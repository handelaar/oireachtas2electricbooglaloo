      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to ensure that adoption orders made by the Adoption Board cannot be declared to be invalid because they were not made by a court. If the Bill is passed it will be put to the people in a referendum.  I am sure that I am expressing the view of the entire House when I say that it is my sincere hope that the people will approve of the proposal and I have every confidence that they will do so.</P>
      <P>This is a straightforward measure which will, I hope, receive general approval. I think that technically it is a better provision than the similar one in the Private Members' Bill which was defeated in the Dáil on 25 October. Before I go on to deal with the Government's reasons for not accepting some other proposals that have been made, I propose to indicate briefly for the record why a Bill to amend the Constitution on the lines of the present one is thought to be necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1976 the Supreme Court declared that a particular adoption order was invalid. They did so on the basis that there <Col N="399" /> had been defects in the processing of the case and they did not proceed to consider whether there was any basic defect in the Adoption Acts from the constitutional standpoint by reason of the fact that they provide that adoption orders are to be made by a body which is not a court.  May I say in passing that the court order did not award custody of the child to its natural parents but left the question of custody to be determined separately.  The processing defects that were found by the Supreme Court to exist drew attention, in turn, to procedural difficulties which the Acts themselves gave rise to but those difficulties were dealt with by a number of provisions of the Adoption Act, 1976.  However, the opinion in legal circles ever since the Supreme Court judgment has been that had the court to deal with the constitutional position, they might have considered themselves obliged to find that, in making adoption orders, the Adoption Board were purporting to exercise powers that the Constitution reserves to the courts.</P>
    <P>I am advised and believe that a strong argument could be made in defence of the constitutionality of the present position, but equally I accept the weight of the opinion I have referred to and I am conscious that there is a great deal of unease among adoptive parents and others in regard to the present position.</P>
    <P>The effect of a finding that the Adoption Board in making adoption orders have been purporting to exercise powers they do not possess would be nothing short of disastrous.  Unless the court were to avoid by some means giving their decision a retrospective effect, it would mean that each of the 26,000 or so orders that have been made by the board over the last 25 years since formal adoption began would be invalid or, at best, would be declared to be invalid at the request of any interested party.  The consequences of a single order being declared to be invalid can be traumatic for the parties involved.  The consequences of a great number of orders being upset would be frightful.  One must remember that an adoption, unlike an order for custody, for example, involves <Col N="400" /> a fundamental and permanent change in the relationship between the adopted person and his natural and adoptive parents.</P>
    <P>It is, of course, possible that, on hearing the matter argued before them by counsel, the Supreme Court would find that the Adoption Board's position was in accordance with the Constitution.  The risk that they would not is, however, in the Government's opinion, great enough to justify this Bill.  The Bill is expressed to be retrospective in its effect, the intention being that past as well as future orders will be protected by the amendment. It is wide enough in its scope to permit of an adoption system involving an agency other than the Adoption Board to be the authority in adoption matters if the Oireachtas should think fit in the future to make such a change, though as far as the Government are concerned no such change is, in fact, envisaged.</P>
    <P>I now turn to what is not in the Bill.  I know that arguments have been adduced by a number of people who, in one way or another, have interested themselves in the field of adoption, that provision should be made to permit the adoption of certain categories of legitimate children.</P>
    <P>Sections 2 and 3 of and parts of the Schedule to a Private Members' Bill that was introduced in the Dáil were clearly intended to enable legislation permitting such adoptions to be passed.  The proposition may appear to be both humane and unexceptionable.  I am afraid, however, that a fuller analysis will show that the change proposed could and almost certainly would have effects far beyond what many, even of those advocating the change, might consider reasonable.  There is no possible way of devising a system which would not lead to the possibility of parents giving their children for adoption even if they were perfectly capable of rearing them themselves.  No criteria of neglect or abandonment could eliminate collusion between natural and adoptive parents.  I do not think that many of the advocates of change in the adoption law would wish to see adoptions on this basis become possible.  Moreover, even if <Col N="401" /> the adoption of legitimate children could be confined to abandoned or seriously neglected children, serious problems relating to the consent of the natural parents would arise.  Here I must stress the uniqueness of adoption: it is permanent and irreversible; no change in the behaviour or circumstances of the parties can affect it.</P>
    <P>We must remember that, with a relatively minor exception which was introduced in 1974, the adoption procedure is based on the free consent of the parties, including that of the child's mother in the case of an illegitimate child.  Supposing that a parent of a child, who for one reason or another is not able or is not willing to rear the child in a manner that some of us might consider appropriate, refused to give his or her consent to its adoption, is the consent to be dispensed with at the behest of some third party, even if that party is a welfare agency?  A great number of people would, I have no doubt, be very disturbed to think that they might be at risk of losing their children because somebody else felt that the children would be better off adopted.  It seems to me that, while we should certainly see what can be done to strengthen and extend our services for deprived children, we should not look on adoption as the panacea for all the problems.  Its very finality makes it inappropriate even in a number of cases of the kind that tend to be mentioned in support of it.</P>
    <P>A particular type of case has been the subject of representations.  That is the case where a child is born to a married woman who claims that her husband is not the father.  It has been suggested that the presumption in law that a child born to a married woman is her husband's is too difficult to refute and that in consequence many children in this category cannot be given in adoption.  Some people have contended that the position of these children is an argument for a change in the law that would permit the adoption of legitimate children.</P>
    <P>I think that it is necessary in these cases to analyse carefully what the real difficulty is.  The possibility of adoption undoubtedly could arise in such cases where the husband either does not want <Col N="402" /> to have the child in his home or does not know of the child's existence, and it is where he does not know that the difficulty is most likely to arise.  Permitting the adoption of legitimate children would not in fact solve this difficulty.  Even if the law allowed the adoption of legitimate children, it obviously would have to provide for parental consent and that would include the consent of the father, and there would of course be a presumption that the mother's husband was the father.  There would therefore be precisely the same difficulty as at present about by-passing the mother's husband.</P>
    <P>It may be that there could and should be new procedures to reduce the difficulty of showing that such a child is not the child of its mother's husband, but it is important to realise that what is involved is not the barrier to the adoption of legitimate children&mdash;for the child in question is not legitimate&mdash;but a method for the establishment of a fact, namely the fact that the mother's husband is not the child's father.  That fact would have to be established no matter whether the adoption of legitimate children was permitted or not, and it would have to be established by a means or a procedure that would be acceptable in the light of all the circumstances, including the inherent importance of what is at issue.  A presumption that the child of a married woman is also her husband's is quite clearly one that operates in the interests of the overwhelming majority of children.  The consequences of a system whereby a mother could declare her child to be illegitimate, and in practice make the child illegitimate in the eyes of the law, by a statement to that effect could be very serious and far-reaching, even if a sworn statement were required.</P>
    <P>In this area, as in others in the adoption field, there is a risk of people being swayed by the consideration of what are undoubtedly very hard cases into making laws which could be very bad for the general body of persons who might be affected by it.  As I have said there may be room, consistent with protecting the rights and interests of the overwhelming majority of children, to make some change in the present position, but it <Col N="403" /> would need very careful consideration and, for the reasons I have given, it is not relevant to the present Bill.</P>
    <P>The next topic which I propose to deal with is the suggestion by some of those who have spoken on adoption matters that it is desirable that the Constitution should contain a provision making it mandatory on courts and, in appropriate cases, the Adoption Board, when considering a case involving a child to regard the welfare of the child as the first and paramount consideration.</P>
    <P>I believe that it would be wrong and highly dangerous for such a provision to be written into the Constitution.  At present the phrase is to be found in section 3 of the Guardianship of Infants Act, 1964 and in section 2 of the Adoption Act, 1974.  It has been suggested that those provisions are not in accordance with the Constitution and that, accordingly, the Constitution should be amended to make them constitutional.  I do not consider that section 3 of the 1964 Act is in any danger of being held to be in conflict with the Constitution, unless it is first of all given an interpretation significantly different from that which it was undoubtedly intended to have when enacted in 1964.  If it were to be given such an interpretation, it would matter little whether it was declared unconstitutional or not, as I have no serious doubt that, having been given a meaning so different from what was intended, it would have to be changed by legislation if it were not declared unconstitutional.</P>
    <P>I went into this topic at considerable length in my Second Stage speech in the Dáil and I do not propose to weary Senators by covering the ground again here.  I assume that Senators who have a special interest will have read that speech in any event.</P>
    <P>Section 2 of the Adoption Act, 1974, is not a provision about which I am happy. The case for such a provision was being strongly urged by some in the very early days after the 1976 Supreme Court decision when it was assumed&mdash;wrongly&mdash;that the court had not only quashed the adoption order but had awarded custody of the child to its <Col N="404" /> natural parents, thereby in the eyes of some people failing to have sufficient regard to the child's interests.  If in the context of legal adoption the provision were to be construed by our courts as the English courts appear to have construed the similar one in the context of guardianship, I would be very concerned indeed.</P>
    <P>Another suggestion that has been urged on me is that provision should be made in the proposed constitutional amendment for the abolition of the concept of illegitimacy.  Such a change would mean among other things that a child would have the same inheritance rights to his parents' property, irrespective of whether they were married to each other or not.  My approach to this matter is that I do not rule out the possibility of some changes in the law to accord new rights to illegitimate children.  I believe we should await the results of the studies proposed to be carried out in this area by the Law Reform Commission before taking any decisions.  What I am opposed to is any change in the Constitution which would be liable to undermine the legal status at present guaranteed to the family based on marriage. In taking this view, I believe that I am reflecting the attitude not just of a majority but of the overwhelming majority of the public.</P>
    <P>To sum up, I am convinced that it is necessary to amend the Constitution in the manner proposed by this Bill and, on the other hand, I believe that the need for further changes of the kind I have mentioned has not been demonstrated. On the contrary, I believe that the case against some of them is compelling. Some critics of the Bill say that they recognise that the problems I have referred to are serious ones but suggest that a constructive and imaginative approach would find a way round them so as, for example, to put illegitimate children on an equal footing with legitimate children and to permit the adoption of legitimate children who are neglected or abandoned. I am afraid, however, that the difficulties are not ones that can be got round.  The element of certainty and security which the current law affords to the vast majority of persons concerned <Col N="405" /> could be seriously threatened by some changes intended to benefit small minorities of cases but which would have repercussions in other cases that would not be advocated by anybody.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidMolony" hpid="Mr. Molony Mr. Molony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to compliment the Minister and his Government on the confidence they have that this Bill will go through the House without difficulty. I understand the Taoiseach has already given the date on which the referendum planned under this Bill will take place.  I know a lot of people in the past have complained that the Seanad is not regarded as of sufficient importance by the Government, but we now have come to the stage of absolute ridicule of the House when the Government will announce the date they plan to hold a referendum when the Bill enabling such a referendum has not even been passed by the Seanad, indeed has not even been put to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is over two years since the Surpreme Court in a judgment made reference to the difficulties involved in this area.  It is nearly two years since the joint opinion of two very eminent senior members of the Bar expressed their views as to the constitutionality of adoption orders made since the Adoption Board was founded 25 years ago.  When that news was published by the media at the time the feelings amongst thousands of people involved were, in one extreme, the feelings of near hysteria and, on the other extreme, certainly a feeling of a quite cold fear.  In all cases there was a feeling of incredible disbelief that our Constitution, particularly the provisions of the Constitution relating to the family which were certainly drafted with the best intentions of social well-being and social good in mind, could be turned around, as it were, and viciously threaten to break up the relationships that had come about in families throughout the length and breadth of Ireland because of adoption orders made.  As the Minister has said, the Supreme Court never actually decided that the adoption order in that case or in any other case was unconstitutional for the reasons now being brought forward by this Bill.  They expressed the view at <Col N="406" /> the time that if they had to consider it they were concerned that they might have to find that the adoption orders and the Adoption Act itself were unconstitutional because the Adoption Board were exercising functions which under the Constitution were properly the preserve of the courts and of the judicial system.</P>
    <P>I do not think it is entirely relevant at this stage whether the Adoption Act and the adoption orders were constitutional or not.  The position really is that once the Supreme Court gave that warning over two years ago they were saying to the Government and the Legislature it was time to get their house in order.  The real pity is that it has taken two years to bring about this simple amendment which is contained in this Bill today.  It is a pity that people had to suffer great fear immediately after the announcements were made and everybody who knows people who had an adopted child, no matter how well educated or how understanding they were on the law or the Constitution, knows how worried and concerned they were about it.  It is to be regretted that it took so long to alleviate the worry and the inevitable fear those people had.</P>
    <P>Having said that, I support the Bill in so far as it goes.  I regret that two years have been lost which could, perhaps have been devoted to a greater study and review of all our adoption laws and the question of legitimacy.  I regret that the Law Reform Commission were not asked to do this two years ago and were not given the resources to do it within a reasonable time; and two years would have been a reasonable time to carry out a major review of our adoption and legitimacy laws generally.  The point has been made by many people that a constitutional referendum is unusual; it is expensive and difficult.  It is likely that we will have to wait a long time before we have another one, unless an immediate necessity arises.  We can only presume that the Government have decided that this is the absolute extent of the reform they are going to allow in this area, that their policies do not allow for any further review.  After taking two years to come up with such a simple <Col N="407" /> reform, presumably they have given the matter the fullest consideration and have decided, not just as a matter of legal difficulty but as a matter of social policy, that they do not propose to go further. That is a pity; it is an opportunity lost.  If in the course of the next two or three years we should decide, and I hope we do, that our adoption laws need greater review, then our Constitution will most likely require to be amended further.  I regret that we will have to go to the expense of doing that twice.  If we have a change at all, this Bill will not provide for it.</P>
    <P>There are many problems in this field. The basic problem of legitimacy or illegitimacy as a status requires urgent examination. I know that over the past couple of decades the social stigmas that attached to illegitimacy have disappeared to an extent.  People accept more readily now a one-parent family, that a mother having had a child, the father never having married the woman and not living with her, raises the child herself.  I know there are some women who are proud to do that.  I know we all hold the family as sacrosanct and as the basic unit of our society.  I know many people if they have a child and are not married are proud to raise that child.  It says something of our development as a nation and a community that we are more tolerant in that respect.</P>
    <P>To say at this time that we should now remove all differences that illegitimacy <i>vis-a-vis</i> legitimacy brings about would be a dangerous thing.  I say so for particular reasons.  The main areas we are concerned about are succession, property rights and so on.  In regard to succession, there are undoubtedly examples where it would be quite just that an illegitimate child should share equally with a legitimate child.  There are also instances in which it would be manifestly unjust that an illegitimate child should partake of the parents' estate equally with the legitimate offspring of the family.  I can think of examples where a man may have fathered a child and subsequently married and raised a family of three or four children; 20 years later on an intestacy <Col N="408" /> the four or five children who lived with him and had been involved in the home and maybe in his old age helped him along, have to meet with somebody who is a complete stranger to them and to the family, who was never associated with them, and who would say because of the change we might bring about that he should share equally in the estate of the father.  I do not think that would be entirely fair.</P>
    <P>We may reach the stage where as a community we would decide that it is fair.  I certainly do not think it would be right, or a just law.  For that reason I would not propose that there should be such a change, constitutional or other, that would bring that situation about.  I feel, however, that it is a matter which should be under constant review.  I know it is a matter that will be going before the Law Reform Commission and I look forward to the report of the commission on this subject.  Whilst the Law Reform Commission have published very interesting papers there seems to be a need to judge with a greater sense of priority what they should deal with.  I do not want to mention some of the reports they have published, except to say that they have all been excellent documents for people interested in law reform.  I believe that the Law Reform Commission as a matter of social policy should be asked to deal with areas like adoption and legitimacy and areas where legal difficulties are being encountered in bringing about changes in the law.  They should give such areas greater priority. If they have difficulty because of the absence of resources in dealing with them reasonably quickly, then their resources should be improved.</P>
    <P>I was interested that Deputy John Kelly spoke on the question of amending the Constitution.  He specifically mentioned that judgments which the Minister mentioned in his speech were not available in printed form.  These are judgments that are two or three years' old.  Long before I became a Member of this House it was a source of great annoyance to me that even the laws passed by these Houses were not available in printed form.  It is a national disgrace that any young solicitor or anybody who <Col N="409" /> is interested in the law who wants to acquire a set of the Acts of the Oireachtas is told by the Government Publications Office that the laws of the land are out of print.  It is something that should be looked at and certainly, as Deputy John Kelly mentioned, judgments like this in printed form should be available.  It is just not possible for somebody who wants to consider this Bill, for example, to consider also the court's attitude.  The Supreme Court has a very important role in areas of law like this.  It cannot be done if one does not know what its opinion is.  The Minister is responsible for this area as Minister for Justice and it is something for him to look into.</P>
    <P>We all know the disadvantages of being illegitimate.  One of the outstanding disadvantages of being illegitimate is that a legitimate child who is not an orphan is not entitled to be adopted.  I know that this has been a bone of contention for some time.  I see no reason why the law should not be changed so as to allow for the adoption of legitimate children.  I know that the Minister has considered this and has decided against it.  That is his right.  I know and accept his reason that it would present difficulties in drafting and preparing legislation and having suitable and proper legislation.  By amending the Constitution suitably at this stage, he is not allowing for the adoption of legitimate children.  What he is allowing for is that the Oireachtas in the future, or the Government, might in their wisdom conceive of some way whereby legitimate children could be adopted and suitable legislation could be produced.  The problem at the moment is that because of the nature of the Constitution and because of specific provisions within the Constitution, we just cannot provide for the adoption of legitimate children and that is a mistake we are making. Another opportunity is being lost and I regret this very much indeed.</P>
    <P>The Minister has rightly drawn the attention of the House to the importance of realising what we speak of when we speak of adoption.  A good definition of adoption is taken from a paper read by Father John O'Mahony, Secretary of St. Anne's Adoption Society in Cork and <Col N="410" /> published in the <i>Children's First Newsletter</i> of spring 1977.  He says simply that adoption is best defined as the provision of permanent substitute family care for familyless children.  He rightly goes on to say that it is distinguished from all other forms of child care by the fact that the natural parents' rights <i>vis-a-vis</i> the child are severed.  The legal relationship that exists between a natural parent and child is severed by the making of an adoption order.  I can see many reasons why we should be loath to do away with that relationship, when a legitimate child's parents are alive.  However, I think that there are circumstances that give good grounds for changing one's view on that.</P>
    <P>Father O'Mahony in the same paper goes on to refer to this under the heading &ldquo;The Need for Adoption&rdquo;.  I would like to read the paragraph to the House.  It reads:</P>
    <P>It is very important for those working in adoption agencies to realise that a child's right to family life should first and foremost be met by his own natural parents.  Therefore, it is the first duty of a society to do all it can to ensure that parents have the support they need to meet the rights and the needs of their children.  We have, therefore, a first duty to help people to rear their own children, and adoption should only be resorted to when there is no reasonable likelihood of natural parents.  Even with reasonable support, being able to provide an adequate form of family life for their children.  That last sentence requires very careful consideration&mdash;there are a number of key words in it&mdash;these are: reasonable livelihood, reasonable support and an adequate form of family life.  Where it is fairly clear that, even with normal help, a parent is not going to succeed in being an adequate parent, there is no obligation to turn the world upside down to help that parent and child to stay together. On the contrary, research shows that the interest of the child is best served by separation from the natural parent in that type of situation.  We should be very careful that prejudice or cultural attitudes do not cause us, as social <Col N="411" /> workers, to give importance to the natural link in itself where there is clear evidence of the inadequacy of the quality of parenting being offered to the child.</P>
    <P>That paragraph sets out very well the case that is to be made for allowing for the adoption of legitimate children.  I know that the Minister has considered it and has decided against it.</P>
    <P>This Bill will amend the Constitution. The amendments proposed to the Minister in the Lower House and those that I urge him to make do not allow immediately for the adoption of legitimate children but would allow the Oireachtas and the Government in future to decide, having given proper consideration to the matter, to introduce legislation to allow for it.  That is what is important.  We will not be making a decision here today nor will people next July be making the decision.  The decision will be made by the Legislature in the future following full consideration of all aspects involved.  I am prepared to wager that in the next decade, constitutional amendment or not, that legislation will come.  It is something that will become more and more contentious in the future.  Ultimately, under pressure, the Government will have to give in to it.</P>
    <P>The problems involved are very great. I was interested in the amendment that was introduced by Deputy O'Keeffe in the Lower House and which was ruled out of order on procedural grounds.  The Minister gave reasons to the Deputy at that time on Committee Stage of the Bill as to why, even if the amendment was in order, he would not accept it.  I am inclined to agree with him.  The amendment proposed would have been too broad and would, possibly, have allowed for a Government with not the best social intentions in mind to introduce legislation that would not be in itself worth while or good.  It has now become clear that the family articles in our Constitution are such as are causing too much difficulty in this area and are too restrictive on legislators and on the courts alike.  They appear to be a little bit contradictory. <Col N="412" /> Article 41.1.1º, the basic Article which includes the two difficult words that cause all the problems states:</P>
    <P>The State recognises the Family as the natural primary and fundamental unit group of Society, and as a moral institution possessing inalienable and imprescriptible rights, antecedent and superior to all positive law.</P>
    <P>The words &ldquo;inalienable&rdquo; and &ldquo;imprescriptible&rdquo; are the difficulties which any court would have in dealing with the rights of natural parents to a child regardless of what interest they have in their child's welfare themselves.  Article 42.5 states:</P>
    <P>In exceptional cases, where the parents for physical or moral reasons fail in their duty towards their children, the State as guardian of the common good, by appropriate means shall endeavour to supply the place of the parents, but always with due regard for the natural and imprescriptible rights of the child.</P>
    <P>The State is not living up to its duties under Article 42.5 because there are many children who are legitimate who have been abandoned by their parents, who are not orphaned and have no reasonable prospect of ever being accepted back by their parents or if they were accepted back, of being looked after properly.  The truth is that in circumstances like that the State has a duty to move in.  The State does move in where parents misconduct themselves or ignore their responsibilities to a serious extent: the children are taken from them and are put into care.  The legitimate child is discriminated against there.</P>
    <P>If one goes into an orphanage and sees a legitimate child in care and another child which is not in care but which is illegitimate and one knows that one can foster either of them or can adopt just one of them, any one interested in bringing a child into the family will want to adopt.  Such people will not want to bring somebody into their home who, after creating a relationship with them over a number of years, might be taken from them again.  The constitutional provisions that allow that are discriminatory and should be looked at. <Col N="413" /> I do not know how we will get around this, presuming that the Cathaoirleach takes the same view as the Ceann Comhairle in the Dáil that the amendment proposed by Deputy O'Keeffe should not be brought in again on Committee Stage in the Seanad.  However, there are other ways of going about it. The Minister told Deputy O'Keeffe in the Dáil that he would review this matter again and see whether he could do anything.  He has brought in the Bill as it left the Dáil.  He has not suggested any amendments that he might make on Committee Stage and he has not specifically said whether, having reviewed the position again, he has changed his mind.  I am sure there is room for manoeuvre.  Perhaps by the deletion of the &ldquo;inalienable and imprescriptible rights&rdquo; from that Article, even though it is something that none of us would like to do because we regard the family in such a sacrosanct way, we would not, in the eyes of the courts, bring about any positive change in their attitude to the family but we would enable them to look more mercifully at legislation designed for the adoption of legitimate or illegitimate children. Everybody, I suppose, will refer to the fact that 1979 is the year of the child and it is appropriate to consider these matters at this time.  I hope that the Minister and his experts in the Department may come up with some solution to this very difficult problem between now and Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>I am rather surprised not to find any Senator from the other side of the House offering at this stage.  I am also sorry that the Minister thought he might weary Senators by going into detail on the subject.  On the contrary, we are particularly interested in the background and in the terms of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Like Senator Molony, I feel this is a very disappointing Bill, particularly in this year of the child.  It is a very narrow Bill and one which fails to solve the basic constitutional problem in the McLoughlin case.  It is a Bill that stemmed from the McLoughlin case, to which the Minister referred in his speech, and arose out of the ensuing enormous public controversy and worry to adoptive <Col N="414" /> parents.  It has failed to solve the major problem in the McLoughlin case. Although the issue of the powers of the Adoption Board was raised in argument, it was not dealt with in the judgments of the Supreme Court in the McLoughlin case.  It may have been a shadow in the background.  It has been a shadow in the background of adoption ever since the establishment of the Adoption Board because of the provisions of Article 37 of the Constitution.  The major problem in the McLoughlin case was a problem of conflict between fundamental rights of adults and the rights of a child.  This Bill does resolve that issue.  I deeply regret to say that we could still have another kind of McLoughlin case.  This Bill&mdash;an amendment to the Constitution&mdash;unless it is amended by the Minister in this House, will not close the gap.  That is the most serious and damaging criticism of this Bill that can be made.  The Minister is inviting the people to come out and support in a referendum a Bill which fails to close the particular constitutional issue raised in the McLoughlin case.</P>
    <P>The special problem in the McLoughlin case and in similar cases is that the parties, the natural mother and the natural father of the child, married and then they sought to have the adoption order set aside.  Although in the decision of the Supreme Court the adoption order was struck down on procedural grounds&mdash;the mother was not sufficiently informed of her rights and did not give a full and free consent in the circumstances and the Supreme Court was critical of the procedure at that time&mdash;the basic issue is the potential clash between the inalienable and imprescriptible rights of the parents and the welfare and best interests of a child.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to the judgment of Mr. Justice O'Higgins, the Chief Justice, on this issue.  In considering the submissions put forward by counsel on behalf of the Adoption Board that it would be harsh and unjust to uproot a child from the adoptive parents on the grounds that the natural parents had married and now had the full, inalienable and imprescriptible fundamental rights under the Constitution, the Chief Justice said in response:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="415" /> It has been argued by counsel for the Board</P>
    <P>meaning the Adoption Board,</P>
    <P>that in this case the Plaintiffs' failure to take action earlier than they did, with the consequent effect on the child in relation to his surroundings, renders it unjust and contrary to the child's interests to remove him now from the care of his adopting parents. No one can be unmoved by such a plea or feel anything but compassion for all those involved in this human drama.  In coming to a just conclusion, however, one must not allow compassion to confuse or permit sympathy to conceal fundamental rights.</P>
    <P>That is the major issue which surfaced in the McLoughlin case and the problem is that it can surface again.  I should like to give the Minister one or two examples of situations where and adoption order could be challenged on constitutional grounds, even if we pass this Bill as it now stands and even if we appear to be, as the Minister said, closing the gap in the McLoughlin case.  It is not closing the gap that I have referred to of reconciling conflicting constitutional rights&mdash;the constitutional rights of parents in a married situation to the inalienable and imprescriptible rights of such parents.</P>
    <P>For example, if, after the passage of this Bill and its adoption in a referendum, a matter comes&mdash;as it does quite frequently&mdash;to the Adoption Board to determine on the legitimacy or illegitimacy of a child, a child born to a woman who is married but she makes the case to the Adoption Board that the father of the child is not her husband, the Adoption Board make a determination that the child is illegitimate and, therefore, eligible for adoption&mdash;then the child is placed for adoption and adoptive parents apply to get an adoption order. An adoption order is made and it subsequently transpires that that woman was lying, that she had her reasons for defrauding, and there is evidence that the child is legitimate.  That adoption order can be set aside on constitutional grounds; it can be attacked on the <Col N="416" /> grounds of the inalienable and imprescriptible rights of the parents and that this is a legitimate child not eligible for adoption.</P>
    <P>Similarly, if a natural mother places a child in adoption and then marries the natural father and if there is any defect &mdash;and there are a number of reasons why there might be a defect&mdash;in the adoption procedure it would be sufficient to take the case outside the safeguards of the 1976 Act.  For example, one ground that is giving cause for increasing worry in adoption procedure is where a couple apply to adopt a child and they are married but may not be married for the purposes of the civil law.  There may have been a Catholic Church annulment and a re-marriage or a divorce which our courts may not recognise.  Although the couple concerned may consider themselves to be married and may apply as a married couple, if they are not married that would be a sufficient defect to take the case outside the safeguards of the 1976 Act.  It would still leave the situation that there could be a successful challenge of the adoption order years later because of the fundamental, inalienable and imprescriptible rights of the parents once they became married parents.</P>
    <P>This was the major issue in the McLoughlin case.  There was the long shadow of the doubt about the Adoption Board.  This was one of the grounds in the Labour Party's Bill, a different way of ensuring the constitutionality of the Adoption Board.  It is desirable and necessary to ensure the constitutional security of the Adoption Board in making adoption orders and having them made.  But if the Minister is trying to say that he is closing the gap raised by the McLoughlin case, he is not.  This was not mentioned in the judgments in the McLoughlin case.  It was not the ground in the McLoughlin case.  The Minister, in this Bill, has omitted to consider the ground in that case.</P>
    <P>This Bill can be criticised, first, for not achieving the purpose the Minister says it will achieve and, secondly, it can be criticised on a broader plane as a minimalist and very poor attempt by the Government to address themselves to a <Col N="417" /> very complex and important area relating to the welfare of children and parents.  I am one of those interested Senators to whom the Minister referred. I was struck, in his long detailed speech in the Dáil, by the number of petty and niggling reasons put forward for not doing something rather than attempting to argue the possibility of grasping some of the major problems in this area.  I shall go through some of the arguments raised by the Minister.  They are very moth-eaten and insubstantial arguments to place against the importance of securing, first, a constitutional balance which sufficiently safeguards the rights of a child and prevents the Constitution from being, as it is at the moment, too adult and parent-centred and, secondly, for ensuring rights to different categories of children.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party's Bill to amend the Constitution was much more appropriate for the International Year of the Child and was making positive steps to introduce genuine reform in this area. Apart from dealing with the constitutionality of the Adoption Board and ensuring that the adoption orders were secure, it was also dealing with two categories of children who might be regarded as being discriminated against in this area.  The first category is the illegitimate child&mdash;I shall refer in some detail to the question of the rights of illegitimate children&mdash;and the other is legitimate children who have been abandoned from birth or so ill-treated by their parents that they cannot be left in their custody.  They are legally ineligible to be adopted.  We condemn them to grow up in institutions or in the much less secure system of fosterage. Fosterage can be a good second best if it works well but it is prone to all kinds of difficulties and insecurities.  It is not anything like the full family which a child ought to be entitled to under our Constitution and laws.</P>
    <P>The problems in this area are major problems many of which stem from legal grounds, either from the Constitution or from our laws.  For the Minister to come in in this minimalist way in the International Year of the Child shows that neither he nor, apparently, the Department of Justice are sufficiently <Col N="418" /> aware of the very substantial hardship and misery caused in this area and of the acute problems that are arising.</P>
    <P>I should like to deal with one problem which may not be sufficiently realised by the public.  It arose from a case that the Minister referred to several times and quoted from in the Dáil.  It is called the G. case.  It was one of those triangular cases where the natural mother had placed the child for adoption and then, not having signed any final consent, and finding herself in a position to support and bring up the child herself, asked to have the child back.  The adoptive parents wished to resist handing the child back and the matter ultimately came before the Supreme Court.  The issue arose and had to be examined by five judges of the Supreme Court&mdash;and all five gave judgments&mdash;as to whether or not an unmarried mother has a constitutional right to the custody of her child.  That is a very important issue and yet the Supreme Court could not agree on it.  That is why, in referring to little quotations from the G. case, the Minister totally ignored that there is a very basic problem: under our Constitution because of certain wording in it, judges of the Supreme Court cannot agree on whether an unmarried mother has a constitutional right to the custody of her child or not.  I refer, first of all, to the judgment of Mr. Justice Kenny where he says:</P>
    <P>While the Constitution deals with the rights of parents of legitimate children and &ldquo;the natural and imprescriptible rights&rdquo; of the child, it says nothing about the custody of legitimate or illegitimate children.  As Article 42 acknowledges that the Family is the primary and natural educator of the child and guarantees to respect the inalienable right and duty of parents to provide, according to their means, for the religious and moral, intellectual, physical and social education of their children, it inferentially gives those who have married and are living together a constitutional right to the custody of their children.  But it does not do this for the mother of an illegitimate child for she cannot claim the benefit of Articles 41 <Col N="419" /> and 42 and, in my opinion, is not given a constitutional right of custody by Article 40.3.</P>
    <P>Article 40.3 relates to the personal rights of the citizen.  Mr. Justice Kenny went on to say:</P>
    <P>It seems to me that there is an equation in the passage of &ldquo;natural rights&rdquo; and &ldquo;constitutional rights&rdquo;.  I do not accept that there is such a connection particularly as the word &ldquo;natural&rdquo; is so ambiguous.  It may mean, when used in connection with the relationship of mother and child, the link between them formed by the facts that she has conceived the child, that is issues from her body and is fostered and nurtured by her or it may mean that the theory of natural law on which so much of that part of the Constitution dealing with Fundamental Rights is based, recognises such a right.</P>
    <P>In my opinion the mother of an illegitimate child has a statutory right under the Guardianship of Infants Act, 1946, to the custody of her child but has not a constitutional one.</P>
    <P>That is one judge of the Supreme Court faced with the provisions of the Constitution trying to reconcile the position and expressing the view that she does not have a constitutional right to the custody of her child but only has a legislative right.  Mr. Justice Henchy dealing with this&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister referred to his speech in the Dáil and said he would not weary the Seanad.  He implied that those of us who were interested would have read his speech in which he raised all those issues.  This is a very important issue and I hope that the Minister will allow me to refer to the Labour Party's Bill and to develop the whole question as to the kind of Bill we should have.  I do not intend to take up too much of the time of the House but it is a major issue and I would like to put forward the kind of problems that we <Col N="420" /> have and the sort of Bill we should expect particularly as it will involve the people in a referendum, which is a very complex and expensive procedure.</P>
      <P>Mr. Justice Henchy referred to the issue of the rights of the natural mother and said:</P>
      <P>Rights and duties in regard to the custody of a child who was born out of wedlock and who is not a member of a family in the constitutional sense of the word are not encompassed, expressly or impliedly, by any of the constitutional provisions I have cited. Rights and duties arising under those provisions are by the terms of their constitutional recognition confined to children of a family founded on marriage, and they are vested not in one or other parent but in the <i>parents.</i></P>
      <P>Again, Mr. Justice Henchy concluded that the natural mother in a relationship with her child or indeed the natural father and the natural mother in their relationship with their children, have no constitutional right to the custody of their children.  We should pause there and think.  We are not only talking about the normal situation of a natural mother with her child with no sign of the natural father but we are also talking about very stable relationships where, for legal reasons, there is not a marriage in the sense of the civil law.  We are talking about a case, for example, where one or other party had a Catholic Church annulment and the parties remarried in the Catholic Church.  They have children. They have no constitutional rights to those children according to those two judges of the Supreme Court.  They only have a legislative right under the Guardianship of Infants Act.  This would seem to be a major problem arising out of the wording of the Constitution and a problem which should concern us very much as legislators.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I quoted two judges from the Supreme Court who expressed in their judgments the view that the natural mother has only a legislative right and not a constitutional right.  Happily the other three judges of the Supreme Court and, therefore, a present majority of the Supreme Court, went the other way and <Col N="421" /> decided that the natural mother does have a constitutional right to her child.  I refer very briefly to the judgment of Mr. Justice O'Higgins, the Chief Justice, and he said:</P>
    <P>In the first place it should be noted that the mother is not the mother of a family in the sense in which the term is used in the Constitution.  Article 41 of the Constitution which recognises the family as the natural, primary and fundamental unit group of society and as a moral institution possessing inalienable and imprescriptible rights antecedent and superior to all positive law, refers exclusively to the family founded and based on the institution of marriage.  It is this family which under Article 41.2 the State guarantees to protect in its Constitution and authority as the necessary basis of social order and as indispensable to the welfare of the Nation and the State.  But the Plaintiff is a mother and as such she has rights which derive from the fact of motherhood and from nature itself.  These rights are among her personal rights as a human being which the State is bound under Article 40.3.1º of the Constitution to respect and to defend and vindicate.</P>
    <P>The Chief Justice found that the natural mother has constitutional rights as part of her personal rights under Article 40.3 of the Constitution.</P>
    <P>Mr. Justice Walsh, who was a member of the Supreme Court for this case, affirmed the constitutional right of an unmarried mother.  He stated:</P>
    <P>The mother and her illegitimate child are human beings and each has the fundamental rights of every human being and the fundamental rights which spring from their relationship to each other.  These are natural rights.  It has already been decided by this Court in Nicolaou's case that among the mother's natural rights is the right to the custody and care of her child.  Rights also have their corresponding obligations or duties.  The fact that a child is born out of lawful wedlock is a natural fact. Such a child is just as entitled to be supported and reared by its parent or <Col N="422" /> parents who are the ones responsible for its birth, as a child born in lawful wedlock.  One of the duties of a parent or parents, be they married or not, is to provide as best the parent or parents can the welfare of the child and to ward off dangers to the health of the child.</P>
    <P>On what might be thought to be a very basic issue the provisions of the Constitution create enormous difficulties, so much so that the Supreme Court have divided three to two on rights of citizens of this country, such as unmarried mothers or parents in a situation which would not be recognised by the State as being a valid marriage, where one of the parties has been divorced, and divorce is not recognised here, or where there has been a Catholic Church annulment and remarriage have a constitutional right or not.  The number of people in that situation is growing year by year.  There are a rapidly increasing number of Catholic Church annulments and remarriages by one or other party and families who would be most surprised if they were told that they do not have protection under our law and Constitution.  The wording of the Constitution in relation to rights is a basic issue for us as legislators to consider.</P>
    <P>I am very disappointed that the Minister seems to disregard the need for or the desirability of looking at the provisions of the Constitution dealing with these kinds of rights.  The Minister resists the increasing call for the extension of the right to, and the facility of, adoption to legitimate children.  The Minister repeated what he said in the Dáil that this might give rise to a problem of parents trying either to give away or sell their children.  This seems to be an extraordinary argument to put forward.  First of all, it is common practice in most other jurisdictions for legitimate children to be eligible for adoption.  It does not seem to give rise to a queue of people trying to sell their children.  It is not even the case with the unmarried mother.  The pattern at the moment is that an increasing number of unmarried mothers, despite the social prejudice, the economic disadvantage, the problems of lack of support and the <Col N="423" /> social stigma involved are trying to keep their children.  More unmarried mothers are keeping their children and bringing them up themselves now than was the case in 1952 or even in the sixties under the operation of the procedures.  The Minister's argument is very hard to understand.</P>
    <P>We know&mdash;and this was referred to in the Lower House by Deputy O'Keeffe &mdash;that there is the small problem, and it should not be exaggerated, of children who may be born to married parents.  It may be the case where the child, although born to married parents, is illegitimate, that the husband is not the father of it, or there may be other circumstances. Some of these children are sent to Northern Ireland so that they can be adopted there, so that they can have the facility of adoption as legitimate children.  That is one kind of problem. Far more important than that is the number of young children who spend their early lives in institutional care.  We cannot estimate the effect on a young child, on a baby in the first year of its life of being in institutional care, not having the advantage of that first valuable eight or nine months of forming the personal bond of a child living in family circumstances. We are only beginning to understand that the impact of the first two years of a child's life may have an effect that can never be redressed, or the child may be forever somebody who lacked the opportunity of being a normal, happy well-rounded person.  We should use every effort to try to ensure that any child has the right to grow up in a family, that any child has the right to be eligible for adoption if the circumstances of the child are such that the child cannot stay with its parents.  We know of a numbers of instances where married parents have totally disclaimed their responsibilities as parents, where young children have been beaten and maltreated by parents or just abandoned, and the problem of the unwanted child and the child being transferred to an institution, perhaps transferred immediately as a baby or in very young years and then having only the option of short-term or even longer term fosterage <Col N="424" /> but nothing like the security and the legal rights which strengthen the family links of adoption.  Therefore, it is deeply disappointing that the Minister refused to accept the amendment which was contained in the Labour Party's Bill to amend the Constitution and has produced no similar amendment here.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to the Bill tabled in the Dáil by the Labour Party, in particular to the sections of it which delete words from the Constitution which give rise to the kind of problems which the Supreme Court was trying to cope with in the G case that I have just referred to. This would be to remove from Article 4.1.1º the words &ldquo;inalienable and imprescriptible&rdquo;. The effect of that would not be to undermine the family, to in some way cause enormous hardship; the effect of it would be that, where parents had abandoned their rights or so abused their rights that they should not have any other right, the welfare and interest of the child could be considered and the child could be given an opportunity of life with another family but would not be condemned forever by the fluke of the kind of parents the child had and the fact that those parents would not assume any responsibility.  We cannot rest easy on the fact that the child's parentage can affect that child for the rest of its life and it can never escape from the situation, even if it is totally abandoned and there is ample proof that the parents would not assume their responsibility.  The amendment proposed in the Labour Party's Bill of removing the word &ldquo;inalienable&rdquo; in Article 42 is a follow-up of that.  In any case, the words &ldquo;inalienable and imprescriptible&rdquo; cause great difficulties.  It is very difficult, even for the Supreme Court with judges sworn to uphold the Constitution, to ascertain precisely what is meant.  After all, the rights are not inalienable and imprescriptible when the child becomes an adult.  Clearly, adults leave the home and that is the end of it.  They form new relationships themselves.  They may or may not marry, have children, whatever the circumstances may be.  So they are inalienable and imprescriptible during their childhood but what is inalienable and imprescriptible?</P>
    <P>We now have two kinds of constitutional <Col N="425" /> rights.  We have the constitutional right, identified by a majority of the Supreme Court, of the natural mother to the custody of her child, but it is not an inalienable imprescriptible right.  It is a right that she can alienate. This raises the question of what exactly are their inalienable and imprescriptible constitutional rights when the fact of them being inalienable causes such hardship and such suffering to young children growing up in the State and condemns them to institutional care or condemns them to the much less secure position of fosterage.  This is a major area where the Minister and his advisers should have been actively considering how to introduce a balanced referendum on this issue.</P>
    <P>The other major area is the question of the rights of the illegitimate child.  I recall that in this House there have been a number of debates.  In particular, there was a debate on this whole question of giving rights to an illegitimate child. Senators on both sides of the House, in response to a Private Members' Bill that I had tabled with some other Senators, made it clear then that they were in support of a change so that the discrimination against illegitimate children could be removed.  The Minister makes a halfhearted attempt to meet that area.  He gives a watery indication that he may look into it.  One has to read his indications with great care because over a year ago he was in this House telling us that he would introduce civil legal aid without any delay and we have not heard anything more about that.  The indication that he might look into the question of the status of the illegitimate child is much more watery and diluted and very vague indeed.</P>
    <P>Once more, one must examine the interest of the Minister and his advisers in this problem.  Do they really care that children are discriminated against legally by the fact of their parentage?  Do they really care that because of the lack of any facility for terminating a marriage in Ireland the picture is becoming more and more clouded and complicated? Many people who think they are married are not married.  Many people who think their children are legitimate have illegitimate children.  Is it not about time, <Col N="426" /> in particular in the context of a country where you cannot legally terminate a marriage, that we came to terms with the enormous problems posed by the very narrow definition of &ldquo;family&rdquo; in our Constitution and the difficulties that this gives rise to?  The fact that the constitutional definition of &ldquo;family&rdquo; confines it to a family based on marriage may to the lay person sound very appropriate and appear to be something that, as a country, we should totally adopt.  The problem is that by making a constitutional matter and a constitutional standard of what a family is we have all the kinds of problems that I have been outlining: the problem of whether or not the natural mother has rights, the problem that certain people who may think they are married do not have any constitutional rights and are not a family under the Constitution.  I do not believe that the people want this sort of situation to get worse.  We may not have termination of marriage but we do have breakdown of marriage.  The more the problem of breakdown of marriage deepens and gets more complicated because of the Succession Act, the more this becomes a major social issue.</P>
    <P>Perhaps in that context we may see some movement about it because it seems as though there has to be a major lobby and a major area of discrimination before the Government and the Department of Justice are prepared to act on the matter.  It is not enough that there is, and has been down the years, legal and constitutional discrimination against illegitimate children because they have appeared just to be the offspring of unmarried mothers and therefore unfortunate and regrettable but not really a major concern for policy makers.  It is regrettable if we have to wait until the social problems become so convoluted and so strong and irresistible that it becomes a mainstream lobby.  A Government must lead in removing any injustice that exists.  The blatant discrimination against the illegitimate child flies in the face of the equality of the citizens as human persons which is proclaimed in Article 40.1 of the Constitution.</P>
    <P>I am not at all impressed with the Minister's moth-eaten argument that it <Col N="427" /> would somehow undermine the rights of the legitimate wife and legitimate children if one were to give succession rights to an illegitimate child.  The reason I am not impressed by that is that the Minister himself is singularly failing to bring in the kind of legislation which would give the best protection to the married wife and legitimate children in present circumstances.</P>
    <P>If we want to protect the wife within marriage and the children within marriage&mdash;and of course we want to protect them and to ensure that they have security&mdash;then why not introduce legislation dealing with property within marriage?  Why not introduce legislation which provides that during the lifetime the wife has a property interest and share in the property of the husband or marriage and <i>vice versa</i>?  Why do we have to wait until after death?  There is this curious anomaly, curious paradox, that it is not until somebody dies that the spouse gets a legal right to the estate. During the lifetime she will not have any property rights unless she brought in money herself, unless she has invested in the family home or has made a financial contribution.  That is how you meet the real concern and real worry of the wife within marriage and the children of the marriage.  You do not do so by penalising the child born outside wedlock. Similarly, there is the growing social problem that many children who think that they were born within marriage, think that they are legitimate, but are not.  When the time comes for father or mother to die they will realise that they do not have any succession rights. Unless they have been provided for expressly in a will they may very well find themselves without any provision.  This is a major social problem, a major problem relating to the relationships between people.</P>
    <P>It is not as though the issue of adoption and the whole question of family rights could be reduced to the single matter which is dealt with in this Bill. This was the third matter dealt with in the Labour Party's Bill.  Having dealt with the question of removing the phrase relating to inalienable and imprescriptible <Col N="428" /> rights so that legitimate children could benefit from adoption, the Labour measure then proclaimed rights for the child and, in particular, said that there would be no discrimination on the basis of parentage.  The section would have contained a Schedule and would have added new provisions to the Constitution as follows:</P>
    <P>1.  That children shall enjoy special protection by law and other means to enable them to develop physically, mentally, morally and spiritually to their fullest potential and in conditions of freedom and dignity and in the enactment of laws relating to children the welfare of the child shall be the first and paramount consideration.</P>
    <P>2.  Equality of rights under the law shall not be denied to any child on the basis of status at birth or parentage.</P>
    <P>3.  The State acknowledges the family as the social unit best fitted to provide the continuity of care essential to the upbringing of a child. Where, however, the welfare of the child requires it, whether by reason of the death of the parents or by reason of their unwillingness, neglect or inability to discharge their parental duties, the State shall supply the place of the parents by appropriate means which may include the enactment of laws providing for the transfer of parental rights to substitute parents.</P>
    <P>This is the kind of provision in the Constitution which would allow very careful legislation.  I am all for taking into account a number of the matters raised by the Minister, particularly in his longer speech in the Dáil.  There should be evidence of manifest abandonment or neglect by married parents in order to invoke the provisions.  Where there is manifest abandonment or manifest ill-treatment followed by abandonment and no parental link subsisting, and where the child is therefore placed in a home and will grow up in a home, then the Legislature, as in every other country, should be in a position to say that this child can be adopted and can have a substitute family with all the legal security of that.</P>
    <P>I should like to turn to a matter which <Col N="429" /> the Minister dealt with in some detail in the Dáil and which he just touched on in his briefer speech this afternoon.  That is the question of the phrase which is contained here, which is also in the Guardianship of Infants Act and the Adoption Act, 1974, that the welfare of the child should be the first and paramount consideration.  I read with care the arguments the Minister put forward about the problems that can arise and it was a matter that was dealt with in some detail by the Supreme Court in the G. case.  Problems could arise.  The use of the word &ldquo;paramount&rdquo; can potentially give rise to problems.  I am aware that Mr. Justice Walsh has distinguished between the first and paramount consideration and then the other considerations, the second, third, fourth and fifth considerations. Nevertheless, I could see that it might possibly, if it were to be the overriding provision relating to all laws relating to children, which is what is contained here, give rise to difficulties.  That is a point that could well be discussed on Committee Stage of a Bill like this where one would try to examine, first of all, whether it would be better to insert the substitute wording &ldquo;the best interests of the child&rdquo; or whether that provision is necessary at all in the Constitution if you have the affirmation contained in the rest of the section.</P>
    <P>I go some way with the Minister in his argument that there are problems relating to a clause which would give overriding consideration to the welfare of the child in all legislation and in all such circumstances.  However, I do not accept the Minister's confidence that there is no problem under the present situation where the Constitution lacks appropriate balance between parents and children, between the rights of adults and the rights of children, and where there is an imbalance against the rights of the child in the wording of the relevant portion of the Constitution.</P>
    <P>I do not accept the Minister's confidence that there is no issue relating to the statutory provisions referring to the welfare of the child being the first and paramount consideration.  The Minister seemed to think that this was not a problem.  He referred in the Dáil to a <Col N="430" /> number of cases in the longer judgment but he did not refer to a more recent case where this issue again arose in the Supreme Court.  He referred to the case of J. where Mr. Justice Henchy had seen this as a problem, but he did not refer to a judgment of 22 June 1977 delivered by the Supreme Court in the matter of the Guardianship of Infants Act, 1964, J.V.D. and Others.  This was a case where the father wished to recover the custody of the children.  The children were legitimate.  They were children born within marriage and the father was living in England with another woman.  The children were with the grandparents.  The mother was dead and he wished to get custody of them.  In the judgment the very interesting thing is that the Supreme Court went quite a distance, indeed, it is very refreshing to see the possibility of the Supreme Court, despite some of the difficulties in the wording of the Constitution, being able to identify the rights of the child within the Constitution.  This is an example of that.  Mr. Justice Kenny said in his judgment:</P>
    <P>Counsel for the Plaintiff, when asked whether he wished to argue that S. 3 of the Guardianship of Infants Act 1964 was repugnant to the Constitution, said that he did not.</P>
    <P>So it was not an issue here where you have a father with inalienable and imprescriptible rights.  He had to be asked if he wanted to argue that because the Supreme Court are aware that there is a problem there, that if you have a married parent with inalienable and imprescriptible rights challenging an order made under the Guardianship of Infants Act where the first and paramount consideration is the interests of the child, it raises a conflict of constitutional rights and that potentially that section may not stand constitutional challenge.  As I have said, the Minister in his recital of cases did not refer to this case and did not note, as I think one must note, that the Supreme Court felt they had to ask whether the issue was going to be raised because they are well aware that it is an issue on which substantial argument could take place and where potentially section 2 of the Guardianship of Infants Act could be struck down.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="431" /> What I have been attempting to do is to outline some of the major legal issues, some of the major social issues and some of the major problems which are getting worse and worse under the present system because we have increasing incidents of marriage breakdown, we have no termination of marriage, we have discrimination against the illegitimate child under our law and we have a discrimination against the legitimate child under our adoption law in the provision that they are for all time and under statute barred from being eligible for adoption.</P>
    <P>If the Minister tables a Bill to amend the Constitution it should not confine itself to one single issue, an issue which the Minister attributes to the McL. case and which was certainly in the background and in the arguments by counsel but was not part of the judgment and decision of the Supreme Court.  I have nothing against providing for the security of the Adoption Board in making the orders they make and for the adding to Article 37 of what is proposed in this Government measure.  As I have outlined at the beginning, the Minister does not meet the other major constitutional problem which was raised in the McL. case.  He does not give the more than 26,000 adoptive parents the security that he is purporting to give them.  The Minister still leaves them with the fact that if there is a challenge by married parents, if the unmarried mother marries the natural father, or if it was argued that the child placed for adoption was an illegitimate child, that the husband was not the father of the child, or if there are other defects in the procedure such as that the adoptive parents, although considering themselves to be married when they apply to adopt, are not in fact married under our law because one or other of them had an impediment in that he or she was either divorced in a way that would not be recognised or had been party to a Catholic Church annulment, those kinds of defects can still render the status of the adoption uncertain and can allow it to be challenged years afterwards on constitutional grounds.  The 1976 Act <Col N="432" /> did not cover this; the 1976 Act did not change this.  The only way we can change it is by ensuring constitutional security for all adoption orders.</P>
    <P>Like Senator Molony, I am somewhat surprised that the Minister did not refer to the learned opinion submitted by two of the leading senior counsel at the Bar who gave as their opinion that, apart from dealing with the question the Minister deals with here&mdash;the question of the powers of the Adoption Board&mdash;there also should be a time limit within which an adoption order could be challenged.  The Minister should seriously consider this point.  He should examine the possibility of introducing an amendment on Committee Stage which would provide for a time limit within which adoption orders could be challenged. The reason sometimes given for not wanting to have a time limit after which there could be no challenge to an adoption order is that it would be a substantial curtailing of rights in a particular situation, that even if a basic defect arose that the adoption order would remain valid.</P>
    <P>When we are dealing with something as vulnerable and as precious as the welfare of a child it is appropriate that that legislative and constitutional decision be taken.  It is a matter for legislative policy how long the period should be.  It would be legitimate to think in terms of a period of one year or, at the very most, two years after which an adoption order could not be challenged on constitutional or legal grounds because at that stage the interests and the welfare of the child would be very strongly the need to remain within the family which had become the real family for that child.</P>
    <P>The Minister has not given adoption orders the full security that they ought to have; he has met only half the problem that arose in the McLoughlin case and, above all, he has produced the most minimalist Bill on this question of adoption and the constitutionality of adoption orders that it was possible to devise.  He has left out of the picture all the other problems and needs of children which are so important and worthy of attention in this International Year of the Child.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill, which is a very necessary one to allay the worry of many people who have adopted children and who have, in doing so, acted in a very desirable way, in a way which is certainly acting in the spirit of true charity.  It is essential that the Government and the Oireachtas have a duty to ensure that people who have adopted children will not be worried that the adoption order is likely to be invalid because of decisions of the courts or anything of that kind.  Certainly, in such a situation it would not only be a tragedy for the adoptive parents but in many cases also for the child who is adopted.  The Oireachtas will have to go as far as possible to ensure that that kind of situation will not arise in the future. When I say as far as possible, there is a limit to how far we can deal with that situation and make sure that it will not arise.</P>
      <P>The Minister stated that he cannot make the position watertight.  Of course this is so.  It is a very complex situation. No matter what laws are passed or constitutional amendments made there may be still a defect.  There may be something that the Supreme Court will, in due course, decide is not covered by the Constitution or that in some way the order is invalid.  Of course there are, as Senator Robinson has mentioned, a number of cases where, in spite of this amendment, an order could prove to be invalid.  Inevitably that kind of situation is going to arise.</P>
      <P>In the first place we must realise that even if this amendment is passed and even if an order is made which appears to be in impeccable order, something may have been wrong.  There may have been fraud of some kind or the status of the parents, for instance, may be quite different from what was understood to be the position.  In that case the adoption order will have to be set aside.  That kind of situation, no matter what we do, may occur in the future.  There is no way of making the situation watertight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill deals with an Adoption Board and the query has been raised as to whether this Adoption Board have the same power as a court.  One must realise that every court, except the Supreme Court, can make a wrong decision and its <Col N="434" /> orders can be queried, can be set aside, and shown to be invalid.  In these circumstances it would be quite inappropriate that we should have a situation where the orders of the ordinary courts of the land, and of the highest courts, can be set aside and declared invalid, but the orders of the Adoption Board are completely immune from any examination by the courts.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that there should be a time limit and that any adoption order which is not queried within a certain time limit cannot then be interfered with.  It seems to me that that suggestion has very little merit.  If there is a serious defect in that adoption order, if the parents of the child were married, and the child is legitimate, and the parents, for one reason or another, did not realise at the time that they were the legitimate parents, and if one or both of the parents at the end of a certain period make their appearance and say that they want to take back their child who was born when they were married, then I cannot see the force or the equity of a situation in which they could not get back their child in these, perhaps, extreme circumstances, merely because a certain time has elapsed.  Having a time limit is, in my opinion, a very crude way of dealing with the problem.  It is a serious problem which can give rise to a great deal of anguish and suffering. Nevertheless, to apply an official time limit is not the way to deal with the problem, no matter how unfortunate it may be.  That is not the answer to this kind of situation.  I do not think there is any absolute answer to it.  The Acts in existence, and the suggested amendment, now go as far as it is possible to go at present to deal with this situation.  All that one can do, in the circumstances, is to hope that the courts will administer the existing law in the best way possible.</P>
    <P>Senator Robinson mentioned the McLoughlin case.  In stressing what the issue was in the McLoughlin case she was tilting at windmills.  The Minister never stated that this Bill was to try to cure the defect that arose in that case. He made it quite clear that this Bill was designed to cure the long shadow that was thrown in that case.  It was not the <Col N="435" /> particular issue that was argued in that case.  It was a question of whether or not the Adoption Board have a right to make adoption orders.  The Minister, in this Bill, tried to deal with that specific problem and this Bill will deal with the problem if the people vote for acceptance in the proposed referendum.</P>
    <P>Everybody speaking has, as it were, his or her own favourite rights.  Senator Robinson talked about a number of rights which certain people should have, but the more she pressed a particular right, the more she was ignoring other rights. The problem of all who have spoken on this Bill in this House and in the other House, and outside the Houses, is that they had a particular right which they considered the most important one, and they were concerned that it should be established to the exclusion of, or certainly take precedence over, other rights.  The Constitution sets out all kinds of rights&mdash;rights of family, rights of children, rights of parents, rights of citizens.  There are bound to be cases where these rights will come into conflict. It is impossible to pass any law, to pass any amendment of the Constitution which will give a black and white kind of situation where everybody's rights are clearly defined and where there will be no future conflict.  That is an impossible concept; it is not capable of being achieved and it is certainly no wonder that the Minister did not find it possible to introduce a Bill here which would reconcile all these rights and put them in their own little boxes and make sure that there would not be a future conflict.</P>
    <P>In regard to the specific issue that is before us, that is the passing of a Bill which will enable a referendum to be held on this question of the competence of the Adoption Board to make adoption orders, in passing an amendment to the Constitution, it is absolutely essential that it should be on a simple, clear-cut issue which people understand and on which they can vote individually.  If an attempt were made, as apparently some Senators and others would wish&mdash;to introduce an amendment to the Constitution which would define all kinds of different rights, some conflicting, the probability is that the people, the voters, <Col N="436" /> would be so confused and so uncertain as to which were and which were not the most appropriate and desirable rights, that they would end up deciding not to vote for anything.  It is absolutely essential, when you are putting something as sacrosanct and important as an amendment to the Constitution, that it be a simple, clear-cut amendment, and something on which the people can make up their minds one way or the other.  The Minister is quite right in putting forward this amendment, which is a simple one, and one which people will have little trouble understanding, and, for which, I have no doubt, they will vote.  If it were more complicated and tried to do too many things the probability is that the amendment would not be passed at all.</P>
    <P>There have been a number of cases made for other amendments of the adoption laws.  It has been suggested that in certain cases it should be possible to make adoption orders against the wishes of the parents.  I am entirely against such a provision.  It is, of course, true that there are parents who do not look after their children, and it is true that there are parents who behave in the most irresponsible way in regard to their children and it is quite clear that they are not capable of looking after them.  In these circumstances there is a provision for putting the child in custody, which is the proper, or certainly an acceptable way of dealing with that situation.</P>
    <P>Having an amendment which would enable a child of negligent parents to be adopted is going much too far.  It is objectionable because the adoption order is permanent; that is, of course, what we are trying to ensure in this Bill.  It is quite possible that parents who may neglect a child and behave in an irresponsible way may change entirely their attitude in the course of time&mdash;sometimes perhaps in a very short time.  They may become responsible and be more than anxious, willing and competent to look after their child.  It would be most undesirable if, in such a situation, they were faced with the irrevocable situation that their child was adopted and they could not get it back.  Even though there are exceptional cases where it would appear that a child should be adopted in spite of the wishes <Col N="437" /> of the parent, the way to deal with it is to put the child in custody.  Merely because there are occasionally very bad cases of neglect one should not try to make a fundamental change.  Hard cases make bad law.  Certainly it would be very bad law to provide for adoption in such circumstances. On the balance of justice and injustice, I would be very much against a situation where adoption would be allowed against the wishes of the parents.</P>
    <P>The other situation which has been advocated is the case of adoption of a legitimate child.  We have the situation where a legitimate child is described as being discriminated against because he is not capable of being adopted; we have the situation where an illegitimate child is discriminated against in many other ways.  To come back to the question of the legitimate child, again, as in the situation which I have mentioned, of adopting against the wishes of the parent, there are cases where it would appear that allowing adoption of a legitimate child would be, on balance, a very desirable thing.  One can argue both ways, but on balance it is something which should not be done.  It should not be permitted, because, in the long run, it would create just as much injustice as provide justice.  In some cases it might only encourage a situation which would create injustice.</P>
    <P>Although there are views on both sides of this argument, I would come down very much against allowing a legitimate child to be adopted.  The main objection is that it is irrevocable.  If, at a later stage, one or other of the parents wished to take back the child from adoption and had very good arguments for so doing, with an irrevocable adoption the court would be involved, and even if it were not involved, there would be an extremely undesirable situation from the point of view of natural justice.  If the matter were brought before the court, the court would be in the position of facing the proposition, the argument, that this was a legitimate child, whose parents or parent wished to take back the child and were not able to do so. From a public policy point of view and from the points of view I have mentioned, it is undesirable that this should <Col N="438" /> be permitted.  If you were to permit the adoption of legitimate children in such a situation it would be impossible to decide between the cases where it was right to allow this and where it would be wrong to do so.  It would be interfering with the fundamental concept of the family in the Constitution, which concept should not be undermined in any way.  Every possible effort should be made to ensure that it is not undermined. The case can be made for the adoption of legitimate children but, on balance, I would certainly be against it.</P>
    <P>Certain observations and views have been expressed about the rights of the child as compared with the rights of the parent.  Some who have advocated the rights of the child and who have talked about this being of paramount interest have gone too far.  One quotation I have seen suggested that parents have no rights; they have only duties.  It is a refreshing concept, in this day and age, that anybody should suggest that any section of the community, or any individual, has duties only and not rights. Nowadays people seem to be obsessed with their rights and almost totally unconcerned about their duties.</P>
    <P>The right of the child is a very important right which must be protected as far as possible.  Parents have rights also and the objective should be to do justice and to ensure that the rights of both are balanced, as far as that is possible.  It is not always possible to do so completely, and to the satisfaction of everybody concerned.</P>
    <P>When I am talking about rights, I should like to mention one matter of rights, that is, the right of the natural father.  Section 16 of the 1952 Act specifically excludes the right of the natural father.  This section 16 deals with those who may be heard on the application for an adoption order and, curiously enough, he is the one person specifically excluded, not by name but not included in the list of those who may be represented.  It is understandable, perhaps rather old-fashioned, for people to assume that natural fathers never want to be concerned, never are concerned for the future of an illegitimate child and that may be right in most cases.  There was, however, a case some <Col N="439" /> years ago in which the natural father was very anxious to retain his right as father of the child and to marry the mother, but he was not allowed even to appear at the hearing of the adoption order.  On a previous occasion in this House, when an amendment to the Adoption Act was being passed, I pressed the Minister to amend that particular section but I did not succeed in having it amended.  At present, when there is, perhaps, a more liberal view taken of these things and a new approach to rights such as that, this is one section of the Adoption Act which should be amended.</P>
    <P>In general, this Bill is a very good one. It is a simple Bill, and sets out to achieve a simple but very important objective. Although it may not do, and obviously does not do, everything that all concerned with adoption would like to see done, it is important that it should at this stage achieve one important fundamental aim, which is to ensure that the competence and right of the Adoption Board to make adoption orders is clearly cop-perfastened. When that has been done we can move on to other rights and other necessary changes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I certainly agree with Senator Ryan that what is in this Bill is welcome.  I also welcome the provisions which have been designed to allay the anxiety created by the court decision which has been referred to.  I have a great deal of sympathy with the view that, as regards that matter, that is at far as the Bill ought to go, that is to say, with regard to&mdash;to use Senator Ryan's words&mdash;&ldquo;copperfastening&rdquo; past orders of the Adoption Board.  I see great difficulties in attempting to do that any more extensively than has been done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am unhappy about one matter that Senator Ryan dealt with, which is the position of illegitimate children.  I should say as I said not long ago in this House that I am very concerned about the legal position of illegitimate children.  I expressed myself on this matter some years ago and, in my own thinking, changed my view with regard to the law relative to illegitimacy, moving, to use political <Col N="440" /> language, from a more conservative to a less conservative position.  I see the very greatest difficulty arising from an attempt to abolish absolutely, in legal terms, the distinction between legitimate and illegitimate children.  I refer to this point merely in so far as I know that anything I want to do for the status of illegitimate children&mdash;and there is very much I want to do&mdash;can be done within the Constitution.  If I am right in that&mdash;that is my judgment on it&mdash;I leave the position of illegitimate children to one side.</P>
    <P>I am unhappy, however, with what I feel is bad thinking with regard to the position of legitimate children.  Legal advice as recently as 1974 was that it was constitutionally impossible to adopt legitimate children.  The Minister indicated in his very learned speech in Dáil Éireann that this was a view to which he had still to pay great respect.  I note, however, in a recent judgment&mdash;the case has been referred to already a number of times, the G. case, that Mr. Justice Walsh takes a different view with regard to this.  I may add that when I addressed myself, with some passion, to this subject in 1974, I expressed the view that it was constitutionally possible to adopt legitimate children.  What I find disturbing today is to find that, even if it were constitutionally possible to do so, there is apparently an opinion that one should not do so, that, quite apart from constitutional provisions, there would be something legally dangerous in providing for the adoption of legitimate children.  On the constitutional point&mdash;which is my precise criticism, in so far as I criticise this Bill&mdash;this is still a matter of constitutional doubt and the constitutional issue should be cleared out of the way now.</P>
    <P>Opinion has been expressed in this House, in the other House, and in many other places in this land, that there ought not to be in the Constitution a prohibition against the enactment of divorce and that matter should be left to the Oireachtas.  There has not been a great deal of dissent about that, except, of course, that people would be damned if they removed that from the Constitution and it would be seen immediately as the first steps to the enactment of divorce <Col N="441" /> laws.  Once that particular matter is in the Constitution it will not be removed unless its removal is immediately followed by divorce legislation, and if that is the mood of the people, to have it so.</P>
    <P>This is a different matter.  This is a matter where legal thinking, as to what it is desirable to do in relation to adoption and children, has been clouded by some idea that there is a constitutional prohibition.  There are two Articles which have to be referred to.  The first is Article 41 which refers to the inalienable and imprescriptible rights of the family. The other, Article 42, refers to the natural and imprescriptible rights of the child.  Unfortunately I did not have an opportunity to read what the Minister said on Committee Stage in the Dáil.  I do not mind telling the Minister that I had a hand in the amendment that he was looking at, though he eventually found it defective.  I will read all about it. The amendment was an endeavour to reconcile this problem.  It was simply designed to do this: to place no limit on what could be done for the child where there is a failure in duty or where there is a justification for the State to intervene. That is to make clear what is already Mr. Justice Walsh's view as to the meaning of that Article, to write it down so that it is so and, if the Legislature so desires, it can by appropriate laws and subject to the appropriate restrictions and with the appropriate safeguards provide for adoption of legitimate children.</P>
    <P>The position is outrageous in my view that a handicapped father whose wife has died leaving a little child can do nothing about that child and it is in the best interests of that child that the father should now die because if he does not die the child cannot be adopted.  &ldquo;Oh, please let God take Daddy away&rdquo;, are the words the child would utter if it could only mouth what would be in its own interest.  It seems we must stand over that because the Constitution requires that we as legislators should not legislate to provide for that case.  In such a case the orphan is better off than the legitimate child.  I do not say that in the case of legitimate children there should not be a different procedure.  That might be for a different part of the statute.  It <Col N="442" /> may well be that an adoption of that kind should not be done except by the courts.  There are different types of circumstances. There are circumstances where one or both parents want to alienate their rights for the benefit of the child, knowing their own inadequacy and incapacity, knowing that they can broaden the horizons of that child and do better for him.</P>
    <P>It is no use saying, as I think the Minister said, that there is no way of preventing collusion.  The courts are very aware of the possibilities of collusion in these cases and it is a collusion anyhow of a benignant kind resulting in the adoption by a pair who satisfy the court as to their credentials.  Let us not get into a discussion about what the statute ought to be, what the law ought to be when we are dealing with legitimate children.  Let us cure the defect in our public institutions which has meant that Government after Government since 1952 or 1954, when the adoption code was first introduced, have been unable to help people in that category.</P>
    <P>Senator Ryan referred to cases of people repenting subsequently and wanting to come back and take the child and so on.  These are the rare cases and not the cases that should be thought about.  The more usual cases are the cases where, because the child is legitimate, it has to go into an institution. It cannot be adopted because there is one parent alive.  The adoption code does not come to the rescue and it is not available for the courts where they are applying Article 42.5 which provides:</P>
    <P>In exceptional cases, where the parents for physical or moral reasons fail in their duty towards their children, the State as guardian of the common good, by appropriate means shall endeavour to supply the place of the parents, but always with one regard for the natural and imprescriptible rights of the child.</P>
    <P>They can go further in aid of an illegitimate child under that section by providing for adoption than they can in the case of a legitimate child.</P>
    <P>It is not beyond the wit of the Minister's advisers, if there is a will to do it, to make a simple amendment to this <Col N="443" /> Article which simply makes it possible for us to get together to see how we can best solve this great human problem or help in its solution, which is all we can do.  There is not ever a total solution to this kind of problem.  There will always be cases falling down, but we will strengthen the State's arm as guardian of the common good to supply the place of the parents where the parents are failing in their duty or where there is an inability to perform a duty or a deep desire to make things better.</P>
    <P>In the name of the sanctity of the family, is it right to deny entrance to a family to unfortunate children?  Here we are talking about a pair proper to the duty of adopting children, willing to take such a child into their family, to make that child one of that fundamental unit group inspired by the love of the pair who are adopting.  In the name of an Article designed to protect that family as a group, we are saying, &ldquo;No, you cannot take in that child because it has a vestigial claim on it&rdquo;, or because of some theoretical, philosophical reason.  The natural law's face has changed many times and continues to change in the light of realities.  We are failing in our duty in my view unless we recognise this.</P>
    <P>It is no use saying that out of the activities of the court processes eventually this will all be cleared.  It may or it may not.  It takes many years for the courts to decide lots of things.  Meanwhile this problem lies unsolved.  I would ask the Minister to reconsider this.  God knows there are no politics in this.  If there are, I am out of my mind.  He should ask himself if it is not possible to clarify that in the sense in which Mr. Justice Walsh has already held it to be.  Then we will at least clear out of the path the question of the constitutional issue and we can table Private Members' Bills until they go through the ceiling.  Each one can have his own view on that.  Some people may have very different views on this subject, but it should be a matter for the Oireachtas then.  Let us face realities: we are not going to go back to the people with another referendum on this matter, not for years.  That is my only point and I press the Minister with it.</P>

      <P>As up to now the only speakers to this Bill have been lawyers, I feel like a fool rushing in where angels fear to tread.  Be that as it may, I welcome this Bill which will go a long way towards allaying the fears and anxieties of adoptive parents and will do away with the uncertainty and the fear which they have suffered during recent years.</P>
      <P>As the Minister said and as Senator Ryan has emphasised, there is no way to offer an absolutely watertight guarantee that an adoption order cannot be challenged. This Bill goes as far as is necessary to maintain the delicate balance of rights, the rights of the family, the rights of its individual members and the rights of others who are given the protection of the Constitution.  Adoptive parents are entitled to this relief and they are entitled to expect that the adoptive process should be secure from challenge.  They do not want to be and resent being regarded as different and thereby somehow inferior to other categories of parents.  They were slow to organise themselves into an association to seek this relief.  They simply want to be left alone to get on with the job of rearing their families like everybody else.</P>
      <P>The Minister covered in a very detailed way many aspects of the law as it relates to children and to the family. He commented in a way that is very helpful to non-lawyers on the measures which are desirable in these areas of law and the measures which are not.  This is both necessary and welcome because it demonstrates that the legal implications of apparently desirable measures are very different from expected and can often have the opposite effect to what is intended.  The broadness of the Minister's approach in his speech to the Dáil and in his speech this evening has enabled the House to discuss two such apparently desirable measures.  The first is whether it is desirable to abolish the legal concept of illegitimacy and, secondly, whether it is desirable to extend the categories of adoptive children in order to include legitimate children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the first I would ask this question: does this mean that by abolishing the legal concept of illegitimacy we also abolish the concept of <Col N="445" /> legitimacy?  The concept of legitimacy is a very necessary concept and a very desirable one.  Children of a union recognised by the State and given constitutional protection are entitled to their legitimacy and all that implies by way of rights of inheritance, rights to the family name and the right to acknowledge the blood tie.  After all, the State does not impose the stigma of illegitimacy, nor does society: the parents of the illegitimate child do that.  I do not think it desirable that the institutions of marriage and the family should be weakened in any way in order to acknowledge people in an amorphous mass.  When social attitudes change, then legislative change is desirable and necessary to reflect these changes.  After all, the day may come when we will all be very happy to live in a hippy commune with flowers in our hair.  But at the moment, and as of now, the family as defined in the Constitution must remain the fundamental unit of society.</P>
    <P>The present position of legitimate children as being outside the provisions of the adoptive code often gives rise to very tragic situations, particularly because these children in many cases have known what it means to belong to a family, have experienced family life as their natural birthright.  Again, the problem is one of balancing rights within a constitutional framework.  There may be a possibility in future legislation of including legitimate children if, perhaps, they were allowed to revert to their former status at the age of 16 and if their rights of inheritance and all the other rights to which they are entitled because of their legitimacy could be guaranteed or protected in some way.  This type of legislation would be very welcome.</P>
    <P>I should like to point out that a curious anomaly exists at the moment whereby married women are subject to discrimination.  The unmarried mother has rights guaranteed to her as an individual by the Constitution.  She has rights with regard to her child; nobody can take her child from her, nobody can insist that she gives it up for adoption, she has duties towards it, she has obligations, she is obliged to see that it is cared for and educated.  But if at any time she finds herself unable to cope <Col N="446" /> with her responsibilities, if, for example, she wants to get married and her husband does not want to accept the responsibility of another man's child, then she has the right to offer her child for adoption and thereby ensure that it gets a good home.  The married woman in a similar situation, if she is deserted by her husband or if he dies and leaves her with a child to bring up or if she wishes to marry again and if that husband has no wish to bring up somebody else's child, has not the right to offer that child for adoption.</P>
    <P>I would suggest that while acknowledging the special position of the married mother it is regrettable that the State acknowledges the unmarried mother merely as a social problem.  This implies that somehow the bonds of affection that exist between the unmarried mother and her child are somehow inferior to those that exist between a married mother and her child.  This is, of course, nonsense because people who are married have a prior commitment, each to the other, which must come before any subsequent commitment they may acquire as parents and these two commitments are not always compatible.</P>
    <P>There is a section of the adoption code to which I should like to draw attention. Section 14 of the 1952 Act requires that orders made under the Adoption Act have to be published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil.</i>  As far as I am aware, most adoptive parents think, and think wrongly, that the adoptive process is a secret and a private one but it is possible to trace an adopted child right back from the adoptive parents to its natural parents.  I ask whether this is a desirable thing.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill as a careful and well-thought-out solution to a very pressing problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Mrs. Hussey Mrs. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to refer to the announcement last week of the date of this referendum.  I went to the trouble of getting a copy of the statement which was issued by the Government Information services on 1 March.  It announced the date, 5 July, on which this referendum will be held and there was nothing <Col N="447" /> in it at all to say it would depend on whether Seanad Éireann would pass it.  It was just a straight announcement.  I am wondering what is the thinking behind taking the trouble to issue that statement the week before this Bill was to come before the Seanad.  Either the Minister for the Environment, from whose office this was issued, considered that the Seanad would rubber stamp this Bill or else he considered that, if we did not pass it, 90 days would have elapsed anyway so it would go before the people for the referendum.  Either form of thinking strikes me as being an insult to this House.  It is extremely regrettable that such an announcement should have been made a couple of days before this House was to discuss this Bill.  The last time the Seanad rejected a Bill it was also in regard to a referendum and the people went on to reject the referendum proposal.</P>
      <P>I am extremely impressed at the concern of very eminent Senators in this House on the subject of this Bill and the sincerity with which that concern has been expressed.  I am very disappointed at the limited terms of this Bill.  I should like to mention the question of the adoption of the legitimate child.  If family life breaks down for any reason the only choice open to the legitimate child is fosterage or institutional care.  In fact, it is conceivable that the parent or parents of such a child could plead that that child was receiving unequal treatment compared to illegitimate children who have the choice of being received into and made part of a family unit.  Such a choice is not open to the legitimate child. That is the case and it strikes me as something that we should not stand over.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have to face up to the fact that family life for one reason or another very often does break down.  We are now more conscious of the fact that family life breaks down.  I do not know if it is breaking down more than it used to, whether the facade that used to be put up is no longer put up and society knows more about it.  But family life does break down a great deal and there are a great many children who are condemned to <Col N="448" /> extreme insecurity, agony of mind and bad upbringing because of the breakdown of their natural family environment.</P>
    <P>It is not adequate for the Minister or legislators to plead that there are great difficulties which will arise in regard to complications over property, families colluding and so on.  The law makers are here to make laws, to overcome difficulties and complications and it strikes me as being extremely irresponsible for us to say that it is to difficult to go into that area.  Our first duty is to protect people and the individual, and surely children are deserving of the protection of this House more than any other section of the society because they are unable to speak for themselves.  There are a great many cases of simple abandonment of children.  There have been cases of children abandoned and three or four years later the natural mother turning up, finding that the child has survived the abandonment, be it behind a church or somewhere else, and getting that child back because now her circumstances have changed.  The child has had three or four years of some kind of secure life and is now dragged out of that back to a situation which, at best, can only be described as unlikely to be very secure.</P>
    <P>I was very alarmed by the clear indication given by Senators Molony, Robinson and FitzGerald of the confusion which exists in the minds of lawyers going to the judges of the Supreme Court about exactly where the rights of children and parents lie.  That sort of confusion must be broken through and tackled.  This is a responsibility that we have.  In a debate like this one is reminded that this kind of area has, perhaps, been neglected even more because of the lack of women involved in any stage of law making or consultation in this kind of area.  When the Minister talks about referring these questions to the Law Reform Commission, I remind myself that there is no woman on the Law Reform Commission and that there was, in fact, a woman on it who no longer is there.  The Law Reform Commission was set up to a large extent as a result of a great deal of lobbying and pressure and dedicated hard work on the part of many women's groups to draw <Col N="449" /> the attention of society to the gross inadequacies of the law in many social areas.  The fact that we now have a Law Reform Commission which once again reflects the lack of female participation in public life strikes me as being extremely bad.  Once again, I would ask the Minister to consider that question and to consider changing that situation as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>When this Bill was published many people expressed their deep disappointment at the failure it represents to take a major step forward in one area.  I would disagree with Senator Cassidy when she says that social thinking has not changed.  Social thinking has changed enormously and this Bill does nothing at all to catch up with new social thinking based on new information and new expertise. There will be difficulties taking any steps in the areas of social legislation. We know that there are difficult questions which arise in trying to change the law as it affects rape, criminal conversation and the laws relating to domicile.  They all raise difficult, related, legal questions, but we have a legal profession and legislators who are paid very well by the people to try and sort out those problems.  I should like to add my voice to those of other Senators and say that this represents a failure of the Minister to grasp this nettle and I hope that he will reconsider the inadequacy and the narrow terms of reference of this Bill.</P>

      <P>I should like to thank Senators for the welcome which they have given to this Bill.  Some of the Senators gave it a warmer welcome than others and I think only Senator Hussey did not welcome the Bill at all.  I would say to Senator Hussey and Senator Molony that there is no need for their suspicious political minds to run away with them because of the fact that the Minister for the Environment announced the date for the holding of the referendum.  The date is so far away that, even if there were outright opposition to the legislation before this House, one would be reasonably safe in assuming that the time would be sufficient to consider the legislation which is before the House.</P>

      <P>One of the reasons which brought about the announcement by the Minister for the Environment was to ease the minds of those who have adopted children and those who are adopted persons themselves.  Newspapers have been speculating for a long time about the possible date of the referendum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The point raised by Senator Hussey and by Senator Molony is a technical point, indeed one not worthy of the contributions one would expect in this House from its Members.  Let me say that in no way was there meant to be an insult to the Members of this House, or indeed to the only two Members of this House who would like us to believe that it was an insult to the House the way the date of the referendum was announced. That was neved intended.  If I might say to Senator Molony, the begrudging welcome which he gave the Bill did not really do him justice.  One would have expected more from an up-and-coming young Senator but because of the fact that he is not here very long one would excuse him.  However, it is fair to say that a reasonable amount of time has gone by since the case which brought about the legislation which is before us now.  Let the good Senator not forget that his party were in Government for over 12 months of the period during which he says we are waiting for the legislation and this Government for 20 months, so let us not try to score cheap, political, technical points on a matter which, as Senator FitgGerald said later on, should be outside politics.  We managed to get this Bill through the Dáil <Col N="451" /> without any hassle whatsoever and I would have thought that we would have every reason to expect the same sort of treatment here.</P>
    <P>With regard to one or two other matters that were raised by the two Senators I have mentioned, which have nothing whatsoever to do with the Bill, that is the priorities and composition of the Law Reform Commission, if the good Senators take advice from some of their more senior and more experienced colleagues they will understand that appropriate representations should be made to effect what they desire.</P>
    <P>A point was raised by Senator Molony, and referred to in the other House by Deputy John Kelly, on the availability of certain legal documents.  I am not the person responsible for the publication of the Acts that the Senator mentioned.  I share the concern of the Senator and Deputy Kelly and others that every effort should be made to have these documents available.</P>
    <P>I shall comment briefly on one or two of the points raised by Senator Hussey. It is quite obvious that at most she has read the Bill.  That is probably as much as would appear from her contribution. The vague generalities made by her and the confusion evident in her contribution clearly shows that she has not studied the Bill, clearly shows that she has not even read the records of the discussion which took place in the other House.  I do not think it is right that I should be accused of being irresponsible for bringing this Bill before the House, for what is in the Bill.  Certainly it is not good enough with the back of one's hand to dismiss, as Senator Hussey seems to dismiss, what is in the Bill as not being adequate. I should not be so irresponsible as to plead legal complications and so on as my reasons for not having in the Bill matters to which she referred.  I have dealt at very great length with what is in the Bill and given a very long commentary on my reasons for not having in it matters which people believe should be in the Bill.  There is no question of irresponsibility whatsoever and if irresponsibility is to be laid at anyone's door, well, I will let this House decide for itself.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="452" /> I reject the allegations in Senator Hussey's comments that our Judiciary are confused.  That is a sweeping statement that should not have been made and should be withdrawn at the first opportunity. I can only quote from my notes as naturally I have not got the official record of this House, but members of the Judiciary right up to the Supreme Court are accused by Senator Hussey of confusion.</P>
    <P>With regard to the argument advanced by more than one Senator, but especially by Senator Alexis FitzGerald, to the effect that the Constitution should be amended to permit the adoption of legitimate children, I believe that it is possible that the Constitution would permit the adoption of legitimate children and, as Senator FitzGerald did say, Mr. Justice Walsh's judgment in the G. case appears to suggest that it does.  A specific change in the Constitution to make clear that such adoptions are possible would, however, represent an acceptance that there ought to be such legislation.  Do we want to make it possible for the parent or parents of legitimate children who are not under any social stigma to give their children away finally and irrevocably?  In any case the possibility of a change of mind on the part of such parents leading to conflict must be greater than in the case of an adoption of an illegitimate child.  It is not good enough to say on the question of the legitimate child that the law makers should overcome difficulties and just leave it at that.  The simple answer is that they cannot and those who maintain that they can, in particular Senator Hussey, would appear to want some welfare agency to determine when a child should be permanently removed from its parent or parents.</P>
    <P>There is nothing new in what Senator Robinson said.  I stand over what I said here today and what I said at much greater length in the other House a couple of weeks ago.  I recognise here as I did in the other House that there are hard cases but I would not be prepared to put the generality of cases at risk in order to make provision for some hard cases.  On the other hand, I believe the present measure will give absolute security to the overwhelming majority of <Col N="453" /> adoption orders.  I could not see my way to sponsoring a measure that said that, after two years, shall we say, an adoption order should not be capable of being struck down.  I am quite sure that if a court was to consider itself bound to strike down an order, for example, if it had been obtained by fraud as was mentioned by Senator Eoin Ryan, it would consider all the circumstances including the interests of the child.  I know that the legislation which I have here on behalf of the Government will copperfasten the validity of the overwhelming mass of orders.  This is what we set out to do. This is what the Bill is all about.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. D. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to address the Seanad on the Second Stage of this important piece of legislation.  Senators will recall the passage, during 1978, of the two Landlord and Tenant Bills which became law as the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) Act, 1978 and the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) (No. 2) Act, 1978.  The Bill now before the House represents the third and final instalment of a trilogy of measures to give effect to the Government's current proposals in the area of landlord and tenant law.  This will bring about the modernisation and, in considerable measure, the consolidation of the post-1922 landlord and tenant code.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Assuming enactment of this Bill the code will consist of the three Ground Rents Acts, one of 1967 and two of 1978, the Landlord and Tenant (Amendment) Act, 1971, which deals mainly with sporting leases, and the present measure, and will collectively be cited as <Col N="454" /> the Landlord and Tenant Acts, 1967-1979. Perhaps I should explain why the consolidation in a single enactment of this body of legislation is not just now being proposed.  It would have been possible to bring in a Bill that provided for the repeal and re-enactment of all the Acts I have mentioned so that the post-1922 landlord and tenant code would be contained in a single measure.  However, it is desirable that this Bill should reach the Statute Book without avoidable delay because of the urgency of one particular provision which I will deal with later.  The consolidation of all the Landlord and Tenant Acts would have involved a very substantial Bill that would almost certainly have entailed much delay.  Moreover, a single consolidated measure could perhaps be of somewhat limited value in the light of the circumstances that the Landlord and Tenant Commission are still sitting.</P>
    <P>Almost all of the changes proposed in the Bill emerge from recommendations of the commission and they may have further recommendations for changes in these Acts in the not too distant future. This raises the possibility that further legislation may be necessary to bring to a conclusion the work of the commission in this area of the law.  Even then it is to be anticipated that the commission will go on to deal with further items that fall within their terms of reference, that is, Deasy's Act, and may recommend changes in that area also.  At that point the question would arise of having further legislation.  Only then could we envisage the possibility of a full Landlord and Tenant Bill that would provide for the consolidation of all the statute law of landlord and tenant.</P>
    <P>Senators will appreciate that this Bill is, by reason of its subject matter, necessarily one of considerable complexity even though care has been taken to frame the proposals in as straightforward a manner as possible.  It might be useful at this stage, therefore, if I were to outline for the House, in a general way, the purpose of the measure and the background to it.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this Bill is to up-date the Landlord and Tenant Act, 1931 and the Landlord and Tenant (Reversionary Leases) Act, 1958 on the basis of <Col N="455" /> changes that have been recommended by the Landlord and Tenant Commission. Certain provisions of the Rent Restrictions Acts and of the 1963 Planning Act are also involved but only as a matter of consolidation.  The subject matter of the Bill extends to two main areas, that is, the terms and conditions attaching to the renewal of occupational tenancies and to the award to a departing occupational tenant of compensation for improvements he may have made&mdash;this is the area covered by the Act of 1931&mdash;and the renewal of ground rent leases&mdash;this is the area covered by the Act of 1958.</P>
    <P>As to the general background, the Act of 1931 was of course a landmark in the regulation of the relations between landlords and tenants.  The terms &ldquo;landlord&rdquo; and &ldquo;tenant&rdquo; have certain unpleasant historical connotations in Ireland and, indeed, for much of the last century and the earlier part of this century this particular social area was one of bitter acrimony.  Thankfully, this is now a thing of the past and the change was due, in no small measure, to the 1931 Act which it is proposed in this Bill to up-date and amend.  The 1931 Act effectively set the pattern for the statutory regulation of relations between urban landlords and tenants by recognising for the first time the right of an urban tenant to be protected against dispossession on the expiration of his tenancy.  It conferred on such tenants the right to a renewal of their tenancies.  In the context of landlord and tenant legislation such a renewed tenancy is referred to as a &ldquo;new tenancy&rdquo; where an occupational tenancy is concerned.  Where the renewal is the renewal of a ground rent lease the renewed lease is referred to as a &ldquo;reversionary lease&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Prior to the 1931 Act, an urban tenant whose lease expired had no legal right to remain on in the property and the landlord was entitled to recover possession even where the tenant had constructed the buildings himself, that is to say, even where a ground rent lease was involved.  The Landlord and Tenant (Reversionary Leases) Act, 1958 extended the rights of tenants in the type of <Col N="456" /> case where the the tenant had constructed the buildings himself or had otherwise paid for the buildings.</P>
    <P>Before going further, perhaps I should clarify some of the other terms that fall to be used in this discussion.  An &ldquo;occupational tenancy&rdquo;, which may arise by way of a lease or any other form of agreement, is one where the landlord owns the &ldquo;bricks and mortar&rdquo; interest, for example, a tenancy of a business premises or of a shop.  The tenant's interest is related primarily to his occupation of the premises.  The rent charged in such cases is, of course, higher than a ground rent and is commonly called an &ldquo;occupational rent&rdquo;.  The other kinds of tenancies with which this Bill is concerned could be grouped together under the generic description of &ldquo;ground rent tenancies&rdquo;.  The rent charged&mdash;a &ldquo;ground rent&rdquo;&mdash;is lower than an occupational rent and reflects the fact that the &ldquo;bricks and mortar&rdquo; interest in these cases belongs to the tenant.  The 1931 and 1958 Acts identified ground rent leases under the categories of &ldquo;building lease&rdquo; and &ldquo;proprietary lease&rdquo;.  A &ldquo;building lease&rdquo; in its simplest form is a lease under which the landlord leases the tenant a plot of land with a covenant in the lease that the tenant will build a house on the land.</P>
    <P>A &ldquo;proprietary lease&rdquo; is a sub-lease under a building lease.  The Act of 1958 had already identified so many different categories of &ldquo;building lease&rdquo; that these categories had become somewhat unwieldy even before a number of new kinds of &ldquo;building lease&rdquo; were identified by the Landlord and Tenant Commission. The 1978 No. 2 Ground Rents Act has already extended the right to purchase the fee simple to the lessees under all such leases, and has done so under a much simplified classification.  This gives the opportunity, which is taken in this Bill, of simplifying also the law relating to the grant of a reversionary lease&mdash;that is, a renewed building or proprietary lease&mdash;as at present contained in the Acts of 1958 and 1971, and of getting rid of the expressions &ldquo;building lease&rdquo; and &ldquo;proprietary lease&rdquo; which have out-lived their usefulness.</P>
    <P>I now turn to the main changes in the law which are being proposed in this Bill <Col N="457" /> and which, as I have indicated, stem for the most part from recommendations of the Landlord and Tenant Commission. Senators will readily appreciate that this is very much a Committee Stage Bill and will, I am sure, excuse me if I do not go into great detail in regard to the various proposals on this Stage of the Bill.  This Bill runs to no less than 82 sections. They deal with a great number of separate issues&mdash;many of them of a technical detailed nature.  I would, perhaps, be trespassing on the time of the House if I were to attempt to describe the Bill section by section, or even to deal with each Part in any considerable detail.  I will, of course, be only too willing to elaborate on any particular points which Senators may raise.</P>
    <P>I will deal first with the proposed changes in the law in Parts I, II and IV of the Bill which are of concern to occupational tenants, that is, those who do not own the &ldquo;bricks and mortar&rdquo;.  The right to a new tenancy is being given to business&mdash;or part-business&mdash;tenants of three years' standing in all cases, regardless of the term for which the existing tenancy was granted and this right will apply even where there has been an unplanned temporary break in business use during the three years if the court considers it reasonable to disregard that break.  At present, business tenants who hold on less than a yearly tenancy, or than a lease for at least one year, must show not only three years' continuous business use immediately prior to the termination of their existing tenancies but also continuous occupation during the seven years preceding that termination, in order to have the right to a new tenancy.  Moreover, the provisions of the law as it stands make no allowance for any break in business use during the qualifying period.</P>
    <P>The other type of occupational tenant is, of course, the tenant of living accommodation, and a further change proposed in the Bill is that an occupational tenant is being given the right to a new tenancy of a dwelling after 20 years' continuous occupation by himself or by his predecessors in title.  At present there must be 30 years' continuous accupation without any sale of the tenant's interest during that period.  In addition, <Col N="458" /> provisions are being included to ensure that a tenant will not inadvertently lose the right to a new tenancy through failure to claim that new tenancy within the time-limits provided: the onus will be on the landlord to give notice of the termination of the previous tenancy and the tenant's right to claim a new tenancy will survive until after that notice has been given.</P>
    <P>I should now like to refer to what is perhaps the most important single area of change that is proposed in the Bill, that is, in relation to the terms on which a new tenancy will be granted where those terms fall to be fixed by the court in the absence of agreement between the parties.  At present, where the court fixes the terms of a new tenancy, that tenancy is normally for a 21-year term; under the Bill it will be for 35 years unless the tenant opts for a shorter term.  In addition, the rent on renewal will, under the Bill, be subject to review at the instance of either the landlord or the tenant at intervals of five years instead of remaining unaltered throughout the term of the new tenancy.  The Landlord and Tenant Commission recommended the introduction of rent reviews at seven-year intervals to cater for the inflationary situation and the longer terms now proposed. Reviews at intervals of five years or even less are, however, much more usual in tenancies currently negotiated between tenants and landlords and, hence, reviews at intervals of five years are proposed in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Senators who are familiar with this field will be aware that the present state of the law in this area is satisfactory neither to landlord nor to tenant.  The decision of the Supreme Court given in 1977 in the case of <i>Byrne v. Loftus</i> means, in effect, that while the tenant can obtain the grant of a new tenancy for a 21-year term at a fixed rent, that rent may nevertheless be very high at the time it is fixed.  It is higher, and it may be very much higher, than it would be under a tenancy that provided for reviews of the rent at regular intervals and, accordingly, that fixed rent may represent a real burden on the tenant.  The need for a change here is an important reason for pressing ahead with this Bill in the form in which it is before the House, that is, <Col N="459" /> without proposing in this Bill the consolidation of all the Landlord and Tenant Acts.</P>
    <P>A further change that is proposed relates to the time when a new tenancy may be obtained.  Under the 1931 Act the right to a new tenancy can arise only in or about the time of termination of the previous tenancy.  It is now proposed that a new tenancy may be claimed and granted as soon as the necessary conditions are satisfied, although the new tenancy is not to commence until the existing tenancy has terminated.  This should have important benefits in terms of security of tenure.</P>
    <P>Other proposals, in Part IV of the Bill, concern changes in the law relating to the procedure to be followed where a tenant wishes to carry out improvements and where he is to qualify for compensation for those improvements in the event that he is leaving when his tenancy terminates. At present an occupational tenant is not entitled to such compensation where he has failed to serve an improvement notice on his landlord.  The Bill proposes that compensation be allowed even where that notice has not been served, provided certain conditions are satisfied, of which the one I may mention is a condition that the landlord has not been prejudiced by non-service.  It is also proposed that a tenant should be empowered to carry out improvements, even where the landlord objects, except where the landlord is due to recover possession of the premises within the following five years.</P>
    <P>Changes of a more or less technical nature that are proposed in Part I of the Bill will extend the right to a new occupational tenancy to Government Departments, charities, sporting or cultural organisations and to business tenants of housing authorities, and will make it clear that that right extends also to local authorities as tenants.</P>
    <P>Part IV of the Bill includes&mdash;in section 60&mdash;a proposal for a new kind of provision in the public interest, in the wider sense, rather than in relief of tenants. This is a proposal to enable a landlord, subject to certain rather stringent conditions, to terminate an occupational <Col N="460" /> tenancy so as to regain possession, before the lease expires, of buildings that are obsolete or are in an obsolete area.  The Landlord and Tenant Commission in their first report describe the situation which sometimes arises when a sitting tenant will not give up possession except for exorbitant compensation or cannot be induced to move at all.  In this way he can hold up redevelopment or reconstruction schemes for whole areas.  The Bill proposes to allow the court to make an order terminating a tenancy in a case like this.  It also provides very stringent safeguards for the tenant.  First of all, it must be reasonable to make the order terminating the tenancy.  In addition, the relevant tenancy must have not less than three years and not more than 25 years to run.  Compensation must be paid for loss of the tenancy and for any further hardship to the tenant.  The tenant is to be paid a share of the financial benefit that accrues to the landlord from obtaining possession of the property.  At least six months' notice of termination must be given to the tenant and every termination order would be subject to a stay of one year.  In every case the landlord will be required to have a development scheme that includes the property and for which planning permission has been granted and either the buildings themselves must be obsolete or they must be in an obsolete area as defined in the 1963 Planning Act.</P>
    <P>I have been dealing with the changes in relation to occupational tenancies that are proposed in Parts I, II and IV of the Bill.  I should now like to deal with the changes in Part III.  Part III of the Bill concerns reversionary leases, that is, the area of the law at present covered in the main by the Landlord and Tenant (Reversionary Leases) Act, 1958.  The proposals in Part III of the Bill involve two main changes in this area of the law. The right to a reversionary lease is being extended to all classes of ground rent lessees who have the right to purchase the fee simple under the 1978 No. 2 Ground Rents Act.  This includes not only the classes of lessees who have that right under the Acts of 1958 and 1971 but also the additional classes of lessees who are given the right to purchase the fee simple <Col N="461" /> by the Ground Rents Acts of 1967 and 1978.  It is true that the creation of future ground rent leases on dwellinghouses is, in effect, prohibited by what I may call the No. 1 Ground Rents Act of 1978 and it might be considered by some to be inconsistent with the general purpose of that legislation to enable ground rent tenants to renew their expiring ground rent leases, be they either the newly-recognised classes of ground rent lessees or be they those ground rent lessees who already have that right under the Act of 1958.  However, if ground rent lessees have not the right to a reversionary lease they are effectually in the position of being forced to buy out their ground rents and their freedom of action is taken away from them.  It was never the intention that ground rent legislation should manoeuvre tenants into the position of being forced to exercise their rights of purchase.  Moreover, it would be both invidious and unfair to seek to remove the right to a reversionary lease from those classes of lessees who under the Acts of 1958 and 1971 already have that right. In consequence, the Bill proposes the preservation and the extension in scope of the right to a reversionary lease in the manner I have described.</P>
    <P>The second main change is one on which I have already touched, namely, that the expressions &ldquo;building lease&rdquo; and &ldquo;proprietary lease&rdquo; are being dropped from the law and are being replaced in Part III of the Bill by reference to the simplified classes of ground rent lessees that are set out in the 1978 (No. 2) Ground Rents Act.</P>
    <P>Certain other changes are proposed in relation to the grant of a reversionary lease, of which the following may be mentioned.  The rent to be reserved by the reversionary lease will be determined with due allowance for any improvements that may have been made by the lessee.  Furthermore, the refusal of a reversionary lease by a landlord on the grounds that he has rebuilding or development plans will not be upheld by the court unless the landlord has obtained planning permission for the work&mdash;this parallels a similar change that is proposed where the refusal of a renewed occupational tenancy is in question. Finally, an applicant for a reversionary <Col N="462" /> lease is no longer being required either to obtain the consent of any under lessees who also have the right to a reversionary lease or to exclude from his application the lands comprised in any such under leases.</P>
    <P>Part V of the Bill re-enacts with drafting changes the provisions in Part VI of the Landlord and Tenant Act, 1931, which provide certain reliefs for tenants against covenants in leases of tenements.  The expression &ldquo;tenement&rdquo; is defined in section 5 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Part VI includes, in section 69, a provision that may be regarded as completing the work of the No. 2 Ground Rents Act of 1978 by giving to ground rent tenants of the State the right to buy out the fee simple of their dwellinghouses under the purchase scheme provided by that Act, subject only to the public interest. The same right is also being given to ground rent tenants who hold under leases given by a harbour authority or by the Commissioners of Irish Lights and who have not that right under the law as it stands.  Ground rents on dwellinghouses held from the State or from the other bodies I have mentioned did present a difficulty at the time last year's ground rents legislation was in progress, and the Minister for Justice expressed his intention at that time of finding an acceptable solution.  When I myself last spoke in this House on the question I promised the House that the matter would be considered in connection with the Bill that is now before it.  What the Bill proposes is that ground rent tenants who hold their dwellinghouses from the State, or from one of the other bodies I have mentioned, shall have the right to buy out the fee simple except where the State authority concerned are satisfied that acquisition of the fee simple by the ground rent tenant would not in a particular case be in the public interest, and where the State authority certifies accordingly.</P>
    <P>One other change that I should mention is that, while the Landlord and Tenant Act of 1931 is being repealed in full, section 60 of that Act is not being re-enacted.  Section 60 of the 1931 Act provides for the grant of long leases of building ground in urban areas in certain circumstances.  The section is highly <Col N="463" /> complicated and the terms of any lease that might be granted under its provisions are uncertain.  Moreover, its provisions do nothing to protect the security of tenants and they are something of an oddity in the landlord and tenant code. In fact, section 60 has never been operated and its non-re-enactment will remove an unused provision from the law.</P>
    <P>The foregoing are the main changes that the Bill proposes.  A number of lesser changes are also proposed and it will be appropriate to deal with these as they arise on Committee Stage.  As I have mentioned, most of the changes stem from recommendations of the Landlord and Tenant Commission and I would be remiss if I did not here pay tribute to the painstaking work of the members of the commission.  In particular, I should like to record a special tribute to Mr. Justice Conroy, chairman of the commission, for his diligent work as chairman of a series of commissions dealing with landlord and tenant law.  The commission are, as I indicated earlier, still engaged in an examination of certain aspects of the post-1922 landlord and tenant code and following that they will, I expect, go on to review both the non-statutory and statutory provisions of landlord and tenant law which pre-date the foundation of the State.  I look forward to a successful conclusion to the commission's work with the prospect in due course of a major Bill which will propose a comprehensive, modern code of landlord and tenant law.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidMolony" hpid="Mr. Molony Mr. Molony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, should like to pay tribute to the work of the Landlord and Tenant Commission under the chairmanship of Mr. Justice Conroy. Anybody who has to study landlord and tenant law finds out very quickly that it is a most complex and difficult area. Because of developments in business life and in ordinary social life it becomes necessary from time to time to amend our laws or to bring in new legislation and, as a result, we now have quite a number of Landlord and Tenant Acts. When one wants to consider a Bill of this <Col N="464" /> nature it is a difficult task to go through all the Acts.</P>
      <P>In so far as the Bill is a consolidating measure&mdash;and it only consolidates two existing Acts&mdash;I welcome it.  Any move to consolidate in this area is a good one. But for the dedication of the members of the Landlord and Tenant Commission the preparation of legislation of this nature would not be possible.  When the Minister complimented the commission I was mildly surprised that he did not pay some tribute to the previous Minister for Justice who, of course, was responsible for drafting the measure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister. What we have here is the guts, if I may use that word, of the 1977 Landlord and Tenant Bill that died with the Coalition Government.  It has a new appearance now, a Fianna Fáil flavour, so to speak, because we have removed from it the ground rent legislation that was brought in separately last year.  We also have one very minor change that I notice, that is, the provision for five-yearly rent reviews, whereas the 1977 Landlord and Tenant Bill provided for seven-yearly rent reviews.  I realise that that has been necessary because of inflation.  Other than that there has not been any major change in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. D. Andrews Mr. D. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>We foresee no difficulties then about the passage of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidMolony" hpid="Mr. Molony Mr. Molony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>I will deal with that as we go on.  I noticed in the Minister's speech a slight change in stance on Fianna Fáil's election promise to abolish ground rents.  He said, &ldquo;It was never the intention that ground rents legislation should manoeuvre tenants into the position of being forced to exercise their rights of purchase&rdquo;.  If I remember correctly&mdash;and it may not be fair of me to mention this to the Minister because Deputy Brian Lenihan, the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry, was present during the debate on the No. 2 Bill&mdash;the intention was to abolish ground rents. Moreover, it was felt that by providing <Col N="465" /> the machinery about 500 applications a week would be processed and dealt with by the authorities and that after two years there would be no more ground rents left in the country.  I should be grateful if the Minister would let us know how many applications have been dealt with under that legislation so that we can judge the success of the Government's intention to abolish ground rents.</P>
      <P>I would agree with the Minister that this is a complex Bill, that it is basically a Bill to be dealt with on Committee Stage.  I do hope that we will be allowed sufficient time to consider it because it would require about half-a-dozen readings before one would begin to get the feel of it let alone understand the legal ramifications of every section in it.</P>
      <P>Those people who have read the report on occupational tenancies published by the Landlord and Tenant Commission will see that the changes in the law are basically those recommended by that commission.  They are very welcome changes in that they not only bring laws together but also update laws that have been out of date for some years.</P>
      <P>The most important proposals in this Bill are those relating to what are generally known as business leases and what are known in this context as occupational tenancies.  For some time the courts have had difficulty in setting new rents for the occupational leases.  In this respect the Bill is very welcome indeed.  I know of many people who have found it very difficult to adjust to a rent fixed by the court.  The rent fixed by the court was more than the current market rent at the time but the court had to add to the market rent a premium to compensate the landlord for his lack of opportunity to have another rent review for 21 years.  I welcome that very much.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I notice with interest that the Minister said that this was the reason the Bill was introduced at this stage.  I would draw his attention to the fact that this proposal was in the Bill published by the previous Government and could easily have been introduced in either of the Landlord and Tenant Bills that passed through his House last year.  It would not have met with any opposition from us.  However, it is as well that the <Col N="466" /> previous Bill has been left more or less as it was.  The changes in it can only be dealt with on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the provision to relax the qualifying conditions for a new tenancy.  In the past many landlords let properties to tenants for two years and nine months.  Before giving a new lease they had their premises vacated for a while and tried all sorts of gimmicks in order to leave their premises free. Landlords should decide whether or not to use their properties as investments.  If a tenant is to have a fair crack of the whip that decision must be made.  The temptation has been there for solicitors and barristers to try to find ways around the problem.  That is what they are paid for and they would not be discharging their responsibilities if they did not try to do that.  I welcome the relaxation of the conditions because it will make the law more sensible.</P>
    <P>Another provision which I welcome is the proposal to extend new business leases from 21 years to a maximum of 35 years in the event of the landlord not wanting it longer, or of the parties not agreeing to having it longer.  It provides better security for the tenant who might want to borrow money on the strength of his title.  It also allows five-yearly rent reviews for landlords, which keeps them happy.  It is also sensible that the court, if the parties agree, can grant a longer lease.  It is a practical way of looking at the law.</P>
    <P>Another sensible provision in the Bill provides for the court to make an order, on the granting of a new tenancy, that the tenant should carry out repairs to the building, specifying the time within which repairs are to be carried out.  That is a sensible provision and it up-dates the law where it badly needs up-dating. Perhaps the best provision of all is the right given to the court to insert conditions in a new tenancy that it deems appropriate where the parties cannot agree. Obviously, if the parties can agree there is no problem.  Where the parties cannot agree the court would now have, presumably on application by one of the parties, the right to insert conditions in a new lease.  If one has a long lease, a 21 year lease, and one applies to the court for a new lease under the provisions of <Col N="467" /> this Bill, the conditions of the neighbourhood and the conditions of the landlord's adjoining premises may have changed substantially.  It is only reasonable that the landlord or the tenant should be able to ask the court to impose conditions and, if the court considers them appropriate, to insert them, despite the absence of agreement between landlord and tenant.</P>
    <P>There is not a great deal one can say about reversionary leases.  I look forward to studying them in greater depth.  I welcome the abolition of the expressions &ldquo;building lessee&rdquo; and &ldquo;proprietary lessee&rdquo;.  I think that is sensible, although the categories will remain. It is sensible to include all tenants who have the right to buy out their ground rents under section 2 of the 1978 Act.</P>
    <P>In general, I give the Bill a warm welcome.  I ask for plenty of time to consider it.  If it were possible, I should like Committee Stage to be broken up over a few weeks so that we could take it bit by bit.  I imagine that by the time we are finished with this Bill we will all be fed up with landlord and tenant law for a while.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Molony took the words out of my mouth, which suggests that he was cogging my notes, because I intended to open with the suggestion that the way to deal with this Bill might be to agree to take Committee Stage in stages, if possible, to get a division of it.  I do not think it is all that formidable.  There are some debatable items but once we clear these, we shall probably spend a good deal of time looking at the text, because this is really what we are trying to do here. Perhaps we could take away reversionary leases as a separate theme.  My thinking is that it is a separate theme from a right to a new tenancy.  I annex again in my mind the compensation part to the new tenancy provisions rather than to the other.  Perhaps we will not be able to do that and will have to plough along in the usual way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is splendid that we have such ample opportunity to disagree on everything as we are all accusing each other of having <Col N="468" /> drafted the document, which means that there cannot be any possible discredit to anyone accepting a proposal from the other side, assuming that the other side is going to contribute to the debate. Their numbers, if they become voluble on this matter, would be very useful. There is a lot of work to do on this.  I have not done the exercise of seeing whether this Bill is like the other one.  I am not concerned with that.  When the history of life comes to be written all that will be established.  I am looking at what I think are important changes.  I did mark off on the explanatory memorandum, which is a great deal easier to read than the Bill, what seemed to be the most important things.</P>
    <P>There are one or two things worthy of consideration.  Section 4 lifts the burden of tenant rights from the State authority. If it has been changed since the 1931 Act I could not find it.  It did not seem to be in the 1931 Act and I do not remember having come across it in practice, so I presume it to be new law.  It does raise a big question of principle for us to consider.  It is odd enough to find that in a Bill which, at the same time, confers on business tenants the right to get new tenancies in the case of housing authorities having leased these premises to them, which they did not have under the previous code.  Is somebody somewhere taking an easy way out for the State in regard to this?</P>
    <P>The theory behind the whole 1931 Act was to prevent tenants being screwed by having tied themselves up in a particular premises and attached their work and activity to these premises so that their work could be used as an exploitative element by the landlord to get something more from the tenant.  Initially, the tenant would pay a rack rent for what he occupied but would not pay more than a rack rent for what he occupied. The language which was used in the 1931 Act was not precisely that.  The 1931 Act did not work that way.  When the courts granted new tenancies they tended to strike middle figures for the tenancies.  When the landlord's valuer came in swearing one figure and the tenant's valuer came in swearing another, the court hit something in between.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="469" /> For a period I used to work on the rule of thumb that when you got a new lease the rent would be about 25 per cent off the rack rent.  That was not the original intention of it.  If the original intention of the code is maintained&mdash;the original intention was to prevent exploitation by the landlord but to leave the tenant to pay the proper remuneration for the landlord's capital which he is occupying&mdash;why should the tenant of a State authority not be prevented from exploitation every bit as much as the tenant of anybody else?  Why should somebody who works away for years on what happens to be the property of the State be at the mercy of the State machine?  Why should he not get as many rights as he would get against any other landlord?  Why should the State be allowed to be sloppy in the conduct of its business?  If it does not want to create rights why should life be made easier for the officials in whatever body it is that looks after this&mdash;probably the Board of Works?  Why should they not have to be as careful with State property as fellows employed by property companies are with theirs?</P>
    <P>We may be talking about a fairly substantial amount of property.  I do not know how extensive an estate the State has.  We do not have any information on it.  It might be useful to know on Committee Stage what kind of total valuation we are talking about, how extensive is the property and what might be involved. Half the GNP is now spent by the public sector, which includes local authorities, semi-State bodies and so on. The size of it suggests that there may be many interests affected by our getting the principle right.</P>
    <P>The language used in the old section did not work out as the market value.  It is proposed to improve that section by being able to look at like buildings in comparable areas.  What is wrong with the market value if the idea is that there should be a prevention of exploitation of the tenant's position?  If we are simply looking for the market value of the premises, surely it will lead to more rational investment of resources by the economy generally if any resources put into these investments get properly remunerated.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="470" /> Connected with that point is the housing equity, the continuous 30 years' occupation. I never really understood why that should be so.  I have come across quite a few cases where it was not the tenant that was the poor man; on the contrary, the only cases I know where the right was there are very well-off tenants and very poorly-off landlords.  I just wonder what we are doing cutting down he 30 years to 20 years and what we are doing by not making it continuous occupation by a family but by letting it be transferred.  I know this is recommended by the commission.  Is there any survey of this at all by anybody?  We are not talking about small tenancies, we are talking about substantial tenancies.  It becomes a little dangerous when we are cutting out the restriction to the urban areas.  A lot of people have been advised by their solicitors over the last 40 to 50 years and told, &ldquo;It is OK.  You can make favourable tenancy arrangements with your sister-in-law, your nephew's widow or anyone else.  You are all right because they will never get rights as it is in the country&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Now that the position is to be changed and we may find lots of situations where tenants are going to have rights conferred on them.  I know it is possible for the Minister to come back and say that it is open to the landlord to look for a review.  That may not be the solution to the problem, particularly in a country situation.  It may not altogether be in a country situation.  It may not be a question of getting a return.  Where we are extending rights and conferring new rights, which is what we are doing here, not merely changing the nature of the right within the city but conferring new rights on people who at the moment do not have them, it is important to ask ourselves if there is justification for this. I would like to feel that we gave consideration to these matters.</P>
    <P>On the landing subsidiary and ancillary, I wonder how this was previously restricted to one acre positions in this city, to urban areas, if I remember correctly. Am I wrong in that? I can tell you in this city there is one very substantial building on lands that <Col N="471" /> were very doubtfully subsidiary and ancillary but the unfortunate lessor had to decide that they were.  Somebody who was originally a rack-renting fully occupying tenant ended up with a couple of hundred thousand pounds in his pocket.  Having gone into occupation as a rack-renting tenant he collected the loot.  We ought to consider quite thoroughly the implications of these things and their impact on problems connected with the re-development of places like Dublin.  We should give thought to the question of whether or not we should in certain cases give power to the local authority if empowered to do so.  In our approach to this Bill, can we do anything with it that would facilitate the reconstruction or the re-development of Dublin and remove obstacles in so far as we can?  Property has its rights, certainly, but they should be regulated to the common good that we are supposed to be serving.  We shall have great fun when we are discussing the Bill section by section&mdash;all 82 of them.  I join with Senator Molony in his request that we be given some time when we are going through it, particularly between Committee and Report Stages.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. D. Andrews) David Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. D. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senators Molony and FitzGerald.  It is true that this is an 82-section Bill.  I think we should follow whatever arrangements Senators wish to come to, to have an efficient approach to the business before us.  Perhaps the Whips might arrange it. We could take it Part by Part or associate one Part with another.  At the end of 82 sections we might have forgotten what the first ten sections were about.  It is that sort of Bill.  I would be delighted to come to whatever arrangement the House finds satisfactory. Senator Molony very fairly admits that it was necessary for him to read the part dealing with reversionary leases three or four times before he came to grips with it.  I think that is a fair point.  It is an area of the law that is not my strongest point. I will concede that to Senator Molony on the basis of his concession.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one other matter.  I would just <Col N="472" /> like to clear the air as we are dealing with the Bill in a very friendly and a very civilised fashion, an attitude one would expect in the Seanad.  I would like to concede that the former Minister for Justice had a hand in drafting this legislation.  I do not want to gainsay that or deny his entitlement in that regard.  I wish to put that on the record of the House.  As the House knows, I have a personal regard for the former Minister for Justice and I expressed on another occasion my sorrow that he lost his seat in the Dáil and I repeat it on this occasion. I mean that sincerely.  I do not know whether he came from a worse place to a better place.</P>
    <P>His successor in office, the present Minister for Justice, Deputy Collins, must take the greatest credit, in all the circumstances&mdash;the complexity of the Bill, the number of sections in it&mdash;for bringing the Bill to the House so quickly and discharging the promise in the Fianna Fáil manifesto for the last general election.  This is the third part of a trilogy and, in that regard, the Government can be justly proud in regard to the promise they made under the heading of the landlord and tenant code.</P>
    <P>The other point that Senator Molony mentioned was the number of applications processed.  Almost 10,000 inquiries have been received about the No. 2 Ground Rents Act purchase scheme. Over 600 purchases have been completed and over 1,000 purchases are being processed at present.  This is a first class indication of how this legislation has worked, is working and will continue to work for the betterment of those people who have applied themselves to obtaining their entitlements under it.</P>
    <P>It is proper that I should repeat that there is in existence this legal mechanism available to people to buy out their ground rents at a reasonable amount and buy in the fee simple.  This is to be highlighted repeatedly during the currency of the term in which they can buy out that particular ground rent.  Coming near the end of the time in which this right to purchase exists, I imagine the Department of Justice would remind the people, by advertisement, of their right under the Act, to ensure that the Act is <Col N="473" /> seen to work.  This may well be outside the scope of the Bill but it is a fair point. I have no reason to be inflexible in dealing with matters not directly related to what we are discussing, if it is helpful to Senator Molony.  I should also like to be helpful in regard to whatever views he may have on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I take Senator FitzGerald's point very well in regard to section 4 of the Landlord and Tenant Bill.  I shall deal with it in greater depth and detail on Committee Stage.  One of the first questions I asked my advisers was on the efficacy of section 4 of the Bill; they were quite satisfied that it was efficacious and proper, and I should remind the Senators who contributed that this particular section has been lifted directly from &ldquo;your own Bill&rdquo;, consequently there is nothing new there.  We have taken that directly from the former Minister for Justice's proposals.</P>

      <P>I do not know if that makes it any better or any worse; it is the reality and the history of it.  I do not think section 4 is in the interests of landlordism specifically; it is only incidental to the State as landlord.  If, indeed, Senator FitzGerald raises any cases with me on Committee Stage which indicate the exploitation by the State of any of their tenants, I should be glad to have these cases examined.  My advice to date is that there have been no cases of actual exploitation brought to the notice of the Department or Departments concerned.</P>

    <P>The abolition of the urban and rural distinction, was a suggestion from that estimable body, the Landlord and <Col N="474" /> Tenant Commission.  I should like to make the point that whilst the Landlord and Tenant Commission is presided over by a judge of the Circuit Court, His Honour Judge Conroy, it is made up of personnel who are not directly related to the law.</P>
    <P>The redevelopment of Dublin will, no doubt, be raised on Committee Stage and I should be interested to hear what Senator FitzGerald will say specifically on that aspect.  I am grateful to the Senators for meeting the Second Reading in the fashion in which they did. Once more I should like to say that, in the interest of the proper expedition and disposal of the Bill and to give it legal purity&mdash;to make it as legally pure as human kind can make it&mdash;we would certainly accede to the Senators' request to introduce discussion on Committee Stage in a piecemeal fashion.  I should like to have this Bill sent to the Dáil as quickly as possible and the best way to bring that about is to accede to the Senators' request.  In that way we shall all get on well together and produce, in the not too distant future, a very good Bill for the Dáil and, consequently, for the signature of the President.</P>

      <P>Redundancy tends to strike a note of fear.  It has similar connotations to sickness, injury or accident.  The numbers who experience it, and the traumas and hardships which frequently go with it are considerable.  Since the redundancy payments scheme came into operation at the beginning of 1968, over 100,000 redundancies have been notified to my Department.  That figure gives an idea of the contribution which the scheme has made in alleviating the anxiety and the hardship which so many have to experience in situations of redundancy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="475" /> I am glad to say that the number made redundant in 1978 fell to below 10,000 for the first time since 1973.  This was an improvement of almost 3,000 on the 1977 figures and while we must strive to bring the level of redundancies down still further, I believe the improvement is a reflection on the considerable efforts of the Government to increase employment opportunities and reduce unemployment.  We will continue with our efforts and I hope to see a further significant reduction in our redundancy figures this year.</P>
    <P>At the same time, the incidence of redundancies as a measure of job loss and human hardship must not be exaggerated. The redundancy payments scheme could be seen as an adjunct to our moves from protection to free trade. The removal of tariff barriers had begun in the early sixties and was greatly extended by the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Agreement in the middle of the decade. Membership of the European Communities was also foreseen, with which would come further dismantling of our tariff barriers.</P>
    <P>Studies carried out in the early sixties showed that, in some industries a substantial amount of restructuring, involving job changing and training in new and developing skills would be necessary if those industries were to prosper in free trade conditions and if employment in them was to be maintained and expanded. The 1967 Act was an important contribution.  It has helped to alleviate the short-term hardship of workers made redundant and to promote the necessary long-term restructuring of industry, by facilitating, retraining and readaption and promoting the general acceptance of change.  Other elements of our manpower policy, including the advisory and placement facilities of the National Manpower Service, the resettlement allowance scheme and the training and retraining programmes of AnCO were all available as well to help promote the changes the country needed.</P>
    <P>On reviewing the legislation, I have had regard to these factors as well as to developments since the scheme began.  I have also taken into account criticisms, <Col N="476" /> representations and suggestions received.  There have been detailed discussions with both employer and worker representative bodies.  The proposals in the Bill which is now before the Seanad are based on the premise that the redundancy payments scheme should continue and that it be developed as a component of manpower policy.</P>
    <P>My review showed the scheme needed to be significantly recast.  The general improvement in the level of social welfare benefits, and especially the introduction of pay-related benefit in 1974 raised the question of the continuing need for redundancy weekly payments. These are paid in conjunction with unemployment benefit and pay-related benefit but normally subject to the rule whereby the aggregate weekly amount does not exceed 85 per cent of pre-unemployment average net weekly earnings or £50, whichever is the least.  This 85 per cent rule has meant that since 1976 redundancy weekly payments have been considerably curtailed.  In fact, there are cases where redundant workers have ceased to become entitled to any weekly payments.  A recent survey of almost 1,000 recipients showed that 78 per cent were receiving payments on a reduced or nil rate, while only 22 per cent were receiving the maximum payments of £24.</P>
    <P>A comprehensive study of the redundancy payments scheme published in 1977 under the auspices of the Economic and Social Research Institute concluded that the weekly payments, being an income maintenance feature of the scheme, should be discontinued, income maintenance being more appropriate to the social welfare system.</P>
    <P>My own examination of the scheme has led me to the same conclusion.  One of the main provisions of the Bill is, therefore, to discontinue weekly payments. It is proposed, however, that persons currently in receipt of redundancy weekly payments at the point when they are abolished, that is, 6 April 1979, will continue to receive their entitlements until they are exhausted or cease for other reasons.</P>
    <P>Weekly payments have always been associated, particularly by the trade unions, <Col N="477" /> with the workers' contributions. This probably results from a comparison with the British scheme which has no weekly payments or workers contributions. I consider it appropriate therefore that as weekly payments are to be discontinued, so too should the workers' contribution.  A proposal is accordingly included in the Bill to abolish the workers' redundancy contribution from 6 April 1979.  The Redundancy Payments Fund will be financed henceforth, it is proposed, entirely by employers' contributions.</P>
    <P>It is further proposed that these employer redundancy contributions should, as with social welfare contributions in general, be pay-related.  They will be collected as part of the general social insurance contribution scheme and be levied on earnings up to the same ceiling as for social insurance purposes. The figure specified in the Social Welfare Act, 1978, is £5,000, but provision is made to update this figure.  I do not think it is necessary for me to outline the advantages of a system of contributions related to pay.  Senators will recall that during the passage of the Social Welfare Bill last year the House discussed the conversion from flat rate to pay-related contributions.  I would just like to say that a pay-related basis is all the more appropriate for redundancy contributions since the workers' lump sum and hence the employers' rebate entitlements will be pay-related.</P>
    <P>I am proposing that the rate of the redundancy contribution be set at 0.5 per cent of reckonable earnings.  It is estimated that this will give the Redundancy Fund an income of about £9 million in the year commencing 6 April 1979, which I expect will keep the fund in credit at least up until the end of the first year of operation of the revised scheme. Then it is my intention to review the situation, including the adequacy of the contribution rate, in the light of the experience in the meantime.</P>
    <P>I am also proposing to raise the statutory ceiling on lump sums.  The ceiling for calculating lump sums is at present £2,500 and I propose to double this figure.  This would give a best possible lump sum of £4,087 when the revised <Col N="478" /> scheme comes into operation as against £2,043 now.</P>
    <P>An unsatisfactory characteristic of our redundancy payments scheme is its complexity.  Senators who have had to understand how the scheme works will be aware of this.  An important objective in my review of the scheme was therefore to simplify it to the greatest extent possible so that it is more easily understandable to those who have to do so. Indeed, the amendments I have already indicated, though not proposed for simplicity sake, will mean a much less complicated scheme.</P>
    <P>The rebate system as it now exists is particularly complex.  At present an employer is entitled to a 55 per cent rebate if he gives the requisite two weeks' notice, with an extra 2½ per cent for each week of extra notice up to a maximum of eight weeks or 70 per cent. Further, in the case of certain long-service employees part of the lump sum is rebated at 100 per cent.  Where two weeks' notice was not given, the rebate could be reduced to 45 per cent.  This complicated rebate system was designed to encourage employers to give additional notice to workers so that they might make arrangements about further employment and also to provide advance information on impending redundancies to the State agencies concerned so that they might be better able to carry out their functions in relation to the redundant workers.  I refer in particular to the placement function of the National Manpower Service and to AnCO.</P>
    <P>Since the enactment of these rebate provisions there have been other developments which ensure that these objectives are more effectively achieved than through the provisions of the Redundancy Payments Acts.  The Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Act, 1973, and the Protection of Employment Act, 1977, make provision in regard to the giving of notice.  The National Manpower Service and AnCO and their offices throughout the country concern themselves with the placement and training of redundant employees whenever possible.</P>
    <P>I am proposing, therefore, to confine <Col N="479" /> the notice provisions of the Redundancy Payments Acts simply to two weeks, which is adequate for the administration of the scheme, and at the same time I am proposing a uniform level of rebates set at 60 per cent which is just below the average rate of rebate up to now.  I might point out that this is a fairly high rate of rebate, especially when compared with the UK's current 41 per cent.  For failure to comply with the minimum of two weeks' notice a provision is included whereby the rate of rebate may be reduced from 60 per cent to 40 per cent. I am further proposing that the Minister for Labour should have power to vary these rates of rebate by regulation, subject to the sanction of the Minister for Finance and possible annulment by either the Dáil or Seanad.</P>
    <P>When the 1967 Act was enacted the old age pension age was 70 years.  This continues to be the age up to which a person can qualify for redundancy payments as it was not brought down with old age pension age.  I feel the upper limit for redundancy payments entitlement should be set at old age pension age and accordingly a provision to that effect is included in the Bill.  I am, however, aware that a sudden drop could disentitle many people, both employers and workers, with reasonable expectations in this respect in the event of redundancies. It is proposed, therefore, that the drop should not occur until one year after the other provisions in the Bill come into operation, that is, from 6 April 1980.</P>
    <P>In 1967, when the scheme was established, the normal working week was 42 hours and the number of hours in a week which a worker was normally expected to work in order to qualify under the scheme was set at half that number, that is 21.  The reasoning behind this is that the scheme should cover employments from which employees are deriving the main source of income and should not extend to subsidiary jobs.  I am proposing that, since the normal working week is now 40 hours, the number of hours needed to qualify be reduced to 20.</P>
    <P>One of the problems faced by an <Col N="480" /> employee who is under notice of redundancy is the need to get another job. While most employers would in the circumstances allow employees reasonable time off to look for work or arrange for training, I feel this is something which should be given to employees as of right. I have accordingly included a provision in the Bill to this effect.  To safeguard against abuses, employers may require the employee to give reasonable evidence of appointments in this regard.</P>
    <P>As regards the Employment Appeals Tribunal, Senators may well be aware of delays in hearing resulting from a backlog of cases.  This is largely due to the increased work-load imposed on the tribunal by the Unfair Dismissals Act, 1977.  I have been conscious of this problem for some time and I am proposing in the Bill that the membership of the Tribunal be considerably expanded. Provision is made to permit the appointment of five vice-chairmen instead of three and of 30 ordinary members instead of 24.  I have also provided that should the work-load of the tribunal warrant it, additional appointments may be made for the speedy despatch of business.</P>
    <P>I now come to the remaining amendments to the Acts which affect details of eligibility and the administration of the scheme.  As details of these amendments are I believe set out clearly in the Explanatory Memorandum I propose here to give you just a brief summary of what is involved.</P>
    <P>In relation to short-time, sections 10 and 11 improve the provisions of the Act relating to short-time situations, section 10 by providing the tribunal with some index of the permanency or otherwise of the short-time involved and section 11 by allowing employees whose hours or pay are reduced substantially, 52 weeks within which they can claim redundancy.</P>
    <P>Regarding appeals to the tribunal, section 12 empowers the tribunal at its discretion to allow appeals beyond the usual two-year limit in cases where the employer fails to give notice or a redundancy certificate.  Regarding an employee leaving before expiry of notice, <Col N="481" /> section 9 allows employees and employers to come to an agreement in the situation where an employee wishes to leave outside the obligatory notice period.</P>
    <P>In cases of winding-up and bankruptcy, section 13 provides that the Minister's claim where he has paid employees direct from the fund should rank as a priority debt.  This should conduce to the workers involved getting paid earlier and reduce the incidence of direct payments from the fund.</P>
    <P>As well, provision is made in the schedule so that periods of leave for childbirth where the employee resumes and periods of dismissal where reinstatement has taken place under Unfair Dismissals Act shall not break continuity of service.</P>
    <P>Also, to enable me to act quickly and effectively in administering the fund, I have taken power by regulation to change the ceiling for calculating lump sums, the contribution rate and the level of lump sums&mdash;all to be subject to the prior sanction of the Minister for Finance and possible annulment by either Dáil or Seanad.  Penalties have been updated and the Bill contains the standard provisions on citations, construction and commencement.</P>
    <P>In the Dáil a number of amendments were proposed by Deputies and having considered these I myself put down some amendments for Report Stage which substantially met the points sought by the original amendments. These related to certain points of detail in the matter of entitlement involving the requirements in certain short-time and minimum notice situations and the fixing of the ceiling for calculating lump sums.</P>
    <P>I might add that it is my intention to have a guidebook prepared on the amended scheme when this Bill has been enacted.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I believe that the proposals in the Bill are worthwhile and useful and I hope Senators can support them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardMarkey" hpid="Mr. Markey Mr. Markey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Markey</NameTxt>
      <P>I would have preferred that the Minister and his Department would have availed of this review of the redundancy payments scheme to take a <Col N="482" /> closer look at the philosophy behind the whole idea of redundancy payments. This Bill, while it is welcome, merely modifies some practical aspects of the Act which has been in existence since 1968 and tightens up some administrative problems in the light of the experience in the past decade or 12 years.  It does not contain any evidence of a substantial rethink on the part of the Department as to what a redundancy payments scheme should be all about and how it should really operate.  The philosophy that underlay the formulation of the redundancy payments scheme in the first instance was a commendable one at that time.  It is obvious to anybody that the intervening decade has brought very severe changes in the employment and labour situation and in the general economic situation which would have an effect on such a matter as redundancies.</P>
      <P>To look at circumstances that applied in 1968 would be beneficial.  At that time, as the Minister in his speech outlined, we were thinking ahead to EEC entry.  The Anglo-Irish Free Trade Agreement was already in operation and the removal of tariff barriers was already in process.  Certain needs had to be met to meet the future economic situation which would present itself with the EEC entry and also with the full operation of the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Agreement, namely, the question of disruption of old traditional industries, restructuring of those same industries and how possible redundancies would be faced up to.  The philosophy of that time was how best to make easier the question of redundancies as to how it would effect workers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unfortunately, unemployment in 1968 as compared with unemployment now was at a much lower figure.  That would have made easier the formulation of any redundancy payments scheme. Likewise social welfare payments were also further below <i>pro rata</i> general average income than they are now and that also would have made easier the formulation of redundancy payment schemes to boost people's unemployment benefits.  But circumstances a decade later have changed considerably. Redundancies have increased from a <Col N="483" /> figure of over 3,000 to 10,000.  Admittedly a couple of years ago during the world recession those figures were much higher, but they are liable to great variation from year to year.  In 1975 there were 19,000 redundancies; the following year the figure had gone down to 12,000 and then down again to 10,000.  We have no guarantee, of course, that the figure will not be on the increase again at any time in the future.</P>
    <P>In the light of the general economic situation now, which is different from that of 1968, it would have been a worthwhile exercise to have had a more thorough examination of the philosophy behind what we expect the redundancy payments scheme to do, particularly in the light of the decision now being made to discontinue the weekly maintenance payments part of the redundancy scheme.  The weekly maintenance income was considered essential due to the low social welfare benefits which applied 10 years ago.  Now with the increase in those benefits in the intervening decade it is found possible to remove those weekly maintenance payments without any great deleterious effect on the income of the unemployed or redundant person.</P>
    <P>That leaves us with the lump sum which in a way can also be regarded as a sort of income maintenance.  The person who is made redundant and qualifies for this redundancy is given a lump sum which in one way is regarded as a compensation for the service he has given in particular work and will be enough to tide him over, with the addition of unemployment benefit, until he has found himself another job.</P>
    <P>Some employers pay what are called <i>ex gratia</i> payments, in addition to the obligatory State lump sum payments. These employers are showing tremendous social consciousness and they are certainly to be complimented.  There is no legal obligation on them to pay out the <i>ex gratia</i> payments.  The fact that so many employers make an <i>ex gratia</i> payment is in one way a reflection on the adequacy of the lump sum amount given by the State.  There are statistics to show that the lump sum can vary greatly from <Col N="484" /> £100 up to, perhaps, the equivalent of two, three or four months' income.</P>
    <P>We have to question whether that is an adequate compensation, given that the same philosophy exists today as underlay the Bill when it was formulated, namely, that the lump sum was regarded as a compensation in a way for the property rights which the worker had built up in the job over a period of service. If so, we have, in the light of today's circumstances, to determine whether that lump sum amount is adequate, particularly in view of the increased unemployment situation and the fact that the redundancy scheme as it has operated has always seemed to result in older employees being laid off. Older workers have always found it more difficult to find alternative employment. It has also meant in its operation that certain categories were in a more difficult position than others.  People in the building and construction industry, people in semi-skilled and low-paid jobs, were always more adversely affected than people in better paid positions.  We have to ask ourselves therefore whether the lump sum as it applies today is adequate or not.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to compare the figures that apply here with the figures in Northern Ireland.  In Northern Ireland they are calculated on a different formula, half a week between the ages of 16 years and 21 years and one week for each year between the ages of 21 years and 41 years.  That compares with the system here where it is a half a week between the ages of 16 years and 41 years.  We should consider whether it would be better to bring the formula for the calculation of our lump sum payments into line with what exists in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>There are other matters which affect the operation of the redundancy payments scheme.  We have to see whether it has been as successful as originally intended. I have already referred to the general level of unemployment which applies now and which can have a very serious effect on the job prospects of the person who has been made redundant. We have also to consider that the fraction of people covered by redundancy <Col N="485" /> payments is very small in comparison with the overall numbers who are laid off jobs.  This is due to the fact that one must have two years' continuous service to qualify for redundancy payment. There are quite a number of categories of jobs which would never qualify due to their being casual and intermittent work, especially in the building industry.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, any scheme when it is drawn up cannot have regard to the individual circumstances.  Since redundancy is a most individual concern in its effect on the person concerned, it is unfortunate that some scheme cannot be devised where there could be supplementary payments under the redundancy payments scheme to take account of individual characteristics.  I have already given account of the intermittent nature of certain jobs and the fact that some people are older than others when they are laid off.  It is therefore more difficult for them, not only to obtain jobs but to go out and seek them, than it is for younger people.  It is a pity that some redundancy payments scheme could not be formulated which would take account of these aspects.</P>
    <P>The Minister has missed an opportunity to have an overall look at the philosophy behind the redundancy payments scheme.  There are a number of alternatives existing in other countries which could be looked at.  I have read that in some countries emphasis is placed on the younger people being made redundant so that the older people can be given continuity of service.  It is most important to older people that they can hold on to their jobs, because young people can obtain alternative employment much more rapidly.  They can go out and seek employment much more eagerly and enthusiastically than older people.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in his speech, has referred to retaining the redundancy payments scheme as a part of the manpower policy.  That is commendable, but the Minister has not outlined in what respects that will be done.  This is where the redundancy payments scheme since it was formulated has not been as successful as we would have hoped.  There have been cases where the employers <Col N="486" /> and the trade unions and the manpower agencies have got together, but there is nothing generally obligatory in this regard.  In other countries the employers, the trade unions and the State agencies get together and plan ahead for redundancies, if redundancies there must be.</P>
    <P>The Bill deals mostly with technical aspects and it tightens up some administrative problems that developed over the years.  I should like to mention some problems on which I should like the Minister to give me his observations. I wonder if the increase in the earnings ceiling up to £5,000 is adequate in comparison with the situation in Northern Ireland, which seems to give a much more adequate lump sum payment than here.  In regard to the two weeks' notice and the incentive to employers, I notice the Minister has settled on a figure of 60 per cent for the rebate.  Under the old scheme this varies between 40 per cent and 70 per cent.  I wonder why the Minister did not just settle for the 70 per cent rebate; it would have been a gesture on his part.</P>
    <P>There is a lot to be said for keeping an incentive there for employers to give plenty of notice regarding redundancy. The Minister has mentioned that under the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment and Unfair Dismissal Acts there are statutory periods of notice of dismissal stipulated.  Under the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Act, 1973, employees can have a right to notice of dismissal of up to eight weeks.  This is important, because the longer the period the person has in which he can seek alternative employment the better for himself.  I should like to know whether it would not have been wiser and better in the overall situation to have kept a graded incentive whereby the longer the notice given the higher the rebate.  If an employer is good enough to give up to eight weeks' notice under this redundancy payments scheme, perhaps we should have given him some acknowledgement of that incentive, as he is doing something in addition to the minimum period of notice envisaged. There are advantages in this for the employee who knows a few weeks ahead what his situation will be.  Since <Col N="487" /> redundancy seems to have a very serious effect on older people, who unfortunately come under the hammer of redundancy far too easily, the longer the period they have to seek alternative employment the better it would be.</P>
    <P>I notice furthermore that the Minister has settled on a minimum rebate of 40 per cent.  It was 45 per cent in the old scheme.  Again, he has failed to increase the amount to the maximum under the old scheme.  In this instance he is only giving a 40 per cent rebate instead of the 45 per cent.</P>
    <P>Giving employees the right to paid time off is a most welcome development, and it is possibly the best thing in the Bill.  I wonder if two weeks is sufficient. Maybe some arrangement could be reached where, if an employer is good enough to give anything up to eight weeks' notice, a longer period than two weeks' time off could apply.  A formula could be worked out on this basis.</P>
    <P>The other sections of the Bill largely deal with administrative aspects.  There must be an increase in the number of vice-chairmen of the appeals tribunal due to the number of redundancy applications coming before the tribunal.  All in all, a rethink is overdue in regard to what we expect a redundancy scheme to do for us.  It is regrettable that we should have to contemplate such a thing as a redundancy scheme and payments.  The Economic and Social Research Institute in their very fine report state that in the future the post-redundancy period before a person would find alternative employment is more likely to become longer than shorter.  This is something which will have to be looked into in regard to the preparation of this scheme.</P>
    <P>Should the Minister not regard it now as opportune that there be a thorough examination of the redundancy payments scheme to see how it could be integrated properly into an overall manpower policy scheme?  This is not referred to either in the Minister's speech or in the terms of the Bill as laid before us. Apart from those reservations I have mentioned, I welcome the Bill because it gives certain benefits to employees in these difficult times.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill and wish to commend the Minister for the many desirable and realistic changes in the redundancy arrangements contained in it.  As the Minister pointed out, improvements in the level of social welfare benefits, and particularly the introduction of pay-related benefits, form a logical basis for discontinuing weekly redundancy payments.  Henceforth, redundancy contributions made by employers only will be pay-related as will the workers' lump sums.  Lump sum payments will now be doubled to a maximum of £4,087, subject to review a year hence, with the ceiling for calculating lump sums also being doubled to £5,000. Under both headings these are important advances, and on the question of <i>ex gratia</i> payments referred to by Senator Markey, one will tend to get a certain amount of negotiation for sums over and above what is statutorily settled as lump sum figures.</P>
      <P>The reduction in the number of hours worked per week from 21 to 20 is realistic in the light of the normal working week which is now 40 hours.  Yet, importantly, it is high enough to help to ensure that a job which entails 20 hours per week forms the main source of income, thus properly avoiding the necessity for the payment of redundancy in respect of part-time employment.  I welcome the statutory base now being given to a redundant worker to have a two-week period to seek another job.  I also welcome the increase in the membership of the Employment Appeals Tribunal to help expedite the business of the tribunal.</P>

      <P>The Bill is an advance on previous measures.  My contribution will be based on the practical problems that have confronted my fellow trade union officials in dealing with the ordinary day-to-day problems that arise through the minimum notice of employment, the unfair dismissals and the redundancy payments measures and the difficulty they encounter as a result of tribunal decisions.  I will be making some observations about the areas where the Bill has not remedied those particular situations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="489" /> Sections 10,11,12 and 13, of the Redundancy Payments Bill, 1979, which was amended and approved by Dáil Éireann on 28 February, were overdue when the 1971 Bill was passing through the Oireachtas.  Section 12 was accepted by the Minister for Labour in the Dáil on 28 February.  The Minister for Labour has accepted some of the urgently needed amendments which had been requested by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and he is taking power under section 4 to amend the manner in which the redundancy lump sum may be calculated.  Most of the improvements sought by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions were, to my knowledge, resisted by the Minister for Labour.</P>
    <P>The Redundancy Payments Bill, 1979 attracts constructive criticism mainly because the Minister for Labour and his Department have not given adequate attention to the necessity to protect the interests of the lower paid workers affected by redundancy.  This Bill in common with the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Act, 1973, enables the Employment Appeals Tribunal to award compensation without making provision to secure the payment of the award to the redundant workers.  Section 7, for example, is supposed to give an employee a right to some time off with pay in order to look for a new job.  But, as the tribunal's award will not be a guaranteed payment from the redundancy fund, the employee may whistle for this award if the employer becomes insolvent, as under the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Act.  These are very important points that affect the day-to-day workings of the trade union officials and manifest a lot of the frustrations we are up against.</P>
    <P>When firms go to the wall, it often happens that there are not sufficient funds to pay preferential creditors. These include the Revenue Commissioners and social insurance fund. Unless the tribunal's award is guaranteed, like the redundancy lump sum, as one trade union official said to me&mdash;it was the first time I heard the expression&mdash;it is as worthless as Wood's halfpence.  I do not know what that <Col N="490" /> means but that is what he said.  The Minister should not have proposed the abolition of the weekly payments without increasing the lump sum.  This is a view that most of the officials have. They feel that as far as possible all employees should be covered.</P>
    <P>In section 4 the overdue proposal to lift the ceiling from £48 to £96 weekly will benefit workers in receipt of pay in excess of £48 weekly, but it effectively reduces the compensation payable to many thousands of workers, especially women, who are paid less than £48 weekly.  The Bill, therefore, reduces the amount of redundancy compensation available to workers in the greatest need. Pending review of the situation, the minimum lump sum payment should be increased from a half week's pay for each year of service after the age of 21 years.  With the exception of the extra week's pay introduced under the 1971 Act, the method of calculating the lump sum has not been improved since 1967. The minimum lump sum payments are too low and should be increased at least to the levels obtaining in Northern Ireland.  Although many firms pay much higher payments than those provided for in the Acts, workers employed by an insolvent firm or company have to accept the minimum payments which are guaranteed by the Redundancy Fund. When one considers that as many as 9,000 notifications of redundancy are recorded in a year that is not a very good situation to be in.  The weekly redundancy payments are a valuable benefit where firms become insolvent, especially if it transpires that the firm did not return the income tax and social insurance payments to the proper authorities.  Trade unions have had experiences of this.</P>
    <P>Due to the refusal of successive Governments to update the deferred payments, or resumed weekly payments to current pay levels, the value of the deferred lump sum was diminished or extinguished.  The Minister for Labour admitted in Dáil Éireann on 6 February last that some weekly payments were as low as 3p, 4p and 6p, while some payments were as high as £24 a week.  That is very considerable when there were <Col N="491" /> over 2,300 payments last January.  The Minister has an obligation to make a compensatory payment in the form of an increase in the lump sum for workers earning less that £48 weekly.  A half week's pay for each year of service is not enough.  The Minister for Labour has an obligation to relate the scope of the Redundancy Payments Act to the current customs and practices in employment so that workers are not deprived of the generality of benefit.  The qualifying period of two years, known as the requisite period, effectively deprives thousands of building workers of the benefits of the Act.  The same exclusion applies to thousands of workers in other occupations. Many building contracts and sub-contracts are completed within two years.  The Minister should agree to reduce the qualifying period to, say, 78 weeks and review the position in a year's time.  We intend to put down an amendment to reduce the qualifying period to 1½ years on Committee Stage of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The restrictive interpretation given in law to &ldquo;place&rdquo; of employment is another matter that causes concern to the officials in the day-to-day activities.  Section 7 of the Redundancy Act of 1977 creates unreasonable hardship and difficulties for building trade workers in particular.  The practice in this trade is to invite workers to apply for employment on the actual site.  Thereafter, the trade would like to regard the entire State as actual place of employment and herein lie the abuses.  Building firms have often claimed that workers sent, for example, from a Galway site to a Dublin site did not in law change their place of employment. The word &ldquo;place&rdquo;, from information I have received, was the subject of a High Court decision and the meaning of the word is still as vague as ever to the people on the tribunal and to the trade union officials who have to argue the interpretation. We will be offering an amendment which will apply to workers generally and which will be seen to be fair and reasonable in relation to building trade workers.</P>
    <P>The scope of the Redundancy Payments Acts, where thousands of women workers are concerned, is determined by <Col N="492" /> what is well known in industry as the 21-hour rule.  It is proposed in the Bill before the House to reduce the qualifying hours from 21 to 20.  It has been proved elsewhere in the country that the qualifying hours should be reduced to 16.  There has been a clear tendency in the service employment to reduce the qualifying hours well below 21 or 20 so that as many workers as possible may be kept outside the scope of the Acts. The Post Office authorities have reduced the hours of work of some grades to 18 hours weekly.  I doubt if it will have escaped the notice of the Department of Labour that the daily hours of work of many service workers have been reduced to three where there is a six-day spread.</P>
    <P>The managers of industry are altering work practices so that scores of women workers are being put outside the protection of the Acts week by week.  What I am relating here are notes I have taken from the practical experiences of trade union officials who come across the problem on a day-to-day basis.  Thousands of workers who were within the cover of the redundancy Acts three years ago are now without protection because the hours of work were reduced from 21 to 18.  The reduction from 21 to 20 will not restore the position.  The view of most trade union officials that I have spoken to is that the Minister's Department should tailor the Acts to the current practices in industry and services. Whenever legislative proposals to amend the Redundancy Payments Acts are laid before the Oireachtas, provision should be made on the title of the amending Bill to facilitate harmonious modifications in the associated legislation, namely, the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment and Anti Discrimination (Unfair Dismissals) Acts to which I made reference earlier on.</P>
    <P>The Employment Appeals Tribunal has been established to determine appeals under the three codes of law in connection with redundancy and other conditions of employment.  Apart from the tribunal, there are several links between the three Acts.  Employees making claims or appeals before the tribunal usually have claims under two and, in a lot of cases, under all three Acts, at <Col N="493" /> the same hearing, especially when a firm or company is in an insolvent condition. Unless there are common rules for calculating continuous employment, the tribunal is seen to be making incomprehensible decisions in relation to common case facts or evidence.  Any change in the 21-hour rule in the Redundancy Payment Acts should be reflected in the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Act.  There is no enabling power in that Act to harmonise the qualifying hours for regulations.  Up to now, the qualifying hours have been common to both codes of law.</P>
    <P>The best way of removing these anomalies is by extending the scope of the Redundancy Payments Bill so that the scope, provisions and continuity rules in the redundancy legislation would be reflected in the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Act.  Unless the scope of the Redundancy Payments Bill is widened, it will be necessary to promote a Bill to amend the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Act, and a draft Bill has been prepared for this purpose.  The trade union officials wish me to look at the draft they prepared to see if I can get some advice on it.</P>
    <P>In the past, the Minister for Labour has defended the scope of Bills on redundancy mainly on the grounds of legal perfection.  But, as soon as Bills have been enacted, the legal advisers of other Governments exploit each weakness which was identified in the debates.  This example is followed by public authorities especially in the health service.  The Department of Education has punched a hole in section 7 of the 1967 Act by making a teacher redundant in a manner which deprives the worker of compensation. The decision was made by management not by unions or workers.  If management decides to make a class of worker redundant, those workers should be compensated.</P>
    <P>In 1969, the Limerick Health Authority decided to make midwives redundant by altering the name of the grade and the degree of qualification required. The Department recognised the implications of that decision and section 4 of the 1970 Act was given retrospective <Col N="494" /> effect in order to restore the scope of that Act.  A similar correction was made in order to restore the scope of the 1971 Act.  The Department of Education has been permitted by existing legislation to make every unqualified teacher redundant without payment of redundancy compensation.  An amendment will be offered for the purpose of providing protection for a class of workers, namely, unqualified teachers.</P>
    <P>Section 7 deals with time-off to seek a new job.  This is a welcome improvement on the scope of the redundancy Acts. Unfortunately, there is no provision in the Bill to ensure equality of treatment for employees generally.  The employee may have to apply to the District Court for the award given by the tribunal and, if the employer is insolvent, the award has to take its place with the preferential debts namely income tax, social insurance, arrears of pay, holiday pay, minimum notice, suspensions and so on. The tribunals awards should be payable from the funds and awards under the Minimum Notice Act should also be paid from the redundancy fund.</P>
    <P>There is a serious defect in section 7. The employee cannot qualify for time off with pay in order to look for another job unless he is given notice by his employer. Many employers, especially those who do not wish to draw attention to a pending failure of business, do not give notice under any Act.  This section would apply to firms engaged in reorganisation.  The time off section would not apply to firms in liquidation and there would be no funds available to pay the amount awarded by the tribunal. The union officials rightly asked, &ldquo;Why should a redundant employee who has had to appear before the tribunal about time off pay have to go to the District Court to recover it?&rdquo;  What use is a contract debt if the firm or company have no funds?  These awards, in their opinion, should be paid out of the Redundancy Fund.</P>
    <P>An important new principle has been promoted by the time off section of the Bill.  Workers are to be given time off with pay to look for another job when the firm decides to run down the work force.  If a worker finds another job and wishes to accept it the firm under rule 4 <Col N="495" /> of the Third Schedule of the 1967 Act, are entitled to claim that, if he accepts the job, he is not entitled to compensation on the grounds that he has voluntarily left his employment.  If a firm wish to prevent an employee from looking for another job, they may do so by not giving notice under section 7.  There is an obligation on the Minister for Labour to ensure that section 7 operates in practice. If, in the situation of redundancy, a worker discovers another job and if the Act confers on him a right to look for an alternative job, the worker must be permitted to accept the new job, otherwise section 7 will be a fictitious benefit.  It is necessary, therefore, to enable the employee to take up the job which he has been given the right to seek.  Section 7, by implication, introduces two new disputes&mdash;that of the right of an employee to look for and accept a new job, and that of the employer not wishing to release him in time to accept it.  The tribunal should be given more discretion than it has at present.</P>
    <P>I have been requested to ask the Minister to look at amendment No. 19 which was discussed in the Dáil on 21 February and which will be presented again, to follow section 7.  Section 9 of the Bill does not offer a solution to the problem where employers refuse to cooperate in a redundancy situation.  Section 10 is an overdue amendment of the 1967 Act.  In order to eliminate the scope for disputes it will be necessary to amend this section so that employers may not claim that the reduced hours of work do not have the effect of excluding workers under the 20 hour rate.</P>
    <P>It is rather difficult to grasp the meaning of section 11.  The people I spoke to believe this is mainly because of legislation, by reference to the amended section 15 (2) (a) which should have been included in the Bill.  Rule (2) (a) was the trial period of two months in the Act of 1971 which has caused considerable trouble.  Section 11 proposes to enable an employee temporarily to accept a change in pay or in hours of work for 12 months without entering into a new contract. This is a significant boon by any measure.  In one of the hardship cases <Col N="496" /> which proved the need for section 11, alternative employment was offered in England and when the employee accepted it for 11 months he lost his right to compensation.  Section 11 does not give relief when a worker accepts temporary work in another place or if he accepts a different position on a temporary basis.  This section would not apply to a Dublin worker sent to Galway or Cork. It would apply to a Cork worker offered short-time work in Cork.  A suitable amendment will be offered at a later stage.</P>
    <P>Section 12 forms part of an amendment proposed in the Dáil.  In fairness to redundant workers who have already lost their appeal, the Minister for Labour should look again at section 8 of the amending Act of 1971.  In the Limerick Health Authority dispute, the Ryan case, the Department decided to pay compensation out of a fund when the corrections were made in the Acts, although the case was decided against the redundant employee.</P>
    <P>Section 10 of the 1971 Act, under which the employee was given certain presumptions as to continuity of service and so on, needs further modification. This has proved to be an important section but, again, the facts which are revealed to the tribunal are often stranger than fiction.  This comment was made by a trade union official.  The problem seems to arise if the employer's records are insufficient.  Unfortunately for employees, verification of the records may not be available before the tribunal makes a decision.</P>
    <P>This section should be amended to enable an employee to make a new claim for a disputed part of his service within 12 months of the tribunal decision. Where the employer's records are insufficient but where the employee produces verification of them.  Taking the tribunal generally, where the employer is in clear breach of a statutory duty by not giving the notice which enables an employee to make a claim properly, the tribunal should have power to award some of the costs to the employee.  The people who solicited my help in this said that explanatory leaflets are of little use to trade union officials appearing before the tribunal.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="497" /> Provisions of the 1967 Act, as amended, which affect most appeals include: section 7, scope; section 15, alternative work; section 24, limit for making claims; and rules 4 to 7 of the Third Schedule, continuous employment. These sections they believe should be consolidated as one Schedule to the Bill.</P>
    <P>The powers and functions of the tribunal are extending of necessity and further discretion is needed to facilitate the despatch of business.  Where the employer is in breach of a statutory duty under a Redundancy Act, the tribunal should have power to award to the employee the cost of his appeal.  This would reduce the number of appeals. Where the employer is unable to refute the employee's contention before the tribunal, the employee's assertion should be accepted.  The tribunal should be able to make an interim award where it appears that the period of service is in doubt.</P>
    <P>The tribunal has functions under three separate codes of law, namely the Redundancy, Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment and Unfair Dismissal Acts.  It has to unscramble the claims and counter-claims made at the same time under all three Acts.  It has power to extend the time limit in redundancy disputes but not when a juvenile worker has been unfairly dismissed, although he may not know it until he finds another job.  The tribunal award under the Redundancy Act is guaranteed by a fund.  The awards under the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Act are not guaranteed.  Although the tribunal is expected to allow a defaulting employer to be subsidised by the social insurance fund when he is solvent there is no guarantee for the employee under the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Act where the employer is insolvent.</P>
    <P>The 78 week rule, that is, the &ldquo;interruption of employment&rdquo; due to sickness or injury, is known to be defective when the employer goes into liquidation or where an employee is dismissed, while on sick leave, by an insolvent firm between the 26th and 78th week of illness or injury.</P>
    <P>The word &ldquo;interruption&rdquo; implies that <Col N="498" /> the employee when ill or in hospital, must resume work before the expiry of the 26th week.  If the firm is not insolvent or if a notice of dismissal is not given, the employee has the benefit of 78 weeks' absence if he is seriously ill.  If the firm is in a serious financial plight, the employee has only 26 weeks' grace.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Labour is once again urged to make the Bill workable and to enable the tribunal to deal with disputes as expeditiously as possible.  Both sides of industry are to be congratulated on the reputation which the tribunal have earned.  That is something I am acknowledging despite all the difficulties the tribunal have.  They are doing a good job in all the circumstances.  The Minister should facilitate those union officials whose duty it is to appear before the tribunal by accepting the proposals to consolidate the work hours section of the Redundancy Act and to harmonise the scope of the rules in the Redundancy and Minimum Notice Acts.</P>
    <P>That, by and large, is the way I was approached about the Bill and I tried to get it on the record as I got it from the trade union officials.  As many of them read the Seanad debates, I aimed as far as possible at accuracy.  It was not a question of knocking the Bill.  It was a question of trying to get the legitimate criticisms of trade union officials who are confronted with problems on a day-to-day basis, trying to get it as accurately as possible to see if we can bring about amendments and to facilitate the Minister and his staff to bring about some improvements in these areas.  It would be a much nicer task if one could talk about the means of preventing redundancy rather than talking about the effect of redundancies.  Unfortunately, the scope is not within the Bill for doing that.</P>
    <P>Even though the redundancies are down this year as against 1977 we should have regard to the fact that redundancy will always be with us.  The pace of change in industry means that this problem will always confront us.  It is part of the society in which we live. Consequently, we should spare no effort to ensure that the claims of workers affected by redundancy are processed effectively, <Col N="499" /> particularly where firms are insolvent, taken into receivership or going into liquidation.  If we do that, we can rightly say to the workers that we have done everything to facilitate them in this delicate area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardConroy" hpid="Professor Conroy Professor Conroy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Conroy</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill which is a very necessary and humane one.  As Senator Harte has so rightly said, redundancy is something we are going to have to live with, something that will stay with us.  The Minister, in his introduction, and many speakers have referred very clearly to the importance of alleviating the financial trauma to the individual and have pointed out that it is not solely a question of financial embarrassment.  To someone who has been working in a job for five, ten, 15, 20 or 30 years it is an enormous crisis in that individual's life if he finds himself redundant, almost invariably through no fault of his own, and very often quite unexpectedly.  As the Minister said, redundancy strikes a note of fear, in many ways almost more so than sickness or injury.  That is one aspect of it and it is right that we should be concerned.  In itself, it would justify our concern.  In fact, there is far more to it than that.  We should not regard redundancy solely in malign terms.  It is, as Senator Harte said, going to stay with us.  In some sense it is a healthy sign.  It is vital for us, as a whole, most of all, workers, all of us involved in any sense in industry or development, that our industries mature and develop.  It is essential that new industries should be introduced into this country.  If that is to be done effectively, for the general health of the country, the health of industry, and the health and welfare of the individual worker, then it is essential that we have an effective, humane and good scheme of redundancy payments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are in a very different situation from the United Kingdom.  In the United Kingdom there are a large number of decaying industries.  From that point of view it is obviously important to them that they should have redundancy schemes.  We do not have that background of industry.  Therefore, on <Col N="500" /> the one hand we have no excuse for not having effective redundancy legislation and, on the other hand, we must regard it very much as a challenge, not something which is used as a sort of umbrella or protection which, unfortunately, in Britain has led to so many ill-effects, particularly to the general fall in the efficiency of industry, to poor incomes and poor living standards.  It is like a tightrope.  On the one hand we must have redundancy payments which will effectively compensate the person involved and give him a worthwhile chance of a new start, or, if he is close to retirement, tide him through until that. On the other hand, we must not set up a situation in which the employer concerned is tempted not to let an employee go because of the redundancy payments involved or, worse still, to refuse employment to people because he is afraid of being involved in excessive redundancy payments&mdash;excessive in his terms.</P>
    <P>It was introduced in 1968 when we were thinking in terms of free trade and this is the historical basis of it, as the Minister indicated.  In general terms, far beyond the question of removal of tariff barriers, if Irish industry is to develop and is to be effective, if we are to introduce modern industries, we must have a proper redundancy scheme.  Allied with that, it is very important that our retraining and relocation programmes be constantly kept in mind.  It is not sufficient to provide a lump sum to a worker and say goodbye to him.  It is a far more difficult problem to see that he has the opportunity of getting a job in another industry and has an opportunity to do the appropriate training.  This in itself is quite an enormous topic and, I am sure Senator Harte would agree, a very difficult one.</P>
    <P>I note that the fund income is anticipated to rise towards £9 million.  It is a significant figure and one which is likely to increase.  We should be happy to see it increased much further because it is for a scheme in which there is hope of development for the future.  It is much more important and worthwhile in terms of society and the individual than unemployment benefit.  Let us hope the day <Col N="501" /> will come when there will be no need for such a thing as unemployment benefit but there is a continuing need for worthwhile redundancy benefits.</P>
    <P>I am very glad to see that the ceiling has been doubled to £4,000.  I cannot help thinking that that figure will need to be increased.  I am also very glad to see that some of the complexity is to be reduced.  It is very important in any such scheme as a redundancy scheme, which is so closely associated with the change from one industry to another, and so important for the individuals concerned, that it should be as simple and efficient as possible.  I am glad to see that the Minister is to bring out a guidebook for our advice and knowledge.</P>
    <P>One small matter is the question of the working week.  I am glad to see that provision is going to be made for a reduction to 20 hours.  Perhaps that will be further reduced again at some future stage.  One very important point on which one or two speakers have commented is the question of time off.  This is very closely related to the fact that for people who are made redundant it should not be the end of the road.  Quite frankly, I should prefer far longer notice to be given by industries or companies which are considering redundancy.  We should get away from the idea of considering it as something bad and should take steps in good time so that those involved will have the greatest possible opportunity to move to some other job, to get training for some other industry. They should be given every possible encouragement, not only in terms of finance and money.</P>
    <P>The enlargement of the Employment Appeals Tribunal fits in with the Minister's very enlightened approach to this problem and his realisation that it is something to be tackled in a positive manner, with which, I am sure, we would all agree.  There is the question of bankruptcy in certain firms and the relationship towards repayments and the situation of the State.  This is a healthy improvement in that employees' rights should be safeguarded in all circumstances, particularly in the circumstances of redundancy.</P>
    <P>I am glad also to see the very necessary <Col N="502" /> and enlightened attitude towards childbirth leave.  This is a part of the general picture.  I have great pleasure in welcoming this Bill.  It is a really worthwhile one.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ValentineJago" hpid="Mr. Jago Mr. Jago">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jago</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill.  This Bill is part of a general rationalisation to relate employees' deductions to their pay and to relate employers' payments to pay.  This is welcome because of the administration costs and because it relates the payment to the pay of the employee. In this case it has been decided that there will be no deduction from the employee. There is a case to be made for that because we should really look on this as an insurance paid by the employer for a liability he may have to face in the future.  It is really the employer's liability.  In the employer's case he is paying more but against that the lump sum has been increased.  In recent times, in cases of redundancy, more than the statutory amount has been negotiated.  If this happens again the employer will probably get a bigger amount from the State towards what he has to pay.</P>
      <P>Generally speaking, redundancies are negotiated.  If they were not it is more than likely that the rule, &ldquo;last on, first off&rdquo; would apply.  The short-term employees would go first, possibly the younger employees.  It appears that the notice required in the Bill should be sufficient. Sometimes in negotiations the long-term employees offer to go, in which case they must be given longer notice.  Therefore, shorter notice should be sufficient in the case of employees entitled to less redundancy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Harte referred to cases of voluntary liquidation in which there were no funds.  I look on this as being an insurance paid by an employer for a liability that he may have to face in the future.  To a certain extent can it not be looked on as insurance for the benefit of the employee?  If a case like that arises, is not at least 60 per cent payable to the employee?  If that is the case, if the employer does not give the required notice and fill in the required form, he can be cut to 40 per cent.  Now we are reducing the employee to an entitlement of 40 per cent.  It might be better if that <Col N="503" /> penalty on the employer was left out and some other penalty brought in against the employer for failure to give the required notice.  An employee is entitled to certain notice.  If he doesnot get that notice then he is not gone and the employer is liable to pay him up to the date on which he should go in relation to the statutory notice.  I should like to know if that is correct.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelMulcahy" hpid="Mr. Mulcahy Mr. Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill and should like to refer to a number of points without repeating what has already been said.  I have had experience of one of the AnCO programmes for managers and executives who have been made redundant. It is a very sad experience to stand in front of some 20 middle-aged people who felt they had safe jobs and suddenly found themselves redundant.  I should like to commend the Department of Labour and the Minister for instituting the programme through AnCO, which is known as the Career Development Programme.  Just in case Senators do not know about it, it means that individuals who find themselves without a job spend six weeks on a programme of development. They are paid while they are on this programme.  The important thing is that individuals who have been accustomed to going out every morning to work and who suddenly find themselves with nowhere to go except to look for a job, can, by going on this programme, have some place to go.  They can keep their heads in the air and get a new direction, a new sense of purpose.  I should like to record in the House that more than 90 per cent of them, so far as I can remember, find new employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many of them find employment before the programme is finished, which leaves them in the difficult situation of wanting to finish the programme and wanting to start work again.  Sometimes I hear caustic comments about keeping people in employment artificially, but this programme is a positive approach to the problem.  It provides an injection for people in the middle stage of their career, a reorientation and, very often, a new direction that gives them even more satisfaction than they dreamt of in the <Col N="504" /> beginning.  I have seen some of these people working on some of the shorter term projects that we have been playing around with in the inner city.  That is another indication of how all of these activities can, in fact, come together in a positive way.  For somebody who is very tired of the world and of a system which has thrown them out on the road after they have given 20 years of their life to some firm it can be a salutary experience to go to the inner city and see things that may be worse than their situation.  In the process they can do something to rehabilitate themselves.</P>
    <P>How does the figure of 10,000 redundancies compare with other countries?  In industry if you take a figure of 300,000 employed, 10,000 redundancies is something like 3 per cent.  As we are restructuring industry in a post-free trade area during the transition into the EEC, one would expect to know how bad that figure is.</P>
    <P>From an employer's point of view, it is another bit of chipping into the added value that goes to labour in industry. There has been a gradual build-up of that over a period.  I wonder what the employer's attitude is to a cut in the share of the added value which is left over after income.  It looks like another .25 per cent.  This is something that will go on for some time as negotiations between the labour share and the company share continues.</P>
    <P>Has the Minister any information about the distribution of the 10,000 redundancies?  I am interested in knowing how much of it is coming from Dublin as opposed to the rural areas? Are we winning?  I think that we are and I hope we are.  I welcome the Bill and look forward to Committee Stage.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>First of all, I extend a hearty céad <Col N="505" /> míle fáilte to the Minister.  He is a man who has done a tremendous amount of work since he took over the Ministry of this most important Department.  His work has been acknowledged by everybody and we wish him continuing success in his onerous task.</P>
    <P>I was taken by the first sentence in his speech.  He said, &ldquo;Redundancy tends to strike a note of fear&rdquo;.  Never was a truer sentence penned by anybody.  The great fear of any good workman is that the day will come when he will not be wanted any longer.  Until recently, he could visualise that that would happen when he reached an advanced age. Somehow he has mentally prepared for the traumatic effect of reaching that age. Unfortunately, no matter how good a workman he is and no matter how dedicated he is, he cannot be unaware of the fact that, even at a comparatively early age, he will not be wanted any longer.  In other words, he will become redundant.  &ldquo;Redundant&rdquo; is a nice-sounding word but it does not ease the pain of that man's heart when he finds that he is redundant.</P>
    <P>One point I would make more than anything else is that in this day and age we have to face the fact that people will become redundant before their time.  One of the main things that trade unions, employers' organisations and the Department of Labour should face is the educating of men in industry and in agriculture to prepare themselves for a number of jobs, so that when the time comes they can switch easily from one to another and be able to say to themselves, &ldquo;Even though I am not wanted in this job, I am not an outcast.  I can still earn my living in another form of employment.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There are many excellent features in this Bill.  I am sure they have all been dealt with by various speakers and I will not go into them.  The Minister in his final sentence said, &ldquo;I believe that the proposals in the Bill are worth while and useful and I hope that Senators can support them.&rdquo;  Let there be no doubt in his mind that the proposals in this Bill are worth while and useful and I am sure every Senator in the House will be very glad to support them.</P>

      <P>I thank the Senators for their contributions and for their general acceptance of the Bill.  I will endeavour to refer to some of the points made by the Senators.  I, too, share the concern that redundancy is preferably something that should be avoided.  In other words, we should not have redundancies if at all possible but obviously we have to cater for them when they arise.</P>
      <P>In relation to some of the points made by Senator Harte, I should like to say that I had discussions with both sides of industry and with the congress of trade unions, and I accepted many of the suggestions and amendments put forward. The House will also be aware that the Minister has a responsibility to balance the points made to him by both sides and to take into account the improvements that are necessary.  I am satisfied the major ones are in the Bill before the House tonight.  In the more detailed context Senator Markey referred to the adaption to free trade and the increased competition which, I believe, is still taking place.  We have to be prepared for the redundancies that arise in that situation.</P>
      <P>I want to take issue with the Senator in that he said there were no substantial changes.  I do not agree with him, on two scores.  There have been a number of substantial changes from early 1968 when the Redundancy Payments Bill was first introduced and became effective, to the present time, such as the passing of the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Act, the introduction of pay-related benefits, the establishment of AnCO, and of substantial changes in the introduction of pay-related benefits; in rebate provisions; in ceilings for lump sums; in the abolition of workers' contributions and the right to time off &mdash;which has been mentioned by so many speakers, and which, I believe, is a good provision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the lump sum aspect, Senator Harte and some other Senators have referred to the method of calculation.  I want to make a few points on that.  The first is that I have undertaken to revise the method of calculation at the end of <Col N="507" /> one years's operation of the scheme when I will have had experience of how it operated during the first year.  On the point that the position of the lower paid worker would be affected, we are satisfied from our investigation that, except in very isolated cases, there should be no worsening of the situation and, in the vast majority of cases, there should be substantial improvement.  The latest figure we have, for example, for the average industrial wage is £72 for June 1978 and this includes men and women. I should add also that the calculation of redundancy payments is based on the reckonable earnings, including overtime, allowances and so on.  It is not confined to the basic rate.</P>
    <P>On the lump sums, let me say that the increase in the ceiling from £2,500 to £5,000 will benefit very substantially the vast majority of workers becoming redundant.  It was, I think, Senator Harte who referred to my reply to a question in the Dáil where some weekly payments were as low as 3p or 10p&mdash;I am not quite sure of the figures; they certainly were low.  This is one area where the lump sum payment will help.  Of the thousand recipients investigated, 78 per cent were in receipt of either reduced or nil rates of contribution under the weekly payment and the remaining 22 per cent were receiving the full weekly payment. The ceilings, basically, operate on pay-related benefits and unemployment benefit.</P>
    <P>Mention was made of care being taken in the treatment of individuals under the redundancy payments scheme. Desirable though that might be, it is difficult to discriminate between workers, as was suggested by Senator Markey. One must, of necessity, look at the overall situation.  I should say also that the IDA, the National Manpower Service and AnCO have developed and are continuing to improve, arrangements for close collaboration on threatened redundancy situations.</P>
    <P>Senator Markey asked me to tell him specifically why on the rebate rate a figure of 60 per cent was suggested.  The reason was that the average rebate figure was looked at and 60 per cent is slightly <Col N="508" /> below the average rebate figure; in comparison, in the UK the average rebate payable is 41 per cent.</P>
    <P>Some Senators would prefer to see a longer period than two weeks given as time off.  First, under the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Act, 1973, it is compulsory and obligatory for the employer to give the notice required under that Act.  For the purpose of the Redundancy Payments Act we are suggesting two weeks which is a complete innovation.  It is desirable and right that it should, at this stage at any rate, be kept within that two week notice period.  I will come back in a moment to that topic, on which particular points were made by some Senators.</P>
    <P>The ESRI Report was mentioned. After a thorough examination, the vast majority of the ESRI recommendations were included in the Bill before the House except for its recommendation on intermittent work.  I have not followed the recommendation with regard to the building industry; I believe that two years to qualify is a reasonable minimum period.  Senator Harte referred to this industry, but he would probably be the first to agree with me that there are difficulties in that particular area.  He referred to the place of employment, and if one took it to the ultimate it could mean that a worker need never leave one particular building contractor but could move from site to site and qualify for redundancy payments each time he moved to a new site.  There would be difficulties, there, into which we will be going in more detail on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Senator Markey referred to favouring older workers in redundancy situations and encouraging the departure of young workers.  The House is aware that this is, essentially, a matter for the employers, in consultation with the trades unions. These consultations take place and, understandably, arrangements are made between both sides to the best possible advantage of the employees affected. Sometimes in that situation the workers with long term service volunteer to go.  It would be a bit unreal, perhaps, to load it entirely in favour of young people.  It does, perhaps, give the young people the opportunity of continuing work at an early age.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="509" /> I did say the Bill does not reduce compensation for the lower paid, as was mentioned by Deputy Harte.  The formula remains the same and I will look at it in a year's time.  The level of the lump sums will rise with the level of wages, subject to the ceiling, which is being raised very substantially from £2,500 to £5,000.</P>
    <P>I have referred to the building workers and I have made the point that this will be discussed in greater detail on Committee Stage.  The reduction in working hours from 21 to 20, brings the realistic half week into line with what is now the normal working week of 40 hours.  I do not propose at this stage to make any changes.</P>
    <P>Reference was made a number of times to the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Act and the Unfair Dismissals Act and to possible necessary amendments.  It would be extremely undesirable that we should contemplate amending those Acts under this legislation; it would only make its operation almost unintelligible and create considerable difficulty in interpretation.</P>
    <P>Some of the points mentioned related to difficulty in comprehending the existing provisions.  I agree that some are complicated.  However, I cannot agree to attempt, at this point, any partial consolidation. As I have said, I shall do something about that but it must be done in a well researched, safe complete way.  I hope to issue a guide book immediately this Bill is enacted, which will be very detailed, specific and clear, giving the necessary information so that the ordinary employee and, indeed, anyone, will be able readily and easily to understand it.  Section 7, on time off to look for work, has been referred to.  This is a new concept.  I do not agree with the comments made about difficulties being created; it does establish a right for reasonable time off to look for new employment or for training.  Both sides, I am sure, will have faults to find with the interpretation.  It could be difficult, perhaps, to decide or to interpret what specifically is legal.  I have said that the employer should be entitled to be informed by his employee what appointments he had and where he was seeking <Col N="510" /> further employment.  With a certain amount of common sense on both sides and with the goodwill which is so necessary, this is a helpful and desirable section.</P>
    <P>Sections 10 and 11 were referred to. Senator Harte said he would put down some amendments on these sections so we shall have an opportunity of going through them in greater detail on Committee Stage.  I should say that section 10, with respect to short time, provides definitions for divisions analogous to those governing time off.</P>
    <P>Short time is defined in section 11 (2) of the Principal Act as involving the reduction in weekly remuneration to less than half of normal.  By section 11 (3), which was inserted in the 1971 Act, this definition was extended to include reduction in hours of work to less than one half of normal.  I am satisfied that we shall have an opportunity of teasing this out in greater detail on Committee Stage and I welcome that opportunity.  I assure the House that the provision of this section is advantageous and helpful.  The same would apply to section 11 which deals with a situation of reduced working, or the remuneration not constituting statutory short time.  The amendment to this section 15 (2) (a), in effect, extends from four weeks to 52 weeks the period during which an employee may try out non-statutory short time without losing redundancy entitlement.  It certainly improves the situation.</P>
    <P>I had detailed discussions with the Senators, and I have carefully considered all the points raised and, indeed, I have conceded many.  As I have said, one must endeavour to balance the situation.</P>
    <P>Senator Conroy referred to the length of notice.  The two weeks referred to here are only for the purpose of the redundancy payments scheme.  The Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Act is obligatory and must be compiled with. The employer is obliged to give the notice to which the employee is entitled under that Act.  The Protection of Employment Act under the collective redundancy situation gives notice to trades unions, in order that consultations might take place on the threatened redundancy.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="511" /> Senator Harte referred to an untrained teacher situation.  The point he is making there refers to a particular case and I do not think we should legislate here for a particular case.  It arises from a controversial tribunal decision where an untrained teacher was replaced by a trained teacher.  The Act provides that a redundancy situation does exist where it is necessary that work be done in a different manner for which the employee is not sufficiently qualified or trained.  The tribunal held that in the case of an untrained teacher being replaced by a trained teacher a redundancy situation did not exist.  This is an isolated case. The Act is well worded and should not be tampered with as the result of an isolated case.  A tribunal might, in a similar case in future, decide differently.</P>
    <P>Senator Jago spoke on the penalty of reducing employers rebate from 60 to 40 per cent. for failure to give notice.  I think it was Deputy Mitchell in the other House who suggested to me that it was not severe enough.  In the case of a rebate, say, of £2,000 the fine for lack of notice could be £400, and £2,000 is a fairly heavy penalty.  If notice is not given, the 60 per cent is not granted; it is reduced to 40.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="512" /> Senator Mulcahy asked for some figures for other countries.  I am not too sure if they are comparable but he will be given the information requested. There was one point in the opening comment I made, that may be confusing. Mention was made that the figures varied from 3,000 to 13,000.  What, in fact, I said was that the figure reduced from about 13,000 in 1977 to less than 10,000 in 1978.  It was the first time since 1973 that the figure had been under 10,000.</P>
    <P>That sums up most of the points I wish to make in reply.  I hope the Senators will feel I have covered the situation and the points that were made. Again, I say that this Redundancy Payments Bill, 1979 updates and improves the redundancy payment situation, making many substantial and worthwhile improvements in the existing legislation.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
    <P>Committee Stage ordered for Wednesday, 14 March 1979.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 8.10 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 8 March 1979.</P>
