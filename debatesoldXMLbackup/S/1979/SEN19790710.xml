      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 3, after line 18, to add to the section the following new subsection:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="820" />&ldquo;(5)  This section shall cease to have effect from such date, if any, as the Assembly shall commence payments to representatives of the Assembly in respect of their membership of the Assembly.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment is self-explanatory. This miserable situation in which we find ourselves arises because of a deal that was done at the insistence of the British Prime Minister of the day at a European summit.  It is generally hoped that the European Assembly, or Parliament, in their wisdom, whenever they get round to the matter, will determine the payment of their own members as should have been the case in the first place.  The object of amendment No. 3 is to put a clear time limit on the operation of the relevant part of the Bill as an aid to both the Irish Government and the Irish members of the Assembly to say to all the relevant agencies, but most importantly the European Assembly, &ldquo;Will you please get on with the matter of determining the remuneration of your own members?&rdquo;  Subsection (5) relates to that point.  Subsection (6) in amendment No. 3 is a mechanism whereby the actual guillotine date, of 1 July 1981, can, by ministerial order, be a little extended. This formula is used in other circumstances and works quite satisfactorily.</P>
      <P>In this amendment we want to pressure the decision-making agencies to determine the question of the remuneration of Parliament members by the Parliament itself, quickly.  We wish to aid that pressure being kept up.  We do not wish to do that &mdash; and this is the point of subsection (6) &mdash; in such a way as would create embarrassment or difficulty. Subsection (6), to some extent, mitigates the rigorousness of the 1 July 1981 time-limit which is in the new suggested subsection (5).</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 7 of section 6 is consequent on amendment No. 3.  It simply means that the power of the Minister in making orders which occur in another part of the Bill, would also extend to the new subsection (6) of section 3.  Amendment No. 7 is simply consequential on the new subsection (6) in amendment No. 3.</P>

      <P>This legislation deals with the situation we find ourselves in, and we can only deal in such situations.  As regards amendments Nos. 2 and 3, which are basically questions of time limit on the provisions in section 2, I see no reason at all to change the provision as outlined in the Bill because it is difficult to legislate for what, at the moment, is a hypothetical situation.  If such a situation develops, Senators will be well aware that it is quite easy to amend the Act, much easier than what is provided in the second part of Senator Robinson's amendment which is extending it by ministerial order which is a cumbersome exercise which would not be the best, if that is the way it was intended.  As Senators are aware, the orders for such purposes have to be laid before the Oireachtas, for 21 sitting days of the Dáil and so on.  The system of annual orders would only give rise to a good deal of extra work without any real obvious benefits.  Not being in a position to accept amendments Nos 2 and 3, amendment No. 7 does not arise.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="822" /> In page 3, before section 3, to insert the following new section:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;3.&mdash; The Minister shall arrange for access to such research facilities as he considers necessary for representatives in the Assembly who have been elected or appointed thereto in the manner described in section 2 (1) of this Act.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Until the time of the direct elections the facilities of the Oireachtas were available to Members who had been in the European Parliament.  Indeed, this was an experience I had myself.  From the date of our accession on 1 January 1973 these members were nominated by the Oireachtas and were not directly elected. From the time of the direct elections it appeared that these facilities were not available to representatives in the Assembly who were elected.  I do not want to digress about the general quality of service of all kinds available to Members of the Oireachtas, but I want to confine the matter strictly to the elected representatives.  They face a new situation to the extent that their constituency is not the whole country, as it was for the nominated representatives, which was my own experience.  They have very large constituencies, much larger than the existing Dáil constituencies and very difficult to work.  In those circumstances, and in the added circumstance that they will receive the worst salaries of any European parliamentarians and have the greatest distances to travel both in sparsely populated areas domestically and in the large distances between Ireland and the places where the parliament sits, either in Strasbourg or Luxembourg, they will be supplementing the allowances which they obtain from the parliament on a flat rate basis out of a salary which is already the lowest salary of any European parliamentarian.  I will not go into things that were said from all sides on Second Stage, but this is a most unsatisfactory situation.</P>
    <P>I recognise that we cannot have a circumstance in which we vote a charge, but we are asking for access by all elected members to as much back-up as can be possibly given to them.  This is the more urgent in the case of one particular person &mdash; I refer to a member of the <Col N="823" /> European Parliament, Mr. T.J. Maher, who is not a Member of either House of the Oireachtas.  Pending a real salary being paid to these people, and pending the ending of this disgusting anomaly where there are three different rates within the Republic of Ireland, four different rates within the island of Ireland and where, apparently, Irish parliamentarians, members of the European Parliament, are considered to be the least valuable of European parliamentarians, we would like to see the Minister at his discretion arranging for access to the research facilities he considers necessary for the newly elected representatives to the Assembly.</P>
    <P>I might point out to the Minister that there is a matter of discretion in the phrase &ldquo;as he considers necessary&rdquo;. Since these research facilities currently exist and are there, there is not the matter of a new charge.  The object of this amendment is to try in what is hopefully a short transition period, to ensure that Irish members of the European Parliament can function at the best and highest possible level.  Since the salary matter has been resolved in such a rotten and unsatisfactory way, hopefully a temporary way, we feel that all possible aid from the Irish State should be given as an indication that we consider it a bad solution, that these people, as indeed Members of the Oireachtas, ought to be better sustained than they currently are in trying to carry out their work.</P>

      <P>In his reply could the Minister clarify what the current situation is, whether members of the European Parliament can avail of the ordinary facilities of the parliamentary office here, which has been the practice over the past six years?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Mrs. Hussey Mrs. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to speak in favour of this amendment.  This is only an attempt to strengthen the hand of the Irish members serving the European Parliament on behalf of this country.  We went through a very intense European election campaign, even though the electorate did not seem to feel very intense about it.  We have only 15 people there in a very large parliament of 410 members, and they will need extra help. <Col N="824" /> Without putting any charges on the Exchequer, we should examine every possible method to strengthen the Irish voice in Europe.  As Senator Keating said, the Irish representatives have ended up with an absolutely rotten salary compared with salaries being paid in the stronger countries in Europe.  It seems that the stronger nations will be getting stronger and the weaker nations getting weaker instead of the weaker nations catching up on the stronger ones.  The expression &ldquo;positive discrimination&rdquo; should be used to help our members in Europe.  I would just like to support the amendment very strongly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Dáil offices used to provide various secretarial services for the nominated members, including the booking of flights, arranging of connections, and so on, and the necessary staff time was made available to deal with these matters.  These services were given because the people concerned were basically Oireachtas delegates to the parliament.  Now the position is different. The present 15 are not designated by the Houses of the Oireachtas but are directly elected representatives to the European Parliament.  In these circumstances, the services mentioned are being withdrawn.</P>
      <P>Up to the present the Joint Committee have monitored the agenda for European Parliament meetings and provided briefings for the members.  The need for briefings is not expected to arise in a serious form until later in the year, in the autumn, when the European Parliament committees to which the Irish representatives are assigned will be known.  At that stage the entire matter can be reviewed.  It is understood, also, that briefings are given to the European Parliament representatives by the various political groups in Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The situation is that the European Parliament themselves are now, because the members are directly elected, duty bound to provide the facilities for their members.  I would like to point out that the allowances for secretarial, research for whatever purposes, paid to former nominated members of the European Parliament &mdash; and I am sure they will <Col N="825" /> continue and may even be improved &mdash; were of the order of £93.65 a month flat rate, portion of which is paid automatically to cover expenses incurred by the member in the exercise of his European mandate, plus £374.60 a month which must be accounted for, and which is to cover expenditure incurred in employing an assistant on the basis of a private contract.  A substantial amount of funds was available to previous members for such back-up and research facilities, in addition to what was provided by the House.</P>
    <P>As I said, I have no reason to doubt that those amounts of money will be available and will continue to be there for the newly elected members, and I am sure they will be improved.  The point I want to make quite clearly is that they are now directly elected members of the European Assembly and it is the duty of that Assembly to provide these research facilities and back-up services for their own members.  Therefore, the facilities provided by the House are being withdrawn, but the existing facilities, as they have been known to the previous members, can, I am sure, be availed of until such time in the autumn as it becomes clearer which facilities will be available from the European Assembly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is trying to have it both ways when he does not want to continue these facilities.  It is important that he has now clearly uttered the word, which people knew to be the fact in practice, that these facilities are being withdrawn.  When he is justifying the withdrawing of facilities he says it is the responsibility of the European Assembly to look after these costs.  If that is true, why is it not the responsibility of the European Assembly to pay the salaries of the members?  He cannot have it both ways.  These people are being paid less than anybody else to offer as good a service as any other European parliamentarians, a sum of £6,000 a year, and some of that has to go on salaries.  The continuing of this activity would have been a justification of further pressure for a proper solution to the problem of salaries.  I do not think <Col N="826" /> there is any saving of money because there are no moneys involved in this section. We are taking away a service which exists for other people.  We are simply denying an access which was given to the directly nominated members of the European Parliament.</P>
      <P>For the sake of a piece of bureaucratic tidiness we are wilfully diminishing the quality of service given by European parliamentarians.  This is a very retrograde thing to do.  I am very sorry the Minister in his wisdom did not see fit to accept this amendment.  I regret to say that I do not find his explanation satisfactory.  This is an important issue because all that we do ought to be concerned with two things, a proper solution to the salary problem and the provision of an environment in which these people can work properly.  In the life of this State we have never produced an environment where Members of the Oireachtas could work properly.  It was almost as if those with real control of the money and administration did not want the Oireachtas to work properly, because the facilities here are pathetic. Here, when we get a new start with a new Assembly which will have profoundly important effects for us, we are accepting a disadvantaged situation for our parliamentarians.  It is retrograde and it seems a violation of all the high promises and high aspirations.  I hope I will find enough support to divide the House on this because I do not find the Minister's rejection of this reasonable, practical and possible amendment satisfactory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyWest" hpid="Dr. West Dr. West">
      <NameTxt>Dr. West</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the arguments made by Senator Keating.  We should be as generous as possible towards our European parliamentary representatives. Whereas it may be argued that if we agree to supply some of the services and necessary back-up that our European representatives require, this will be an argument for the European Parliament not to offer the services, I do not believe that.  I think the European Parliament will offer services across the board and there is no guarantee that they will be sufficient for the needs of our representatives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="827" /> Senator Hussey made the point that we have a very small delegation in a very big parliament.  As everybody who has anything to do with the European system knows, all the delegates are absolutely flooded with documentation and it will require an army to sift through the documentation the representatives will get.  If we are not generous towards our representatives in Europe then their performance will match our lack of generosity.  Because we are a small country and because our representation in Europe is particularly small, we have to ensure that our men and women in Europe are well briefed.  Owing to this deal which is being discussed, our European representatives' salaries will be so ludicrous that we will have the same situation, only to a much worse extent, as exists in this House.  There are people who would be outstandingly good candidates for membership of either House of the Oireachtas who cannot afford to stand because the salaries are so ridiculous.  Most full-time Members of either House are losing money at the moment.  They give up their jobs and generally end up losing money.  If we are going to see the same sort of situation apply in Europe, and if we are not going to augment the ludicrous salaries with the best possible service for the people involved, then I think we should have our heads examined.  I strongly support this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government are not, and neither am I, trying to have it both ways, as Senator Keating said.  The question of the salary was a decision taken by the Council.  Heretofore the representatives in the European Parliament did not have a salary.  Therefore, provision had to be made to provide a salary and because of the situation we found ourselves in, we had to introduce this legislation to enable us to pay our representatives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards facilities, allowances, expenses and so on, no matter what kind of expense it might be &mdash; whether for travelling, subsistence, research or secretarial &mdash; the majority were provided by the European Assembly.  While the <Col N="828" /> amount provided by the Oireachtas was important, it was not in any way elaborate.  Everybody will agree on that. As I said, it is not easy at this stage to envisage what arrangements will be made by the new, directly elected European Assembly regarding these questions of research and facilities.  Until that becomes known, there is no necessity for us to legislate for what might be a hypothetical situation.  As I said, the matter can be reviewed.</P>
    <P>In the event of the Assembly not providing these facilities, under section 3 as it now stands, the provision of research facilities and back-up services involves expenses.  As there are only 15 people involved I assume that if such facilities were to be provided they would be provided on a cash basis, as an allowance towards the cost of the provision of these services.  If that situation arises section 3 as it now stands could cover that.  Section 3 reads:</P>
    <P>The Minister may, if he thinks fit, by order provide for the payment of allowances for expenses to representatives in the Assembly who have been elected or appointed thereto in the manner described in section 2 (1) of this Act.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Mrs. Hussey Mrs. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said we do not yet know what will be provided by the European Assembly in the line of research facilities or allowances.  It seems to me that Ireland has a special case to make for positive discrimination for our members.  Do we have any intention of making representations before decisions are made about what research facilities will be available, considering Irish members live very far away from where the Parliament sits and have a lot of extra travelling?  Will we be passive about this or have we any function at all in asking for the kind of facilities Senator Keating and Senator Robinson and some of us feel will be very necessary for our members?</P>

      <P>It is their duty to see that in the Assembly of which they are directly elected members, they are not discriminated against.  The same applies to any Member of the Dáil or Seanad.  It is the Parliament who will make these decisions and the representatives from Ireland, or any other country, will be <Col N="830" /> there to ensure that they are provided with adequate facilities.</P>
      <P>Travel expenses are paid and quite liberal expenses have been paid in the past and I have no reason to doubt that other allowances will not be maintained, continued or even improved.  There is no question of us discriminating against the Irish representatives, and I am quite positive that the 15 members from Ireland will ensure that the European Assembly when they make their decision about all kinds of facilities will not allow themselves to be discriminated against.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomJFitzpatrick" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Tourism and Transport (Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick, Dublin South-Central) Thomas J. (Dublin South-Central) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Tourism and Transport (Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Dublin South-Central</i>): The main purpose of the Bill is to give statutory effect to an agreement dated 12 July 1977 between CIE, Cork Corporation and Cork Harbour Commissioners which provides for the permanent closure of the navigation spans on the Brian Boru and Clontarf Bridges in Cork city and for the transfer of ownership of the bridges from CIE to Cork Corporation.  In addition the Bill also makes certain provisions in relation to the members of the Board and the general manager of CIE.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Brian Boru and Clontarf Bridges, which span the north and south channels of the river Lee in Cork city were constructed under the provisions of the Cork City Railways Act, 1906.  The <Col N="832" /> bridges were so constructed so as to be able to carry road as well as railway traffic.  In addition the Act provided that the bridges were to have opening spans to allow for the passage of vessels along the river.</P>
    <P>In 1948 CIE, Cork Corporation and Cork Harbour Commissioners concluded an agreement in accordance with the provisions of section 134 of the Transport Act, 1944, which provided that the cost of working, control, management and maintenance of the bridges would be shared equally between the three parties, subject to the contribution by Cork Harbour Commissioners being payable only so long as any portion of the bridges continued to be moveable.</P>
    <P>It is 1961 since the navigation spans of Clontarf Bridge were last opened and 1963 in the case of Brian Boru Bridge. Any craft now using the portions of quay upstream from the bridges would be small and would not require the opening of the navigation spans.  Cork Harbour Commissioners agree that the opening spans are no longer needed.</P>
    <P>In recent years it became apparent that the provision of a stronger and more durable type of decking on the bridges was necessary in order to improve the traffic flow over the route, and in an effort to alleviate the severe traffic problems caused by the necessity of frequent repairs to the existing bridge surfaces. The operation of trains over the bridges on the line between Albert Quay Station and Glanmire Station, which had been used by CIE for the transfer of certain freight traffic, became increasingly difficult and the line has not been used by CIE since 1976.  The freight traffic is now transported by road vehicles direct to Glanmire Station for onward distribution on the rail network.</P>
    <P>Following consultation between CIE, Cork Corporation and Cork Harbour Commissioners, CIE prepared proposals to have the bridges converted to fixed bridges and to have the railway lines removed completely.  The three parties have concluded an agreement dated 12 July 1977 to give effect to these proposals and to provide for transfer of ownership of the bridges to Cork Corporation. <Col N="833" /> The implementation of the agreement is subject to the enactment of this Bill.</P>
    <P>A copy of the agreement is set out in the Schedule to the Bill and, as Senators will note from the agreement, CIE will convert the bridges to fixed bridges within six months and will remove the railway tracks and other equipment from the bridges within 12 months of the passing of the legislation.</P>
    <P>Pending completion of these works the cost of maintaining the bridges will be borne equally by CIE and Cork Corporation. Cork Harbour Commissioners will be relieved of any obligation to contribute to the maintenance of the bridges from the date of enactment of the Bill.</P>
    <P>When CIE have completed the works, and on payment by the board to Cork Corporation of a sum not exceeding £12,000 towards the cost of providing a more durable road surface on the bridges, ownership of the bridges will be transferred from CIE to Cork Corporation who will then become exclusively responsible for their maintenance.  Cork Corporation will indemnify CIE and Cork Harbour Commissioners against any possible claims for compensation for loss of private rights arising from conversion of the bridges to fixed bridges.</P>
    <P>In addition to the provisions concerning the Cork bridges, the Bill makes certain provisions in relation to the general manager and members of the Board of CIE.</P>
    <P>For some time now it has been Government policy to make statutory provision for the control, in a broad sense, of the remuneration of chief executives of State-sponsored bodies.  Section 7 of the Bill will extend this control to the chief executive of CIE.  The Board of CIE will be free to fix the remuneration of the chief executive within the range approved by the Minister for Tourism and Transport with the consent of the Minister for the Public Service. The Report of the Review Body on Higher Remuneration in the Public Sector dated 11 July 1972 recommended ranges of remuneration for the chief executives of State-sponsored bodies. These ranges have been updated by the <Col N="834" /> addition of increases in pay agreed under the various successive national pay agreements.</P>
    <P>Every member of the Board of CIE holds office, under section 7(2) of the Transport Act, 1950, on terms and conditions fixed by the Government at the &ldquo;time of his appointment&rdquo;.  Because of this latter phrase it is not open to the Government to alter the terms and conditions of a member of the board without his resignation and re-appointment on revised terms and conditions.  Hence, to apply the normal approved increases in remuneration it has been necessary for the chairman or other members of the board to resign and be re-appointed by the Government at the higher rate.  To resolve this legal difficulty it is proposed in section 8 of the Bill to amend the existing legislation by the deletion of the words &ldquo;at the time of his appointment&rdquo;; in addition provision is being made for the fixing of the terms and conditions by the Minister for Tourism and Transport with the consent of the Minister for the Public Service rather than by the Government.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MylesStaunton" hpid="Mr. Staunton Mr. Staunton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Staunton</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the introduction of this Bill by the Minister.  It is quite uncontentious and, as in Dáil Éireann, it has our support.  Obviously there are serious problems in Cork. Deputy Barry referred to these in his speech in Dáil Éireann and he knows much more about the problems there than I do.  There are problems and anomalies in the holding open of navigation rights on these bridges in circumstances in which these rights have not been used for some years.  When the structure of the bridge is such that it has to be held open for navigation rights it leads to serious maintenance problems in a city in which the traffic situation is very congested and quite unsatisfactory. The introduction of this Bill is probably overdue and the arrangement made by CIE, Cork Corporation and Cork Harbour Commissioners for the carrying out of what has to be done seems very sensible and rational.  It is uncontentious and has our support.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second section of the Bill is quite a different matter in the sense that it <Col N="835" /> does not relate to the first topic.  It is also very sensible and it is an example of the archaic workings of Parliament in this country that this has not been updated until now.  In this age of inflation and in the light of the problems we have been having it is ludicrous that we are operating under the Transport Act, 1950 under which every member of the Board of CIE holds office on terms and conditions fixed by the Government at the time of his appointment.  The position whereby resignation and re-appointment is necessary to comply with that Act is unsatisfactory.  The anomaly is being corrected and also has our support.</P>

      <P>It was with a certain regret and nostalgia that I read this Bill.  It has, of course, my unqualified support but the provision for the permanent closure of the navigation spans of the Brian Boru and Clontarf Bridges and for the transfer of the ownership of the bridges from CIE to Cork Corporation brings my mind back to the times when we were youngsters living not very far away from Cork city and we always envied the lads who happened to be in Cork when either of the bridges was opened.  I can remember the thrill I got the very first day I saw one of those bridges open.  Even though the bridges have not been opened, one for 18 years and the other for 16 years, still there was always the hope that some day a miracle would happen and they would be opened again.  However, time marches on and now we are to have permanent bridges. Quite a lot of good will come from that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister stated that CIE have to convert the bridges to fixed bridges within six months and that they will remove the tracks and other equipment from the bridges within 12 months of the passing of the legislation.  That is something that is crying out to be done because both of these bridges, as far as traffic is concerned, are most unsatisfactory. The surfaces are very rickety and certainly do not do good to cars passing over them.  These bridges present a grave hazard to cyclists or pedestrians and I always have to make excuses to people from abroad about the bad condition of <Col N="836" /> the roads.  I hope that CIE and all concerned will make a determined effort to get those bridges properly surfaced so that they will not be a hazard for traffic and will add to the good looks of our city.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two totally different matters in this Bill.  I said to the Minister that this Bill was not going to hurt but I am not sure now.  On the first part, a matter of regulating bridges in Cork, there can be no disagreement.  We may ask why it took so long because all of us have recollections of the situation being unsatisfactory on those bridges and the traffic circulation in Cork being bad for a long time.  Anything that puts that right is welcome and nobody will oppose it.</P>
      <P>Section 7 represents a total change of gear, to a completely different subject which is the remuneration of the chief officer of CIE, or whatever he is called at any given moment.  The Minister stated:</P>
      <P>For some time now it has been Government policy to make statutory provision for the control, in a broad sense, of the remuneration of the chief executives of State-sponsored bodies. Section 7 of the Bill will extend this control to the chief executive of CIE.</P>
      <P>I had a great deal of experience of the mess, hassle and chaos this broad Government policy created during my time as Minister.  I bitterly but unsuccessfully opposed its implementation. I wonder with a Bill such as this whether we should have the Minister for Finance and the Minister for the Public Service in front of us rather than someone from the Department of Tourism and Transport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me very briefly say why I believe there is a mess and what I believe is desirable.  This issue of the remuneration of the chief executives of semi-State bodies wastes more time between Government Departments than any other piece of trivia.  It certainly did in my time and it will not stop now.  It may be broad Government policy and it is certainly narrow and rigorous Department <Col N="837" /> of Finance policy to control in the most minute and precise sense the remuneration the chief executives of State-sponsored bodies.  I am a passionate defender of the State sector in our economy.  I want to see it bigger and to see it extend into other areas.  But I want that on very specific conditions.</P>
    <P>I believe in the concept of a national enterprise board which separates the semi-State companies directly from Departments because there ought to be something intervening between those semi-State bodies and the individual Ministers to which they are currently attached. There should be a filtering mechanism so that there is not an effort to politicise the activities of these companies, and to ensure that there is not an extension of civil service attitudes &mdash; and particularly Department of Finance attitudes &mdash; to those companies.  For us to be proud of those companies they must be excellently run.  The condition of their being excellently run is that they have the best chief executives available.  To get such executives we must pay the going market price.</P>
    <P>In the case of NET I will give the example of somebody managing with immense vigour, passion and skill a huge semi-State enterprise with enormous investments who was being paid a most miserable and shameful salary.  I was ashamed of what he was being paid and we had endless hassles about it.  This measure extends attitudes into CIE which are better kept out and to the extent that they have already pervaded CIE they are better chased out again. The matter is perfectly simple.  There should not be this Government policy to control in a broad sense or any other sense the remuneration of the chief executive. There should be a board of people who are dismissible.  If they do something foolish and give a man too much money they should be fired by a Minister.  They know they are fireable; they know they are expendable; they know they are appointed on the condition that they behave reasonably; and then we should trust them.  There is paternalism by the State as well as paternalism by the Church, by fathers of <Col N="838" /> families and by everybody else in this country.  It is a stifling thing.  This is retrograde.  The chief executive of CIE, who should be the best transport executive we can find, should be paid the going rate for the job as determined by the market place.  If that sounds off coming from a socialist it is nonetheless something that I believe passionately to be necessary if we are to have a good administration. I am glad to have the opportunity of putting that on the record.</P>
    <P>Obviously it is desirable to end the anomaly of the appointment subject to the conditions at any given moment whereby there is the ludicrous situation of a whole body of people retiring and being appointed under new conditions. No reasonable person would oppose those provisions in the Bill.</P>
    <P>I am not speaking to this Minister at all.  I am using this platform in the Seanad to speak to all those people who form policy in regard to the efficient administration of the State sector, of so called semi-State companies.  They are really State companies.  I am speaking out of my own experience about the immense amount of wasted time and ill-will that has been generated through the State companies.  I am speaking most of all to the Minister for Finance.  I do not expect him to listen now but this is a debate that will have to be continued and resolved in another way because we will never get the excellence we know to be possible in State companies and that the nation requires and expects, if we do not pay the best people we can find the going rate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ValentineJago" hpid="Mr. Jago Mr. Jago">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jago</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to refer mainly to the first part of the Bill and its relation to the Cork traffic problem.  As everybody knows, Cork has a serious traffic problem and that is partly caused by the fact that the river Lee divides into two channels when going through the city. To ease the problem, Cork requires a lot of bridges and is very much behind in the number of bridges which it has in relation to traffic.  It is so far behind that the two bridges we are talking about built in 1906 are still known to some people in Cork as &ldquo;the new bridges&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As explained in the Minister's speech, <Col N="839" /> these two bridges have been involved with three different bodies.  Because they had to be opening bridges to allow shipping to go up, Cork Harbour Commissioners are involved.  Because CIE had a connection between the Bandon section and the Glanmire Road section, they had to have railways across the bridges. Thirdly, because of city traffic Cork Corporation entered into it.  Those two bridges are an essential part of the Cork traffic system at the moment.  If either of those bridges went out of commission, whatever mess the Cork traffic is in now, it would come to a complete standstill without an alternative being provided.  It is urgent for Cork city that this Bill be put into law as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>As soon as this legislation is passed the railway tracks will be taken up and a proper decking can be put in to replace the present timber decking.  The superstructure which is the lifting part of the bridge can be taken down.  Plans are ready for all this to be done.  Alongside one of those bridges a bailey bridge is already constructed to take over.  The bridge cannot be put out of action to repair or alter it until this legislation goes through.  It is urgent and I would ask all Members of the House to give it their approval immediately.</P>
    <P>If we cannot get those two bridges repaired and keep the traffic flowing while the work is being done we cannot ease the traffic problem.  The plan after that is to build two more new bridges in the city to cross the river and, lower down the harbour, either a high level bridge or a tunnel.  The money has been passed for a study to be made of this and we are very anxious that this should go ahead.  To enable these bridges to become the sole property of Cork Corporation so that they can be repaired and adjusted to keep the traffic going for the time being we are very anxious that this measure should be enacted as soon as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyWest" hpid="Dr. West Dr. West">
      <NameTxt>Dr. West</NameTxt>
      <P>There are four separate points here.  In connection with the bridges there is the problem of giving up the navigation rights.  There is the second problem of pulling up the rail lines.  Then there are the two problems, the <Col N="840" /> remuneration of the chief executive of CIE, and matters dealing with the other board members.</P>
      <P>I do not think anybody could have an objection to cancelling the navigation rights connected with these two bridges. They have not been open for such a long time that if either of them were opened it would collapse.  I walk over these bridges often enough and they are pretty &ldquo;shook&rdquo; at the moment.  Since there is virtually no navigation in that part of the Lee by reasonably sized boats nobody could object to the cancelling of the navigating rights.</P>
      <P>I am not quite so sure about pulling up the railway lines.  It seems that one could easily resurface the bridges and make them perfectly stable.  I do not think either of them is stable at the moment; they are both in a dangerous condition. One could incorporate railway lines.  These railway lines have been important in the past and they could be important again.  I would like the Minister to say something about the state of the Albert Quay railway station.  A great deal hinges on what CIE plan for this station.  This particular piece of railway line connects the two main stations in Cork.  Glanmire station is the one which everybody knows because it is the Cork station.  Albert Quay station has not been used in the normal sense of a railway for a number of years since the west Cork line was closed down.  It is used as a goods yard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am always very suspicious about the proposal to close down railway lines, particularly when it means rooting them up.  There are a number of people even in CIE who would like to get back the Harcourt Street line.  I do not think we should give up our railway lines and give up the right of way there without serious consideration.  Senator Jago has talked about the Cork traffic problems.  The only people who will solve the Cork traffic problems will be the Arabs by putting a squeeze on the oil.  Cork traffic problems, bridges or no bridges, are pretty insoluble.  The thought that resurfacing these bridges can do much to affect Cork traffic problems is an illusion. Senator Jago is quite right in saying that if either of the bridges went out <Col N="841" /> of commission then it would make the traffic problems worse.  He did not say that if we re-surface these bridges it would make the Cork traffic problem any better.  I do not think it would.</P>
    <P>We should know something more about the situation regarding the future use of Albert Quay station before we give up the railway line connecting the two stations.  If it is to be used as a goods depot then I do not think it is enough for the Minister to say that the goods which are in railway trucks in Albert Quay station can be then put on the road, on a roadrail or truck, and pulled across to the Glanmire Station.  That will cause a great deal of loss and expense.  I do not see that the preservation of the railway line between the two stations really causes a problem.  There have been problems caused by goods trains running at peak traffic times.  That is only a matter of administration.  All one has to do is say that if this line is to remain in working order then there should be no traffic movement on the line except between the hours of, say, 2 a.m. and 8 a.m. That would seem to me to be an easy solution to that problem.  I am not falling over myself with enthusiasm when I hear that we are closing down another railway line.</P>
    <P>The situation regarding petrol and petroleum products and their availability in the future looks pretty grim.  It is getting grimmer every day if one can judge from the newspapers.  This may mean that a considerable portion of both passenger and goods traffic will be forced back from the road onto the railway, which is a much more economic user of petroleum products.  This would be a very good thing.</P>
    <P>We should be thinking about legislation which would ensure that certain types of traffic could be carried entirely by rail, particularly traffic which may have some problems in terms of dangerous chemicals.  They are much safer going by rail than by road. Therefore I view with some dismay a proposal to close down yet another railway line.  It is absolutely clear from the Bill that there is no intention of ever having a rail link between these two stations <Col N="842" /> again.  I oppose that.</P>
    <P>The argument has been perfectly made for making these bridges into fixed bridges but I do not see why the rail line could not be incorporated.  It could be done properly and would not affect the traffic flow.  Railway lines in the middle of the road always affect cyclists and make life slightly more dangerous for them but I do not think many cyclists or pedestrians have been killed on this particular stretch of railway line over the past 20 or even 50 years.  I do not think these lines cause any danger whatever, in a realistic sense, to the public.  I am against the closing of railway lines and against the closing of this particular railway line, unless CIE have decided to dispense with the Albert Quay station altogether.  Surely if they had decided to do that the Minister would have told us. I am opposed to the provision for removing the railway lines.</P>
    <P>The two other provisions at the end of the Bill concern the Board members of CIE and their remuneration.  Along with Senator Keating I have no objection whatever to that.  It is a quite minor administrative change and will affect nobody.  But I am delighted that he has protested against this provision in a very vigorous way and obviously with a great deal of feeling coming from his experience as Minister for Industry and Commerce.  Whenever I see this in a Bill I protest against this business of &ldquo;screwing&rdquo;&mdash; that is what it is &mdash; the chief executive of a semi-State body.  This is a Government policy.  Which Government originated this policy, I would like to know.  I am not trying to score party political points, but I think it is a disastrous policy that the chief executives of semi-State bodies should be pushed down.  We know the level they are being pushed down to&mdash;they are being pushed down to the level of the secretaries of the Departments involved.  I think Senator Keating will bear me out in that.  It is essentially &mdash; I do not like saying it &mdash; a question of jealousy on behalf of the senior civil servants who do not want the chief executives of semi-State bodies paid more than they are getting.  I think that this is ridiculous; it is a petty point. <Col N="843" /> The man who makes it most clearly and most vigorously and most often is John Healy.  He has been at this for years. When he talks about the permanent Government of the country he means the civil servants.</P>
    <P>I am totally and utterly against this provision.  I have protested against it on many occasions.  I am delighted to see that Senator Keating is taking such a strong line and it obviously comes from his experiences.  He said it was from his experiences, as Minister for Industry and Commerce.  He is a socialist; I have often heard him putting forward strong socialist views.  I think this view is not blindly socialist; I think it is a very straightforward, pragmatic view.  If you have State corporations and if you want your State corporations to perform as well as private corporations, you must get them managed by the best people and the most important person is the chief executive.  When the State or semi-State bodies were started originally the board had freedom to pay the chief executive the salary that was appropriate, the going rate at the time.  I think that to take away this freedom from the boards of semi-State bodies is absolutely wrong. There is no justification for it. Everybody knows what has happened to the Devlin Report; it went out the window years ago.  One or two small sections were implemented by somebody who wanted to get somebody else.  This is one of the most pernicious parts of the Devlin Report and I think that the chief executive of a State-sponsored body should be paid what is necessary and what is determined by the market.  If we do not do this, if we adhere to the provision in section 7 of this Bill, what is going to happen?  We are going to see people leap-frogging from senior positions in the civil service into the senior positions in the State-sponsored bodies.  The reason for that is &mdash; not that I have anything against the civil servants at all &mdash; that the people from the private sector will find the salary conditions too unattractive to even offer themselves.</P>
    <P>I think it is a disasterous policy and I think it is an attempt which can be seen in other spheres of operation of semi-State bodies to haul the semi-State <Col N="844" /> bodies back into the civil service net.  I can see it going on at the moment.  I have protested against it ever since I have been a Member of this House and I will continue to protest against it.  I am very encouraged to hear Senator Keating say that the fight against this particular piece of Government policy must go on.  I am glad to find him such a strong and convinced ally.  I wonder who started this whole racket.  For example, I would like to hear Senator Hillery's views on this particular item.  Senator Hillery is a Professor of Business Studies or a senior business academic.  Could he justify the policy in section 7?  I am not asking him to, because I do not think he would and I do not think he would try to.  I do not think it is justifiable on any economic grounds, grounds of efficiency or on the grounds that we must get the best people to run our semi-State bodies.</P>
    <P>I have said this before; we were fortunate at the time that a number of these bodies were started &mdash; I do not know if it applies to this particular one, but it certainly applies to others &mdash; that we did get people to run our early semi-State bodies who were outstanding, who had a commitment, and who got them off to a flying start.  We are gradually whittling away their position and hauling them back into the net.  I will continue to protest against this particular section and this sort of provision and I am delighted that someone with as much experience in Government as Senator Keating also feels it necessary to register a strong protest.  I hope that something more will come out of this, because it is about time this sort of nonsense stopped. I do not fall over myself to welcome this Bill; I think two out of the four provisions are unobjectionable on any grounds and the other two are objectional. So, I cannot join with the other Members of the House in cheering this piece of legislation.</P>
    <P>I find the removal of rail lines to be very serious.  There are now a number of railways which we would fall over ourselves to put back if we could, Harcourt Street being the main one.  As soon as CIE closed that line down &mdash; I was on the last train and I got a few souvenirs &mdash; the permanent way was sold <Col N="845" /> off.  They cannot get it back.  I think that policy was short-sighted and I think this policy here may be equally short-sighted. I should like to hear the Minister say what is the proposal for the Albert Quay station.  If it is to be kept as an operational goods station or depot then I think that we should not give up the railway line.</P>
    <P>I think we should insist that the railway line be retained.  I do not think it would affect the new bridge at all, not one bit.  I do not know if you can do a job on both of them as they stand: I think they will both have to be knocked down and new bridges built because they are in such a bad state.  Senator Jago thinks otherwise but they are pretty bad. No doubt the whole thing could be revamped and the railway lines could be retained and I think that is what should be done if CIE intend to retain the Albert Quay station.  So, I would like the Minister to say what is to be the future use of Albert Quay station before I pass any judgment on this particular section of the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Tourism and Transport (Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Dublin South-Central</i>): First, I would like to thank Senators for their constructive contributions.  I think by and large there is no objection by any Senator as regards the permanent closure of the bridges.  It has been the decision of the three parties concerned they will serve no useful purpose in the future.  As regards urban traffic, we know the present position.  Anyone who has any association with Cork knows perfectly well that there is utter confusion and chaos there.  I often think that traffic in Cork has become even more congested than in Dublin.  It had become obvious that the repair of these bridges which was necessitated quite often, was causing further congestion, causing a build-up of traffic from time to time.  Seeing that there was no useful purpose served by them I think the decision taken by the three parties concerned was the right one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator West is concerned about the Albert Quay station and the removal of <Col N="846" /> the railway line.  That seems to be the only question that has arisen here &mdash; whether it is going to be used again.  The information I have is that CIE ceased rail operations between Glanmire and Albert Quay stations in 1976.  Prior to this fertilisers had been carried on the line.  CIE now transfer the fertilisers direct from Gouldings factory to the goods depot at Glanmire station for distribution from the rail network. Albert Quay is now used as a warehouse depot and a garage for freight vehicles. So, we can see that Albert Quay will not be used any longer in transporting fertiliser by railway for which it was mainly used.  From now on it will be used as a warehouse and a garage for freight vehicles. Discussions have taken place with CIE as regards its future development.  It has been decided that it will serve no useful purpose from now on as regards having the railway line on the bridges we are speaking about here.  I hope that that satisfies Senator West's concern about this particular aspect of the Bill.  The general feeling in Cork among people in commercial life is that these bridges had been causing a certain amount of disruption to traffic and that it is desirable that the measures which are contained in this Bill should be enacted.</P>
    <P>The only contentious part of the Bill which other Senators have mentioned is section 7 which provides for control of the chief executive's remuneration.  This is a policy which was introduced in 1974. It operated during the Coalition Government's term of office.  A number of semi-State bodies, as it arose down through the years, as legislation necessitated it, were brought within the umbrella.  In addition to those who were previously in, the ESB, Bord na Móna, Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann and Nítrigin Éireann, over a period Aer Lingus, Aer Rianta, the B &amp; I, the Agricultural Credit Corporation, the Racing Board and so on, were brought in.  This has been a policy of successive Governments.  I believe, and I share this view with Senators who have said it, that semi-State bodies should be able to recruit the best top executives. They play an important part in the commercial life of the country.  I am quite convinced about that concerning the chief executives.  Every semi-State <Col N="847" /> body is an important body.  Only the best is good enough in my opinion for the chief executives of such bodies.</P>
    <P>Remunerations are controlled to a certain extent within the guidelines of the Devlin Report but they are not all the same.  They vary from semi-State body to semi-State body as I am sure Senator Keating and other Senators are fully aware, according to their size and the contribution which they make to the economy.  Whether this matter should be looked at again to see whether there is sufficient latitude, I do not know, but I do think that some type of overall control is desirable to ensure that one semi-State body should not get completely out of line.  Senator Keating did say that if you have a board appointed this should not happen.  This is a policy that has obtained for a considerable length of time, since before 1974, and each semi-State body, as the occasion arises on Bills such as this, is brought within the guidelines of the Devlin Report.  This is a situation that must be looked at from time to time because we know the important part these chief executives play.  The Government will keep this in mind to ensure that each of the bodies will be in the best position as regards the recruitment of the best personnel to those semi-State bodies.</P>
    <P>There is another provision in the Bill to remedy an anomaly &mdash; this should have been changed but it is not all that easy to get Bills through quickly &mdash; as regards the resignation of the chief executive or former Chairman of CIE.  At the time of his appointment it was difficult to give him any further remuneration or any further increase without this nonsensical practice of his having to resign and be reappointed again by the Government.  That is something that is welcomed by all and it will get over that anomaly which has existed for a considerable length of time.</P>
    <P>I have nothing further to add and I thank Senators for their contributions.  The quicker we get this Bill through the Seanad the sooner CIE and Cork Corporation can begin the work of removing the railway tracks and getting the <Col N="848" /> bridges properly finished so that traffic can move freely again.  I would be obliged if the Senators would see their way to give all Stages of this Bill today.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
    <P>Agreed to take remaining Stages today.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Wyse)</NameTxt>
      <P>The trustee savings banks, although they are private bodies, conduct their business and are supervised by the State in accordance with the Trustee Savings Banks Acts. The Trustee Savings Banks Act, 1863, which was a consolidating Act, is, with certain amending Acts, the governing statute.  Amending Acts passed in 1958 and 1965 brought the legislation up to date in such respects as then seemed necessary.  The question of consolidating the legislation is being examined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At present there are four trustee savings banks operating in the State &mdash; in Dublin, Cork, Waterford and Limerick. A fifth bank &mdash; the Monaghan Savings <Col N="849" /> Bank &mdash; operated until 1976 when it amalgamated with Dublin.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this Bill is to remove a doubt which has arisen in connection with the application of section 3 of the Trustee Savings Banks Act, 1965.  That section provides as follows:</P>
    <P>The trustees of a trustee savings bank may, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, undertake any business which is, in the opinion of that Minister calculated to encourage thrift and within the financial capacity of the bank.</P>
    <P>Under this section the trustee savings banks were authorised to grant short-term personal loans &mdash; for periods of up to five years &mdash; and bridging loans to depositors.</P>
    <P>In connection with a proposal to extend the personal loans service to include long-term housing loans the law officers advised that there was no objection in law to the use of section 3 of the Trustee Savings Banks Act, 1965 for that purpose. As announced in this year's budget the trustee savings banks have been authorised to grant house mortgage loans.</P>
    <P>One of the savings banks was advised by counsel that in his view the 1965 Act did not empower the Minister for Finance to sanction loan schemes and that new legislation was required.  The matter was referred to the Attorney General who now advises amending legislation.</P>
    <P>The Bill amends section 3 of the 1965 Act by providing that any business sanctioned by the Minister for Finance under that section may include the making of loans, including house mortgage loans, and the using of depositors' funds for that purpose.  For the protection of the savings banks it is necessary that the amendment should have retrospective effect to cover loan schemes sanctioned to date.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MylesStaunton" hpid="Mr. Staunton Mr. Staunton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Staunton</NameTxt>
      <P>We have no objection to this Bill going through the Seanad as introduced by the Minister.  I wonder why it is, in fact, even necessary to introduce <Col N="850" /> it in the Seanad but the legal mind may have another way of looking at it.  If the trustees, under section 3, of which we are speaking, with the consent of the Minister, could undertake any business which is, in the opinion of that Minister, calculated to encourage thrift and is within the financial capacity of the bank, and if to date under that section trustee banks were in a position to grant short-term personal loans and bridging loans to depositors within that definition, I wonder whether the Bill is, in fact, necessary and if the question of housing loans, which is a laudable aspect of lending, could not be covered by it. But legal advice is legal advice and presumably we are guided by it.  For that reason, we support the Bill as introduced by the Minister.  Apart from the matter of the Bill it is obviously encouraging to see the trustee savings banks going into the home loan area because it is an area which has been, at times, starved for finance.  Any source of funds which is using its funds for that purpose is performing a very useful national service and I commend the fact that they are lending money for housing at this time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill providing as it does a valuable supplement to available resources for house mortgage loans.  The Bill provides an opening for the trustee savings banks to enter the longer-term end of the lending market which was not heretofore available to them.  Customers in these banks tend, I think, to be small depositors.  By lending for house purchase to their own customers, especially in these days of very high house prices, the trustee savings banks will be providing a particularly valuable service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course, in order to be able to make loans these banks must be able to attract deposits and there is an increasing consciousness of the level of interest rates prevailing at any particular time among the investing public, be they large or small depositors.  This implies that the interest rates offered by the trustee savings banks to their depositors must be competitive which, in turn, means that the consent for changed interest rates must be readily forthcoming from the Department of Finance lest the trustee savings <Col N="851" /> banks be put at a disadvantage in relation to other deposit-taking institutions.</P>
    <P>I welcome this amending legislation and view the power now conferred on the trustee savings banks to make house mortgage loans as one more enlightened measure contained in this year's budget.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FlorenceCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>I also welcome very much this amending legislation and, indeed, I think that we should go even further.  I think that the savings banks have shown themselves to be responsible, have shown themselves to be progressive and, indeed, in some cases far more progressive than their counterparts, the commercial banks.  We in Cork are fortunate in having a long standing trustee savings bank in the Cork Savings Bank under the general managership of the former county manager, Michael Conlon.  I think it is this type of enlightened recruitment of staff that is going to make these institutions a very formidable force in the future and, indeed, a very important part of our whole lending structure.  I think also that it is no harm to have a little more competition among the banks.  If further legislation was required in order to make, if you like, the market more competitive for the existing banks, I think that would be a good thing generally for the people of the country. Of course, nothing but good can emanate from this incursion into the house loan business because, as we all know, the basis of a successful industrial economy is the building trade.  If we have an institution like the savings bank that will further encourage people to purchase their own houses, I think the spin-off from that will be enormous.  I welcome this Bill very much and advocate, if necessary going even further to make the savings banks more available to more people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>In general, this Bill is to be welcomed but the principal objective of the change is in relation to the availability of funds for people to buy houses.  I think that is referred to in the circulated text of the Minister's speech and that is something that warrants comment.  We see a circumstance where <Col N="852" /> increasing competition with the existing loan sources is advantageous to those persons who are determined to obtain a loan so that they can purchase a house. But we see a circumstance now in regard to the general purchasing of houses which is extraordinarily unsatisfactory because the rate of escalation in the price of houses far exceeds the rate of general inflation and that rate of general inflation is high and accelerating.</P>
      <P>The second point is that interest rates at this time in Ireland, for a variety of reasons, are exceedingly high and it is clear even in the published lists in the newspapers that the banks and other credit institutions are bidding for the moneys that lenders may possess.  Simply increasing the availability of home loans by a measure like this will have the result of tying people to buy dear houses, which are initially dear if the purchase itself is a dear purchase, but in addition the interest rate is very high. Therefore, what is happening is that an increasing section of the population are being encouraged, through measures like this, to tie themselves into committing a third or more of their income for the whole of their active lives.</P>
      <P>I am certainly not opposing a measure like this, but I ask myself whether, in the absence of other policy it is prudent or satisfactory.  It seems that the policy of this Government is to encourage the private sector to make the funds available and to encourage the private sector to provide the houses.  That is a movement away from local authority housing which in historical retrospect will be seen as disadvantageous to the people as a whole.  It will be seen as a movement which tied up a very large and growing proportion of the total incomes of families in the purchase of accommodation, a liability from which they do not escape during the whole of their working lives.  It is very unsatisfactory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Labour Party's approval of this Bill should not be seen, in any sense, as approving the policy of the present Government, either in regard to the controlling of houses, or the building cost, or the price of building land, or of approving their policy in shifting towards private satisfaction of people's housing <Col N="853" /> needs through the market place, or, indeed, approval of their policy in regard to interest rates, which are now at absolutely astronomical and immensely burdensome levels.  Through the provision of loans by organisations like trustee savings banks, they will bear most heavily on that sector of the community least able to contend with those increased costs.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasWhitaker" hpid="Dr. Whitaker Dr. Whitaker">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Whitaker</NameTxt>
      <P>The public spirited and progressive work of trustee savings banks deserves our commendation and I am happy to see this Bill confirm that their business may extend to the giving of personal loans of a long-term nature for house purchase finance.  I rise, really, to ask the Minister to say something in his reply about the general method of supervision of the finances of trustee savings banks.  I do so without implying any doubt whatever about their financial capacity.  As I understand it &mdash; the Minister said this in his speech &mdash; they are private bodies supervised by the State, in accordance with the Trustee Savings Banks Acts.  If my memory serves me right, they are not under the supervision or control of the Central Bank.  It is the Department of Finance as I understand it, that looks after the question of their financial capacity and their liquidity in particular.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The section of the Trustee Savings Banks Act 1965, which was found by the lawyers to be faulty in relation to long-term finance, says that a trustee savings bank can undertake any business which, in the opinion of the Minister, is within the financial capacity of the bank.  The Minister must have some set of guidelines for this purpose and I think they will be needed far more according as the trustee savings banks move out into the field of long-term lending.  Hitherto, they have been either investing the depositors' money in Government securities, which are liquid, or in short-term personal loans for periods up to five years and bridging loans to depositors.  All these are in the short-term category.  Now they are being authorised, rightly, to move into the field of longer-term housing loans, <Col N="854" /> which, presumably, might be for 20 to 30 years.  As a matter of simple banking prudence somebody in authority should be having a look, from time to time, at the extent to which they invest the depositors' money in the long-term, as distinct from the shorter-term, and more liquid assets.  I should like the Minister to say whether it is the Minister for Finance who will be discharging that supervisory role in the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Wyse)</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of questions have been posed which are not appropriate to this Bill.  This Bill is clarifying a Minister's order safeguarding the banks against any legal action that may be taken.  The Minister for Finance is directly responsible.  The Minister for Posts and Telegraphs is responsible for the money.  A question regarding the interest rate was put by Senator Keating. That matter is under consideration at the moment.</P>
      <P>This is a Bill to be welcomed.  An announcement was made earlier in the year by the Minister that these moneys could be made available for housing purposes. It was welcomed by the banks and by everybody concerned.  There is strict supervision at all times of trustee savings banks.  Senator Keating went into a number of matters but they do not arise on this Bill, which is reinforcing a Minister's order and eliminating any doubts that may arise from that order.  I appreciate the contributions made.  One could widen the debate where savings banks are concerned but this Bill is mainly to remove doubts about the Minister's order and to safeguard the savings banks against any legal action that may be taken.  I am anxious also that all Stages of the Bill be agreed.  I do not have to impress on Senators the urgency of this, in the interests of the Minister and of the savings banks concerned.</P>
