      <P>The main purpose of section 8 is to ensure that the present properties and everything relating to them held by the various boards of conservators are transferred to the central board.  The properties are specified at (a), (b), (c), (d) and (e), five hatcheries at Carrowmore, Innistioge, Mallow, Cong and Virginia.  There is nothing more really in the section than that, the transfer of all rights appertaining to the particular hatcheries from the present boards of conservators that own these hatcheries to the central board.  They are specified salmon hatcheries.</P>

      <P>Government amendment No. 7 (A):</P>
      <P>In page 13, subsection (1) (a), lines 42 to 48, to delete subparagraph (i) and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(i)  subject to the provisions of this Act, protect the fisheries in such region and generally enforce the Fisheries Acts, 1959 to 1979, therein,&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 10 (1) (a) as drafted at present requires each regional board to appoint staff for the protection of their fisheries to the extent that the board's funds permit.  The section is based on a similar provision in the principal Act which enables a board of conservators to appoint staff for the protection of their fisheries to the extent that the board's funds permit.  I consider that the inclusion of this provision is unnecessary as staff numbers are controlled in another section of the Bill, section 24, to which we will be coming.  It is sufficient to require regional boards to protect the fisheries in their regions.  That is the purpose of the amendment.  Really, it is a drafting amendment.  There is no point in having a superfluous provision here in section 10 (a) when in fact the intention is contained in section 24.  It is a matter that came to the attention of the draftsman after the drafting of the Bill.</P>

      <P>Will the substituted paragraph not be superfluous in that it is going to charge the board with the enforcement of the Fisheries Acts, 1959 to 1979 generally?  Is not the board already well charged with such a duty by virtue of the earlier Acts and this one?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>No, it is the actual section as it is framed in section 10 (1) (a); it is covered under the latest section 24. We are substituting by this provision here &ldquo;subject to the provisions of this Act, protect the fisheries in such region and generally enforce the Fisheries Acts, 1959 to 1979 therein.&rdquo;  So, &ldquo;subject to the provisions of this Act&rdquo; brings you on to section 24.  It is a tidier drafting.  Section 24 says: &ldquo;(1) Subject to the provisions of this section and to section 28 and 29,... the Central Board or a regional board may, subject to the approval of the Minister, given with the concurrence of the Minister for the Public Service, from time to time appoint such and so many persons as it thinks proper to be its officers and servants.&rdquo;  That is the general section?  It then goes on to deal in detail with that.  By reference back between section 24 and the main Act we feel we have covered this area that we are seeking to cover here.  Basically, we are trying to make it more flexible; it is more restrictive as it now stands.  We are trying to meet the wishes of the Seanad. Criticism was voiced here generally on Second Stage that there were a number of unduly restrictive provisions in the Bill.  We are trying to make the Bill more open.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 9:</P>
      <P>In page 14, subsection (1) (b) (ii), line 14 to delete &ldquo;,development&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I believe that it would be better if the development of the inland fisheries was the responsibility of the central board. The case I wish to put forward to the Minister is that whereas it is proposed that the great coarse fishing area in this country, comprising Counties Monaghan, Cavan, Leitrim, Roscommon, part of Westmeath and Meath, would be under the control of four different regional boards, I believe it would be better and lead to more effective work if that area were under the control of one board.  The way to meet that situation is to ensure that the work of developing the inland fisheries is the responsibility of the central board and that the regional boards look after the question of pollution and so on.  That is the principal case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot accept that, because I want to embody a regional principle here and really what the Senator is arguing for is centralisation as against regionalisation.  There are tremendous variations between the catchment areas around the coast, tremendous variations with regard to development requirements and with regard to the runs of fish and so on, so that you cannot have a generalised or uniform system in regard to the development of fisheries.  What the Senator is suggesting in effect is to delete development from the mandate of the regional board under section 10.  This, I would suggest, is an undesirable proposal if one has regard to the whole nature of Irish fisheries.  The development work will be a matter for implementation by regional boards under the aegis of a central board that will seek to co-ordinate it under the Bill itself.  To delete development here would in my view unduly restrict a regional board in regard to carrying out their developmental functions as appropriate to the particular region, or catchment area, or estuary, or river, or lake, requiring particular treatment or attention as the regional board might think fit.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AndyOBrien" hpid="Mr. A. O'Brien Mr. A. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I suggest that in view of the fact that this is the great coarse fishing area and because of its great potential as a coarse fishing area that the counties and parts of the counties I outlined would become a region under the Act?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator has referred to a matter now that is really running counter to the amendment that he proposes because I am thinking seriously&mdash;I can do it by way of order under the previous section&mdash;about defining the region with which the Senator is associated, that is, the northern region generally that happens to be a strong coarse fishing region.  I am thinking seriously&mdash;there are difficulties in the way&mdash;of making that a specific region of its own.  That is a matter I am considering at the moment.  But again that runs contrary to the spirit of the Senator's amendment which does not seek to delete development activities from the region inself.  What the Senator is suggesting now is a constructive step and one that I am giving consideration to but it does run counter to the notion of deleting development here.  It is precisely the point that the Senator is making now which I was making earlier on in reply to his amendment: that that particular region does require particular development treatment which might be forthcoming from a central board but may be very appropriate to a regional board.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator O'Brien's amendment is that in the event of the area being fragmented between different boards, you then could have different levels of development perhaps even in the same county.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the central board is to co-ordinate and to prevent duplications.  It would be a mistake to adopt the amendment here, as it <Col N="723" /> rather tends to mitigate and reduce the particular regional function of the regional board.  You are cutting the regional board at source and giving to a central board total authority in regard to development activities.  One must ask is that desirable?  Candidly, I do not think it is.  I would see the central board essentially as a co-ordinating authority, making sure, obviously, that there should not be duplication in regard to development work as between different regions.  That would be the function of the central board.  Surely one must not seek to emasculate the regional board by removing any development interests or activities from their ken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AndyOBrien" hpid="Mr. O'Brien Mr. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought that four regional boards with responsibility for looking after this one area would not be as effective as it should be, but in view of what the Minister has said, if he would take steps to meet this situation by implementing the serious thoughts that he is having on this area, I would be quite happy with that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I am glad that the Senator has brought this to my notice because this is one area in which I am having second thoughts.  It is an area with particular problems peculiar to that area&mdash;the whole region stretching from Louth to Longford, north Leinster and south Ulster, and north-east Connacht.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelMulcahy" hpid="Mr. Mulcahy Mr. Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am interested in this because of the problems of central <i>versus</i> regional distribution of power.  It was drawn to my attention that there might be a possibility that the resources would be too widely spread.  Does the Minister foresee any difficulty there?  Will each regional board have the resources to do the development work?  For instance, in relation to industrial development we had to centralise.  I would like to hear the Minister's view on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>It depends on which way you look at it.  I was faced with the problem of structuring this Bill.  If you want a centralised board with no regional boards and no democracy, you <Col N="724" /> can have that.  I would imagine that the whole trend today, and particularly in regard to an area like fisheries where you want to mobilise public opinion, get an interested public and interested local angling associations&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Anglers do not march.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important to have a regional aspect.  Bord Fáilte found this out when they, after many years, decided to devolve from being a centralised board to the regional boards that they now have.  I would envisage these boards operating rather like the regional boards of Bord Fáilte with, as in the case of Bord Fáilte, the central body operating in an overall grant-giving capacity to supplement local requirements and to co-ordinate the various regions for tourism purposes.  I would envisage the central board here operating with such regional boards rather in the same manner and hopefully in a complementary manner.  I appreciate the fears that have been expressed here by certain people who are very concerned about angling development, especially Senator O'Brien.  He expressed a point of view that has been raised with me and what Senator Mulcahy mentioned has been raised with me also. I appreciate the point of view.  The view is that funds may tend to be dissipated to various regional authorities and the view has been expressed that one central board could maximise the utilisation of funds and make greater use of them rather like what the fisheries trust do at present.  It is attractive in its own way in a short-term view.  In the long term what we have to do is to mobilise public interest and public opinion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will just mention salmon.  The State through all its legislation, regulations and enforcement is not going to preserve the salmon species unless there is a public opinion built up.  You can only build up that public opinion through a democratic regional organisation and a regional input into the importance of the conservation of particular lakes and rivers and the preservation of particular species in particular areas.  That sort of mobilisation is best done through a system where various angling interests <Col N="725" /> are represented democratically, through a form of election, on regional boards where they can be mobilised with voluntary people who are concerned on the ground with this matter in the interests of protection and the interests of the preservation and conservation.  That is my argument for having it on a regional rather than an over-central basis.</P>
    <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
    <P>Government amendment No. 10:</P>
    <P>In page 14, lines 59 to 62, and in page 15, lines 1 to 4, subsection (6), to delete paragraph (b) and subsitute the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(b)  (i)  The Minister may by order provide for the issue by any regional board, on payment of such duty (if any) as may be specified in the order, of licences for fishing of a class or description specified in the order.</P>
    <P>(ii)  In case an order under this section provides for the issue of licences for fishing with engines which are not scheduled engines, then for so long as the order is in force the following provisions shall have effect, namely, any engine which is of a kind described in the order shall for the purposes of section 65 of the Principal Act be regarded as being a scheduled engine and any such licence shall for the said purposes be regarded as being an ordinary fishing licence.</P>
    <P>(iii)  In case an order under this paragraph is for the time being in force, the powers conferred by the order on regional boards shall be in addition to and not in substitution for the powers conferred on such boards by subsection (4) of this section.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>At the moment section 10 (6) (b) states that the Minister may by order provide for the issue by any regional board of fishing licences other than those issuable under the Principal Act.  The object of the section is to enable regional boards to issue licences to cover a region or part of a region.  The <Col N="726" /> amendment was necessary in order to ensure that any person fishing with such a licence, if the engine licensed was not a scheduled engine would be fishing legally. The intention at present is to enable boards to issue licences for scheduled engines only.  Scheduled engines are those listed in the Fourth Schedule of the Principal Act.  If, however, at some time in the future the board wish to issue a licence for an unscheduled engine under this section the amendment now inserted enables such an engine to be added to the list.  Again, it makes for more flexibility in regard to the issuing of licences for such engines.  At present the situation is over-restrictive whereas under the amendment here it gives a greater degree of flexibility to the board in respect of the issue of licences for this purpose.</P>

      <P>They may still seek the licence in the ordinary way.  Could the <Col N="727" /> Minister tell us how the country is going to be divided as between the regional boards?

When will information be available in regard to the functional areas of the new boards and generally when will the administrative machinery be available for applications for licences?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would hope to have that ready inside a few weeks.  I have made up my mind actually on the seven regions.  The only one that is concerning me is the one I referred to earlier in replying to Senator O'Brien, the north Leinster one and the Shannon catchment generally north of Athlone, which also includes parts of Cavan, Leitrim and Monaghan.  That area, because of its coarse fishing predominance, may require special treatment.  At the moment it is included in the Shannon region.  The regions can be roughly defined as the Donegal-Sligo region incorporating two existing boards; the Mayo region incorporating two boards; the Galway region incorporating three existing boards.  The Shannon region as it is now is unchanged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>It takes in the whole catchment region from Cavan right down.  The Kerry-west Cork region makes five: the Lismore region, which is the Blackwater region, east Cork, Tipperary and Waterford.  Then there is the Leinster region running from Wexford up to Louth.  That makes seven regions instead of the existing 17.  The north Leinster region is the predominant coarse fishing region in the country and the difficulty is that it covers a number of catchment areas.  I have tried to keep the arrangement as rationalised in the way I mentioned to catchment areas, estuaries and the catchment areas of particular rivers.  But the Shannon region does present problems because there are very real differences between the sort of fishing and the angling situation in the <Col N="728" /> lower Shannon region and the upper Shannon region.  I am trying to reach some solution in respect of that particular one.</P>

      <P>I am interested in hearing&mdash;perhaps it has been discussed before&mdash;about the sea anglers' side of it. According to the figures pointed out to me sea anglers are very heavy users of fisheries and they are not on the register, for instance, which will be coming up later.  I am just interested in getting the Minister's views on that, why the sea anglers in fact are not included.</P>

I was astonished that section 9 went through without anyone saying a word because that section is the kernel of this entire Bill.  However, maybe somebody will think of something for Report Stage.  I would like to ask if the Minister could give us an indication of how many of the <Col N="729" /> people who are likely to be on the regional boards will be elected and how many will be appointed?

      <P>In other words, the fishermen in that particular board's area have a year to decide whether or not they will pay a subscription to the board.  They may for local or other reasons decide not to subscribe to the board and you could end up with a situation where there could be a tiny electorate and the elections the second year might be very unreal if the Minister wanted to have the majority elected.  I see practical difficulties there in the feedback from the area where there will be a lot of support for this idea of applying for licences in order to obtain a vote to the regional board.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The feedback is that the genuine trout angling fraternity in the country are very interested because up to now they have had no representation on existing boards of conservators and their only involvement has been through the trust.  Now, for the first time, there will be a panel for them.  The same thing applies to the coarse and sea anglers who have no representation at present. The only people who have representation on the boards of conservators are the salmon rod anglers, the drift net salmon fishermen and draft net salmon fishermen, the rated occupiers of weirs and so on.  The rest of the fishing fraternity are excluded.  One of the main purposes of the Bill is to bring in the rest of the fishing fraternity and I know that there is tremendous interest among not only the trout anglers but also to a very substantial extent among the coarse and sea angling people in becoming involved.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I can see a certain area of conflict, particularly in the region of the country that we were discussing on Senator O'Brien's amendment which is predominantly coarse fishing country but, at the same time, has within it quite an amount of good trout water.  If, as the Minister says, the major interest in these elections is going to be taken by the brown trout fishermen and they become the predominant element on the boards&mdash;which I think is likely to happen because they are, by and large, the <Col N="731" /> keener fishermen and more likely to take an interest and they are in charge of developing in their area&mdash;does the Minister foresee a situation where, in order to develop brown trout fishing there will be widescale cleaning out of coarse fish and can he see any conflict arising in that regard?  In the area to which Senator O'Brien referred&mdash;the south Ulster/north Leinster area&mdash;I feel that coarse fishermen are unlikely to participate, initially anyway, in the electoral process.  Consequently, the boards in the earlier years may be composed almost entirely of brown trout fishermen who may direct their activities to an emphasis on brown trout fishing to the detriment of coarse fishing, which might not be a bad thing, depending on one's point of view.  If any imbalance should arise, with potential conflict in a particular area over different stretches of water, does the Minister see his right to nominate members having a role to reconcile such conflicts?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. A. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support what Senator Cooney has said because in the area to which I referred there is a belief among the coarse fishing enthusiasts that perhaps too much is being done for the trout anglers and, because of the tourist attraction and other attractions of the coarse fishing in this area, it would be important to ensure by whatever means within the Minister's power that the development of coarse fishing would not be neglected and that it would be developed to the maximum degree.  There is the danger, as outlined by Senator Cooney, and I would like to have some assurance from the Minister that everything will be done to prevent things going in that direction because it would be resented by people in the area to which I referred.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I intend the Minister's nominees to redress any imbalance on the boards.  That is the main purpose of reserving these additions or nominees which the Minister may make.  It is also a way of redressing the possibility of a wrong balance in that I propose to have a panel system of voting in so far as the <Col N="732" /> interests are concerned.  For example, in an area like the area being referred to, where there is a strong coarse fishing interest and a strong trout fishing interest, I would propose of the 12 seats I mentioned that would be selected by fishery interests to have three seats allotted to coarse fishermen and three seats allotted to trout fishermen.  The registered coarse anglers would vote for the coarse angling nominees and the registered trout fishermen would vote for the trout fishing nominees.  In certain areas this would not arise.  In the north Leinster area you would not have drift net fishermen.  In other areas their interests would predominate and they would have a stronger panel, for example, in the Lismore area.  This emphasises the regional aspect, that the interests are different in various regions and, depending on the predominance of fishing and angling interests, the panels can be weighted accordingly.  It is the job of a politician to draw up these regulations and I think I am reasonably suited.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that the Munster Trout Angling Council are concerned that many of the clubs will lose their autonomy under this new system?  I do not know if that will be the case.  Much will depend on the representatives appointed to the regional boards. I am interested in what he says and I would like his confirmation specifically in relation to Munster, that the trout anglers will have a separate panel of their own and will not, for example, be lumped with coarse fishermen.</P>

      <P>The Senator can take it that in every board area of the seven regional boards the trout anglers will have a separate panel of their own.  In the brief time I have been in this position I have been very impressed by the dedication and the attention displayed by trout anglers and their overall association and by the various clubs, regional groups and associations interested in brown trout fishing, who have sent in most helpful suggestions to amend this Bill.  They tend to be very dedicated people.  There is no question about that.  I would see them for the first time taking a very positive part in the <Col N="733" /> administration of our inland fisheries and there will be a panel specifically for trout fishermen on each regional board in Munster and everywhere else.</P>

      <P>There is an important message that the Minister should propagate in connection with this section and the Bill in general, particularly in terms of the clubs and angling associations that are in existence, and which may come into existence, and that is that the principle of self-help is really a fundamental one and that the setting up of a structure like this should not be taken as a panacea for all our ills.  It should be looked upon as a body which will regulate, assist and encourage the clubs of coarse and trout fishermen and the sea anglers to increase their efforts to preserve, conserve and develop fishing in their areas. It is very important to get this across. The idea of this Bill is not to hamper the effort locally but, in fact, it is to give it increased impetus.  The bodies operating locally at present shall be given every support and encouragement because it is really what they do that ultimately will count.</P>

      <P>To get back to the question of possible conflict of interests, I should like to instance a situation which could arise in the area to which we have been referring, the area of north <Col N="734" /> Leinster, south Ulster, east Connacht.  A large number of lakes are in that area and many of them have both trout and coarse fish.  Let us take a situation of a lake near a village with guesthouses doing business with visiting coarse fishermen but where the lake in question is suitable for ecological reasons to be developed particularly as a brown trout lake and where the particular regional board decide it should be developed as a brown trout lake for those reasons. There is immediate conflict then with the local tourist interests.  What mechanism is provided in this structure to resolve such a conflict, particularly to resolve it, if possible, harmoniously?  It may not be possible but perhaps there may be a mechanism for making the ultimate decision where a decision will cause conflict.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I can see the Senator's point here.  That is the whole purpose of having the central board and it was something to which objection was taken, the Minister, to some extent, in the scene also and having the Minister's nominees on the regional boards and the central board.  Because of the very nature of fisheries and the varying interests there is bound to be some degree of, let us call it, difference of opinion.  I would see the Minister's nominees resolving such difference of opinion and ultimately the Minister and the central board, through the allocation of finance and the coordination of the central board, ensuring that resources are allotted where the best ecological advice suggests they should be allotted and decisions taken accordingly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What this new structure of elected members should do is to bring a greater element of voluntary responsible people to these boards who will take the broader view.  Perhaps I am being optimistic here, but I hope that the sort of people who will be elected by the brown trout fishermen and by the sea angling associations will take a broad view. They will not have a vested interest in the situation.  One of the matters which has bedevilled the activities of the existing boards of conservators has been that the commercial interests have predominated, be they commercial driftnet fishermen or draftnet fishermen, <Col N="735" /> the rated occupiers or salmon fishermen. While there is nothing wrong with it, that whole area of commercial activity has tended to predominate that issue.  Now we have provided for an influx of voluntary people who are genuinely interested in fishing as an amenity and a resource, as part of our heritage, who are interested in its continuation in a voluntary non-commercial capacity.  I hope that they will exercise their views on the boards in that sort of spirit and way.</P>
    <P>In many ways the Bill is a vote of confidence in the voluntary people who are in the angling clubs and associations around the country to exercise their responsibilities in that way.  In order to ensure that it is done properly, we have this balance of election, a panel system, panelling out the various fishery interests in a particular region, and the Minister's own nominees, plus the overall coordination of the central board, with the allocation of funds ultimately residing with the Minister.  Within these various checks and balances I hope it will work out all right.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AndyOBrien" hpid="Mr. A. O'Brien Mr. A. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>Will careful research work be done to ensure that before coarse fish are taken from a lake that is stocked with trout it is likely to be a success? Much research work is necessary in that field.  It is said that in some areas, in the regions to which I referred earlier, where coarse fish were taken from a lake which was then stocked with trout this trout stocking was not successful.  That gives rise to lack of public confidence in boards operating such a scheme.  In addition to that, the hopes and the aspirations of the people in that area should also be taken into account.  If a tourist business is being built up in an area mainly on its attraction as a coarse fishing area as distinct from a trout angling area, the board should favour the development of coarse fishing in that area because of its appeal and tradition.</P>

      <P>To answer Senator O'Brien's point, I feel very strongly that legitimate tourism interests have a very strong case and very valid reasons why they should be represented on these boards.  That is a matter I would bear very much in mind in regard to the Minister's nominees, that in any area where there is a strong tourism interest with an hotel or guesthouse I would certainly be predisposed to appoint such a person to the board as one of the Minister's nominees.  That makes sense. That person could bring, as it were, another dimension to any kind of constructive proposal for the development of fisheries.  Senator O'Brien is right: there is a certain conflict here between the purist in regard to brown trout development as against coarse fishing development.  I do not agree with the extremes on either side; there is room for the two.  We have enough inland waters to carry out a whole range of fishery development if we keep them unpolluted and provide the proper measures to maintain them in an unpolluted state.  I would not go overboard for any particular type of development.  It is important, and I emphasised this in discussions with the various angling interests, to preserve a sense of balance.  There can be a range of fishing activities in different places with the facilities available. That is tremendously important.  I would hope that that is the sort of attitude that would permeate the administrators of the future.</P>

That is the purpose of the amendment.  I am proposing the same action in amendments Nos. 14A and 14B.  The purpose is to confine the election to people resident in the State and it is desirable from the voting point of view.  It is not necessary to include tourists.  The Bill is basically concerned with national development of our own resources and it might be dangerous to have tourists there.  It would not be beyond the bounds of possibility to collect a lot of tourists to sign the register and so on and somebody could have a bloc of votes at the election.

      <P>It is a test of the bona fides of the voter that he or she should be the holder of a licence for three years. Senator Cooney raised the query.  It will not arise in the first election but for second and subsequent elections it is only right and proper that the people voting on the coarse angling, sea angling panels or on the trout angling panels who volunteer to vote, who are on the register and have paid their voluntary contribution should have done so for three years. The point made by Senator Honan is slightly different because the salmon fee is a licence.  It is a statutory obligation to pay under penalty of court proceedings&mdash;prosecution and fine&mdash;whereas what we are talking about here is a voluntary contribution on the part of sea and coarse anglers and on the part of trout fishermen.  What Senator Honan is talking about is the salmon anglers.  In that case they must pay a licence fee under penalty of law. To that extent there is a difference.  Once they pay their licence fee they are entitled to vote.  The three-year provision applies to voluntary contributors&mdash;they become voluntary contributors at their own request.  Originally in this Bill I proposed to bring in a situation with a licence fee attaching as far as trout and coarse fishermen were concerned but I relented in the face of mounting antagonism to such a compulsory system and substituted a voluntary system. Those people cannot have their cake and eat it and if it is going to be a voluntary system let us prove the voluntary nature of the person who is seeking entitlement to vote by stating here that he or she should have voluntarily paid his or her contributions for three years at least.</P>

      <P>I agree with the Minister, but earlier he gave the impression that he was encouraging the persons who had fished for a long time in the local anglers' association and now he is asking them to register for three years before he gives them a vote. Senator Cooney said he would be worried about these people not registering and not being interested or knowing where votes were going but they know what registration means.  I wonder is it right to ask the man in the Ennis and <Col N="740" /> District Anglers' Association, who has fished for 25 years, and his father before him, to be registered for three years before he has a vote when somebody else can vote after one year.  That is what I am asking the Minister.</P>

      <P>I wanted to put to the Minister for clarification a somewhat different point.  He has given a fair amount of comfort to the trout angler, the coarse fish angler and even the sea angler, but I want him to clarify a point on behalf of the optimists who still hope to catch salmon with rod and line. Let us suppose a person has taken out a £10 licence, called a salmon fishing licence, issued by a particular fishery district, but described to be valid to the end of the season in all districts.  Am I too much of an optimist to hope that such a person would have a right to vote in all the regions, or would he be confined to voting in whatever particular region, which almost by accident happened to be the first place he went to fish in the year?  That might not be the district he was most interested in.</P>

      <P>In answer to the last question, it is one man, one vote, he or she must opt.  Senator Whitaker, being a master of the salmon angling art, knows his favourite waters and I am certain he would have no difficulty in opting.  I will leave that to himself and I am certain any salmon angler would be in precisely the same situation.  I would defend the matter raised by Senator Honan on the basis that the salmon licensee is a compulsory holder, he pays £10 a year for it, and must pay under penalty of prosecution. In the other case we are talking about volunteers.  The best way to test genuine volunteers is to ensure that they are interested in the art of trout, coarse or sea angling.  In order to remove any fear that the Senator may have, I might say the association concerned welcome this.  They do not want any more than any Senator wishes some flight-by-night operation in the last year where somebody comes in and proceeds to pack the electoral college for a particular panel.  They are as aware as we are of the importance of ensuring that the genuine anglers are the voters.  They <Col N="741" /> regard the test of genuineness&mdash;and have agreed with me in discussions&mdash;as being reasonably expressed in this three-year provision, which means that when a positive contribution has been made a person is entitled to vote.</P>

      <P>We are into a very difficult area here.  We are trying to get away from that because that was the system until now.  For instance, in the salmon area a rod angler and a rated occupier had two votes under the present system and if he or she had a drift net or a draft net he or she had even more votes.  We are trying to get away from this system of having power concentrated and a multiplicity of votes obtaining. This is one of the big matters of concern to the commission&mdash;the whole notion of democratising the system of administration of our fisheries and also the whole idea of involving as broad a spectrum as possible of the fishing interests in order to have the whole range of fishing interests involved in the administration of inland fisheries and to dilute the privileged position that heretofore obtained.  I do not like going away from that, and that is the principle we are trying to work on and develop.</P>

That person would <Col N="742" /> not be exercising any extra power.  It could encourage revenue for the boards if a person could go on both registers knowing he is going to be given the vote for both panels.  It could have some small beneficial effect there.

Every Act of Parliament providing for appointments or election invariably disqualifies Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas, generally for good reasons, in the bodies concerned.  Is it necessary to go so far as to disqualify Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas from serving on a regional fishery board?  They might be able to bring a lot of interest and knowledge to the particular board and, after all, it is a recreational rather than a business matter.  I do not see that there could be a conflict of interests in that regard, nor do I see that one's duties in the Oireachtas could lead one into conflict with any actions of the regional board, particularly if the regional board is subject to the central board, and again subject to the overall control of the Minister.  It would be a pity if keen anglers who are Members of Parliament should be excluded from contribution to the development of the fisheries of the country.</P>

      <P>On the question of the removal of disqualification, subsection (2) gives power to the Minister to relieve the person from disqualification in certain situations.  I am thinking of the situation on local authorities where there <Col N="744" /> is an analogous provision where persons can be disqualified after absences for a certain length of time.  The provision in the local authority code&mdash;and I am speaking from recollection&mdash;contains allowances for a person who has been ill or who can satisfy his colleagues on the local authority that his absence has been for good sufficient reason.  The best judges of whether a member of a regional board should be disqualified for non-attendance would be his peers on the boards who would know his individual situation more precisely than would the Minister.</P>

      <P>This is a central section. It gives powers to the central and regional boards for the improvement of fisheries generally, which is the kernel of this Bill.  It has very wide powers with regard to acquisition, gaining access and rights of way.  Would the Minister like to flesh out the section for us in layman's language?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>When one reads the section one sees it is reasonably explicable. It is concerned with the powers for improving any fishery, whether or not it is the property of the central board or the regional board.  Subsection (1) sets out the various steps under paragraphs (a), (b), (c), (d), (e) and (f).  It is important to write out those powers.  There is also provision for consultation with the Commissioners of Public Works.  That is reasonable where certain works are required. In the case of a dispute I have authority to arbitrate between the Commissioners of Public Works and the central or regional boards.  There is a notice provision in the case of any owner <Col N="745" /> of a fishery where there is an intention to make such improvements, and if the owner cannot be found I may issue an authorisation saying the conditions need not apply.</P>
      <P>Other authorities, such as the ESB, have enabling officers or servants of the central or regional board who may come on to any such land to gain access&mdash;it is important to gain access to a fishery&mdash;to do the required works or to improve a bridge, a road, or a pathway. There is a provision for a certificate of authorisation such powers to be issued by the regional or central board.  Under subsection (7) there are limitations on these powers in the interests of privacy, <i>vis-a-vis</i> entering a private house or garden. The section is reasonably self-explanatory.</P>

They are proud to manage and control those areas and are concerned that the regional boards might wish to take over these small fisheries.  Could the Minister indicate if it would be the intention of the regional boards to take over these small scattered fisheries and deprive existing clubs of the rights they have had, and the responsibilities that they have been given to manage them?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>These rights already exist with the Land Commission, in particular, and the Office of Public Works. There is a provision here enabling such fisheries to be transferred to the regional or central board, not under this particular provision, but as agreed between the Land Commission and central or regional board, or between the Office of Public Works and the central or regional board.  The same policy approach will obtain.  There is no question of the compulsory appropriation of such fishing rights.  The same arrangements will continue in regard to letting and leasing to anglers' associations, anglers' clubs and so on, on the normal tender basis.</P>

      <P>Two points have been made.  One of them I suppose is a selfish one on the part of such clubs, that is <Col N="746" /> they have been able to get membership fees and charge people for going into these fisheries.  The second point is that they are concerned that if they are deprived of the responsibility of managing these fisheries, there might be a freefor-all, within legal limits; for example, if a club had a particular fishery, they might be interested in conservation and might limit fishing to fly fishing.  I am not talking about large clubs which would be concerned with massive improvements but small scattered clubs.  Would the Minister not consider it better that they should be left with the responsibility of managing these clubs and doing what they can to conserve them in their own way?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">

      <P>There is a lot of sense in that.  That can be done within the Bill itself.  Perhaps this whole area might be more appropriate to sections 39 and 40. I agree with Senator Molony that under this section any sort of arrangement is open to the central or regional board.  It is the sort of arrangement that obviously would be desirable.  Here again the regional advice comes in, provided they were happy in the knowledge that a strong angling group was in the area, had some funds, were concerned about development and were doing it, the obvious thing would be to transfer such fisheries to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>This section gives wide powers to the boards for the purpose of improving fisheries.  To implement those powers the various bodies have to be given rights to access to water.  This includes obviously getting right to enter land at any reasonable time.  These words are taken from subsection (3). The powers contained in subsection (3) are very wide and are not confined just to the central board or regional board or their work people, but are given in addition to any contractor or workmen employed by such a contractor.  They have right to enter on land at any reasonable time for the purpose of gaining access to the site of fishery improvement works or for the purpose of gaining access to a fishery in order to inspect it or maintain it.  The reasonableness relates to the time of entry.  It does not <Col N="747" /> relate to the method or place of entry.  It would appear that the power of entry there is very wide.  Section 42 provides for compensation.  As I read section 42 the compensation is to be paid by the person in whose favour the power is exercised. I wonder if it is any use to a landowner if the person is a workman employed by a contractor and decides to take a short cut across a particular piece of ground.</P>
      <P>According to the strict reading of section 42 is the person who pays the compensation, if that landowner subsequently seeks it, the workman who entered the land?  All he has to do is enter it at a reasonable time.  There is no compulsion on him to enter it in a reasonable way, or to seek agreement.  The power contained in subsection (3) is very wide and is perhaps not careful enough of the rights of landowner whose land is going to be crossed for the purpose of exercising the powers under section 17 generally.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason for the section being so positively worded is that the access aspect, for obvious reasons, is all-important.  One can have all the powers in the world in regard to improvements in relation to fisheries&mdash;at a later stage when we are talking about the acquisition of fisheries this matter will be relevant&mdash;but when you analyse the situation, if you do not have fairly stiff powers of access you are not in a position to do much about it.  That is the reality of the situation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree there is a dilemma there but is the dilemma solved too much in favour of the fishery board and a bit carelessly with regard to the rights of the individual?  This could raise a constitutional question&mdash;that powers are given to enter on land at any reasonable time and there is a provision for a <i>post factum</i> compensation.  I agree that in the compensation clauses there is provision for interest to be paid, and I suppose that is intended to make up for the retrospective nature of the compensation. It seems to me that in providing for &ldquo;entry at any reasonable time&rdquo; there might be a constitutional conflict with <Col N="748" /> the right of private property.  If the right of compensation is not concurrent or in advance of the diminution of the property right, there might be a difficult situation.  I do not press the point but I raise it as something with seeds of trouble within it.</P>

      <P>Government amendment No. 14C:</P>
      <P>In page 22, subsection (4), lines 6 to 12, to delete all the words from &ldquo;, and without prejudice&rdquo; to the end of the subsection.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment is brought in to meet points of view that are being expressed by the various angling interests.  In particular the Trout Anglers' Federation and other interests brought this point to my notice.  The section itself is designed to lessen the restriction on the payment of grants to regional boards in connection with trout and coarse fishing development.  The purpose of the amendment is to lessen the restriction.  The section as originally drafted, has caused some controversy and apart from the various angling associations certain Senators have raised the point with me.  As the Seanad is aware, subsection (4) of section 20, as drafted, and as the Seanad now sees it, was designed to achieve a situation which, while desirable in theory, I am now satisfied would not quite work out in practice.  The theory behind it was that grants from the central board to a regional board would be loaded or <Col N="750" /> weighted in favour of areas with a high subscription content.  However admirable as that theory was, a number of angling associations and very interested parties, while agreeing with the principle behind what I was trying to do under that section, have satisfied me that there are a number of practical difficulties.</P>
      <P>The point was made, also, by a number of Senators during the Seanad debate, that there were obvious anomalies and, indeed, individual representations were also made to me. The main, fairly obvious, anomaly is that it is unscientific, in the sense that an obvious resource crying out for development, say a potentially excellent trout lake in a poor, or a remote area, with no anglers living near it or in its general area, might not be developed if an overrigid view were taken of the criterion as now written into subsection (4).</P>
      <P>Another obvious point made is that the density of population on the east coast, or in relatively well-off areas on the east coast, could result in the subscriptions in these areas being far greater than in less well off areas, which could be a factor that might mean the weighting or loading of grants from the central board towards these particular areas.  In other words, there could be a disproportionate amount of money spent in areas where there might be a high degree of payment of subscription but not the same degree of importance in regard to the actual resource itself, as might obtain in a less-favoured area, amongst people less well endowed to pay subscriptions.  An obvious wrong could be done in that respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having looked at the pros and cons of the whole matter I have decided to bring in the amendment which is before the Seanad.  The best way to amend it is by a straight deletion, as suggested; the section will, therefore, end after the words &ldquo;central board&rdquo;, the last six lines of the section being deleted.  That leaves the matter much more open and far less restrictive than envisaged in the subsection at present.  I am quite satisfied that I cannot achieve, in the section as it stands, what I am trying to achieve and that it is better to delete it and trust to the good sense of the boards concerned <Col N="751" /> that they will develop the resource in accordance with requirements; that each development of a fishery will be assessed on its merits and that this need not necessarily take the grant into account, to the degree sought by the section.</P>
    <P>The section, briefly, was designed to act as a carrot to encourage subscriptions. Candidly, while our intentions were excellent, I do not think it would work as originally drafted and I am asking the Seanad to accept this deletion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's arguments are excellent to support not just the amendment but the deletion of the entire subsection.  To be logical, he should delete the entire subsection and give real force to what he has been saying. If the last six lines were deleted, we should be left with a subsection reading:</P>
      <P>In determining the amount of a grant to be made under this section by the Central Board to be a regional board the Minister shall have regard to the total amount of the subscriptions paid to the regional board in pursuance of section 53 of this Act, as shown in the accounts...</P>
      <P>It does not say what the Minister is to do then, having had regard to the amount paid.  The explicit threat, now removed, is still there, impliedly.  What do the words mean: &ldquo;the Minister shall have regard in determining the amount of grant to be paid&rdquo; and &ldquo;the Minister shall have regard to the amount of subscriptions&rdquo;? There is a slightly threatening note to that when read by itself, with the explicit threat removed by the amendment. Unless the Minister has regard to the level of subscriptions for the purpose of raising or lowering the grant, for what other purpose is he going to have regard to the total amount of subscriptions? Unless he is going to have regard to it for some reason, there is no point in leaving the words there.  His reason is either to increase or reduce the level of the grant.  Why leave it there, when the Minister has indicated in his speech supporting his amendment, that he is not in favour of this principle?  I think he should go the whole way and delete the entire subsection.</P>

      <P>I support the view stated by Senator Cooney.  I agreed almost entirely with everything the Minister said.  If, in determining what funds are to go to the development of a lake with great potential in a very remote and sparsely populated area, the Minister must have regard to the subscriptions, that can only mean, in the long run, that such an area would be neglected.  I should like an assurance from the Minister that that is not intended. I agree with Senator Cooney that the best way to ensure that is to drop this amendment or part of it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  There will be a number of flexible considerations borne in mind in regard to the allocation of grants.  The primary and logical one, is the potential of the particular fishery and the resource.  The section as it is put down means that the Minister shall have regard to the total amount of the subscriptions paid.  That is simply a factor, along with a number of other factors, that would have to be taken into account.</P>
      <P>I defend the idea behind the whole section, as originally framed, in that it is desirable&mdash;as was I think, referred to by Senator West&mdash;to encourage local interest and self-help.  An area that is acting in a fairly positive way as regards fishery development, clearance, restocking, putting in beds and so on, and expending money and paying its subscriptions&mdash;Senator Molony referred to the Munster anglers, in particular, who have an outstanding association, substantially in funds&mdash;will be very strong voluntary contributors.  There are some people in Senator O'Brien's area who are in the same category I would like it to be acknowledged in some way in the manner of distribution of State funds through the central board.  I should like to see acknowledged in some way the voluntary strength of people of that kind who are doing their work on the ground.  That was the whole thinking behind the section as it stood.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Earlier I mentioned the objections <Col N="753" /> that were raised with me and the objections were such that I watered down the section to the degree that I have done, by saying that the Minister &ldquo;shall have regard to the total amount&rdquo; and &ldquo;have it as one of the considerations in his mind.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it should be a very important factor in his mind if there are people in a fishery area who are making the effort and putting the money in; who are active in becoming voluntary contributing members; who are substantial contributors, playing an active part in the election of members of the board in their particular panel.  I am thinking of an active trout angling association like that, and there are a few very good ones around the country.  These people are all voluntary members and contributors, taking an active part in developing fishing grounds in their particular area. The fact that they are making the local effort should be an important consideration in any Minister's mind or any central board's collective mind in the allocation of grants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I see the other point, that you can have excellent fisheries in remote areas, perhaps, poor and underdeveloped areas, that do not have anything like that local voluntary strength and that they should not be neglected.  I do not see very much harm in asking the Minister, in pursuance of this Act, to bear in mind&mdash;or &ldquo;have regard to,&rdquo; is the phrase in the subsection&mdash;the total amount of subscriptions paid to the regional board as a factor in the allocation of grants.  That is why I have decided to leave it as it were, as a guiding consideration in the Minister's mind, and deleting the more specific aspects that tie down the Minister unduly&mdash;to leave it there as a general aspiration to be borne in mind by the Minister.  In the last analysis, nothing that we do in this Bill, or in any regulation under it, will have any real effect unless there is a great groundswell of voluntary interest and voluntary commitment by angling associations, clubs and interested people throughout the <Col N="754" /> country.  The people who are doing that work on the ground are the people I should like to see helped.  Whether or not it should be written into the Bill is another day's work and I think that is the burden of what Senator Cooney stated.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyWest" hpid="Dr. West Dr. West">
      <NameTxt>Dr. West</NameTxt>
      <P>While I agree with the spirit of the Minister's reply, I do not think that he can really include a section like this in legislation.  Ministers have regard to lots of things when they are making grants to certain areas.  One of the things they have regard to is the number of votes their political party may get from a certain grant in a certain area.  We all know that, but it is not the sort of thing one puts in legislation.  That is being slightly facetious, but I think that legislation should be legislation, and asking a Minister to have regard, in the Bill, to something is a meaningless clause.  There are lots of things that Ministers will have regard to and certainly the strength of the local fishery association will be something that he naturally will have regard to.  However, if you put a clause like this in the Bill, if one local fisheries region has 40,000 votes and the region next door has only ten, the first will say that they should get four times the money.  There is that sort of problem.  I feel that the legislation would be tighter if this subsection were removed altogether, as Senator Cooney suggested.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support the point made by Senator West that the words &ldquo;shall have regard to&rdquo; appear, at the moment, to be meaningless, but suppose a particular regional board with rather a poor subscription record say that we should have this phrase interpreted. They could say to the court &ldquo;We think that these words mean that, because of the lack of money being generated within the board, the Minister should, therefore, give us an enhanced grant.&rdquo;  On the other hand, the board that has a big local membership might make the argument that because of their large membership, they should have an enhanced grant.  I do not know what the words mean.  Legally, they are awkward words and could, within the present <Col N="755" /> proceedings, create legal difficulty for the Minister.  If he wants to retain the &ldquo;carrot&rdquo; principle in this subsection, and reward the people who are contributing well locally, there then is the situation that they would be a high local contribution and a high Government contribution, and what funds will be left for the area where, perhaps for very good and valid reasons, there is not a high local contribution?  This is why the Minister could be laying a trap for himself by putting that obligation on himself, to have regard to something for unspecified reasons, reasons which might subsequently be specified by the court, to the embarrassment of the Minister.  I think those words are dangerous from a strictly legal point of view.</P>

I was never very fond of the subsection in any event, but I was trying to do my best to meet the views that I expressed earlier on, that people who help themselves should be helped, unfortunately, aspirations do not often work out well in legislation.  I should hope that, in the administration and the disbursement of the grants, what I said earlier would be taken into account and the people who are helping themselves will be helped.  I am certain that will be done in actual administration and management. Taking that into account, I am inclined to go along with the views expressed in the past in the Seanad.  On Report Stage I will delete that entire subsection. I have already deleted half of it and I might as well go all the way.</P>

      <P>In this respect, I am not inclined to go along with the Senator's amendment.  There is already similar power under section 51 of the Principal Act which enables boards of conservators to be dissolved.  From time to time, boards have been dissolved under the Principal Act; the Cork board were dissolved in 1973; the Drogheda board were dissolved in 1975 for refusing to collect fishery rates.  There are similar provisions in local authority law in regard to local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This section is involved with the fundamental matter of whether the board are doing their job or not.  Section 7 sets out the various functions of the board, what they should do and what they should provide; this section is involved with a board not doing their job in accordance with the functions assigned to them by the Minister.  This is really an essential nexus between the Minister and the board.  I am not disposed to accept the amendment at all.  I feel this type of legislation depends on a balance of powers between Minister, the central board and the regional board; one cannot let any one of the three off on tangents away from control.  There are so many dedicated and involved people in particular areas of fisheries that if you do not have some measure of central control this fear was expressed already by some Senators&mdash;the regional boards may get too much power against the central board.  If one allows this sort of area to become unbalanced and to allow <Col N="757" /> people to chase their own particular pet notions in regard to particular fisheries development, without an overall built-in control system, there would be a high degree of wasteful expenditure.  It is not an area that is accountable in terms of profit and loss or commercial criteria.  It is an area that could become very loose in the accountability aspect, unless there were a degree of ministerial presence and ministerial power to act.</P>

      <P>This section as it stands provides that the chief executives and professional officers of the central and regional boards be appointed through the Local Appointments Commission; that is, in my view, an excellent principle to have established.  It is also provided in the Bill that employees of the Inland Fisheries Trust and boards of conservators, as they are now constituted, would be transferred without any worsening of conditions to the central and regional boards.  That is done by later sections 28 and 29.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Convincing representations have been <Col N="758" /> made to me by some staff members of the Inland Fisheries Trust that as section 26 now stands, taken in conjunction with sections 28 and 29, these staff members of the trust&mdash;most of them very experienced and able officers&mdash;would have to apply to the Local Appointments Commission for their existing posts.  There would be a reapplication situation which would be very unfair to the officers concerned and could not be sustainable.  That is the reason behind this amendment, which specifically provides that transfers of staff from either a board of conservators or the Inland Fisheries Trust will be exempt from the provisions of section 26 and they will not be under the constraint of having to apply to the Local Appointments Commission.  The spirit, therefore, of the later sections allowing for their transfer will be observed and they will not have to go through this reapplication procedure.  It was an omission and this amendment now properly links up this section with the later section which guarantees the position of existing staff.</P>

The important thing to remember is that, under section 54, the right of the life and donor members of the Inland Fisheries <Col N="759" /> Trust to fish in trust fisheries is maintained under section 54.

      <P>This is the section the Minister mentioned when I raised the point of the Land Commission giving to local trout angling clubs the right to manage fisheries.  This arises where the Land Commission take over land and land rights are separated from fishing rights.  I would like clarification on this because I am not clear from what the Minister said on the earlier section.  Is it going to be policy in all such instances? I notice the section says that the Land Commission may hand over their fishery rights to the central or regional boards. Is it, in fact, the policy that the Land Commission will in future hand over those rights to the regional or central board and that the regional or central board will either decide to manage the fisheries themselves or will ask local clubs to do it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no black and white situation with regard to all of these fisheries.  To put the matter into perspective for the information of the Seanad, the Land Commission are in possession of approximately 100 fisheries all over the country.  These fisheries are managed for the commission by the Department of Fisheries and Forestry.  My Department organise lettings and so on as agents for the Land Commission.  That is the present position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Senator said, preference is given to angling associations or hotels. Practically all the fisheries go either to angling associations or hotels.  Lettings <Col N="760" /> are very reasonable.  The total lettings from the 100 come to £5,000.  The money is not a real consideration and priority is given to local interests.  That situation will continue.  All the section does is to enable the Land Commission to transfer them to me or, with my consent, to the central board.  The reasoning behind that is the whole reasoning behind the Bill, that the central board can deal with it either directly or through its regional board or I can deal with it directly with the central board or regional board and that proper development can take place.  That is why, as I said in my Second Reading speech, that the whole thrust of this is towards development.  As it stands, the Land Commission have no mandate to develop fisheries and neither do I.  All the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry does is manage the letting on a purely legal basis, collect the money and so on.  Some of these excellent fisheries around the country are not being developed.  Where you have a good angling association or where there is a conscientious hotel owner they are being developed, but there are a number of them that, candidly, are not developed or are in a state of underdevelopment or are neglected. Where this arises, we have now a situation where they can be taken over.  It is not mandatory.  It is at the Land Commission's discretion.  If the central board or the regional board express an interest to me that a Land Commission stretch of water is neglected and should be taken over and developed I can move in and allocate it to the central or regional board, have it developed and so on and possibly lease it then to an angling club.</P>
    <P>The matter is discretionary and there is no intention to interfere with existing arrangements with angling associations and clubs.  It is designed to ensure that neglected fisheries or fisheries that are not being developed as they should be can be taken over by a body that is now being charged with the responsibility of developing these fisheries.  There is no intention of interfering with any leasing or letting arrangements that obtain between the Land Commission and angling associations who are doing their own work, or hotel interests.  All that will obtain in such cases is that the Minister for <Col N="761" /> Fisheries and Forestry and the central board will step into the shoes of the Land Commission.</P>

      <P>They apply only to indictable offences.  Under the point mentioned by Senator Molony, I am limited to a fine of £500 in the District Court, but I can go up to £2,000 and imprisonment in the case of a more serious offence on indictment.  The offences are set out in section 48.  The Senator can see that anywhere there is reference to indictment, for instance, it states that that person is liable to a fine not exceeding £1,000 or a term of imprisonment not exceeding two years.  That means a trial by a jury, in effect.  What we are doing is raising that £1,000 to £2,000.  We are not interfering with the £100-a-day point referred to by Senator Brugha or with the District Court jurisdiction which is up to a fine not exceeding £500.  There is a long list in section 48.  For clarification, we are changing subsections (3) (a), (b), (c) and (d).  For £1,000 in each of those, read £2,000.  I shall be doing the same thing on Report Stage in section 45 but I have not got the actual amendment to hand.</P>

      <P>Under the first part of the section it provides that a licence may be forfeited.  The second part relates to different offences&mdash;I hope I am reading this correctly&mdash;and where there are a number of convictions there is a consequential disqualification.  That is the second part of the section but the first part of the section is the one in which I am interested. It provides that where a person is convicted of any offence under this Act if he is the holder of a fishing licence, the court may, in addition to any other penalty, direct such licence or licences to be forfeited.  If such a licence <Col N="766" /> is forfeited can the same person apply for a licence subsequently?</P>

Where a person is convicted of a third offence under that section, the court must make an order disqualifying the person from holding a commercial licence for three years.

      <P>There is a difference between a person being disqualified from holding a licence and a licence being forfeited.

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The licences are issued on an annual basis.  This goes back to the nature of the licence.  All of these fishing licences are issued on an annual basis so what is forfeited under an order of court under this subsection is the annual fishing licence, for instance, the licence for 1979.  That means that the applicant can only apply for a licence for the year 1980.  The section goes on further to say that if there are three offences in subsequent years, he can be disqualified from holding a licence for three years but until he reaches the stage of the third offence, where there is a mandatory three years' disqualification, the only disqualification is for the year in question for which the licence is held. For the year in question he is disqualified but he may re-apply the following year.  The Senator appears to be saying that it is not clear from the subsection that it does, in fact, obtain for the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidMolony" hpid="Mr. Molony Mr. Molony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me that the courts have been given the right to order that a licence be forfeited.  Regardless of whether it is for a year or a number of years or whatever, it seems also that the Minister or the fishery board has the right to re-grant a licence the following day to a person.  He is not disqualified from holding a licence.  It is just that the licence itself is forfeited.  It is not of great consequence whether the annual licence is the case.  It does seem to me generally that it would be better if a decision was made where the court could disqualify a person holding a licence for a period of, say, three months or six months as the case may be.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidMolony" hpid="Mr. Molony Mr. Molony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will look into that aspect if it makes it more positive.  But the interpretation by the courts of that forfeiture section has been that all these licences are annual licences and that the forfeiture obtains for the balance of the period, that the licence expires at the end of the year and that the licensee has to go forward again to get a licence for the next year.  The only change we are making here is to provide for the three year forfeiture in the event of a third offence. This is the new element we have brought into the section.  Otherwise the section is taken from the Principal Act.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>This section on aquaculture brings in for the first time a regime in regard to aquaculture which has been lacking heretofore.  At present there are no statutory rights whatever beyond some rights acquired under charters and so on and vague or undefined rights held by certain people. We are setting out here the precise code or umbrella under which aquaculture can be developed in the future.  As I said in regard to one amendment already and as I shall be saying in regard to further amendments later on, while protecting the rights of the existing licensees who are operating aquaculture operations in various ways, under charter or otherwise, what we want to set out for the future is a positive regime for development so that we open up section 51 by saying it shall not be lawful for any person to engage in aquaculture save under and in accordance with a fish culture licence, an oyster bed licence, a licence granted by the Minister under this section or an oyster fishery order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With the exemption of the existing operators who are covered by the amendments I have referred to and subsequent amendments we are now initiating a new regime for this development which has been advanced to a very substantial extent by certain firms, the ESB and Guinness particularly, who have put forward some very progressive plans for development in this area, an area in which there is tremendous future for which many of the indentations <Col N="771" /> around our coast on the south-west, west and north-west are ideally suited.  It is an area in which very substantial investment in the way of research and development has to take place before money is put in.  It is an area where there is very high research, developmental and back-up investment and where such investments can be put at risk if a free-for-all is allowed.  That is the reason for what you might call a very tough drafting initiative in this section, that it shall not be lawful for any person, with the existing people&mdash;and there are only a few of them exempted&mdash;to proceed on this aquaculture basis save in accordance with certain procedures here.  This is designed to protect the sort of investment that we envisage now as going to develop in this area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidMolony" hpid="Mr. Molony Mr. Molony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not familiar with aquaculture at all.  I was curious to know is there something potentially dangerous involved in it?  It is not a criminal offence for somebody to engage in agriculture without having a licence.  Why is it necessary here?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The trouble is&mdash;and I touched on it here&mdash;the investment in it is very substantial particularly on the marine side of it.  Aquaculture, by the way, as defined here covers mariculture, sometimes &ldquo;aqua&rdquo;, water, the more genetic term, covers inland and sea. Sometimes the sea culture is referred to as aquaculture.  Aquaculture as set out here covers both inland and marine waters up to 12 miles from the coast.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This operation entails a lot of preliminary investigation, research and development.  Climatic conditions, in particular, estuaries or stretches of water have to be examined over a period of years, wind conditions, tide conditions, saline conditions and all of these aspects have to be examined in a very thorough manner before proceeding on an investment basis.  For instance, Guinness are about to embark on a fairly large investment in this area.  They have been working for many years now and are progressing to a certain level.  The ESB also conducted experiments in this area.  Other <Col N="772" /> countries such as Norway in particular have conducted experiments also.  It does require a lot of investment.  Unless there is a regime governing such investment it can be put at risk completely if there is a willy-nilly, free-for-all situation. With fish, the area is not defined. All of this type of long years of investment can be set at nought by any buccaneer who wishes to do what he or she wishes unless there is licence attaching to the areas being developed.  Again, it is the type of investment&mdash;apart from the type of research expenditure that I have already mentioned&mdash;that is prone to wrong-doing because any sort of poison can eradicate in a night the whole investment and that type of poison could be injected artificially.  I am just giving that as an example.  It is open to nefarious forms of activity.  It is very important, having regard to the back-up of investment involved and having regard to the real risks that this investment is open to, that there be a title regime to protect the people who get a licence after due inquiry as provided under this section and proceed to employ the research development to a particular investment.  It is very important that such people be protected.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasWhitaker" hpid="Dr. Whitaker Dr. Whitaker">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Whitaker</NameTxt>
      <P>My concern is not about people having to have a licence to <Col N="773" /> engage in acquaculture but about the adequacy of the protection afforded to people who have a licence against human predators.  I am concerned particularly with subsection (16) which in fact deals only with people who have an aquaculture licence.</P>
      <P>The Minister, on the Second Stage of this Bill, very kindly assured everybody concerned that those who are already engaged in what is now termed aquaculture would in fact automatically be given fish culture licences.  My first question is what degree of protection is afforded against trespass or against larceny to people who hold a fish culture licence?  It seems to me that taking the terms of subsection (16) as they stand, even if they were to apply to everyone who engages in aquaculture, it is a very poor protection to find that those who are found guilty of an offence are liable only&mdash;and apparently it is not an indictable offence as yet&mdash;to a fine not exceeding £500.  A few dozen salmon taken out of a sea cage would net you at least that amount of money. Therefore, I would suggest that offences involving stealing or poaching of fish, whether they be oysters or salmon or trout from aquaculture operations, should carry as high a fine as any other form of offence, and should be indictable.</P>
      <P>It has been argued, I understand, that there is some doubt as to whether in the case of oysters or fish in cages which are being cultivated or reared in any form of aquaculture, a charge of larceny could validly be sustained against somebody who stole these fish, the contention being that unless the fish are reduced to captivity they are still in a sense wild animals and therefore nobody could have a property in them and nobody could steal them.  I hope the Minister will be able to assure me that that is not the law here and that those who, as he has just said, have invested a lot of money in these operations are not going to be exposed to predation by people who could really flout the law, because the law regards the fish which are being reared in these cages or the oysters in an oyster bed as not being reduced to captivity and therefore not private property.</P>

      <P>I would like to support Senator Whitaker on this and appeal to the Minister to make sure that this opportunity does not go by without making sure all the loopholes in this connection are watched.  The cultivation of oysters is a very delicate operation.  I spoke on this on the Second Stage of the Bill.  Indiscriminate use of the waters in which oysters are growing could ruin the whole operation.  I take the point very well that the Minister must licence this type of activity because people not doing it properly might even ruin a neighbouring effort. It is very easy for human predators to ruin the work of years.  There has to be some basis for an ample punishment to make it a restriction and a fear.  I am not sure that it is quite right yet.</P>

      <P>As I said in regard to the earlier amendments Nos. 21 and 22, Senators Mulcahy and Whitaker can be assured that those two amendments do protect the existing rights of present operators.  They do not have to go through this procedure; the <i>status quo</i> is maintained so far as they are concerned. The further point raises a very fundamental issue in regard to the legal definition of trespass and it is not as easy as the two amendments I have mentioned. I have taken it up with the Attorney General.  There is a sort of open definition situation as to whether or not trespass is committed in relation to fish in such cages, and whether the law of trespass applies as a protection to such operators.  That is a point that is not strictly related to this Bill; it is a point related to the general law of trespass.  I have taken it up with the Attorney General with a view to devising some method of pinning this offence down &mdash;in other words for guarding such fish in cages or traps as being trespassable as it were for the purpose for the offence of traspass and so give the protection of the general law to the operator.  At the present time the general law of criminal trespass does not apply and the operator is under an obligation to protect his or her property, whereas if the general criminal law of trespass applied to this particular type of case, then the State would have the law to protect that person just as the State has the law and <Col N="775" /> the duty to protect anybody's property. That point is being teased out with the Attorney General and I hope to have a suitable amendment for Report Stage which will cover it.</P>
      <P>The other point that has been concerning the two Senators has been met. As far as existing operators are concerned, the joint effect of amendments Nos. 21 and 22, is to put the existing operators&mdash;I think there are six altogether&mdash;into the same situation as a licensee will be in respect of protection without having to go through the procedures that will have to apply in regard to any subsequent applications for a licence under this section.  The existing licensees are deemed to be people who hold a licence as if they had obtained it under this section, as if they had gone through the procedures to qualify for a licence under this section.  They are protected.</P>
      <P>The further point in regard to the law of trespass, as far as they are concerned, the criminal law of trespass, is one that I am taking up with the Attorney General and I hope to have a suitable amendment for Report Stage.  It is not a simple matter: it is a matter of getting a definition of the whole area of trespass that will encompass this offence.</P>

      <P>While the Minister was speaking something occurred to me that might make it more concrete.  It is the difference between rowing quietly over the area on which oyster culture has been laid or tearing over it at 50 miles an hour.  It is tricky, particularly when you come to deal with devices for stringing oysters.  How do you protect those?  We have a problem here.</P>

      <P>On a point of order in relation to legal efficiency, I have always advocated that in circumstances like this where a human predator, as he has been described in the debate on this section, goes in and does damage, or steals from or interferes with a plan such as this and causes the owner of the plan or the licensee to be at a loss, it should be an indictable offence.  I would also ask the Minister to consider giving the court the power to impose what is known as a compensatory fine so as to avoid the necessity of duplication of proceedings.  If the court at the criminal stage cannot provide for the imposition of a compensatory fine on the defendant it would be necessary for the victim afterwards or the licensee to issue civil proceedings against the predator.  It is something that ran into difficulties before on a jurisdiction point.  I would ask the Minister to consider that if he is considering making it an indictable offence.</P>

The word &ldquo;trespass&rdquo; is used in relation to property that is owned by a corporation or private person.  At the moment this area is part of the sea; it is not private property.  It is probably held by the Department of Transport and Power or some body like that, but it is not private.

      <P>There are several aspects there, (a) health, (b) pollution and (c) potential damage to other fish life.  The erection of fish farms internally is a very tricky engineering matter.  A number of them have been built with grants from the State over the years and some of them are very successful but the criteria that go into the assessment of whether or not they should get the right are very important criteria because if you let artificial fish life run riot in a river system you can destroy natural fish.  You can cause all kinds of health or hygienic hazards or pollution hazards; so, it has to be a controlled type of enterprise with proper safeguards and so on.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 34:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="780" /> In page 54, before section 57, to insert the following new section:</P>
    <P>57.  The Commissioners of Public Works shall not submit a drainage scheme to the Minister for Finance in accordance with section 7 (1) (c) of the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945 without the agreement of the Central Board.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This amendment was designed to cover the point I raised on the Second Stage concerning drainage schemes and the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945.  The situation that pertains at the moment is that the Commissioners of Public Works must consult with the Minister but they do not have to receive his permission for a drainage work which may involve fishery areas or particular lakes, rivers or streams which may affect lakes, rivers or streams in which the Minister has an interest and which are well known for their fishery resources.  The aim of the amendment is to ensure that the Commissioners of Public Works receive the Minister's permission.  One of the problems that comes up specifically is in connection with drainage.  When a river is drained the work may, besides affecting the actual spawning beds and so on in the river, in fact lower lake levels. This has happened and this perhaps is more serious than the effect on the contours of the river bed because lowering lake levels can produce this utrification problem which we have in a number of our lakes around the country.  This seems to be an irreversible process.  To ensure that sort of thing does not happen or, at least, if it happens, it has not been foreseen by the Minister and, to give him power to prohibit the Commissioners of Public Works from carrying out certain drainage schemes which would damage fisheries, with Senator Martin, I put down this amendment which means that the commissioners would have to have the agreement of the central board rather than just have the consultative arrangement.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I referred to this in my reply on the Second Stage.  The existing provisions work.  All I can do is assure the Seanad and the Senator that is the case.  There is ample consultation <Col N="781" /> between the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry and the Office of Public Works in regard to what precautions should be taken, what provisions should be made in any drainage scheme for fishing life. The consultation procedure is working excellently.  In fact, rehabilitation measures are taken as a matter of course in all rivers where drainage schemes are undertaken.  That has been the case for some years.  In fact the chief engineer in my Department is an expert in regard to drainage operations.  He is well known as such in the public service and he is automatically consulted by the Board of Works in any scheme relating to the rehabilitation of fish life.  In fact, there is an excellent pamphlet about the Corrib&mdash;Galway scheme which is his own particular work in conjunction with the very intricate engineering operations in connection with the levels of the Corrib which changed during the course of the Corrib drainage scheme and it has led to the enhancement of fish life generally in the Corrib area.</P>
      <P>What happens occasionally, and this gives rise to misconceptions, is that the areas of fish life may change by reason of the drainage operation.  Area A may not continue to be a fish life area but area B, which did not have fish life before may become so.  In the overall the combined operations undertaken by the chief engineer and his staff of my Department with the Office of Public Works under the consultation procedure, which is already there under the 1945 Arterial Drainage Act, have worked out well in practice.  If I thought there was a need for this amendment in the practical administration sense, I would gladly adopt it.  I go the whole way with Senator West in the spirit and principle embodied in the amendment. What I am saying is that it is not really necessary and requires an amendment of an arterial drainage statute which lays down this consultation procedure and in my view would not be appropriate from the drafting point of view for inclusion here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, if I was under any apprehension that existing procedures were not working, I would run to adopt an amendment of this kind and have it in <Col N="782" /> the Bill.  I agree fully with the spirit of it, but as I said, it is working at the moment and is well accepted administratively between the two bodies concerned&mdash;my Department and the Office of Public Works.  The Office of Public Works are highly conscious of their obligations in this area, and I would like to hear otherwise from any Senator.  From our experience the consultation procedure is working very well.  The Office of Public Works do not touch a river for drainage without total consultation with my Department regarding its fishery aspects.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyWest" hpid="Dr. West Dr. West">
      <NameTxt>Dr. West</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very glad to hear that assurance from the Minister.  I would be worried that in the future, with increasing pressure on water resources&mdash;industrial and agricultural pressures&mdash;the fisheries interests may not be taken into account fully as they are now.  I am also glad to hear the Department have such good relations with the commissioners. This may at any time depend on certain individuals in each Department and that also could change with time.  That worries me somewhat.  I will not press the amendment but I hope that in five years' time we do not come across situations in which the fishery interests are trodden under foot and steamrolled because of big financial interests involved in a drainage scheme and that we regret that the Seanad did not put this amendment into the Bill and give the Minister for Fisheries some definite powers in this regard.</P>

      <P>I want to repeat what I said.  I am in full accord with what Senator West stated here, but I want to assure him that automatically there is written into any drainage scheme submitted to the Minister for Finance for approval a specific section relating to the rehabilitation of fisheries.  This is an integral part of any such drainage scheme. This rehabilitation section of the drainage scheme incorporates aspects like restocking, the creation of specific fishery pools where others have to go, the replacement of spawning gravels, new spawning beds, where other spawning beds have to go and so on.  That is now a matter of practice.  That has been <Col N="783" /> established for some years and it will continue.  The Seanad can be assured that the matter in practice, is being looked after.</P>

      <P>(2)  Subsection (1) of this section shall not be construed as affecting the power conferred on the Minister for Tourism and Transport by section 10 of the Foreshore Act, 1933.</P>

    <P>(5)  Section 261 of the Principal Act is hereby amended by the substitution of &ldquo;in such manner as he shall consider appropriate having had regard to the circumstances by reason of which the order's amendment is necessitated&rdquo; for all the words from, &ldquo;and all&rdquo; to the end of the section, and the said section 261, as so amended, is set out in paragraph 2 of the Table to this section.</P>

    <P>1.  256.&mdash;Subject to section 11 and to the provisions of this Chapter the Minister may make orders for the establishment or improvement and for the maintenance and regulation of an oyster fishery on or above the shore and bed of the sea or of an estuary or tidal river above or below or partly above and partly below low-water mark (which said shore and bed are in this Chapter referred to as the seashore), and including, if desirable, provisions for the constitution of a board or body corporate for the purpose of such order, on an application to the Minister by any person desirous of obtaining such an order.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The difficulty here again arises from legal matters.  There is some <Col N="785" /> legal doubt as to whether some modern methods of oyster culture&mdash;I am thinking here of raft culture, for instance, and other similar methods used where oysters are reared off the floor or bed of the sea&mdash;are covered by licences issued under section 245 of the Principal Act. We are back to the legal area we touched on earlier.  The purpose of subsection (1) is to remove this doubt and these licences will cease to be issued when section 51 comes into operation. Therefore, it will only affect licences current at that date.  In subsection (2) the placing of structures on the foreshore is subject to licence by the Minister for Tourism and Transport.  This subsection is necessary to maintain the requirement because of the amendment provided in subsection (1).  Subsection (3) makes it an offence to interfere with the structures referred to in subsection (1) and is an effort to extend that subsection. Subsection (4) provides for an amendment to section 256 of the Principal Act under which oyster fishery orders are granted for the same purpose as in subsection (1).</P>
      <P>On subsection (5), section 261 of the Principal Act empowers the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry to amend oyster fishery orders and requires the same procedures&mdash;publication of notices, holding public inquiries and so on&mdash;as applies when an application for an order is considered initially.  This procedure is unwieldy and unnecessary, especially when an order is being amended with the agreement of the holder of the order or where it is considered necessary to do so in the public interest.</P>
      <P>Subsection (6) makes it an offence to interfere with the structures or devices which are covered by oyster fishery orders in accordance with subsection (4) and is an extension of that subsection.</P>
      <P>What we have here is a clarification of the position regarding the whole area of oyster culture.  The particular amendments are designed to tie down the Principal Act and to ensure that the position is clarified from the legal point of view.</P>

    <P>Government amendment No. 34B:</P>
    <P>In page 57, between lines 53 and 54, to insert the following new section:</P>
    <P>65.&mdash;Section 297 of the Principal Act is hereby amended by the substitution of the following subsections for subsection (2):</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(2) (a) Subject to subsection (3) of this section, a warrant issued under this section shall operate to authorise the person to whom it is issued (and named therein) at any reasonable time or times within seven days of the issue of the warrant to&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  enter and search, if need be by force, the garden, dwellinghouse or curtilage thereof named in the warrant,</P>

    <P>(iii)  require a person who is in occupation or is in control or is concerned in the management of such land to furnish to him his name and address,</P>
    <P>and if the person so named has reasonable grounds for suspecting that an offence has been or is being committed under this Act with or in relation to anything found in the course of the search, the person may seize and detain that thing or anything else so found which appears to him to be something which might be required as evidence in proceedings for an offence under this Act.</P>
    <P>(b) Subject to subsection (3) of this section, a warrant issued under this section shall operate to enable any one or more of the following, namely, any member of the Garda Síochána, any officer of the Minister and, in case the warrant is issued to an officer of a regional board, any other person employed by that board to accompany and assist the person to whom the warrant is issued in the exercise of the powers thereby conferred on him.</P>

      <Col N="787" /> (3) The powers conferred on a person named in a warrant issued under this section shall be exercisable by the person as regards a dwellinghouse only if, and only for so long as, he is accompanied by a member of the Garda Síochána.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a new section proposing to amend section 297 of the Principal Act.  It gives powers to District Justices to grant warrants to enter any enclosed garden, dwellinghouse and so on in order to enforce the fishery laws. Section 297 of the Principal Act made provision for the grant of the warrant but did not empower the holder to do other than enter the place where he suspected a breach of the Fisheries Acts was being committed.  This again is touching on the point Senator Whitaker raised regarding the unfortunate Common Law and statutory limitations on the power of the State in this area.  The warrant itself under the section of the Principal Act did not empower the holder to do anything other than enter the place where he suspected a breach of the Fisheries Act had been committed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The section, as amended, spells out the power of search and seizure which goes to the holder of the warrant, and in entering a private dwelling the holder must be accompanied by a member of the Garda Síochána.  This amendment will strengthen considerably the hand of the protection staff in locating poached fish.  That is its main purpose.  I do not want to go into too much detail but everybody is aware of the extent of unlicensed and illegal fishing that is causing severe damage in particular to our salmon stocks.  We are convinced that one of the main ways in which this illegal fishing is being facilitated lies in the comparative ease with which such illegally caught fish can be disposed of.  In this respect we have gone through this Bill with a fine comb to ensure that everything possible will be done in the Bill, as we have done in regulations already, to strengthen the hand of the protection staff and the Garda enforcement. Where poached fish are located in a deep freezer&mdash;which is an expanding outlet for illegally caught fish, and we know that there has been an increase in <Col N="788" /> the number of such deep freezers around the country&mdash;we are seeking to give greater powers of actual search and seizure to the warrant holder, who heretofore could not do anything except go into the place and look around.  Now we are giving him power to actually go in, search and seize.  He will have power to enter, open a freezer, seize the salmon and depart, and is given the full protection of the law under this amendment.</P>

      <P>This amendment is substituted for amendment No. 35.  This is the article in the Schedule that relates to the filling of casual vacancies among the elected members of regional boards.  As it is drafted, the Bill would enable a board to fill a casual vacancy amongst its elected members by co-opting any person.  It is only right that if a person elected from a particular panel leaves a board, he should be replaced by a person representing a similar interest.  The purpose of the amendment is to meet this particular point.  As drafted, this part of the Schedule left it open for representatives from some other interests to be co-opted.  I want to ensure that if there is a vacancy arising it will be filled by a person representing the same interests. The board under this amendment must appoint the first person on the panel of unsuccessful candidates in the last election. If there is no one on a particular panel a member of the electorate for the same panel or any other candidate may be appointed.  In other words, we are ensuring that the panel representation is maintained.</P>

      <P>May I refer to the point I raised earlier about membership of the regional boards in regard to Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  I can see that the argument might not be as strong with regard to the central board, it having a closer relationship with the Minister, and perhaps it might not be as pertinent a point with regard to membership of the central board.  May I have the Minister's views on this?  The other point I raised is that if a person becomes nominated for election to either House of the Oireachtas he ceases to be a member of the central board.  I think that is a bit harsh.  If the Minister is going to retain the disqualifications provided for in section 2 of the same Schedule he <Col N="790" /> should delete section 9 (1).  I do not think it will add to a person's candidature that he can say that he is still currently a member.  He will say he is a member if it is any use to him, and if he failed in the election and was a valuable member of the board, it would be a pity if he had gone from it.</P>

      <P>This is an omission in the Principal Act.  Under section 298 of the Principal Act, as adopted in this Schedule, by Article 1, gardaí and officers of the Minister or of a regional board are empowered to board and examine the certificate of registry and the fishing engines of a fishing vessel.  Section 298 (2) as adapted here also makes it an offence for the master of a fishing vessel to refuse to show the certificate of registry of his vessel to the officer of the Minister or of a regional board.  Obviously it should be an offence <Col N="792" /> also to refuse to show a certificate of registry to a garda as he is empowered to examine it.  What we are doing here is bringing the Garda into the situation as well as the Minister's officer and the officer of the regional board, but the Garda have the same power of prosecution and enforcement as have the board officers or officers of the Minister.  This amendment is to remedy an omission that existed in the Principal Act.  The Garda for some reason were excluded in the Principal Act and we are rightly including them by this amendment so as to correct the omission.</P>

      <P>This is a formidable piece of drafting and will make reading the Fisheries (Consolidation) Act, 1959, nearly impossible.  While I am aware that there are pressures on the Minister and the officers of his Department, I would nevertheless urge on him to consolidate the Fisheries Acts as soon as possible.  They are obviously going to be in great demand by lawyers and others, and it would be of great assistance to everybody concerned with the subject if we could have a single Act into which all these amendments were incorporated.  It would be extremely difficult now to read the fishery laws of the country having regard to the way they are being amended by this Schedule.  I realise and appreciate that the amendments are inevitable, but it would be well nigh impossible to read the law and most confusing. That is my first point.  What is the position if a person is refused a licence by the appropriate board?  Is there any right of appeal to any other authority because he is refused a rod licence?</P>

      <P>There is no specific right of appeal&mdash;but I presume there is a <Col N="793" /> general right to go to the courts&mdash;in regard to the refusal by a board to grant a salmon rod licence or drift net licence application.  They have to observe the criteria set out in the law in regard to any granting or refusing of an application. It would be a general legal right residing in anybody who was unjustly refused a licence to mandate the board to grant a licence if they acted illegally or if they did not observe the rules. There is no right of appeal to a minor court, as it were, from such a decision as I understand it.</P>

      <P>These powers enable me to bring in such a licence if I want to, but, as of now, they are in suspension. An earlier section enables me to bring in a licensing provision by way of order.  I make an order declaring the section to operate and then the licence situation can obtain.  What I have done in the Bill is to provide on the basis of a voluntary contribution&mdash;what is written in the Bill is a voluntary register system.  Section 80 of the Principal Act is an enabling section.  Section 81 states that trout and trout rod licence shall be of three kinds and they are set out, as is the area of <Col N="794" /> validity and so on.  These licences are suspended, as it were, at present and I am not bringing in any such licensing scheme under this Bill.  I am bringing in instead a voluntary registration system. By way of order I can invoke the sections of the Principal Act that provide for a trout licence system and in fact probably will do so if the time comes when it is appropriate to do so.  It can only be brought in by me by way of order, instead of relying on the good sense of people to contribute voluntarily, to get on to the register of trout owners or coarse anglers or trout, coarse or sea fishermen.  I am doing it on a voluntary basis rather than a compulsory basis, but I am empowered to do it on a compulsory basis on a licence system and I will bring it in by way of order which I must place before each House of the Oireachtas.</P>

      <P>This is actually one of these situations where people became very emotive.  People spoke about their traditional God-given rights to fish freely and so on.  We never had a licensing system implemented for trout and coarse fish, as we did for salmon.  The associations themselves were in favour of the licences.  They saw the merit in collecting the revenue for the development of the trout fisheries and in particular the development of coarse fisheries.  The relevant associations were strongly in favour and still are but when you got down to the nitty gritty of the public, there was a large public deputation.  This is an area about which I feel very strongly. Goodwill is terribly important because we are not going to protect or develop our fisheries unless there is goodwill among our people.  That is a fact.  No amount of regulations or enforcement or penalties will ensure the protection or rehabilitation of fisheries unless there is goodwill on the ground.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a gesture of goodwill I brought in <Col N="795" /> this voluntary registration system.  I can, if necessary, bring in the other system, of statutory authority to do so, and if&mdash;as I hope, will happen&mdash;there is a realisation of the importance of our inland fisheries.  People will see the need to finance their rehabilitation, to finance spawning bed development, to finance clearance, to finance factories, to do all the multifarious things that are required to develop our fisheries.  The system of statutory authority will be appreciated when it is seen that any such funds will go solely towards fisheries administration. I want to emphasise that.  The levy that is introduced here, the salmon rod licence fee, the salmon dealers' licence fee, all the various ways of collecting revenue, will go direct towards the financing of the administration envisaged by this Bill.  I hope that all anglers will see the wisdom of making a contribution towards this.  I should like to do it in stages, first on a voluntary basis and I hope, when people see where their money is going, the climate will be created in which I can, by way of order, bring in the licence system across the board.  That is my present thinking on the matter.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaireGeoghehanQuinn" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Industry, Commerce and Energy (Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn) Minister of State at the Department of Industry, Commerce and Energy (Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry, Commerce and Energy (Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to make more effective provision for the development in the national interest of the mineral resources of the State.</P>
      <P>Basically, the reason for this Bill is that the provisions in the Minerals Development Act, 1940, for the compulsory acquisition of unworked, privately-owned minerals are of uncertain legal validity and can no longer be operated with safety.  The House is generally aware of the background to this circumstance.  Briefly, what happened was that in 1970 the discovery of a significant lead-zinc deposit in a prospecting licence area at Nevinstown, County Meath, was announced.  Subsequently, detailed investigations showed that the deposit extended to other townlands and as ownership of the minerals in the area was mixed, including those at Nevinstown which were privately-owned, the then Minister made a Minerals Acquisition Order on 15 March 1971 covering all unworked minerals except, of course, State minerals in the area concerned.  Some few days after the making of the order, a third party effected purchase of the surface lands and mineral rights of a farm at Nevinstown within the area of the then known deposit and challenged, in the High Court, the validity of the acquisition order and the constitutionality of the 1940 Act.</P>
      <P>In a reserved judgment delivered in April 1973 the President of the High Court held that the order was invalid. The then Minister appealed the High Court's decision but the Supreme Court, in a reserved judgment delivered in March 1974 upheld the decision of the High Court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The grounds in both cases were that the order did not specify with reasonable <Col N="798" /> particularity the nature, situation and extent of the minerals being acquired, which the court held was required under section 14 of the Minerals Development Act, 1940, under which the order was made.  In the circumstances, the court found it unnecessary to rule on other grounds on which the acquisition order had been challenged, including whether in section 14, which makes no reference to the giving of prior notice by the Minister, there is an implied obligation arising from the requirements of natural justice that such notice be given, the constitutionality of the acquisition provisions under that section and of the provisions for compensation.</P>
    <P>Subsequent advice by counsel, however, was to the effect that the acquisition provisions of section 14 of the 1940 Act, if applied in future, would almost certainly be challenged on grounds of validity and again raise the question of the constitutional validity of the Act.  Accordingly, it is now the position that there are no effective means readily available to secure the development of unworked minerals in private ownership in appropriate cases.</P>
    <P>It is desirable, in the national interest, to ensure that companies doing exploration work here should have reasonable assurance that, if they discover a deposit and produce development plans which are acceptable to the State and other appropriate authorities, they will not be prevented from proceeding with those plans because of legal problems on the ownership issue.  It will be appreciated that any effective remedy to the existing situation must, of necessity, affect the rights of ownership of property.  It has been necessary to seek an equitable and acceptable way of dealing with this difficult problem and for that reason the Bill has not been an easy one to prepare.</P>
    <P>The Constitution acknowledges the right to private ownership and prohibits any law attempting to abolish this right. It also provides that the exercise of this right ought to be regulated by the principles of social justice and that the State may, as occasion requires, delimit by law the exercise of these rights, with a view to reconciling their exercise with the exigencies of the common good. <Col N="799" /> Thus, the solution proposed in the Bill is to vest the exclusive right of working minerals in the Minister.  I am satisfied that the vesting proposal comes within what might be called the constitutional dispensation to which I have referred and, from the economic and practical point of view, the exigencies of the common good require, or at least justify, control by the State of all unworked minerals in the State in the manner provided in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The memorandum circulated with the Bill explains its purpose and that of the various provisions.  Accordingly, in dealing with it now I intend to concentrate only on the principal features of the Bill. Briefly, the Bill provides for:</P>
    <P>&mdash;the vesting in the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy of the exclusive right of working minerals,</P>
    <P>&mdash;the granting by the Minister of a lease or licence to any person giving that person the exclusive right to work minerals in respect of which rights are vested in the Minister,</P>
    <P>&mdash;the payment of compensation to persons entitled to any estate or interest in the minerals the mining rights of which are vested in the Minister, and</P>
    <P>&mdash;the making of certain amendments to the Minerals Development Act, 1940 which experience has shown to be desirable, as well as a number of repeals in consequence of proposals in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Rights to work mines of minerals being lawfully worked or being planned for working at the date of the initiation of the Bill in the Dáil, that is, 15 December 1978, are specifically excepted from vesting in the Minister on the passing of the Act.  Other exclusions from the scope of the Bill are stone, gravel, sand or clay, and petroleum as defined in the Petroleum and Other Minerals Development Act, 1960.</P>
    <P>Part I of the Bill deals with matters of a preliminary and general nature.  The Bill, when enacted, will be construed with the Minerals Development Acts, 1940 and 1960, which constitute our basic mining laws.  Section 4 provides for <Col N="800" /> a change in the composition of the Mining Board by requiring that henceforth both ordinary members shall be property arbitrators.  Under the existing legislation one of the ordinary members is an officer of the Minister.  In view of the changes being made by the Bill, and, in particular, changes in the role of the board, it is important that the board should be seen to be an independent body.</P>
    <P>Section 6 provides that the interest of persons under disability, or unascertained, will be represented in proceedings before the Mining Board or the court.  In the context of the problems associated with the determination of title to minerals ownership and of tracing owners, a provision of this nature is seen as highly desirable.</P>
    <P>Section 7 provides for the appointment of assessors to assist the court in any proceedings under the Bill.  This will enable the court to have technical advice readily available to it throughout the proceedings.</P>
    <P>Section 11 provides for repeals.  The repeal of section 70 of the 1940 Act ensures that an aggrieved party will have a right of appeal to the High Court on a question of fact as well as of law.  In the main, the other repeals listed in the Schedule to the Bill are as a consequence of proposals in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Part II of the Bill contains provisions for the vesting of the exclusive right of working minerals in the Minister, subject to a number of exceptions under section 13 to which I have referred.</P>
    <P>Section 15 empowers the Minister to apply to the Mining Board to have the registration of minerals as excepted minerals cancelled, where it appears to him that they are not being worked. Again, as in the case of section 14, the ultimate jurisdiction of the Superior Courts is preserved and there is provision for the serving of notice by the Mining Board on such persons as may appear to the board to have an interest in the proceedings.</P>
    <P>Section 16 empowers the Minister to grant a licence to any person to work State minerals, which, by definition, include exclusive mining rights vested in the Minister under the Bill.  The Minister <Col N="801" /> already has the power to grant a lease in respect of State minerals under Part IV of the 1940 Act.  In future cases, therefore, the Minister will have power to grant either a lease or a licence to enable minerals to be worked, depending on whatever instrument is most appropriate to the particular case.</P>
    <P>It is also provided in this section that the Minister, with the concurrence of the Minister for Finance, may take a participating interest in the working of the minerals and that he may so provide in the conditions attaching to a lease or licence.  This is an enabling provision, designed to ensure that the Minister would be in a position to specify State participation as a condition of a lease or licence.  It is not necessary, nor do I think it is desirable, to attempt to formulate the precise policy lines which would apply to State participation.  The State has the duty, in the national interest, to ensure that a reasonable and equitable share of the profits from the development of a deposit accrues to the Exchequer.  Furthermore, the State must, again in the national interest, have the power to ensure that the development plans are drawn up and implemented in an optimum way.  The extent, if any, to which participation by the State may be desirable, for the purpose of achieving one or both of these objectives, cannot be determined on a theoretical basis, but on the basis of the circumstances peculiar to each individual deposit of minerals.</P>
    <P>Section 17 provides for the giving of prior notice by the Minister where he proposes to work minerals, or to grant, or give an undertaking to grant, a lease or licence to work them.  It is also provided in this section that, as far as practicable, individual notice would be given to persons who appear to the Minister to have an estate or interest in the minerals and that such persons should be given a reasonable opportunity of making representations to the Minister in the matter.  Similarly, it is provided that the Minister may refer the representations to the Mining Board and, indeed, must do so where the person making the representations so requires, by application to the Minister. The board's consideration of the <Col N="802" /> representations will take the form of an inquiry.</P>
    <P>Section 18 provides for the publication of a notice by the Minister where he commences to work, or grants a lease or a licence to work any minerals which are State minerals by virtue of this Bill.  The object is to alert those entitled to any estate or interest in the minerals to these facts.  Compensation claims will be indicative of title and at this point the pattern of ownership will begin to emerge. As in the case of notices under section 17, there is also provision here for individual notices to persons who have claimed to be entitled to any estate or interest in the minerals.</P>
    <P>Part III deals exclusively with the arrangements for compensating those with title to minerals, the mining rights which are vested in the Minister under the Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 19 establishes the right to compensation of every person with title to the minerals immediately preceding the date of the enactment of the Bill.  It is envisaged that the compensation will, in the normal way, be related to the commercial potential of the minerals, and will accrue as and when the minerals are being developed.</P>
    <P>Section 20 states that compensation will be paid by the Minister; this is in line with the position in the 1940 Act relating to compensation for State acquired minerals.  There will be no change in the existing procedure whereby the Minister will recoup compensation payments from the lessee of the minerals.</P>
    <P>It is provided in section 21 that, in default of agreement, any question arising as to the entitlement of any person to compensation, or as to the amount, will be settled by the Mining Board.  It is also provided in this section that where the Minister, or the claimant for compensation, is dissatisfied with the board's findings, there will be a right to apply to the court to settle the matter.  There is also provision for the revision of an award, in the event of a change in circumstances not foreseen at the time of the original award.  I think the reasons for this provision are obvious and further elaboration is hardly necessary.</P>
    <P>Section 22 states the basis for the assessment of compensation, which is to <Col N="803" /> be fair and reasonable, having regard to all the circumstances of the case.  While the section does not place any restriction on the form the compensation should take, it indicates, however, what would be the usual basis of a compensation award of this kind, namely, that it would be based on such proportion of the net profits arising in consequence of the working of the minerals as is attributable to the minerals as they existed in their natural condition prior to such working. Essentially, this would take account of the pre-extraction value of the minerals in terms of their contribution to the mining operation.  It is further provided that where it appears to the Mining Board, or the court, that compensation in the form of periodical payments would not, of itself, be appropriate, then the board or the court may, in its discretion, award compensation in the form of a lump sum payment, or partly in that form and partly in the form of periodical payments.</P>
    <P>The scheme of compensation has had to be designed to ensure, on the one hand, that awards will not be such as to frustrate economic mining and, on the other hand, that the owner will receive reasonable and equitable compensation for his minerals.  I am satisfied that the proposals in the Bill make adequate provision for the achievement of these very essential objectives.</P>
    <P>I believe that the proposals in this Bill will substantially eliminate the difficulties which have arisen with regard to minerals development.  It should enable the State and the mining companies to deal with this in a practical way and in a manner which is equitable for people who have clear title to mineral rights. However, technically, it will not settle the rather complicated position of ownership of mineral rights.  The legal position is that some mineral rights are clearly owned by the State, some can be legally established as in private ownership and there is a grey area where ownership cannot be established in a definite way.</P>
    <P>In an earlier draft of the Bill the Minister had set out to secure clarification of this position by a process of compulsory <Col N="804" /> registration of title.  The scheme he had in mind was that the area of a minerals deposit would be designated as one in respect of which the mineral rights would have to be registered. Persons claiming to own mineral rights in the area would be given a period of time within which to secure registration of their title and an appeals procedure was provided for.  These proposals envisaged that when the period for registration had expired and subject to the results of any consequential appeals, all minerals in the area which had not been registered as privately owned minerals would automatically become the property of the State.  These proposals were considered by a number of legal experts and the consensus of their opinion was that such a scheme would present very considerable difficulties. It became clear that, if it were to incorporate the safeguards necessary to overcome these difficulties, then the improvement on the existing situation would, if any, be marginal.</P>
    <P>We must, of course, accept the views of these legal experts and, for that reason, the Minister decided not to include anything in the Bill dealing with this particular matter.  I should, however, say that the Minister has not abandoned the idea that some further improvement in this direction may be possible and he intends to have the position considered. While the proposals which the Minister had in mind, or some modification of them, would be a desirable supplement to the provisions of the existing Bill, they are not by any means as important to a resolution of the existing problems as are the provisions of the Bill.  For that reason the Minister felt it was desirable to press ahead with the Bill as now drafted because he is satisfied that it will provide substantial resolution of the difficulties which have existed since the court proceedings to which I have referred.</P>
    <P>While the Bill is, therefore, an important measure, it has a fairly limited purpose which is to deal with the difficulties arising from the court decision to which I have referred.  I am satisfied that it does this in a manner which conforms to the provisions of the Constitution and at the <Col N="805" /> same time provides a satisfactory and workable basis for administering policy on minerals exploration and development. In this regard, it will continue to be the policy to encourage the widest spread of exploration by mining interests and to create a climate where there can be confidence in the future of mining in this country.</P>
    <P>There are other important and possibly controversial areas which are not dealt with in the Bill; for instance, it does not attempt to deal with the question of whether the State should adopt a more active role in minerals exploration and development.  I believe that it would not be appropriate to attempt to link a major policy issue of this kind with the rather technical matters which are dealt with in the present Bill.  This is not to say that the question of a State role in the minerals sector does not merit consideration. I believe it does, but this consideration should be critical and it should not be carried out on the basis of preconceived ideas.  The problem of the right to work minerals, which is dealt with in this Bill, is one which must be tackled, no matter what role might be envisaged or adopted for the State in exploring and developing minerals.</P>
    <P>I commend this Bill to the House.  The comments and discussion on it up to this time seem to suggest that there is no substantial divergence of views on the need for the measure.  I believe that the Bill will, when it comes into force, operate as an incentive towards continued operations here by mining interests, so that our mineral resources will be explored and developed in a continuing and committed manner.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the practice of the House requires me to declare an interest in this field, in that my professional firm acts for, and has acted for, the company that made the Navan find and, indeed, a large number of other prospecting companies which never succeeded in discovering anything, and other firms, one of which I am, in fact, a director.  I have obviously gathered information from dealing with these people over the years.  My opinions are very much my own and I am wholly <Col N="806" /> responsible for them.  I want to assist the House on what is, I feel, the most radical Bill that the House has had to deal with in this session and, perhaps, the most radical Bill that I have had to deal with since becoming a Senator, in so far as it is a very significant delimitation of what may be very important property rights. The Minister said that there was no substantial divergence on the need for the measure.  May I immediately say that I in no way diverge from the view that this measure is needed.  This measure, or something very like it, is very much needed.  We have a very serious problem and this Bill is a very genuine effort to cope with that problem.  I most sincerely hope that it will do so successfully.  If there is anything that I can suggest, in the course of this debate, which will improve it in the manner of its coping with this very serious problem, I should feel very happy to be able to make a contribution.</P>
      <P>What is the problem?  We should look at it starkly.  The fact of the matter is that since the upset by the court of the acquisition order which was made following the discovery of the Navan mine, there has not been, published at any rate, any discovery of any other mineral resources in this country.  That was more than five years ago.  What this Bill is trying to do is to clear out of the way a legal obstacle which has been there, obstructing the development of the mineral resources of this country, very much against the interests of the Irish people.  I very much welcome the successful coping with that obstruction. I shall not go into the details of it; there is no need to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The whole legal structure on which policy was founded, in effect, capsized with the findings of the Supreme Court with regard to the effective non-operability of the minerals acquisition section, section 14, of the 1940 Act.  The court did not find, although it might have done so, if it had been pressed, that the mineral acquisition procedure was in itself unconstitutional.  Indeed, the President of the High Court, who gave his judgment before it reached the Supreme Court, held to the contrary.  If this Bill went even further than it does, and went <Col N="807" /> to the point of a total State acquisition of the privately owned mineral resources of this country, it would be my view that that acquisition, in the circumstances in which this country finds itself, in the factual economic position which we have with regard to these mineral resources, would be held to be a delimitation of the exercise of property rights which according to the principles of social justice would be found to meet the exigencies of the common good.</P>
    <P>As far as I am concerned, the Minister need have no hesitation in converting what is a proposal to take and vest in the Minister an exclusive right of working minerals into a total acquisition of the mineral resources of this country in private hands because their existence in private hands has been an obstacle to development by the State or on behalf of the State, development by developers, development by lessees.  The wraith, the ghost of old property rights in the mineral resources has proved to be and is preventing the growth of real property rights in the valuable resources which might be discovered if that wraith were taken away.</P>
    <P>I do not want to go into the detail of it.  There is no need to go into the detail of it but I think just a broad summary of the thing, if I am summarising correctly and I hope I am, is worth while.  Broadly speaking, theoretically and in law you could always sever the ownership of minerals from the ownership of land. You could have a freehold interest in your land and not own the minerals.  The minerals could be severed from the land. Historically this happened and when the lands of Ireland came to be vested in the tenant proprietors of Ireland, all the Acts &mdash;I think I am correct to say&mdash;up to the 1903 Act left these mineral rights in the landlords or in the lessees of the landlords or in the Crown or in some other superior interest, and these residual mineral rights are speckled all over Ireland.  The speckling is still further added to by the fact that when they came to vest the lands under the 1903 Act, they did not vest the mineral rights of the landlord or the vendor in the Land Commission if the vendor at <Col N="808" /> the time of vesting was working the minerals himself.</P>
    <P>Similarly under the 1923 Act when it was all taken into State ownership, if on the appointed day the minerals were being worked by the owner or by a lessee of the owner, then they remained with him.  They never came into the State but unfortunately under the machinery for the acquisition of these lands nobody in those times thought that there were mineral resources around.  Nobody bothered about it, and so the amount of information that is available as to whether or not they were being worked is nothing like adequate to establish that the State owns them because they were not being worked by the landlords.</P>
    <P>If you are prospecting in modern circumstances you may be prospecting a vast tract of land which might be 1,000 acres, which might be owned by 40, 50 or 60 people, all with separate and different titles.  Somewhere in the middle of that 1,000 acres where your prospecting was going on, you might find that the State could not prove that it owned that portion there and the whole development of the mine might be obstructed because the State could not make a good title to the person or the company that wanted to do the development.  If we are talking about mineral discoveries of substance, the money involved is not thousands or millions of pounds, it is tens of millions of pounds which comes in from financiers who want to be sure that the title is good.</P>
    <P>That was all very fine until the procedure which was invented and was in the 1940 Act whereby the Minister would give an undertaking in the course of a prospecting that he would give a lease to the prospector if he was successful in his prospecting operations.  That was all very fine if the Minister could come in and make a minerals acquisition order, but when the procedure under section 14 of the Minerals Acquisition Act was faulted by the court, then people were prospecting and they were likely to have the experience that the people had in Navan when they found a mine on land the State did not own and when someone could come in, take advantage of their discovery and buy the mine from <Col N="809" /> the person who did own it.  The undertaking of the State to lease to the man who found it could not be fulfilled because the State could not acquire the lands because of a defect in the procedure.  The State could not acquire the land from the freeholder who owned the minerals.</P>
    <P>In that circumstance and in that situation I am quite clear that it is an entirely just and proper law to tidy up this whole picture and to take into some ownership&mdash;obviously preferably in this situation the State which already holds the vast majority of the mineral resources anyhow&mdash;the rest of them and vest them in the State.</P>
    <P>In this Bill the Minister is not going as far as that, but I am afraid he may be held to be going as far as that because instead of acquiring the mineral resources all together, what the Bill is doing is vesting the exclusive right of working them in the Minister and apparently seeking to put himself in a better position to argue that this is a constitutional delimitation.  It is arguing that the mineral resources are not being taken over, that there is no appropriation, no take-over, no acquisition, that the ownership remains where it is now whatever it may be, and that all that is happening is the exclusive right of working what is there is now to be in the Minister.</P>
    <P>I think that is all too like saying to a man with an apple tree, you can continue to own the apple tree but the exclusive right of picking all apples from that tree is now mine.  The reality of leaving behind the ownership resources while taking the exclusive working of the resources, seems to me to be very doubtful. I would have preferred, and still would prefer, if there was a full acquisition of these mineral resources and not taking away only the exclusive right of working them.  Taking away the exclusive right of working is to appear to leave something behind when, in fact, nothing is being left behind because what can you do with mineral resources which you cannot work?</P>
    <P>I think the Minister is weakening his case, and case there must be about this. He is weakening his case by repealing <Col N="810" /> the section of the 1940 Act which provides for acquisition of these minerals, and by repealing the section which at present allows him to acquire the minerals he seems in effect to be saying: &ldquo;We no longer want to acquire the minerals because they are no use to us. We are vesting in the State the exclusive right of working and you can keep the nominal ownership&rdquo;&mdash;the illusory element; the reality is being taken by the Minister.  If you are taking mineral resources, take mineral resources; do not take exclusive right of working mineral resources.</P>
    <P>I am apprehensive of the effect of one particular definition which indeed can be corrected.  That is the definition of working as including &ldquo;searching for&rdquo; among the many elements which will constitute working.  If the exclusive right of working is taken from an owner, and if the exclusive right of working includes the exclusive right of searching for, is it not the most primary act of ownership that a man would be entitled to search for what he owns, to discover what he owns, to measure and value it?  It seems that to take that is to take the primary element and a primary constituent in the business of possessing or owning anything.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister has been complimented for ingenuity in his way of doing it.  No doubt there is a certain withdrawal of political provocation involved in saying you are taking exclusive right but you are leaving the ownership free.  It does not seem to me to matter very much, particularly if the courts are going to look at it, as they very likely will.  The Minister has been very wise in one thing&mdash;I do not doubt the ingenuity here; it is a constructive and beneficial ingenuity&mdash;in having a Long Title.  I dissent from my colleagues in Dáil Éireann on this point.  I think the Long Title is intended to aid the courts in construing the intention of the legislature with regard to this measure.  It is designed to assist the court in the matter of discovering if we as a legislature are consciously having regard to principles of social justice and seeking to enact legislation which has regard to the exigencies of the common good.  That is good but I want to suggest <Col N="811" /> to the Minister for consideration something more than the Long Title.  I know it has been said that it is not a modern practice to have a preamble to a Bill.  First of all, it is not altogether true. In the United Kingdom the Matrimonial Causes Act, 1937 has a preamble, but more important, that is a practice which has grown up in this country under the influence of British lawyers, British lawyers who have no written Constitution.</P>
    <P>I invite the Minister to have the law officer consider again in the context of this legislation, which is so important for the development of these resources and which could have a transforming effect on our whole economy, whether there is a proper basis for continuing the prejudice against preambles, whether a Constitution which sets forth very well various personal rights, subject in most cases to a variety of different justifications for legislative intervention with them, does not in particular make it extremely desirable to have a preamble. What am I talking about when I talk about a preamble?  I am talking about setting out in the Act of Parliament that we enact the relevant facts on foot of which we decided that this was in accordance with the principles of social justice, to take these resources, or if you like the exclusive right of working into the Minister's hand, to set out the facts with regard to the title ownership, with regard to the fact that there has not been development because of that title ownership.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately it is not the practice of our courts to look at parliamentary debate.  They do not permit themselves to look at the memorandum which accompanies a Bill.  They can, and have done occasionally, look at commission reports and they will certainly look at a document which is referred to in legislation. I do not think it should be left to the ability of the professional men who will be in court on the day this matter comes for finding, or their ability to get the right witnesses to prove the right facts, that this legislation should stand or fall.</P>
    <P>What happens if it falls?  If it falls the ability to ground the whole development <Col N="812" /> will disappear.  If this is not put beyond doubt as a legally enforceable measure, if the Minister's title to give a lease to some developer is not put beyond doubt by a court finding, you may find that the professional advisers to the proposed financiers of a company proposing a development will have in honesty to say, &ldquo;We cannot be certain that this title will stand up and you may lose your money unless you get State guarantees.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The President has a right to refer a Bill to the Supreme Court before signing it.  He did that a few years ago.  On the Supreme Court finding that that Bill is in accordance with the Constitution, then the provisions of that Bill cannot afterwards be challenged.  I know there is a view against the point I am making, but I want to ask the Minister to reexamine this; let us have solid rock in law on which to build the superstructure of the economic development which I hope will come from this measure.  The only way to get solid rock is by referring the Bill to the Supreme Court.</P>
    <P>Other things may have to be done to the Bill before we can be confident that the Supreme Court find it to be constitutional. When we get to Committee Stage we will have to look very closely at every section and I ask for patience when we get to that Stage because this is a very serious matter.  After all, if our predecessors had considered with all the enlightenment of hindsight the significance of the language used in section 14 of the Minerals Development Act, 1940 development would not have stopped in 1960 or 1974.  The prospecting would not have dried up more or less as it unfortunately has.  A good deal of capital would have been embarked around this country to the benefit of people, even if finds had not been made. Of course, if finds had been made far greater benefit would have been obtained. But if our predecessors had looked to the language of their section that fatality would have been avoided. Let us look at the langauge of our section and satisfy ourselves that we are not leaving any nook or cranny in this Bill that can aid anybody who wants to upset it.  It is very much in the interest of this country that we all do our duty with <Col N="813" /> regard to this.  If there is any matter of doubt whatever in the language, let us not take a chance on it.</P>
    <P>I do not think it is going to be sufficient to rely on the advice that this is constitutional anyhow as it stands, that there is a distinction, that this is without a doubt arguable as a delimitation of property rights.  That carries you a lot of the way, but there will be marginal money that might make all the difference regarding the extent of the development which might not be prepared to go on hazard and on risk if there is any doubt about it unless we have&mdash;and maybe there is an answer to this incidentially&mdash;some kind of covenant in the lease that the Minister will make with the consent of the Minister for Finance which will be in itself the fullest indemnity to anyone taking a lease.  After all it was very many years after 1940 that section 14 fell.  It might be a larger number of years before someone attacked this if it is not first sealed with the Supreme Court's approval.  If at some stage the exclusive right were challenged successfully&mdash;and there could be a lot of money prepared to spend itself in that challenge&mdash;the people would at least be able to fall back and say, &ldquo;Well, we will get the Minister for any loss we suffer because we have got his covenant for quite enjoyment&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>If we are not able to have solid rock in the shape of our Bill, let us have the lease itself such that the Minister, even if he has failed to get the exclusive right to work, is put in a position of wholly indemnifying the person who is developing. I am not in love with the developers, do not misunderstand me.  I just want to get the blighters to develop.  I want them to do their business and develop and they will not do that if their title is on risk.  At least some of them will not, and it is they whom we possibly will want.</P>
    <P>The question of prospecting here has not been dealt with in this Bill and it is a matter of some surprise to me that it has not.  I do not know if the Minister is aware that for very many years prospecting licences were used by the licensees without their running into much difficulty.  In the past few years landowners have been questioning the <Col N="814" /> licensee's entitlement to come in and do all those things that under the prospecting licence he is authorised to do on what is, after all, the landowner's property.  Although the section authorising the Minister to give prospecting licences provides for the procurement of indemnification, in fact there is no provision for payment of compensation to the owner of the land who may or may not own the minerals.  These prospecting licences have been operating and it has never been clear up to this whether they were validly being operated in cases where the State did not own the minerals in question, where the prospecting was being done over lands where the minerals were owned by people other than the State.  You may say that particular question will disappear down the drain if the exclusive right of working gets transferred to the Minister.  I would like to see some evidence of a consideration of the problems of prospecting here which I do not find.</P>
    <P>When we get to Committee Stage I will be referring to quite a number of different items.  Some of them will have a bearing on this desire which we all share to make the Bill as safe as we possibly can, for the benefit of the country and for the benefit, incidentally, of the owners of the mineral resources themselves if they finally get returns out of them.  There are other sections not having the same relationship.  There are one or two things that worry me about the Bill.  First of all, there is provision for the registration of people who were developing on 15 December when this got published.  It is most important from the point of view of the constitutionality of this Bill that there be a time limit with regard to registration of the fact that they were engaging in development, which incidentally I notice in subsection (2)  it is called developing whereas I really think it should be called lawfully developing a mine.  That should not be left at large to the Minister to determine. It is much too important a matter.  It should be determined by the Legislature itself.</P>
    <P>I also think that the question of the constitution of the board is of very great importance.  It is proposed to amend the existing provisions with regard to the <Col N="815" /> Mining Board by substituting for the two ordinary persons two property valuers.  I have no objection to that.  There is provision for assessors in the court.  There should be a like provision for assessors in the case of the Mining Board just as we have provided for assessors in the judicial tribunals of inquiry.  In this area where the criteria are going to be so difficult to work out as to how to determine what is a fair and reasonable compensation, it does not seem to me to be a property man's job but very much one which, if it is to be a property man's job, he can only do with the benefit of the assistance of mining assessors.</P>
    <P>A frailty that I see in the existing position&mdash;perhaps I am wrong&mdash;relates to the constitution of the board as it stands in that the Minister can remove members of the board.  If it is the Minister who will be paying the compensation which is to be awarded, and if the Minister can remove a member, I would take that point away from somebody wishing to attack the Bill and put the people who are engaged in the business of assessing compensation here in some standing which makes them feel and appear to be independent of the Minister whose Government is going to have to find the money to finance the payments. After all it is not just for a particular acquisition: this will apply to all the private minerals in the country that are being acquired or to the exclusive right of working which is to be acquired.</P>
    <P>I should like to make another point before I finish and I am afraid I have a great deal more to say on this.  From my point of view, someone contemplating having to operate this Bill as a piece of law, as no doubt it will be, I find section 16, which, under licences to work, adapts, sections 13, 26 and 43 of the 1940 Act, awkward and I would think extremely difficult to operate.  There are dangers in doing it this way from an understanding point of view; from the point of view of us understanding what we are doing; from the point of view of the Minister understanding what she is doing and the Minister's advisers understanding what they are doing.  We should <Col N="816" /> enact these sections and that part if necessary in their entirety in the context of a licence to work as distinct from what they are related to in the language of the original Act.</P>
    <P>It is infinitely boring stuff to be setting out in pages and printing but it will have to be done by the people who are going to operate it for their own convenience or they will not understand what they are doing.  It is highly desirable to set it all out in this Bill so that we can immediately understand what we mean. We have to look at what we are saying here in section 16 (3):</P>
    <P>The following provisions of the Act of 1940 shall apply to a licence under subsection (1)&mdash;</P>
    <P>Section 13 of the Act, which refers to an undertaking by the Minister to grant a State mining lease, states:</P>
    <P>On the granting or at any time during the currency of a prospecting licence the Minister may enter into an undertaking with the licensee under such a licence to the effect that if at any time during the currency or on the expiration of such a licence the Minister is satisfied the prospecting carried on has been successful...</P>
    <P>&ldquo;On the granting or at any time during the currency of a prospecting licence&rdquo;&mdash;or are we to take it as meaning that when we are operating it prospecting licences are going to continue and leases continue in relation to minerals that are State minerals other than the State minerals that are deemed to arise when you have the exclusive right of working which is provided for in the beginning of the section?  At the same time, are we expected to delete &ldquo;a prospecting licence&rdquo; from the opening words of section 13 and shove in &ldquo;a licence to work any State minerals&rdquo;?  This may be as clear as daylight to the wiseacres who thought all this up but it is not clear to me.  If we are to pass this into law it would be useful to have it clear to somebody somewere in the Legislature.  It is merely an example of the sort of thing we cannot be excessively circumspect about.</P>
    <P>It is highly desirable that we have a definition of &ldquo;development&rdquo;.  The definition of &ldquo;working&rdquo; is worrying in its extent. I would like to hear when we come <Col N="817" /> to these sections&mdash;or if we could hear about them at the beginning&mdash;what is to be the distinction between State minerals other than those which include an exclusive right to working minerals and minerals which are to be State minerals of a different kind, category origin and base?  What is going to be the difference between minerals and State minerals?</P>
    <P>There are different definitions of minerals and State minerals with strange connotations, and where these connotations end up I do not know when we are talking about exclusive right of working minerals which are going to be included in State minerals, whether they are to be treated as included in State minerals for various purposes.  For example, section 3 of the Act which defines minerals does not include mineral compounds, mineral substances which were included in State mining rights but they come into State minerals because of the reference to scheduled minerals.  I assure you that it is not easy stuff and it is highly desirable that we know what we are doing.</P>

      <P>Once more I sit and learn from Senator FitzGerald.  As usual he has stimulated all sorts of ideas and doubts.  Certainly, on a common sense level there is no doubt regarding what this Bill is about.  It is about getting prospecting going in this country again, as Senator FitzGerald said.  In his own inimitable fashion he indicated to us some of the pitfalls that might lie ahead of the legislation.  We all know that the common-sense view is that the State should have the right to ensure that value would be added to minerals which are capable of having value added to them for the good of society as a whole. The State should be able to do that and ensure that in the process it does not take from people's constitutional rights.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some of the developments here have been shocking.  In 1956 a package of tax reliefs was first introduced by a Coalition Government which was designed to get the old Avoca mines started.  These reliefs together with Government grants got the mine going in 1959 and, as far as I know, it never made a profit.  In 1961 it closed leaving the Government about £2 million out of pocket.  It was a lot of <Col N="818" /> money in those days.  The tax legislation remained on the Statute Book.  It was the existence of this tax relief which encouraged exploration.</P>
    <P>In 1961, we had the discovery of Tynagh mines, Gortdrum was discovered in 1964 and the new Silvermines in 1965.  These finds could be said to be the beginning of the profitable development of the mining industry.  It had 100 per cent export.  At that time, the Fianna Fáil Government recognisied the impetus would have to be maintained.  I remember looking at a graph of the number of prospecting licences issued around the beginning of that period, the early sixties.  After the full tax exemption came in in 1967 for 20 years the graph raced up and people seemed to be scuttling all over the country looking for minerals.  We got the restart of the Avoca mine in 1969 which gave the Government some chance of recovering what was lost earlier.  Finally, in 1970 the Navan mine was found and which at that time was the fifth largest zinc mine in the world.  It was found by a company which had been unsuccessfully exploring in Ireland for 13 years.  So, this is the business we are in: we have to give incentives to companies of that kind to keep at it so that one day something suddenly arrives.</P>
    <P>This was one of the promises that Fianna Fáil made in the manifesto.  They pointed out that no new economic orebody had been discovered since 1970 and to get the previous high level of exploration restored we would have to do something about resolving the problems of mineral ownership.  I know now why it has taken the Minister the best part of a year-and-a-half to get this measure into the the pipeline and I see the way he had to go about it, in defining rights, not so much property rights as ownership of working rights, which is a very neat approach. I am not qualified to say just how this Bill when enacted will stand up but I must admire its ingenuity.</P>
    <P>We must get the prospecting effort under way again.  No orebody has been found since 1970 and we are now near 1980.  That is really a failure for the State.  If there is nothing there, then there is nothing there but I doubt that very <Col N="819" /> much.  Those of us who are old enough will remember it being hammered into our heads at school that there were no minerals of any value in this country and we end up with the fifth largest zinc mine in the world.  Incentives are required and one would hope that the Government&mdash; Fianna Fáil had this very much in mind in writing the portion of the manifesto that refers to this area of development &mdash;intend to provide the incentives even though some people in our society may say that too many incentives are being given, that the mining lights, whoever they are, are getting too much out of it. But if nobody starts then everybody ends up in a position of feeling very self-justified that nobody has made a million out of this.  But neither did anybody else get the ordinary stipends that can be obtained from good employment and jobs that can be provided in that area.  So, we have to give the incentives.  That is what gets people to go out and drill holes for oil and be willing to get only one success out of 13 or 14 holes drilled, whatever the going rate.  The incentive must be there to remunerate the risk.  I hope that this legislation will be able to stand and I welcome any devilling that we can do on Committee Stage and, in my own unqualified way, I will try to contribute to it.</P>
    <P>I would like to raise one or two points and I hope the Minister can elaborate on them.  What happens the individual who owns the land while the Minister has the working rights?  Does he have rights to walk on the property in that period? Senators who have gone by Tynagh have seen now that that mine is drawing to a close the open, gaping landscape that exists there following the working of the mine.  If that had been a mine where the Minister had working rights and these had been vested by lease or otherwise in Irish Base Metals or whatever group operate in that area, what would happen at the end of all of this?  Does the property revert to the original owner and what condition should it be left in?  Is that covered? These are just a few thoughts on it.  I prefer to be the engineer mining the minerals rather than the lawyer <Col N="820" /> protecting the rights but I hope that some Irish engineers will soon be digging into mines that will be newly discovered as a result of the introduction of this legislation.</P>

      <P>I am particularly appreciative of the fact that the two Senators who spoke have seen the necessity for this particular measure and for having it before us at this time.  I am particularly thankful that they realise, as all of us do, that a problem exists and that a very genuine effort has been made in this Bill to deal with the problem.  I am glad of the support shown by both Senators for the Bill and its objectives and I know that both of them are, as are all Members of the House, appreciative of the difficulties which are involved in the drafting of a Bill of this nature, so as to ensure that when passed by the Oireachtas it will stand up and not be subject to challenge later.  Most of the points raised by Senator Mulcahy and Senator FitzGerald are points of detail which I feel can possibly best be dealt with on Commmittee Stage and therefore I am going to confine myself to some general remarks on the points raised.  I hope both Senators will appreciate that these points will be dealt with and looked at between now and Committee Stage and indeed dealt with fully at that particular stage of discussion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First of all, Senator FitzGerald's idea of acquisition of mineral ownership was very carefully and indeed extensively considered and the Senator's belief that this could prove to be constitutionally acceptable is not disputed by the Minister or indeed by his advisers but the Minister's advice from a number of legal sources was that the risk, however, was substantial and for that reason the approach which is now being adopted in the present Bill was preferred.  The Senator's reference to the definition of working as including &ldquo;searching for&rdquo;, has already been considered in quite some detail and this position exists under the 1940 Act and the view had been taken that prospecting for minerals&mdash;and I quote&mdash;&ldquo;does not involve <Col N="821" /> working&rdquo;.  Indeed, there are provisions in the 1940 Act which strongly suggest that this view was correct.  Of course, as I said originally, the matter will be looked at and considered between now and Committee Stage in the light of the views which have been expressed.</P>
    <P>Senator FitzGerald questioned the appointment of assessors for the Mining Board or whether these should be available or not.  We are advised that if this should be legally necessary the Minister could make regulations under this Bill and under the original 1940 Act providing that the court may engage consultants or advisers or experts to supply any technical or legal assistance which may be necessary.  The Senator also made the point&mdash;and I would like to thank him for being appreciative of the fact&mdash;that there is need for the Long Title to the Bill.  His colleague made the point of disagreeing with the Long Title. Senator FitzGerald's remarks do not necessitate by going into any great detail about the need for a Long Title. However, Senator FitzGerald did say that he considered that perhaps we should at this stage consider the inclusion of a preamble explaining what it was.  I would say we can ask our advisers to look at this between now and the next Stage or the passing of the Bill in this House.  We can let the Senator know what they come up with and perhaps have a discussion on it at the time.</P>
    <P>The question of the constitutionality of the Bill was one which was raised by both Senators.  Of course none of us can be certain that any particular Bill, particularly one of this nature which deals with people's property rights and the delimiting of these rights can be constitutional. I would say, however, that it is the prerogative of the President to refer a Bill to the Supreme Court and this is a prerogative which none of us would wish to question or indeed take away from him.  I am speaking on behalf of the Fianna Fáil Government when I say that but I feel that this is right and fair. Whether it would have been advisable to have the matter referred to the Supreme Court before its passage or before going to the President with it&mdash;I do not think that would have been desirable.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="822" /> I appreciate very much that Senators have seen the necessity for bringing the measure before the House at this stage and we all appreciate that it is very necessary, that it has taken quite a considerable time to bring it to this stage. The necessity for it taking so long is quite clear and therefore all we can do is hope that it will stand up.  I think that a very fair discussion and a very detailed discussion on it on Committee Stage when we can go through each section on its own and look at each section on its own merits will ensure, or at least help to ensure, that when it leaves this House and leaves the Houses of the Oireachtas it will stand up to any challenge which may be brought about later.</P>
    <P>I would like to thank the Senators for their remarks on the Bill and would hope for a very full discussion, a very helpful discussion such as takes place on all Committee Stages of a Bill in this House, on Committee Stage and that we will leave with a better and a much improved Bill if that can be done.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I would like to ask the very relevant question: was this White Paper planned?  Was it designed to be a plan or was it just wishful thinking?  In my short experience in political life I have never seen a document to be so off-beam in such a short time.  It is no more than a few months ago since it was actually published and never in the history of this State have we had so much turmoil, change of direction and change of views in such a short time.  One would also have to ask the question: is it real planning in the strict sense of the word?  It would appear to <Col N="823" /> me that in the recent past a lot of the planning that we have been hearing about and a lot that has been proposed for us is certainly not working out in practice.  I must say very quickly, of course, that it is very important that our economy be well planned.  It is very important for the future success of this nation but, certainly on the basis of the last document, if the interim period is anything to go by we are heading for disaster.</P>
      <P>What has happened since the publication of the White Paper or indeed coincided with it?  The first thing that happened at the end of December was that £20 million was hived off the food subsidies. Whether the Minister would like to accept it or not this has created a great deal of hardship for many people. That has been borne out by the fact that in the very recent past our inflation rate has been made public.  It appears now to be between 10 and 11 per cent despite the fact that the Minister for Finance said on that very morning that it would still be 5 per cent for the entire year.  I am not an economist but I cannot see how you can reconcile these facts.  Certainly, if it is much more than 5 per cent for the year and is nearer to 10 or 11 per cent our economy is in serious trouble.</P>
      <P>The next thing that happened was that in order to gain from the farming community a sufficient yield of tax they were asked in the budget to pay a 2 per cent commodity tax.  The first tax, I understand, for many years on actual production. To say the least of it that has started a vicious circle in this country and nobody is sure where it will finish.  It has triggered off a set of events which are unprecedented in our history.  If it happens that we have severe problems, the architects of that budget, and in particular of the 2 per cent levy, will have to answer the people in years to come.</P>
      <P>There is no doubt that that budget item was ill-conceived and not very well considered, as was shown by its subsequent withdrawal.  It was withdrawn because farmers were asked to come up with a taxation system that would yield the same amount of tax, but on that basis it does not stand up at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="824" /> If, in the opinion of the Government, this was the proper way to tax farmers, they should have gone ahead with it and carried it out.  If they were of the opinion that it was not the way to do it, it should not have been introduced in the first place.  I would like to hear the Minister's views on the subject when he is winding up this debate.  I believe this is crucial.</P>
    <P>When the PAYE sector saw the Government were weak on this spot, they brought on to the streets yesterday tens of thousands of people to show in no uncertain way that they were not satisfied with their taxation proposals. The point I would make, and which did not appear on the White Paper as such, is that unless there is a certain amount of stability and good relationships in industry, commerce, the farming community and so on, as an economy we will not go anywhere.  I would ask the Minister if he is still convinced that we are heading for a 5 or 6 per cent inflation this year.  With the wage demands that are being sought, coupled with rising inflation, it appears that we will have a remarkable deficit at the next budget.</P>
    <P>Is it proposed to withdraw another section of the food subsidies shortly, or do we take it that we have seen the last of the subsidy withdrawals for the rest of this year?  There are certain people in certain places who are now saying quite openly that we might have more subsidy withdrawals on 8 or 10 June.  There is no doubt that the removal of food subsidies in part has contributed to our inflation rate.  That, coupled with the fact that we seem to be on the way to dearer fuel and energy, would seem to indicate that the predictions in the White Paper will be off target.  It is well to acknowledge that there were a number of undertakings given both in the White Paper and in previous documents, certainly in the Fianna Fáil manifesto, which have gone haywire.</P>
    <P>Take Posts and Telegraphs.  I understand that it is the desire of the Government, as stated in the manifesto and the White Papers, that the telephone service would be overhauled to meet the needs of the eighties.  There is no need to comment on that.  Never has that service been so bad and never has there been such a dull and bleak future.  From an industrial <Col N="825" /> point of view, even without the strike, if there is not the will to get on with the job at Government and civil service level irrespective of whether we have money to invest it is likely that we are on a downhill road.</P>
    <P>In the context of the White Paper, what will happen on 1 May if the proposed yield from the farming community does not match what the 2 per cent was likely to yield had it gone through?  What steps do the Government hope to take to rectify the situation whereby the farming community decide, on one hand, that they are taxed to the hilt, and on the other, the PAYE workers believe they are entitled to a massive cut in income tax?  From the point of view of economic planning and development those are vital areas for the remainder of this year and indeed many years to come.</P>
    <P>On the question of agricultural development, the White Paper made a number of points, some of which we entirely agree with.  First, £42 million will be spent on drainage.  There are a number of points to which I would like to refer as this scheme concerns my part of the country.  It was talked about six, eight or nine months ago and was launched officially, I understand, on 1 January.  I have not yet come across a farmer who has actually been approved for a grant.  I am beginning to wonder at this stage if it is a 1979 scheme or a 1980 scheme.  It is vitally important that progress be made.  The proportion of money laid out for arterial drainage as opposed to land drainage is open to question.  There is no doubt this is a very important development but I believe there are vast areas of several counties, including County Galway, that could do with a greater allocation of finance for arterial drainage.  It is very difficulty to drain land unless you have a proper out-fall. I believe there was a certain amount of haste in the actual drawing up of that scheme and thousands of farmers along the basins of the rivers in Galway, the Suck, the Islands river in Glenamaddy and Williamstown and so on see very little use being made of the new land drainage proposals.  Because of the out-fall problem they cannot drain land.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="826" /> I understand the west is likely to expect, and to get, money from the EEC in the region of £150 million or £180 million. On paper that looks excellent.  I hope it is right, but how exactly will it be spent?  When it will be spent?  What contribution will the Government make, and over what duration will that money be coming to us?  I understand it will be used for the promotion of group water schemes and infrastructural developments, like sewerage schemes and so on. It is in that area that it will be used, together with other facets of agriculture. There will be £150 million or £180 million&mdash;I am not sure which as the reports contradict one another&mdash;direct from the EEC.  Is that the size of the budget?  Do we put in half of it&mdash;in other words, we put up £75 million for their £75 million? Will it be over ten years?  If it is, there is nothing dramatic about it.  When one judges the capital allocation to the local authorities over a significant number of years it would actually get lost in inflation.</P>
    <P>Those are the questions we are asking. We are finding it difficult to get answers. It is important that, if we are in a position to capture £150 million plus, the Government of the day should be in a position to match it, pound for pound, to ensure that all the vital structures so lacking in the west and in the designated areas would be righted at a time when it appears that the EEC authorities are very concerned about the less favoured areas.  Anybody who believes that £150 million will solve the problems of the west, particularly over ten years, is living in cloud cuckoo land.</P>
    <P>It is important at this stage in our development, with less than three months gone in this year, with rising prices, with escalating house prices and interest rates, that the Government take a long, hard, look at how this price escalation is hitting the lower income groups.</P>
    <P>On the question of land structure, the White Paper was hazy about a land policy.  The Minister for Agriculture has repeatedly said that he is introducing a new land policy.  However, despite the fact that we have been listening to that for at least nine months, I see no sign of such legislation coming through.  It is <Col N="827" /> very important, if we are to hold any type of structure and maintain any type of population in rural areas, that a proper land structure be formulated very quickly.  There is no doubt that it is the people with money and security behind them, whether in farming or otherwise, who are buying the land.  What is happening now is that on a number of family farms of 20 or 25 acres the farmers are only able to pay the current rate of interest, at anything up to 17 per cent. With land at £2,500 to £3,000 per acre, it is economic suicide for them to invest in an additional ten, 15 or 20 acres of that type.</P>
    <P>It is ironic that at a time when more than half the population believe farmers are rolling in gold, at a time when the bigger farmer is certainly making a fair amount of money, the small farmer is not in a position to better himself.  This Government saw fit, with one swipe of a pen on budget day, to take 2,500 people off the farmers' dole and greatly affected the living standards of another 5,500.  It is very had to reconcile a policy that on the one hand will debar people from subsidy, which is what the farmers' dole is, and on the other will not allow for a situation where the very people for whom this type of assistance was initiated, are denied the opportunity of bettering themselves by purchasing land.</P>
    <P>Any type of Land Commission acquisition at the moment will cost a farmer, even with the subsidy, at least £150 to £180 and, in some cases, £200 per acre.  There is no way under our agricultural price structure at the moment that a farmer could live and repay that type of money on an additional ten or 20 acres.  That is the real problem. Whatever the Minister decides, the financial arrangement for a smaller farmer who wants to better himself must be such that he can do so.  Nobody is suggesting that the price of land will decrease.  There is no sign of that.</P>
    <P>In the market place there are more customers than we have land for and this type of price will obviously be the order of the day.  That is of very little use to the 60,000 or 70,000 small farmers, most of whom genuinely want to stay in <Col N="828" /> farming, who are trained for nothing else, who have families and will use the infrastructure which is already there. They are desperate because they are being priced out of a living.  If the Minister for Agriculture does not take sufficiently swift action the problem will certainly cure itself in the next five or ten years. But we will be well on the road to the big man taking over and we will again revert to the situation where the big farmers will be in the same category as landlords in the past.  Our population in rural Ireland will dwindle and there will be many more problems than heretofore.</P>
    <P>Whatever might be said in the White Paper, the time is absolutely right and it is vital that the Minister for Agriculture, in co-operation and in conjunction with the other Ministers, should grasp this thistle and tell us his land policy, irrespective of whether the Land Commission is scrapped or not.  I believe that, so far as land division is concerned, the Land Commission is very necessary. The expertise built up in that commission over the years would be very hard to replace.  The commission should be amalgamated with the advisory services and together would provide a very lively team of experts who would get on with the job providing and ensuring that the land wealth of this country is divided in a proper and efficient manner.</P>
    <P>Never before&mdash;and I do not like to have to say this&mdash;have I seen a Government with all the answers&mdash;with all the talents, according to themselves&mdash;getting into such a knot.  I hope that the spectacle on the streets of Dublin or of Portarlington will not have to be repeated because it is not good for the country or for democracy.  If it is repeated we will have to lay the blame entirely on a budget which was ill-conceived, ill-timed and ill-considered. One would hope that in the future when a so-called strong Government, the strongest ever in the history of the State, introduce a budgetary measure they should research it well beforehand and decide either to go ahead with it or not.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamHyland" hpid="Mr. Hyland Mr. Hyland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity of saying a few words on the White Paper.  One of the most remarkable and noticeable <Col N="829" /> characteristics of the present Government is their policy of forward planning by identifying priorities for national development and setting targets for achieving them within the period of the programme.  This represents progressive government and provides both Government and people with a challenge.  The purpose of government is to manage the economy in such a way that our resources are utilised to the maximum and the greatest number of people possible share in that overall national development.  It is the right of every citizen to be able to get gainful and satisfying employment in his or her own country.  Therefore job creation must be a top priority in any programme.  The economy must be managed in such a way that these jobs are as far as possible productive, thereby contributing further to our national economic expansion.  I feel strongly that job creation for the sake of job creation, desirable as it may be in the short term, in the long term is not what we should be trying to achieve. We should ensure as far as possible that all our efforts are geared towards involving people in gainful and productive employment.  With our economy in the very early stages of development, there is sufficient scope for such development and there is certainly a need for development in both agriculture and industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is in this situation, then that I welcome the White Paper.  The present Government are just two years in office. Their first programme was the famous, or infamous, election manifesto followed by the White Paper of 1977-1980.  Both of these documents were deliberately designed by the present Government to do two things.  In the first instance they were introduced to restore public confidence not only in our own ability to survive but also to develop.  These documents were prepared at a time when general morale in the country was at a very low ebb from an economic point of view.  The second purpose of these two documents was to stimulate the economy by investing or reinvesting. This necessitated borrowing, which the Government said at that time was a once only operation needed, to gear the machine for future development.  In view of all that has been said, it is no harm to <Col N="830" /> look for a moment at how the economy performed in relation to our first programme.</P>
    <P>In 1978, our economic growth was the highest of any member country of the EEC.  Inflation fell from 13.6 per cent to 7.6 per cent in 1978.  Even though it might not seem to be the case at the present time, in view of all the criticism we hear about prices and so on, price increases were reduced from 13.6 per cent in 1977 to 7.6 per cent in 1978. In the same period our exports rose by approximately 14 per cent.  The main objective of both of these policy documents, or programmes for national development, was in the main to create new jobs.  When the present Government came into office one of the most serious tasks facing them, and the one to which they totally committed themselves, was that of job creation.  In both documents the Government projected a job increase of approximately 20,000.  We know with hindsight, looking at the performance of the programme, that we did not achieve 20,000 jobs but we achieved 17,000 new jobs, and that was the greatest single increase in new job creation ever achieved by any Government in this country. That is a fact which is undeniable.</P>
    <P>Apart altogether from the actual achievements of both of these documents&mdash;and the achievements no doubt were remarkable&mdash;of equal significance is the fact that it has now been clearly established that planning works, provided it is soundly based and provided the public accept the restraints necessary for the implementation of the programme.  In the paper before us the Government carry their economic development programme a stage further to 1981.  Again, they have identified their priorities.  Many people say these priorities are ambitious and are not attainable. But I say it is better to set our targets high and to try to achieve these objectives than to drift aimlessly from budget to budget, from election to election, with no sense of direction and no foreseeable destination.  I have not heard anybody question our priorities.  Nobody would disagree that our target for a continuation of the job creation programme is our greatest national priority and that in the long term we should not be working <Col N="831" /> towards full employment.  It is agreed by all that the control of inflation, increasing output and reducing Exchequer borrowings are all necessary requirements for long-term economic development. But what is not readily agreed is the means by which all these things can be achieved.  It is here I believe that the public and the Government face the greatest challenge.</P>
    <P>The targets set in the first programme were achieved, in my opinion, by good planning assisted by borrowing which was necessary at that time to get the economy moving again.  If we want to implement the present programme the targets will have to be met by and large from our own resources, some of which have come from the success of the first programme.  It has been preached by the Minister, by the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance that it is an economic fact that we cannot pay ourselves more than we earn.  If we do, it can only happen by borrowing, which we now agree is undesirable, in the long term by increasing costs which would affect our ability and our competitiveness from the point of view of exports.  Any new jobs that we can create are dependent on exports and we must remain competitive if we are to have any success in this field.  This raises the whole question of wages, wage restraint and taxation because the bulk of the money to finance the programme must come from taxation.  It really boils down to the fact whether those of us in secure employment are prepared to share with our less fortunate neighbours.  From our point of view, none of us could really claim that we are in very secure employment.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that the time has come for a complete reorganisation of our tax system.  The importance of fairly sharing the tax burden is pressing and I believe and the Government believe this problem must be tackled.  It should be remembered that the objectives of the White Paper would, of themselves, relieve part of this tax burden because the greater the number of people in employment, the less the demand on our financial resources and the greater <Col N="832" /> would be the number of people sharing in the tax load.</P>
    <P>I believe that every period of Government is important but I sincerely believe that the present period of Government is the most challenging.  Our future at the present time is very much in our own hands.  We are now a full member of the EEC and are also part of the EMS.  Such membership brings with it opportunity, but there is no point in looking around us and looking at what other countries are doing.  We must manage our economy in such a way that we gain maximum advantage from such membership.  Most important of all, we must control inflation, increase output and improve our competitiveness.  These, again, are, to sum up, the objectives which the Government have outlined in the current White Paper.  The White Paper deals extensively with every aspect of our economic development.  To me, the detail with which it deals with agriculture is encouraging; it is an indication of the Government's awareness of the contribution that this sector has to make to our economic development and of its potential for doing so in the future.</P>
    <P>Arising from our membership of the EEC, Irish farming has made outstanding progress.  It is to the credit of our farmers that they availed of all the opportunities and incentives provided through our membership of that enlarged Community.  The fact that they will exceed the target of 25 per cent increases in gross output this year is positive proof of the challenge and of the progress that has been made by Irish agriculture.</P>
    <P>The availability of markets gave farmers, for the first time, the confidence they needed; their willingness to borrow and invest in the industry is an indication of their courage.  Our indebtedness to farmers is a factor which cannot be overlooked in any discussion on farm income and nothing should be done to prevent the continuation of this investment; apart altogether from agriculture, it is necessary in the national interest.  The old problem of the instability of markets continues to be a headache for Irish farmers.  It is of the utmost importance that special consideration be given to <Col N="833" /> Ireland as a small agriculture-based economy which is only in the very early stages of development and whose contribution to services will be minimal in the context of the entire Community.</P>
    <P>Our representatives in Europe have been doing a good job, which I hope they will continue, in relation to the promotion of Irish agriculture.  We have not a great industrial base and are mainly dependent on agriculture.  It would be disastrous for this country if anything happened which would undermine our agricultural development programme. For this reason I urge the Minister and the Government to ensure that at all times the weak position of the Irish economy, particularly in relation to the various stages of present agricultural development, is fully recognised and understood.</P>
    <P>Commenting very briefly on the White Paper, the proposed review of the farm modernisation scheme is something which is very welcome from our point of view.  I always got the impression that the various directives, in relation to the farm modernisation scheme, were designed in Brussels and that the people who designed them did not have a full knowledge or understanding of the peculiar position in Ireland in relation to, for instance, the size of our agricultural holdings.  All of these future directives, as far as Ireland is concerned, will have to be geared towards retaining and strengthening the small farm family unit, which has been traditional as far as we are concerned and which is so essential if we are to retain the maximum number of people employed in agriculture.</P>
    <P>In relation to a Bill which is currently before the Dáil and which will be coming to this House in the foreseeable future&mdash;the present AnCOT Bill&mdash;all the provisions in that Bill, in relation to agricultural development, are progressive. The Bill envisages a situation where the county committees of agriculture will be development organisations within the eastern counties for the promotion and general development of agriculture there. The Bill is progressive to the extent that it sees the agricultural adviser as being a development agent, working in co-operation with the Department of Agriculture in each of our counties.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="834" /> One of the most encouraging aspects of our development is the fact that all the grant aid under the EEC directives for agriculture which is being paid, and will be paid in the future to farmers under these directives, will be based on the farmer working to a development plan. This has been one of the most heartening and encouraging things taking place in relation to modern agriculture&mdash;that all the farmers now participating in the EEC schemes have development programmes prepared for them by their agricultural instructor, in fact, very much the same as what we are talking about here.  Targets have been set for them and they are working towards them and if each individual farmer is doing that, then, collectively, our total agriculture must benefit and expand considerably.</P>
    <P>In relation to these directives and in relation to the points made in the White Paper on agricultural development, I urge the Minister and the Government to give further consideration to the employment of additional instructors to service the farm development plans which have been prepared by these agricultural instructors. Perhaps I am biased and perhaps it is a personal view, but I do not know of any other public servant, paid out of public funds, who makes a greater return to the nation than the agricultural instructor preparing plans for farm development and working in close co-operation with the farmer, from the point of view of servicing these plans. Certainly, the national investment in the employment of additional agricultural instructors would more than repay itself in the long term and I cannot emphasise too strongly the need and the importance of increasing the staff for our various county committees of agriculture.</P>
    <P>The White Paper stresses the need for, and the importance of, agricultural development from a drainage point of view.  The last speaker did not give us much credit for it, but the amount of money which is now being channelled into land drainage in the west is extremely welcome from a national point of view, or from the point of view of the development of agriculture.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="835" /> Coming from the midlands, let me again be a little bit biased and say that there are parts of this country, other than the west, where there is an urgent need for land drainage.  I want to make the point that, in relation to the expenditure of large sums of money such as we are talking about in the west of Ireland, I feel that a cost and effort analysis should be applied to such expenditure and that priority should be given to areas which would yield the greatest return to the nation, by way of increased agricultural output.  In the midland region we have the Barrow and the Nore catchment areas and a number of other smaller rivers: all of these are waiting for an arterial drainage scheme which, as I see it, may not happen in our lifetime.  I would urge the Minister and the Government to press ahead with our case in Brussels to increase grant aid which would enable us to make more rapid progress with arterial drainage.</P>
    <P>I happened to be at home last night watching on television a very informative agricultural programme showing land reclamation in some of our mountain regions.  One of the experts in the programme, in reply to a question, stated that we had over 1,000,000 acres of mountain land capable of reclamation and capable of being brought into production.  Up to now, however, this particular job could not be tackled because of the non-availability of the necessary modern machinery.  I am a farmer myself and I was amazed, last night, watching the television screen to see the progress that has been made in relation to machinery for land reclamation. The big problem in mountain reclamation is, of course, the large number of stones and boulders that result from such projects.  We have now advanced to such a stage that we have machines capable of collecting, gathering and drawing away these stones.  I am saying this to illustrate the point that we have made fantastic technical progress in relation to land reclamation.  We have a million acres of mountain land capable of being brought back into production.  I understand a further million acres of land are in need of drainage in the lowlying <Col N="836" /> areas.  Our greatest natural resource is agriculture and we have two million acres of agricultural land undeveloped which I do not think we can, in the long term, afford to neglect.</P>
    <P>Again, we have an EEC scheme, referred to in the White Paper before us, in relation to disadvantaged areas.  There are areas outside the present designated areas which are, in their own way, seriously disadvantaged and where the farmers cannot qualify for the increased grant aid for land reclamation that is available in other parts of the country.  I hope, within the term of the programme before us, that we shall make further progress in relation to the disadvantaged area scheme and that a greater portion of our country could be included in it.</P>
    <P>Forestry is an area of national development which has been completely neglected in the past.  We have large areas of land capable of being planted. The great national regret should be that we did not tackle the afforestation programme 25 to 35 years ago.  Had we done that, we should today be reaping the harvest in relation to some of our State forests which is only now commencing. While it is very encouraging to see the amount of timber coming on the market from our forests, it is sad that the acreage available is so limited.  I hope that under that heading the Government will continue with a positive forestry programme, both from the point of view of creating employment in forestry and from the point of view of planting young forests which perhaps not we, but our children, will be able to take advantage of in the years ahead.  I have endeavoured to cover, as best I can, some of the important parts of the programme which is before us.</P>
    <P>I was impressed last night when I came across a book, <i>Aspects of the Swedish Economy and Their Relevance to Ireland</i>, the co-writers of which are Robert O'Connor, Eoin O'Malley and Anthony Foley and it was published by the Economic and Social Research Institute. There is in it a statement which is relevant as far as we are concerned. Sweden is at a very high stage of national economic development and is one of the wealthiest countries in <Col N="837" /> Europe.  The statement reads:</P>
    <P>Sweden has attained her present level of development, not through any specific policy instrument, or set of instruments, but because her people made a definite commitment to full employment in the 1930's and have stuck to that commitment since.... The success of the full employment policies has depended to a large extent on the attitudes of the trade unions. The unions realised early on that in a democracy real power in the area of labour policy rested with them and not with the Government.  Hence, if full employment was to be attained they (the unions) would have to back the idea (of full employment) to the ultimate limit.</P>
    <P>I hope that if some Swedish economist 30 years from now is writing about Ireland he will be able to say that Ireland made a commitment to full employment in 1977 and they have stuck to that commitment since.  If this happens, Ireland, too, will have reached a very high level of economic development; the time for that decision is now.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardMarkey" hpid="Mr. Markey Mr. Markey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Markey</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Hyland started off by using the manifesto of Fianna Fáil before the 1977 election, the famous or infamous document, depending on which side of the House one is on.  He went on to talk about forward planning, and to say that this White Paper was an example of forward planning.  He spoke of challenging times for the Government today and finished up by quoting Swedish examples, when I should have thought that we were being encouraged to follow German examples.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I thought, on reading the White Paper, that it followed from an instruction given to the various Departments to produce a document, which would sound optimism throughout its length, and which would lead to discussion and comment.  The latter aspect, about its leading to discussion and comment, is advisable in any document.  However, having already had the Green Paper which was also there for discussion we were told, and now having a White Paper, we are finding ourselves being led to a cycle in which there must be a break <Col N="838" /> somewhere if concrete action is to be taken.  We can go on talking <i>ad infinitum</i> about what should be done and, indeed, congratulating ourselves on what has been done.</P>
    <P>If the White Paper is regarded, and it should be regarded, as a planning stage for the Government, then the absence of specifics in this regard in the document before us condemns, out of hand, what it is supposed to do.  It has failed lamentably to set out for discussion and comment either specific objects or a set of alternatives which could be tackled as a forward planning programme.  There are no references to costings in regard to any specific purposes mentioned.  There are no alternative propositions put forward with costings which any responsible Opposition party could get their hands on and say, &ldquo;We should choose this rather than the other one; this seems to be the best course for this nation to take&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I have a suspicion that Fianna Fáil have been forced to tie in both the Green Paper and the White Paper somewhat in line with what was in the manifesto. They created that hazard for themselves and it would not do for them to depart too abruptly from it.  In the White Paper we find a divergence from the heavy and colourful language which was so predominant a feature of the manifesto. Optimistic targets were, indeed, set out in that document before the election of 1977.  Even now we find in the White Paper that there are departures, that the figures quoted in the manifesto may not be realised; that depends on so many other factors operating to our advantage.</P>
    <P>The White Paper, the Minister said in his opening speech, sets out different courses of action which could lie ahead for the nation.  I do not believe it does that.  The Minister says that the Government to date have restored confidence and set the country on rapid economic growth.  Confidence is not something which starts overnight.  It has a growth, just like economic growth.  It must start at some stage.  There is no doubt the best authorities do admit that confidence was beginning to rise after the recession of the 1973-76 period before Fianna Fáil came into office.  This being so, I expect <Col N="839" /> Fianna Fáil to claim credit for something with which, perhaps, they have very little to do.  It means that the Coalition Government, before they went out of office, had set the economy on a course which generated confidence and which also, in turn, generated the rapid economic growth of which the Minister speaks.</P>
    <P>The White Paper refers to job creation, particularly in the public service. Here there is a definite change in emphasis from what we read in the Green Paper and, indeed, in all the speeches made by the Government in the post-manifesto period.  It is an admission that private enterprise has not been able to throw up the number of jobs desired, or felt as necessary, to reduce the level of unemployment to manageable proportions.</P>
    <P>We must take into account that any reduction in unemployment that there has been, has not yet been shown to have taken into account the rate of emigration over the past two years.  Until we get the emigration figures it would be premature for Government Ministers to speak of any great success in the reduction of the unemployment figures.  A number of authorities have specifically referred to the fact that the creation by the Government of non-productive jobs in 1978 in the public service cannot be continued; it leads to logical consequences, to increased taxation and increased costs.  Here, again, Fianna Fáil find themselves in a dilemma.  They know, and, have partly admitted in this White Paper, that the private sector has not come up with the number of jobs desired and they must try to make up for the slack in that regard.  Because of that dilemma they cannot go too far without creating more taxation measures&mdash;a matter about which there is considerable agitation at present.</P>
    <P>In regard to the rate of inflation practically nobody agrees with the figure envisaged by the Government for before the end of 1979.  This figure is now in the region of 10 to 12 per cent, and possibly more.  This is very much a contradiction of the figure of 5 per cent envisaged by the Government.  In regard to the rate of <Col N="840" /> economic growth various fountain sources commenting on the rate of economic growth envisaged by the Government have said this does not seem to be realisable.</P>
    <P>I move on to the field of housing.  For whatever reasons, Fianna Fáil decided after the election victory of 1977, to give what was almost a blank cheque to the private building sector to erect as many houses as they could.  We now find an admission in the White Paper that there is evidence to suggest that the demand for housing which emerged during 1977 resulted in an undue concentration by the construction industry on providing houses at the upper end of the housing market.  This made it very difficult for prospective buyers to raise the necessary finance to purchase such houses.  Local authorities, particularly, have felt this concentration of emphasis by the Government on the private sector.  The number of local authority housing completions in 1978 was estimated to have reached 6,000 and this compared with figures of 8,700 in 1975, 7,000 in 1976 and 6,300 in 1977.  We see that there has been a reduction each year in the number of houses provided by local authorities since the Coalition days.  The White Paper makes the most extra ordinary statement:</P>
    <P>there is a general lessening in the degree of urgency of local authority housing needs, even though there has been little or no falling off in general demand and significant arrears still exist in some areas...</P>
    <P>I should have imagined that the fact that there is no reduction in demand and that there are still substantial arrears of housing to be met, would certainly have led to a different conclusion than is reached in the White Paper.</P>
    <P>In regard to roads, Senator Hyland referred to forward planning being an aspect of the Government.  In no other field is the lack of forward planning so evident as in the sphere of roads throughout this country.  We have had a great increase in the volume of traffic on roads which are completely inadequate and unequipped for that volume of traffic. One would have thought that forward planning would have meant that <Col N="841" /> the creation of roads would precede such an increase in the volume of traffic but we have seen just the opposite happen.  It has also led to the situation for most local authorities that the 1979 Road Fund allocation which has been presented to the local authorities over the past few weeks, shows that apart from improvements on national and primary roads and a small number of national secondary roads, the amount for maintenance of the existing road network is completely inadequate for the task in hands.</P>
    <P>The manifesto referred to a road development plan which would be brought forward by the Government.  It also spoke about a transport commission report.  We are still waiting for all these things to happen and we are almost two years into the life of the present Government.</P>
    <P>In the field of telecommunications, the White Paper has this to say:</P>
    <P>One of the main inhibiting charcteristics of telephone development is the long lead times involved. There are inescapable lengthly intervals between the initial planning and physical completion of large numbers of related works.</P>
    <P>I venture to ask how do other countries manage in this field?  If it is a simple admission that there are inescapably lengthy intervals between planning and completion, how do other countries get around this problem?  Why are there such lengthly intervals, which seem to be more lengthy in Ireland than in any other country?  The Government, we are told in the White Paper, envisage accelerating the present programme.  I would like an explanation or definition of what &ldquo;envisage&rdquo; means.  We all have dreams and we all conjure up lovely visions of what various systems should be.  I am afraid all that is in the Government's mind at present are merely dreams and ambitions.  What any plan should have, or any White Paper should have at this stage, are specific proposals with costings, or, at least, a number of alternatives with costings.</P>
    <P>The Government is facing challenging times, challenging times, not merely on the economic front but on the broader <Col N="842" /> front of democracy and in social terms because, largely through political blundering and bad judgment, they have arrived now at the situation where they are not being trusted; they are even being suspected.  They are not looked up to, which should be the case with any Government in any democratic country, if they are to act as a demonstrative government in democratic terms.</P>
    <P>I conclude by saying that the White Paper is merely another part of that cycle that we set out on when we had the first Green Paper.  This cannot go on indefinitely; it is high time that the Government brought forward some specific proposal and told us the cost for a number of alternatives so that purposeful comment and dialogue can take place on those proposals.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondGoverney" hpid="Mr. Governey Mr. Governey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Governey</NameTxt>
      <P>I have some brief comments to make on the White Paper. I feel that the White Paper does not fulfil its supposed role as an instrument of economic planning because of the lack of decision on important issues and the lack of anything specific with regard to targets for individual sectors of agriculture.  The paper's authors are mesmerised by increases in gross agricultural output; they seem to be unaware that certain categories of farmers and certain lines of production have lagged well behind the others.  The possibility of changing the eligibility for and the method of payment of grants under the farm modernisation scheme is raised, but there is no final decision or no final plan put forward in the White Paper regarding this scheme.  As a result, I feel that the farmer who might intend going ahead under the present scheme or under the scheme that is emphasised in the long term, does not know whether it would be better to go ahead and invest under the existing scheme or to wait to see if he would do better under the scheme that is emphasised in the White Paper.  An uncertain situation like this, due to no finality being reached, always tends to favour inaction.  You will find that farmers who are undecided as to what to do will be slow to go ahead under the present scheme and will wait to see what the Government or the Department are going to produce under the new <Col N="843" /> scheme.  This is not good forward planning and could certainly not be described as such.  There is strong evidence that, notwithstanding the general prosperity in the sheep industry, mountain sheep <Col N="844" /> production has not benefited in any way.</P>
