      <P>I have notice from Senator Hussey that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, she proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The serious situation that has arisen at the Wood Quay national monument site as a result of building operations, where Viking artefacts were uncovered by building machinery last Monday.</P>
      <P>I rule this matter is not admissible for discussion on the Adjournment on the ground that there is no ministerial responsibility involved.</P>
      <P>I also have notice from Senator Connaughton of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The fact that section 40 notices are no longer being served for the purpose of land acquisition.</P>
      <P>I regard this matter as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and it will be taken from 8 p.m. to 8.30 p.m., or earlier, if the business ordered is concluded.</P>

    <Title>Restrictive Practices (Confirmation of Order) Bill, 1979: Second and Subsequent Stages.</Title>
    <P>
      <Col N="531" /> Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy (Mr. O'Malley) Desmond J. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>The object of this Bill is to confirm the Restrictive Practices (Motor Spirit) Order, 1979 which I made on 12 June under the Restrictive Practices Act, 1972.  This order extends for another year a statutory ban on the operation of new motor spirit stations by oil companies. The order was due to expire shortly.</P>
      <P>The supply and distribution of motor spirit and lubricating oils has been the subject of legislation since 1961.  The first order was made following an inquiry held in 1960 by the Fair Trade Commission.  That inquiry was concerned principally with examining the merits of the &ldquo;solus&rdquo; system, the system under which a retailer agrees to handle one brand of motor spirit exclusively.  It found that while the system had certain merits, it needed to be regulated because of its tendency to encourage an excessive number of petrol outlets.  The system was regulated by the 1961 order, and shortly afterwards the Fair Trade Commission and the petrol companies reached agreement on certain guiding principles designed to limit the increase in outlets.</P>
      <P>In the following years the guiding principles did not appear to be operating effectively as the number of company-owned outlets grew substantially, from 133 in 1960 to 394 in 1969.  There was also concern that the regulation of the solus system was leading the oil companies to increase the number of directly-operated outlets.  Accordingly, in 1970 the Minister requested the commission to hold an inquiry into this growth in outlets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Commission reported that the growth in the number of company-run stations was not in the public interest as it could lead to abuses if the oil companies attained a dominant position in the retail market.  In 1972 an order was made prohibiting oil companies from <Col N="532" /> operating retail outlets which were not previously operated by them.  The order was made initially for a period of three years; in 1975 it was reviewed and, on the recommendation of the commission, extended for a further three-year period.</P>
    <P>Following the review in 1975, the commission suggested that, when they next reviewed the prohibition, they should also review the orders as a whole.  The commission had also stated in their report of the review that they received representations on matters relevant to the orders but as they were outside their terms of reference they could not consider them.  Accordingly I decided, when requesting the recent inquiry, that they should not alone look into the operation of the orders as a whole, but also any matters germane thereto.  I also decided that they should look into a matter which had been a source of grievance to some people in the trade for a number of years&mdash;the conditions under which persons who are not employees of the oil companies operate their stations under licence.  The order was renewed in 1978 to allow the commission to hold an inquiry into these matters.</P>
    <P>The commission held the public hearings in connection with this inquiry in the early months of this year.  They have indicated to me, however, that they will not be in a position to report to me for some time yet.  In these circumstances the currency of the prohibition on the operation of new company outlets was extended for a further year.</P>
    <P>The Restrictive Practices Act provides that orders of this kind shall not have effect unless they are confirmed by an Act of the Oireachtas.  The Bill now before the Seanad is the confirming Bill required to give the force of law to the order.  The order may not be amended, but must be accepted or rejected as it stands.</P>
    <P>I have no hesitation in recommending it to the Seanad.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>We, too, support the proposal to extend for a further year the <Col N="533" /> prohibition on the operation of new petrol filling stations by oil companies. However I should like to raise a number of important issues.  The Minister referred to one of them, that is the question of the terms and conditions of those who operate retail filling stations on behalf of oil companies.  I know this was the subject of the recent inquiry.  It does seem as though the oil companies, or a number of them, operating in Ireland are doing so in such a way as to prevent the operators of the retail stations having the necessary security of tenure in their jobs&mdash;they are not given proper leases with the right of renewal&mdash;and it also endangers the employment of the people employed by them.</P>
      <P>This is a major problem and I would welcome some comments by the Minister about his attitude towards the subject matter of the recent inquiry by the commission.  I certainly have heard of a number of situations in which married men with families, whose lease is not renewed by the oil company, find themselves without any right to remain there.  They find themselves before the courts, being ejected; their employees find themselves out of a job.  It is all part of what appears to be a very highhanded and heavy-handed operation by the oil companies.  I gather that the practice of oil companies in other countries is to operate a leasing system which gives a right of renewal, which gives security of tenure and future rights and employment security to those who operate a retail petrol filling station.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister might give us some idea of the leasing practices in this regard; whether or not it is a certain number of filling stations who are operating under these conditions and whether some others have better security of tenure and better right to renew the lease than certain other petrol stations. This is becoming a very real problem. Certainly it is something that is worrying the petrol retailers' association very deeply indeed.  It is causing a lot of suffering to Irish operators of retail stations and to their Irish employees.  It is something about which we should be very concerned.  I hope the Minister will take a very strong stand against what in <Col N="534" /> European Community terms might be called an abuse of a dominant position, abusing the strength of their position on the market, not entering into fair terms with the operators of the retail stations, giving them proper security of tenure. That is the first important matter that arises under this order and to which the Minister referred briefly in his opening speech.</P>
    <P>The second matter I should like to refer to is the question of whether there is an abuse of this order.  Is it possible for an oil company to have a nominee who appears to be acting on his own behalf but who is, in fact&mdash;under some hidden agreement, gentlemen's agreement or whatever you want to call it&mdash;acting on behalf of the oil company?  I would like to give a specific instance of what may be a case in point.  Perhaps the Minister knows about this particular problem.  It arises in the planning permission which was given in 1970 for a new petrol filling station at IA Oxford Road, Ranelagh. That planning permission was given against the wishes of Dublin Corporation at the time.  Dublin Corporation refused the planning permission and it was obtained on appeal to the Minister. At the time the owner was a private person.  I do not think I need name him here.  The site, with the planning permission for a petrol station, was sold to Shell.  They subsequently resold it to another private individual who has now, almost ten years later, sought to reactivate the permission to build a filling station.</P>
    <P>The site is a totally inappropriate one. Oxford Road, which is narrow, is choked with traffic.  The residents in that area object to the opening of the petrol filling station.  There is a very strong rumour in the area&mdash;I heard it from residents in the area&mdash;that it is not the individual who is concerned but that this is, in fact, a front for the oil company who know that this order, which the Minister is now extending, would prohibit them from opening a petrol station there.</P>
    <P>This is a very serious problem indeed. It is an example of where a very bad planning decision, taken almost ten years ago, is capable of being reactivated now, in 1979, when it is a much <Col N="535" /> worse decision, because traffic congestion has increased in that area.  There are a number of petrol filling stations in the area.  I wish I had the map here to show the Minister just how many petrol filling stations there are in that area; it is overfull. I gather the throughput in the petrol filling stations in that area is below average even for Dublin; that it is very low.  It seems to be a very serious situation when a bad planning decision&mdash;which can affect the residents in a whole area&mdash;can be reactivated nine years later.</P>
    <P>There is provision in the 1976 Planning Act for a cut-off after five years. Therefore, there would be a cut-off in 1981.  But that is no good for the residents at present who face this prospect of the petrol-filling station opening.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister inquire fully into the circumstances of this sudden reactivation, after nine years, of the planning permission for a petrol-filling station on 1A Oxford Road, because the local residents appear to believe that this may be a front for an oil company and that the individual concerned may only be operating under some private arrangement? They have made submissions to the Dublin City Council about the matter and these will be pursued by the local representatives.  However, when the Minister is tabling an order of this sort, to control the outlets of oil companies, he must have regard to the possibility of evasion of the order and of secret arrangements being entered into by the oil companies and certain individuals operating retail outlets, circumventing the objectives of this order and of the Act.</P>
    <P>I would welcome some comment from the Minister on this and I hope he will investigate that particular instance.  It is intolerable that an extremely bad planning decision which would have a very damaging effect on the residents of that area should be capable of being resurrected at this stage.  There have been protests not only from the immediate residents of Oxford Road, Rugby Road, Rugby Villas and that area but there have also been supportive objections <Col N="536" /> from all the residents' associations in the peripheral areas.  This matter is not immediately before the Minister as a planning decision but I would welcome his investigation into it because it seems to be an instance where, to say the least of it, there is very sharp practice in relation to our planning code.  It is also a new petrol filling station outlet in a totally unsuitable area, where the residents believe that it is a front for an oil company seeking to circumvent the Minister's order.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the extension of the order for another year.  It is right that that should be done because a year is a long enough term to extend the order.  We are at present in a transitional state as far as oil outlets and oil sales are concerned.  It is a time when the Minister and his Department will learn much about the activities of oil companies.  We have learned a lot about the many aspects of the sale of oil and petrol in the recent past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would draw the Minister's attention to some privately-owned garages and filling stations that were set up and approved by oil companies, under very tight agreements, but which were not supplied by the oil companies during the recent oil crisis.  These garages should merit special attention from the Minister because they complied with the agreements entered into but they have been denied regular supplies, even on a quota basis.  The agreements are so tight that they cannot be broken in law.  The extension of this period will give the Minister time to consider this.  Unlike Senator Robinson, I do not support the very tight restrictions on planning permission for new filling stations.  That would restrict us in removing the monopolies from all the major companies.  I am a member of a local authority and I am very conscious of the fact that where there is a planning application for a new filling station the planning authority are entitled to be very careful and to give every consideration to objections from residents and others.  I would not like to see a blanket disapproval of new filling stations advocated.  We have an ever-increasing oil consumption and we cannot be tied to the long-established outlets <Col N="537" /> or filling stations.  We are paying very dearly for oil.  We should encourage competition and I certainly support the setting up of new privately-owned filling stations.  I do not want to see filling stations established and supported by companies who will use the situation of the day to supply or withhold supplies.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to support the extension of this period for another year.  The Minister will have an opportunity of looking afresh at the sale and distribution of oil in this country.  It is very important to the future of the economy and to the future of those who use petrol and those who have to sell petrol.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Senators for what they have said.  In relation to the points raised by Senator Robinson the position is that the Restrictive Practices Commission, in the early months of this year held an inquiry into not alone the practice dealt with in this Bill but into various associated practices in relation to the retail oil business, including some of the grievances, practices and difficulties to which she referred.  I anticipate their report in the autumn, when they will deal with the kind of matters that Senator Robinson mentioned. pending the receipt of their report I do not want to anticipate their findings or the conditions generally under which stations, particularly company-owned stations, are operated.  I will bear in mind what the Senator said when I come to consider the commission's findings.</P>
      <P>Senator Robinson mentioned the question of the security of tenure of people operating company-owned stations. This has been a long-standing grievance and it has been looked into by the commission. Senator Robinson referred to the leasing arrangements.  Unhappily the real problem is that generally speaking they are not leases but are usually caretakers' agreements and other licences and similar devices which are of little or no legal value.  The longest period of tenure granted is two years and nine months, for the purpose of keeping the station or the premises out of the operation of the Landlord and Tenant Acts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="538" /> Senator Robinson also raised a point about the possible abuse of this order and previous orders by oil companies on the matter of putting in nominees to circumvent the order.  I have no evidence of that.  If the Senator or anybody else has any evidence I will have it investigated by the examiner.  It would be a serious breach of the order and the Act under which it is made if such were happening. The Senator also mentioned one instance at Oxford Road, Ranelagh, where the local community believe that there is an effort by an oil company to circumvent the order.  If they have any evidence of that, I would be glad to get it and I will immediately have the matter investigated.</P>
    <P>The number of privately owned and company owned stations has fallen marginally in recent years but the proportion of petrol sold through company-owned stations seems to be increasing and is out of proportion to the percentage which they bear to the number of stations as a whole.  This is a matter that one would be concerned about.</P>
    <P>Some Senators may be aware that a practice, in relation to company-owned stations, about which a grievance has been expressed in recent years, was of oil companies requiring their licensees, caretakers, managers or whatever one might call them, to give trading stamps to customers as a condition of their being able to operate the station.  I am sure this House will be glad to see the provision in the Trading Stamps Bill which will prevent that practice in the future.  It caused loss to the operators of such stations and was of benefit only to multinational oil companies and to a foreign-owned trading stamp company.</P>
    <P>In case there is any misunderstanding about it the purpose of this order and Bill, is not to restrict the number of stations but only to restrict the number of company-owned stations.  Subject to the planning laws and whatever other byelaws apply, private individuals are perfectly free, under this Bill, to establish new stations.  That covers most of the points raised by Senator Robinson and Senator McGowan.  If there is any other <Col N="539" /> point that I have not covered, I will be glad to do so.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>

    <Title>Irish Steel Holdings Limited (Amendment) Bill, 1979: Second and Subsequent Stages.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy (Mr. O'Malley) Desmond J. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>The main objects of the Bill are to increase the authorised share capital of Irish Steel Holdings Ltd from £6 million to £25 million, and to raise the ceiling of borrowings which may be guaranteed by the Minister with the consent of the Minister for Finance from £3 million to £60 million.</P>
      <P>Irish Steel Holdings Ltd. are a wholly State-owned Company with share capital of £6 million held by the Minister for Finance.  The amount of borrowings covered by ministerial guarantee at present is £765,800.</P>
      <P>The principal activity of the company is the manufacture of steel from ferrous scrap.  Their principal products are reinforcing bars and sections in a limited range of sizes mainly for the construction industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following advice from external consultants who made a thorough study of the company's operations and potential, the company have embarked on a major development and restructuring of the industry which it is anticipated will give more efficient and more flexible production. A new 90 tonne electric are furnace will be installed to replace the existing 30 tonne electric arc furnace.  A continuous casting facility and a new universal bar and section rolling mill will replace older outdated plant.  The programme envisages the commissioning of the new plant by mid-1980 and the expansion of <Col N="540" /> crude steel output and finished product output over the succeeding five-year period to a projected annual output level of 282,000 tonnes of saleable products. This will be more than double present output.</P>
    <P>While this restructuring of the steel mill will give greatly increased production capacity the work force will not be increased.  The position is, however, that the company's operations are no longer viable and without this modernisation programme the industry would have to shut down with the loss of the jobs of over 700 workers and the loss to the country of its only manufacturer of reinforcing steel.  The industry will now be given modern methods of steel production which will put the company's unit costs of production on a competitive level in the European Community.</P>
    <P>The cost of the programme will be in the region of £45 million, including £10 million working capital and pre-production expenses.  Of the £45 million, £10.5 million will be provided by the Exchequer as share capital, £4 million by an IDA grant, £17.5 million by a loan from the funds of the European Coal and Steel Community, £8 million by the leasing of equipment through United Kingdom banks and the balance from other commercial sources.</P>
    <P>The crisis in the steel industry which has been with us since 1974 together with the outdated methods in use have created difficulties for the company and consequently they have had to borrow heavily to keep in business.  The com pany's projections, however, show that even allowing for the servicing of these loans there will be profits in the third and subsequent years of operation.</P>
    <P>As Senators are probably aware, the European Commission did not immediately approve Irish Steel Holdings' proposals.  This was because of their requirement that investment proposals should not be in conflict with the restructuring requirements of the Community steel industry made necessary by the world steel crisis.  The Commission initiated discussions between the company and a French steel company&mdash;Societe Metallurgique et Navale Dunkerque, Normandie (SMNDN)&mdash;which led to <Col N="541" /> the conclusion in December last of reciprocal marketing arrangements.  The two companies have agreed to market a proportion of each other's production in their respective areas of market influence&mdash;up to 30,000 tonnes per annum in each case when the Irish Steel Holdings plant becomes operational. During the period prior to the commissioning of the new plant Irish Steel Holdings and SMNDN will maintain contacts with a view to fostering relationships not only between the two companies but also with their respective customers.</P>
    <P>I might at this stage point out that the company's policy will, of course, be in the first place to satisfy the home market demand, the balance of production being for export.  The agreement with SMNDN will give the Irish company a foothold in the wider Community market as well as providing economies in production costs.  However, apart from the anticipated benefits from the agreement the company are building up their own sales management team to deal with the increase in products for export expected to come on stream late in 1980 and have already made useful contacts to supply customers outside Ireland.  The consultants who examined the projects are satisfied that the export targets can be met.</P>
    <P>The European Commission is satisfied that together with the modernisation of the Irish Steel Holdings plant the agreement with the French company is in accordance with the general objectives for the Community steel industry. Irish Steel Holdings thus qualifies for a loan at a favourable rate from the funds of the European Coal and Steel Community.</P>
    <P>There are also some other amendments to the Principal Act proposed in the Bill</P>
    <P>&mdash;Section 2 provides for the change of name asked for by the company from Irish Steel Holdings Ltd. to Irish Steel Ltd.</P>
    <P>&mdash;Section 5, besides providing for the raising of the ceiling for ministerial guarantee of loans includes some changes in the relevant section of the <Col N="542" /> Principal Act so that the guarantee may cover</P>
    <P>&mdash;loans and so on in a currency other than the currency of the State</P>
    <P>&mdash;payment in respect of contracts entered into for leasing of plant and equipment as well as commissions and incidental expenses arising in connection with a loan or leasing contract.</P>
    <P>&mdash;Section 6 provides for the approval of the Minister and the Minister for the Public Service to the remuneration of the chief officer of the company, and</P>
    <P>&mdash;Section 7 provides for similar approval of any alteration or arrangement in the superannuation of the staff of the company.</P>
    <P>The two last amendments are being included in the legislation for all State-owned companies as the occasion arises.</P>
    <P>I am confident that the Bill will commend itself to the Seanad and I recommend the Bill for its approval.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJMcCartin" hpid="Mr. McCartin Mr. McCartin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartin</NameTxt>
      <P>My side of the House agrees with what has been done by the Minister in this case.  Anybody looking at the situation, the number of jobs and the size of the investment we are talking about, would naturally have to ask himself some serious questions.  We must recall the commitments and the guarantees given to semi-State bodies in earlier years.  I recall the situation when NET, a semi-State body, were formed. The guarantees that were given both to the consumers and to the Government were that the project was viable and that products would be sold at the right price and would be available competitively on the Irish market.  We have seen a situation where those guarantees did not materialise.  I hope that the people who made the plans in this case know exactly what they are talking about.  I have no reason to believe that they do not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The size of the proposed investment in relation to the number of jobs is what gives concern, plus the fact that in the end the State will be the underwriter if the plans do not work out.  I have no doubt about the sincerity or the integrity of the people involved in drawing up these plans, but they have not put any of their own personal resources or their reputations at risk.  I know the State is <Col N="543" /> not making the complete investment but they are increasing their guarantee from £3 million to £60 million.  Considering the difficulties in the steel industry all over Europe and the situation where unemployment has risen in areas with a tradition of more efficient steel production than anything we have been doing here, we must ask ourselves what else could be done with a similar amount of money.</P>
    <P>We agree with the legislation; we know that 700 people are in employment and we know the importance of this industry to them.  It is so important to them that a figure of money could not be put on the value of retaining their jobs. For that reason we do not question the legislation.  But one feels obliged to ask what an investment of a similar nature could have done in other areas.  This investment is almost twice the amount of money spent on the farm modernisation scheme for all of this country in one year; it is more than all of the regional fund over the number of years for which it will be payable.  We are talking about a vast amount of money for the safety of a comparatively small number of jobs. Nevertheless, the Minister's decision is the one that we, on this side of the House, would make if we were in a similar situation, but my thinking should be considered also.</P>
    <P>We heard the argument that we cannot leave ourselves wide open to the winds of fortune, should a situation arise in which we would not be in a position to import steel from neighbouring countries in the Community.  We were left in this situation before, Irish Steel having had the monopoly for so long.  There were in the past industrial problems in Cork which left all the industries dependent on the services of Irish Steel Holdings Ltd. high and dry for six to eight months, during which they were forced to run around the world looking for replacements of the supplies which they normally got.  The argument that we cannot leave ourselves completely dependent on supplies from foreign-based industries is not entirely valid when we remember that when we had this security here we had a break-down in labour relations <Col N="544" /> and we had a strike which left large segments of Irish industry running around trying to solve problems which had resulted from this strike.  This aspect should enter into any calculations being made at present.</P>
    <P>This is something that we will have to think about as time goes on and a decision need not necessarily be made now. When a question of this nature comes up in the whole context of the European Economic Community, if somebody argues about the subsidisation of or assistance to the dairy industry in Ireland, and the situation with the dairy industry in France, or some of the other European countries, I always say that we can produce the goods much more efficiently and at a better rate than they can be produced in France and that therefore there is a good argument for building up our industry.</P>
    <P>Other industries could also be looked at in a similar way.  If we have an amount of money to invest in a semi-State company it is only reasonable that we should ask ourselves whether we are putting it into the right industry, or whether other people can produce the product at a cheaper rate so that we can buy it at a cheaper rate, or whether we can put this money into an industry where we are sure we have the advantage, the expertise and experience to compete, so that there will be no question of the State ever being faced with underwriting losses.</P>
    <P>From my experience of Irish Steel Holdings they are an efficient company. In spite of the fact that they enjoyed a monopoly we did not experience the sort of independent attitude and approach to their business dealings that one might expect from monopoly companies.  I know of companies in the private sector which had a monopoly which were much more difficult to deal with than this company which enjoyed for a long time what might be called a monopoly in some areas of their business.  Although they did not have a complete monopoly, nevertheless a lot of equipment and machinery was geared to deal with the sort of product that came out of Haulbowline in Cork.  As a business Irish Steel Holdings Ltd. have been conowne <Col N="545" /> ducted most efficiently.  They have given a good service.  The workers which they employ are entitled, on this occasion, to the protection and the guarantees given to them by the State, which we approve of.  I would ask them to make the best of the opportunity being given to them and please let us not see anybody coming back in three or four years regretting that miscalculations had been made and that labour relations or some other problem created a situation in which the State had to foot the bill at the end of the day, and Irish industry had been badly served.  I am confident from my experience of this company that this will not happen and I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ValentineJago" hpid="Mr. Jago Mr. Jago">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jago</NameTxt>
      <P>Irish Steel Holdings Ltd, have been a long time with us now.  They started in the earlier days of the State and they are much appreciated in the Cork area.  They are also appreciated throughout the country, especially if we refer back to the years of the Emergency, from 1939 to 1945, when we were relying on Irish Steel to supply us with our requirements.</P>
      <P>There was concern in the Cork area when we heard that to be competitive Irish Steel would require a new injection of capital and that due to the policy of the EEC on the curtailment of the production of steel there was a possibility that Irish Steel would disappear. Not alone was there concern for the loss of the product but also for the loss of the jobs which are very important in the area of the lower harbour.  It was with relief that we heard that this arrangement had been made whereby they would associate with a French company so that production would be divided as to lines and that sales would be amalgamated.  We look forward now knowing the way in which Irish Steel have been managed and the difficulties which they have overcome in the past, and knowing that now they are in a position to get greater production and greater sales on a fewer number of lines. Their efficiency should improve and we can look forward to better days.  We hope that they will prosper and that this capital investment will be well worth while, as I am confident it will be.</P>

      <P>I, too, welcome this Bill.  Irish Steel, as we are in the habit of calling them, have been with us now for quite a number of years and we are very proud of the work that they have done.  I am glad to note the change to the shorter form.  We are very proud of the colossal length of steel bars that have come from that factory down through the years because the steel bars that are produced there are a vital ingredient in the construction industry.  We cannot have buildings without concrete and steel.  We have the cement already but it is only since Irish Steel came into production that we have been able to have our own steel bars manufactured in our own country.  Perhaps we in the Cork area are inclined to get sentimental about this industry.  We are very proud of it and of the good living the workers there can have.  Unfortunately, industrial relations at one particular stage were not what we would desire but we have no tradition in the manufacture of steel products.  By degrees we are getting used to the idea of producing steel here at home and, please God, with a better climate industrial relations will remain at a satisfactory level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has said about everything that could be said.  He put the matter clearly and briefly when he said that a new 90 tonne electric are furnace will be installed to replace the existing 30 tonne electric are furnace.  That shows the determination of the company to increase their production and to increase it to a significant extent.  The Minister went on to say that the programme envisages the commissioning of the new plant by mid-1980, which will be in about 12 months time, and the expansion of crude steel output and finished product output over the succeeding five-year period to a projected annual output level of 282,000 tonnes of saleable products which will be more than double the present output.  In the world we are living in we must be highly competitive.  It will be part of the functions of the company from now on to work in collaboration with their friends in France and an interchange of ideas and of techniques as far as marketing is concerned will be all to the good.  In the Cork area we are anxious that the great <Col N="547" /> work force there would remain at a constant level, certainly that it would not fall to lower than 700 workers.  The workers have gradually acquired skills and have applied them in their work and we hope that this new injection of capital will ensure the viability of the firm of Irish Steel and that during the coming year they will go from success to success.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very pleased to hear of the expansion of Irish Steel.  One does not need to come from Cork to be proud to hear this news.  In fact someone coming from Donegal might appreciate it more because those of us who drive across the Border fairly often see the vast amounts, even on the road, of steel that is imported into the country.  I welcome the news that Irish Steel are to do a major expansion job.  When one looks at the figures one finds that the amount of State funds going into the company is less than half what is needed because the company are raising by way of loan the greater part of the money. This is a very healthy sign.</P>
      <P>I am aware that we are importing vast amounts of steel but the new rolling mill will actually put Irish steel into a completely new market.  We are at present importing boatloads of sheet steel to make radiators, shutters, boats and everything else for which rolled steel is required.  This is a great day for Irish Steel.  Steel is one of our basic industries and Irish Steel will make a major contribution to the economy and to all the people who are indirectly involved in steel fabrication.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, again, we are importing fabricated steel.  It is sold to us fabricated and with labour input, very often.  There is a whole new basic change here and I welcome it.  It is healthy from the national point of view and it will encourage many firms that were not engaged in the fabricating industry here to look at the prospects for the future.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelMulcahy" hpid="Mr. Mulcahy Mr. Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill, too, and I should like to associate myself with some of the sentiments that have been expressed already.  I would like to draw attention to the fact that there are <Col N="548" /> certain strategic industries in this country and that steel for the construction industry is one of these.  It is essential that we have at least one facility under each of the strategic areas in the country.  I am thinking of oil as well as steel.  Sometimes one hears statements from the EEC about restrictions, that there is over-capacity in oil refining, or that there is over-capacity in the steel business, and they put pressure on small countries, but small countries must resist these pressures.  We must make sure that we have at least one facility that is capable of keeping us going in times of crisis or stress.  I am very pleased to see the regeneration of this facility in Cork and to see the modern technology being introduced in terms of continuous casting facilities and so on.  For too long we have tended not to bring our technology up to the best levels of the technology that our competitors have at their disposal.</P>
      <P>I will make one other point.  We are always concerned about whether units of this kind are economically viable.  The Leas-Chathaoirleach has expressed the hope that this company will not have to come back to the Government in a number of years and say that they had underestimated costs and so on.  For so long as an industry generates an amount of added value per person employed, or per £ of total investment, which is similar to the amounts generated by the competition, then we can keep on going. When we talk about losses and about not making profits, we are talking about certain residuals.  Other countries, like Japan, have found this to be the case in the past and when countries like the US were operating to criteria which had to do with profit only, and did not continue at the rate of investment required to maintain their world market share, they lost market shares.  We are not in that size of business; we are not talking about getting a world market share but we should keep it in mind when people start talking about businesses of this kind not being viable.  I repeat that as long as they generate an added value per unit of input, that is per person or per pound of investment, then they will keep on going. I welcome this further development of one of our strategic industries.</P>

      <P>I wish to thank those Senators who have spoken to this Bill.  I am broadly in agreement with all the views that have been expressed on all sides.  You, Sir, when you spoke earlier, mentioned the considerable cost of maintaining these jobs of which there are only 700.  Many, many thousands of jobs could have been created <i>de novo</i> for the amount of money that we are talking about.  However, the object of spending money is not strictly to maintain 700 jobs.  If it were just that I would not ask this House or anybody to spend that type of money to save jobs because it simply would not be worth it.  What is at stake here is something more fundamental than just the 700 individual jobs.  This is the entirety of the steel manufacturing industry in Ireland.  The manufacture of basic steel, such as goes on at Haulbowline, is a matter of some strategic importance to this country as well as being of considerable economic importance.  In the past, for one reason or another, we had periods when there was a shortage of heavy steel for the construction industry and when that occurs&mdash;as it did once or twice&mdash;it has a disproportionately bad effect on the economy because the construction industry is a major part of our economy. The kind of steel that is proposed to be made here is what are called long products as opposed to flat steel products or sheet steel.  Senator McGowan mentioned sheet steel but that will not be produced in Haulbowline though Irish steel will continue to galvanise imported sheet steel and to sell it as galvanised sheet.  The products that will be made in this new mill are reinforcing bars, plain rounds, champered squares, torque bars, hexagon bars, equal and unequal angles, flats, channels, joists, universal beams and columns and extended billets all of which I think are relevant in one way or another to the construction industry primarily.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If there were to be an emergency of some kind which made it impossible for us to import steel, and if we did not have access to this kind of steel, we would be in very serious trouble indeed.  It was not easy for me to make the decision to put <Col N="550" /> at risk a great deal of public money with regard to this project.  Equally the sort of misgivings I have, and which I think Senator McCartin and others may have to some extent, were shared in Europe by the Commission and I had to talk to Commissioner d'Avignon on three occasions before I finally got his agreement and the agreement of the Commission to go ahead with this project.  The Commission have been very fair in their approach to this proposal.  It is one which must have been difficult for them to swallow.  We hardly know what the steel industry is but in Europe in recent years they have seen tens of thousands of jobs lost, not just in countries but in relatively small provinces in many of the continental countries.  Of all the ailing industries of Europe steel is perhaps one of the sickest.</P>
    <P>For them, therefore, to give us their support and encouragement in this project was a judgment on their part which was extremely fair to this country and took into account our island situation, our comparative isolation and the necessity for us, notwithstanding our membership of the Community, to have access to certain basic strategic materials manufactured within our own jurisdiction.  The Commission have made available fairly substantial funds, at favourable rates of interest, as a mark or gesture of their support.  I am also very glad that they were able to negotiate this arrangement with the steel company in Normandy whereby each company would sell certain products for the other and thereby enable each of them to shorten their line of products and to make each of them more competitive in terms of cost.  There are several hundred jobs involved here as well as a steel industry and of course with the sort of money we are talking about they are the 700 most expensively retained jobs ever in this country.</P>
    <P>I hope that those whose jobs have been retained at such considerable cost to public investment will bear that in mind.  I would share with you, a Leas-Chathaoirleach, your anxiety that I or my successor would not be coming back here in a few years' time and saying to the Seanad that Irish Steel miscalculated <Col N="551" /> or that they ran into enormous labour difficulties which have put the cost up 50 per cent, or 100 per cent, or whatever.  I have had the very unhappy experience of having to live with NET during the last two years and I am conscious that this establishment is only a couple of miles away.  It is my fervent desire not to have to come back to either House of the Oireachtas with an amending Bill to extend these already high figures any further.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned in the other House, we are fortunate that Mr. Kevin McCourt, the chairman of this company, accepted my invitation to become executive chairman for two years to see this project through.  I have every confidence in his ability to do that.  He has already proved himself in the private sector in a not dissimilar sort of task and he has the ability and the talent to do an equally good job here on behalf of the public at large.  I would express the hope that he will get every co-operation at every level of this company and from their contractors and sub-contractors as well.  If that is forthcoming I have every confidence that this work can be completed on time and within budget.  Work has been under way for the past several months and I am glad that it is on time and is so far within target.  They will be coming into the more expensive and more difficult parts of the operation shortly.  I hope they will continue to be as successful as they have been during the past few months in regard to this.</P>
    <P>I have dealt with most of the points that were made but if there are any which I have overlooked no doubt Senators will avail of the opportunity on Committee Stage to remind me, when I should be glad to answer any queries.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasWhitaker" hpid="Dr. Whitaker Dr. Whitaker">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Whitaker</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the section which enables the Minister to subscribe additional share capital for the company. I should like to take advantage of Committee Stage to ask the Minister how the proportion which is to be subscribed as share capital was arrived at. He mentioned on Second Reading that of the £45 million required, £10,500,000 would be provided by the Exchequer as share capital, that £4 million would be provided by way of IDA grant and so on.  Is there a <i>rationale</i> to this or is the £10,500,000 the residual that remains to be provided after the loan from the European Coal and Steel Communities and the leasing arrangements and IDA grant?  I am particularly interested in this because the equity contribution is the capital contribution which does not have to be remunerated in all circumstances. Therefore it is the element of capital which could be a channel for subsidisation of the company in case of need&mdash;in other words, by not drawing a dividend on the share capital.</P>
      <P>The Minister has assured us that the modern methods of steel production which will be brought into being will ensure that unit costs of production will be on a competitive level with that in the European Community.  That is a careful statement.  It does not necessarily mean that production will be profitable.  The company however, he says, have made projections showing that allowing for the servicing of the loans there will be profits in the third and subsequent years of operation.  If those profits happily materialise then they provide a source from which the Exchequer's equity contribution could be remunerated.  If they do not materialise for any reason then the equity goes unrewarded and in effect, in addition to the IDA grant interest-free capital is being provided for the company&mdash;a form of subsidy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wonder when the Minister is replying could he clarify also a point where the language in his speech was perhaps a little careful.  He said the consultants are satisfied that the export targets can be <Col N="553" /> met.  I realise that to get on a competitive unit-cost level output has to be considerably enlarged and that, therefore, exports have to be arranged.  I yield to nobody in admiration for the valiant work done by previous chairmen, the present chairman and the Board and management of the company in trying to achieve viability under the handicap of a very low throughput and difficult labour relations at times, as the Minister has said.  When it is said that the export targets can be met does that mean&mdash;which would be rather obvious&mdash;that production for export on that scale is possible, or that in fact remunerative markets for the export surplus of the company are likely to be found?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>On the points raised by Senator Whitaker and regarding the figure of £10.5 million as the equity, I would say in relation to that figure, without wanting to appear evasive, that the figure was fixed in consultation with the Minister for Finance.  I have no doubt the Senator will appreciate all that that entails.  There are certain alternatives when it comes to the residual financing.  It was the judgment of the Minister for Finance that the top part of the £10.5 million might with greatest advantage to the State be subscribed by him as equity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as dividends are concerned it is very much the policy of the present Minister for Finance that dividends where at all possible should be paid and should be paid in a commercial fashion. For too long it has been taken for granted by companies, even the relatively small proportion of our State manufacturing companies who are profitable, that State equity was some sort of free gift, or interest-free loan with which they could do as they wished.  If there was a greater realisation generally of the nature of equity investment and the fact that when the State makes the investment or the Exchequer or the taxpayer make it, it is no less deserving of its due reward, there might not be a tendency to the same extent to regard some State companies as fair game for what one can get out of them.  The taxpayer <Col N="554" /> is entitled to get his pound of flesh out of those that succeed, particularly so in the light of the fact that he gets so little out of those that do not succeed.</P>
    <P>In regard to exports, there has been a marked contraction, as the House will know, in the European steel-manufacturing industry.  There is far less competition within the European industry now.  I gave the House a list of the actual products that are projected and some of which are being made already.  The number of competitors that the revamped Irish Steel will have to meet in the European steel market is much reduced to what it was some years ago. Because of their sharing arrangement with the Normandy company, apart from what the Normandy company will sell for them, their prospects of selling in the European market are a great deal better.  The House will be aware that in recent times Commissioner d'Avignon introduced certain controls, particularly in relation to prices, which have proved helpful to the European steel industry and have had the effect of cutting down some of the imports, particularly from some far Eastern countries which had created a great difficulty, particularly for some of the older established steel mills such as those in Lorraine, and had caused great difficulties for the British steel industry also.  It is worth remembering that the losses reported by some nationalised steel industries in western Europe in recent times have been astronomical.  Small and all as our steel industry is it has performed not too badly in all the circumstances.  It is now in a much stronger position.  This improved situation I am confident will extend to its marketing ability.  It did not have a very extensive marketing arm, but it will have now.  Its prospects are much better, because the degree of competition it will have to meet will be a good deal less. There has been a good deal of rationalisation and order brought into the European steel market in recent times principally as a result of the initiatives of Commissioner d'Avignon.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill do now pass.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Seanad adjourned proceedings on this Bill last week I was making the point that the Government, having committed a gigantic legal error, had an obligation to rectify the position of any citizens prejudiced by that legal error.  The point has been made that nothing happened to people that would not have happened in any event, but in answer to that I said that people are entitled to expect to be dealt with, not just according to the facts of their case, but according to the law relevant to their case.  Because of the legal mess that the Government's action created, there was no law for many of the people dealt with during the course of the invalid 12 months or so.  The result was that a considerable number of citizens&mdash;I do not know how many&mdash;whether they be members of the force who were disciplined, or who were promoted, or members of the public, who occasionally make applications to the Garda for one thing or another, who found themselves being refused their application or, indeed, even granted the application, or citizens who were convicted in the courts, who possibly are now serving jail sentences, have all been prejudiced because the Government made a gigantic legal mistake.</P>
      <P>The Government were also guilty of a gigantic breach of injustice against the then Commissioner, and I will deal with this matter later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The people who have been prejudiced, by reason of the Government's action&mdash;I mean prejudiced in law and not necessarily in fact&mdash;are entitled to have their position rectified.  The Government have an obligation to come out of this <Col N="556" /> sordid affair with clean hands.  It is not enough for the Government to come before the Houses of the Oireachtas and say: &ldquo;Here is a Bill and when it is passed the <i>status quo</i> will be restored.&rdquo;  That is not sufficient.  The Government must be seen to come out with totally clean hands and the only way they can do that is for them to take an initiative in searching out cases where persons were prejudiced during the term of the invalid appointment and rectifying the position so far as those citizens are concerned.</P>
    <P>It is not enough for the Government to say in this House that they are providing the law and if any citizen feels aggrieved by what happened to him he may proceed to the courts.  I submit to this House that that is not sufficient; it is putting an unfair onus on a person who may not be in a position, for financial or social reasons, to take up that onus and rectify his own position.  Because the State made a legal mess it is up to it to cure the consequences of that mess and be seen by all the citizens of the country to want to come out of this sordid affair with clean hands.  For this reason I urged the Minister last week to consider that proposition in the hope that he would come back to this House today and tell us that he was agreeable to it and that he was arranging for the law officers of the State to investigate these matters with a view to rectifying them.</P>
    <P>I put forward the case, namely that the State had done an injustice in law to many citizens through the term of the invalid appointment, with total confidence in its correctness.  Unfortunately, I cannot anticipate with the same confidence that there will be a similar reaction on the part of the Government.  It would be out of character with the injustice that was perpetrated earlier on an individual citizen and out of character for a Government who showed themselves careless about the norms of justice and proper standards of procedure where citizens are concerned.  I regret that I cannot look forward with confidence to getting a satisfactory answer to a case the correctness of which is beyond dispute. However, we shall have to wait and see if my gloomy forebodings are justified.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="557" /> In the course of this debate last week it appeared, from what I read subsequently in newspapers, that the Minister was relying on what he called a &ldquo;background&rdquo; to imply justification for the action of the Government, and he referred to certain papers being available to me, lest my memory might be faulty.  I am well aware of the background, but the difference between the Minister and myself is that I was not prepared to do other than support the head of the national police force against suborning tactics by certain elements to have him removed from office.  I did not consider that this so-called background justified anything less than total loyalty to a man who was giving good service to the State, whose ideas were right and who was implementing them.  The Minister, on the other hand&mdash;my successor&mdash;possibly because of constraints that preempted him, from his days in Opposition, felt that he had to treat this so-called background in a different way. Instead of giving support to a loyal servant of the State he collaborated in his subornation.  The proof of that is contained in a statement in <i>The Irish Times</i> of 25 March 1978 where it is actually printed that the Representative Body of the Garda had written to the Minister to discharge their chief officer.  That is an appalling state of affairs and it is the background to which the Minister was referring.  That is a sordid background.  It is regrettable that the Minister, instead of supporting the chief officer of the national police force, who has been guilty of no misconduct, to use the Taoiseach's words, chose to treat him unjustly and in an appallingly harsh way.</P>
    <P>I want to make it quite clear that so far as background is concerned I am aware of this so-called background but it was not one that would have persuaded me to have anything less than confidence in the then Commissioner. This leads me to make one further point: to reiterate a call that I made in March of this year for the establishment of a police authority.  It is important that some body should be interposed between the police force and the Minister of the day.  What I said when I spoke in March of last year was that the changes that <Col N="558" /> have taken place in the development of the force and the development of the relationship of the Minister with that force, now in the light of what happened over this unfortunate incident, make it imperative that there should be a police authority or an independent body.  At the moment, the day-to-day running of the force is conducted by the Commissioner, but there is a constant input from the Department of Justice, there is no doubt about that.  The extent and nature of that input varies from time to time.  It can be influenced by contemporary events and by the personalities that happen to be present in each place at a particular time.</P>
    <P>While the day-to-day running of the force is the prerogative of the Commissioner, it would appear that the interventions that are made by the Department are based on the legal position that the Minister has overall responsibility.  The difficulty is to decide, from time to time. what is day-to-day and what concerns the Minister's overall responsibility. There is a quite understandable and proper tendency on the part of the Department to take a deeper interest in the affairs of the force than overall responsibility would involve, in order to keep their Minister right.  This tendency involves interference&mdash;that is not an ungracious word&mdash;in day-to-day matters. This is a relationship which can be difficult and has led to difficulties.  Many of these difficulties would be obviated by the presence of a police authority, an authority that would be appointed and be manifestly free from political influence and would operate entirely without political considerations.  I do not think the overall control that must remain with the Minister would be prejudiced, or diminished, by such a development; he would retain legislative and, above all, financial control.</P>
    <P>At this stage coming to the end of this whole sordid episode, I would plead again with the Minister to reconsider his views on the merits of establishing a police authority.  I will again express regret that the Government and the Minister treated Commissioner Garvey in the fashion in which they did.  His record, from the time he joined the force <Col N="559" /> until he was summarily dismissed from it, was without blemish.  His many positive achievements do him credit, all designed to make the force better and more efficient and, consequently, to serve the public in a better way.  It is regrettable in the extreme that he was treated in this way.  The fact that he has been vindicated so far&mdash;more proceedings have yet to come&mdash;has highlighted the wrongness of what the Government have done.  As far as he is concerned, in the public eye his reputation stands as high as it always did and he has been totally vindicated.  I will conclude by again appealing to the Minister to consider what I have said as to the necessity of the State coming out of this matter with some credit.  The only way that the State can do that now is by being generous towards the people whom it has unjustly and unlawfully treated.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidMolony" hpid="Mr. Molony Mr. Molony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall be very brief.  I want to say that I am sorry that the Minister for Justice is not here because what I have to say relates to something that was discussed here last week.  I understand that he may be in some difficulty and has other demands on his time.  This is something that affects him in an assurance that he gave me here last week and about which I have since acquired some new information and I feel that I should put into the record of the House what I know and what the Minister said and perhaps get another opportunity at another stage to bring it to the Minister's attention directly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I referred last week to an editorial that appeared in <i>The Irish Times</i> on 8 September 1977, in which the Government were accused of the monoeuvre of weaseling; that was described by that editorial as using newspapers to fly a kite or to sell a story to see how it would be received.  <i>The Irish Times</i> said that in &ldquo;non-attributable&rdquo; conversations Fianna Fáil have recently, for example, tried to get newspapers to do for one of their Ministers what the Minister should do for himself, either by direct action of by persuasion.  They were referring to a story that they said the Minister tried to fly, and that was the removal from office <Col N="560" /> of the Commissioner.  I put that to the Minister and in reply he said:</P>
    <P>I hope the Senator will not think I am interrupting him when I say that if ever I have to ask a newspaper, whether it be <i>The Irish Times, The Irish Press</i>, the <i>Irish Independent, The Limerick Leader</i> or <i>The Kerryman</i> to do my job for me then I should not be in this House.  That is putting it very clearly.  I have asked nobody.  I know nothing of it.  I was not involved in any way...</P>
    <P>What the Minister said there may have been literally true, but I cannot accept its entire truth.  I believed that in substance it was, to say the least, misleading.  I have learned in the past week that a couple of days before that editorial was written there was held a non-attributable press briefing by the head of the Government Information Services at which the head of the Government Information Services floated this story and asked the newspapers to write about it to see how it would be received&mdash;that the Commissioner was going to be removed from office. I expect that the head of the Government Information Services would not, without some authority, or without being asked to do so, hold such a press briefing.  I would have assumed, in the ordinary course of events, that it would have been the Minister for Justice who would have briefed him, or discussed the matter with him beforehand.  If the Minister, Deputy Collins, says that he knew nothing about it then I would accept it, because I cannot show otherwise. But if it is the case that the head of the Government Information Services, without authority from anybody, can go to newspapers and ask them to make reference, in a non-attributable story, to the Commissioner of the police force being about to be removed from office, then I think there is something very seriously wrong with a Government who allow that to happen.</P>
    <P>I look forward to a future opportunity of discussing this matter with the Minister and getting his view on it.  I am saying this because what the Minister for Justice said and what I said is already on the record of the House and it is only <Col N="561" /> proper that it be completed.  I would ask the Minister of State who is here to shed light on the matter, if he can at all; it is important, because we have been led to believe that the decision to remove Mr. Garvey was one that did not occur three or four months before he was actually removed from office.  One way or another there is a point of great principle involved here.  Either the head of the Government Information Services was briefed and requested to do this, or else he did it off his own bat.  If he was requested, and requested by the Minister, the Minister has seriously misled this House.  If the Minister did not brief him and the head of the Government Information Services did it on his own account, without authority, then I believe that that man is not fit to hold office.  I believe that one way or the other there is a serious question involved here and the Members of this House are entitled to a full and frank reply.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. D. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>If I may deal with the last point first, I am not aware of the allegations made by Senator Molony, but I would like to make it very clear that if he accepts, in logic, what the Minister for Justice says about his not being involved in any way in the setting up of this leading article in <i>The Irirh Times</i>, then he can take it as a corollary to that, as an extension to the Minister's absolute and emphatic denial, that, certainly, the head of the GIS did not hold such a press briefing.  That appears to be the reality of that, because certainly the head of the GIS would not have held a press briefing unless he had the authority of the Minister for Justice.  It is quite clear, in those circumstances, that the Senator is basing his argument on a false premise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Justice has already denied any knowledge of it and the Senator has very fairly accepted the Minister's denial.  In the meantime, apparently, he discovered that the head of the GIS has now become involved since he made this accusation <Col N="562" /> against the Minister for Justice on the last occasion.  This type of thing could go on <i>ad nauseam</i>, and if I deny&mdash;and I have no grounds to deny&mdash;that the head of the GIS had anything to do with any such press briefing or that there was any such press briefing, on the next occasion the Senator will bring in some third party.  I do not see why the Minister for Justice should have that hanging around his neck, or that the head of the Government Information Services would undertake to hold a press briefing, as described, without anybody's authority. I would respectfully suggest that these allegations are a figment, if not of the Senator's imagination, of somebody else's imagination&mdash;namely, the person who gave him this information.  Of course, if you throw dirt of this nature, some of it sticks; there is no question about that; that is an unfortunate reality of public life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidMolony" hpid="Mr. Molony Mr. Molony">

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. D. Andrews Mr. D. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I would certainly not undertake to look into it.  In conscience I could not.  On Fifth Stage last week Senator Cooney raised the question of it being possible that a citizen who may have been imprisoned&mdash;I assume from the context that he is referring to someone who is convicted on a criminal charge&mdash;during the relevant 16-month period would have suffered an injustice at the hands of the State, by reason of the invalidity of Mr. McLaughlin's actions during that period. The Senator suggested that if any person were so aggrieved, consideration should be given to compensating him in whatever way might be appropriate.  It would appear that what the Senator was advocating would, in practice, imply that the State should take the initiative in trying to have the sentence of some convicted criminal set aside on some legal ground which, in turn, depended entirely, even if indirectly, on the ground that Mr. McLaughlin's appointment was invalid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Though the invalidity of Mr. McLaughlin's appointment could conceivably give a person a basis for making <Col N="563" /> a legal argument in certain cases, it is clearly an issue wholly unrelated to the reliability of the actual evidence of guilt. On behalf of the Minister for Justice, I put it to the House that it is the community that would suffer if individuals succeeded in invalidating convictions on grounds that would have nothing to do with the reliability of the evidence.  I suggest that it would be, not just an unnecessary initiative by the State, but a positive injustice to the community at large, if the State were to take the initiative in endeavouring to secure that a convicted criminal could escape the consequences of his conviction, and possibly even qualify for compensation, on grounds that had nothing to do with the trustworthiness of the evidence on which he was convicted.</P>
    <P>What the Minister for Justice submitted to the House in presenting this Bill, and what I am now repeating on his behalf, is that the House, by passing this Bill, would simply be saying that, in so far as it is concerned, a person found guilty of crime on evidence that satisfied the courts beyond reasonable doubt should not now escape the consequences simply and solely because Mr. McLaughlin's appointment as Commissioner was invalid.  I underline the point that I am not setting myself up, and that this House is not being asked to set itself up, as a judge of the evidence.  The evidence we are speaking of has satisfied the court beyond reasonable doubt as to the person's guilt.  If Senator Cooney were to consider a specific type of case, rather than looking at it in general terms, it would be unlikely that there would be any disagreement.  What would be involved is that a person convicted by the courts of, for instance, armed robbery, or some other serious crime, somebody who perhaps was caught in the act, should be released or given compensation because of the invalidity of Mr. McLaughlin's appointment.  Of course, if there is some convicted person who feels that he is entitled to have his conviction set aside on grounds connected with any act which is expressed to be invalidated by this Bill, it is open to him to raise the matter in court and he can even apply <Col N="564" /> for legal aid, and, no doubt, the court will allow legal aid, if he has an arguable case.  But I would have to make it clear that, as far as the Minister is concerned, the policy would be to resist and oppose in court, as far as possible, any such application for the setting aside of such a conviction or for compensation.  The interests of the community require that the policy be adopted and maintained.  I submit to the House that it, for its part, would certain be doing no injustice to anybody by approving of this Bill.</P>

      <P>This short Bill proposes an increase from nine to 12 in the statutory number of ordinary judges of the High Court.  It takes account of the fact that by virtue of the provisions of section 14 of the Law Reform Commission Act, 1975, the number of such judges may, in certain circumstances, be one more.

      <P>The appointment of additional judges of the High Court, as provided for in section 1 of the Bill, is necessary because of the increased volume of business coming before that court in recent years, coupled with the fact that the court is, in effect, short of one judge, because the full time of one judge has been for some time, and still is, taken up with sittings of the Special Criminal Court.  Up to January 1977 the Presidency of the Special Criminal Court had been filled by a retired judge of the High Court, but he was then appointed chairman of An Bord Pleanála and, in order to ensure that there would, at all times, be a High Court judge available to act as President of the Special Criminal Court, it became necessary to appoint four High Court judges to be members of that court.  The effect of this has been to deprive the High Court of the full time of one judge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another factor which is a source of <Col N="565" /> strain on the resources of the High Court is the substantial growth in recent years of family law business which, because of its personal nature, needs to be disposed of with the minimum of delay.  The stage has now been reached where it has been found necessary to allocate the full time of one judge to it.  The increase of two in the number of High Court judges provided by the Courts Act, 1977 has thus been absorbed and the court has not been able to reduce either its arrears of business or the average time-lag between the date of setting down of a case and the date of hearing which, in the case of jury actions, had grown from seven-and-a-half months in 1977 to ten months on 6 April 1979, the end of the Hilary law term.</P>
    <P>The annual number of jury actions set down for hearing in the High Court has risen from 863 in 1872 to 1,861 in 1978 and, despite the fact that in 1978 the court disposed of 1,555 cases, the highest number disposed of by the High Court in any one year, arrears continue to accumulate and a serious position now exists.  The position has been made worse by the necessity to assign a High Court judge to conduct the Bantry Bay disaster inquiry, which is likely to deprive the High Court of his services for many months.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, it is essential that additional judges be made available to the High Court with the minimum of delay, otherwise a situation will arise in which it will be impossible to overtake the arrears of business, and the time-lag between the dates of setting down and of hearing of cases will continue to increase, a situation which, I am sure Senators will agree, must not be allowed to develop.</P>
    <P>This Bill is, therefore, of vital importance to the proper administration of justice and I commend it to the House.</P>

      <P>Time slips past.  The last time it happened it had the effect of reducing the time lag in litigation coming to trial, or for hearing.  Anything achieving that aim is desirable, and I hope this Bill will assist in that way also.  I recall that one of the constraints on increasing the number by more than two at that time was the shortage of accommodation; we could have increased the number of judges but the difficulty was to provide court rooms, chambers and all the other necessary ancillary facilities.  There were severe difficulties of accommodation in the Four Courts at that time.  I had initiated certain changes to try to ease the accommodation in the Four Courts.  The old Four Courts Hotel was purchased.  It was the intention to move certain clerical staff from the High Court and the Dublin County Registrar's Office into the Four Courts Hotel, thereby making more space available for courts proper in the Four Courts building itself.  I think too there were discussions involving the possibility of some part of the solicitors' building being used to provide a court.  Perhaps when the Minister is replying he could give an indication of where these additional judges will sit, if it has been found possible to bring that initiative to completion and extra court accommodation is now available.  I think there were problems also concerning the District Court and to a lesser extent, the Circuit Court&mdash;problems of accommodation.  I would be glad to hear from the Minister what is the up-to-date position on the whole court accommodation scene generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another factor which has tended to slow up litigation coming to hearing has been the complexity of the pre-trial procedures, the pleadings and all the rest of it that have to be undertaken.  I recall that when I left office a Bill was at an advanced <Col N="567" /> stage of preparation.  So far as I recall, the heads had been approved and, indeed, drafting had commenced&mdash;a Court Officers Bill which was to implement recommendations of the Committees on Court Practice and Procedure, designed to speed up the pre-trial procedure and to give an enhanced jurisdiction to the Master.  The recommendations would have streamlined the pleadings.  They would have provided for the exchange, in documentary form, of certain formal proofs so as to obviate the necessity of calling technical witnesses to prove something that was going to be admitted anyway.  They provided for an exchange in medical reports and various preliminary matters such as that, all designed to make the process more streamlined and get the case to court sooner.  It also provided for an enhanced jurisdiction for the Master to enable him to make rulings on a lot of preliminary matters which at present have to be dealt with in the court proper after the case has been set down, which delays the setting down of the case and can delay the action getting under way. When I left office, the heads of that Bill had been settled and, so far as I recall, the actual Bill itself was being drafted. That was two years ago and I would have expected that that Bill would have been completed by now and be before us.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that the consequences of that Bill will be to speed up litigation. I would urge the Minister to find out what is the present stage with regard to it and to try to ensure that it will come before the Houses of the Oireachtas when we meet again after the summer recess.  Hopefully, the combination of the extra judges, the streamlined administrative procedures and pre-trial procedures will possibly achieve what we would all like to see, a period when the delay between setting down and hearing will be reduced to not more than a month and that, more importantly, the time lag between the issuing of the summons and getting it to the setting-down stage will be reduced from its present period, which can range anything from a year to two years, or even longer.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="568" /> Perhaps the Minister would deal with those two matters&mdash;the question of the up-to-date position with regard to accommodation in the Four Courts and the present position with regard to the proposed Court Officers Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. D. Andrews) David Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. D. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to Senator Cooney, the former Minister for Justice, for welcoming this Bill.  He appreciates probably more than most of us the need for the increase in the number of judges.</P>
      <P>On the question of High Court accommodation and court accommodation generally in the Four Courts, as the Senator is aware, at present there are some nine court rooms available for High Court business.  As I have stated, one High Court judge sits on the Special Criminal Court in Green Street. Therefore at present it is possible to accommodate all ten High Court judges at sittings in Dublin.  Judge Costello's temporary absence on the tragic Bantry disaster inquiry will make another court room available.  Because High Court judges have other duties to discharge elsewhere than in the court room in Dublin there are many occasions during the year when court rooms are available which could be utilised by the proposed additional judges.  Those occasions arise when, for example, the High Court goes on circuit to hear appeals.  Of course, the High Court goes on circuit to hear original actions at provincial venues&mdash;that is when it goes to Cork three times during the year in January, April and October to hear original jury actions, when judges are working in their chambers on the preparation of judgments, vetting transcripts of cases, writing notes on cases appealed to the High Court or studying relevant papers for sittings of the Court of Criminal Appeal, and when the Court of Criminal Appeal, which is comprised of the Chief Justice and two High Court judges, is sitting.  The President of the High Court has, of course, expressed concern in that respect and in other respects and is doing what he can to ensure that the judges of the High Court have proper accommodation. I know he is achieving his objective in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="569" /> The Circuit Court accommodation, from my short experience at the Bar, in one particular building was high up and, to say the very least of it, a very inaccessible courtroom.  However, I understand that things have improved somewhat in that regard in the Circuit Court area.  I do not think there is too much hardship on the Justice and the litigants in regard to the District Court.  There are quite a number of District Courts in the area of the Four Courts, including the Bride-well&mdash;as Senator Cooney will appreciate&mdash;and I think District Courts in the Four Courts area are reasonably well catered for.</P>
    <P>On the question of the Court Officers Bill I should like to assure Senator Cooney that, whilst I cannot give any undertakings, this Bill will be before this House in the next term, as he requested. Certainly every effort will be made to bring it forward as speedily as possible. The matter is being dealt with in the Department of Justice at this time. Senator Cooney knows the problems involved in the preparation of Bills of this nature, and indeed others relating to the Department of Justice.  He would appreciate the difficulties one encounters. One prepares the heads of a Bill; one sends them to the various Government Departments.  They have to give their opinion.  Then one gets all the heads back with the comments from these Government Departments which must be analysed and so on before being brought to the attention of the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>I should like to asure Senator Cooney that certainly we will take note of what he says and undertake to bring forward as speedily as human beings can, within their competence, matters of this nature.</P>
    <P>There were no other queries in relation to the Bill.  There is urgent need for the appointment of these three judges.  I appreciate the unanimity of the Seanad support for the Second Reading.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Public Service (Mr. MacSharry)</NameTxt>
      <P>The main purpose of the Bill is to provide the necessary legislative authority for the appropriate payments to Irish representatives elected to the European Assembly.</P>
      <P>Section 2 provides that Irish representatives will receive, in respect of their duties in the Assembly, the equivalent of the allowance payable from time to time to a Dáil Deputy.  This is in accordance with the decision of the European Council that Assembly representatives should be paid the same remuneration as the members of the Parliament of the country they represent.  It was left to each member state to decide, in relation to members holding a dual mandate in the national parliament and the Assembly, whether they should retain both salaries.  It has been decided that Irish representatives in the Assembly, who are also members of the Oireachtas, will receive their appropriate Oireachtas alallowance in addition to their Assembly allowance.  It is not, however, necessary to provide specifically for this in the legislation.  It is not the intention that an office-holder who becomes an Assembly representative would continue to hold office. In line with this, the Minister of State who was recently elected to the European Assembly has resigned his office. The question of payment of salary as an office-holder in addition to allowances as member of the Assembly and the Oireachtas does not therefore arise.  Payment of the Assembly allowance will continue from the beginning of the term of office, that is, in the case of an elected representative, from the date on which the Assembly first meets after the election&mdash;17 July 1979 in the case of the first elected Assembly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Members of the European Parliament have in the past received allowances in respect of travel, subsistence and secretarial expenses, and it is understood that these payments will continue to be determined by the Assembly and met <Col N="571" /> from the Assembly budget.  It is not envisaged, accordingly, that any expenses would fall to be met from voted moneys. It is considered desirable, however, to have a provision in the legislation enabling payment of expenses to be made from voted moneys if the necessity should arise in the future, for example, if these expenses should cease to be borne on Assembly funds.  Section 3 enables this to be done by way of Order.</P>
    <P>Section 4 provides for the making of a contributory scheme for the grant of pensions to, or in respect of, the Irish representatives in the Assembly.  The provisions will be set out in the scheme itself, which will be generally on the lines of that already applicable to members of the Oireachtas.  Such a scheme will be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas in accordance with section 6 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Bill also provides, in section 5, for the avoidance of conflict of interest arising through representatives of the European Assembly having direct involvement in the affairs of State-sponsored bodies.  Already, the individual Acts governing most of these bodies contain provisions designed to ensure that a person shall not at the same time be a Member of the Oireachtas and a member of the board or staff of a State-sponsored body.  The application of similar limitations to representatives in the European Assembly is appropriate, and the present Bill affords a suitable opportunity to do so on a general basis. The Schedule to section 5 lists the bodies to which the limitations will apply, and further bodies may be added as and when appropriate.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>From the Minister's statement it is quite clear that this Bill should not be before this House at all because he says, and I quote:</P>
      <P>Members of the European Parliament have, in the past, received allowances in respect of travel, subsistence and secretarial expenses, and it is understood that these payments will continue to be determined by the Assembly and met from the Assembly budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="572" /> Why will the Assembly not accept full responsibility for a payment of the salaries as well as other allowances?  It would have been the natural thing to do, the right thing to do.  While we discuss this Bill, probably the eight other countries comprising the EEC are doing the same thing, have done, or possibly will do it.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister fully realises that this was a decision taken late at night, a rather foolish decision.  It was taken by the head of the British Labour Party Government at that time.  I do not understand the reason.  Perhaps the Minister might enlighten us.  That Government have since left office.  I am quite satisfied that the motive behind it was political, and it was accepted.  It is a waste of time and money discussing this Bill at all.</P>
    <P>Now we are confronted with a rather peculiar situation, that we have 410 members of the European Parliament. We will have at least nine of them with different salaries.  Is it not natural that people in the high-up bracket will look down on people in the lower bracket?  I have with me the various salaries&mdash;which I shall quote&mdash;being paid by various countries to their Members of Parliament.  Even in this country, having elected 15 members to the European Parliament, it means that 12 of them will have an income between their Dáil salary and European salary of £13,822 per annum.  It means, additionally, that one of them will have an income of £10,969 and two of them will have an income of £6,911.  I cannot see how any Government or Minister can justify that.  It is foolish and a waste of time.</P>
    <P>We might take a look at salaries being paid in other member countries&mdash;my figures are not up-to-date; they are those for 7 March, 1978, and may not compare with those I have given already&mdash;in the United Kingdom, £6,270 per annum&mdash;that is net salary without any subsistence or overnight allowance; Belgium, £21,500; Denmark, £11,750; Germany, £22,700; France, £21,000; Italy, £21,000; Luxembourg, £9,000; Netherlands, £9,530 and the Republic of Ireland, £6,273.  Those are the salaries of <Col N="573" /> the different members of Parliament in these countries.  If, for example, in France a member of their Parliament was elected to the European Parliament and was in receipt of his salary from his own Parliament, he would have an income of £42,000 as against the highest paid representative we have in Europe who is in receipt of £13,800.  It is not sensible.  I am sure the Minister fully realises this because he is a very sensible person.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that within a very short time this matter will be taken to the European Court with a decision being taken giving each member of the European Parliament the same salary.  If we have three different rates of salary for 15 representatives I am sure the same will apply in other countries.  Indeed we could end up with 30 or 40 different rates of salary, even 50.  I do not think a Parliament can work or will work that way.</P>
    <P>European salaries should have been paid and fixed by the European Assembly, as are the travelling, subsistence and overnight allowances which some people maintain are substantial; I do not know.  I believe these salaries will be fixed ultimately by the European Court and that will be the end of it.  I have often asked myself what salary a European candidate should receive.  There is no way one could offer a European candidate the same salary as a Dáil Deputy when one thinks of the amount of travelling he does.  For example, take some people living in the far west.  I can think of nobody better at present than my neighbour, Senator McCartin, or Mr. Seán Flanagan, who have to fly out of Dublin, probably returning late that night.  They must endeavour to keep two homes and keep in touch with their families.  I do not know what kind of salary one would need to offer them. Certainly there is no point in offering them the same salary as a Dáil Deputy. Indeed, as we all look into the future, it appears to me that if the European elected representative is doing his job properly he should not be a member of either House of the Oireachtas.  Certainly this Bill is ridiculous, it should never have come to this House; rather the <Col N="574" /> salaries should have been fixed by the European Assembly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to make one or two comments about this Bill. Certainly I agree with Senator Reynolds that it borders on the ridiculous.  I regret I was not present for the Minister of State's Second Reading speech.  Perhaps he has already answered some of the points I should like to raise.</P>
      <P>This year we have had here a number of Government decisions which set many people thinking.  After a five or six month marathon European election campaign it is ridiculous to find the Government introducing a Bill like this, proposing to set the rate of remuneration of the Irish directly-elected members of the European Parliament on a scale similar to that presently enjoyed by Members of the Dáil and which anyone will accept is far too low taking account of present day prices, relativities, or whatever yardstick one wishes to use.</P>
      <P>We are on the periphery of Europe.  In travelling to the meeting place very seldom is an Irish representative able to make a direct connection by plane.  He must fly over London, Amsterdam or Brussels and very often this warrants travelling the night before, for which the member cannot claim expenses.  What I am amazed about is that the Government, in their wisdom, decided that they have not got the authority to allow members to continue to enjoy the facilities the House provided by way of booking travel and hotel accommodation that proved so useful.  Indeed, I should like to compliment Martin McMahon and David Reynolds in the inter-parliamentary section for the wonderful facilities that they have&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I bow to your ruling. I had not intended doing so but I just wanted to put on record the tremendous contribution that the staff members of the House have made to the Parliament of the Community over the past six years.  Their task, which necessitated <Col N="575" /> working over and above the normal hours that the civil service work, warrants recognition.  While, on one hand, the Government say they have no power to allow those officers of the House to continue to book tickets, reserve hotel accommodation or indeed even to allow the Joint Committee to pass on documentation or information to members, at the same time they can set a salary for these members which will be a fifth of the salary which will be provided by the members from Berlin and a fourth of the salary provided for members from Sicily, which is one of the poorest areas in the Community after the Irish midlands.  If we are to believe the press the Irish members will have almost certainly a third less than their counterparts representing Northern Ireland.  Our people going out have a difficult job, they are in a new environment.  At least their salary should be adequate.  Certainly under the terms of this Bill it will not be.</P>
      <P>May I take it from my reading of section 2 that members of the European Parliament who are not Members of the Dáil or Seanad will receive only £6,700 per annum?  Do I take it that Senator McCartin, who has been elected in the western constituency, will receive in addition to his Seanad salary, a sum equal to his Seanad salary or will it be a sum equal to a Dáil salary?  It is not spelled out in section 2.  Do I take it that the remuneration of Mr. Maher and Mr. Flanagan, both elected to Europe and who are not Members of either House of the Oireachtas, will be solely £6,700 per annum?  My recollection is that this decision was arrived at after a dinner discussion at the second last Council meeting when the wine had been flowing fairly freely.  It is ludicrous that any Council, or any organisation, should arrive at a decision whereby, for instance, representatives from this country would be paid three different rates of salary.  It is nonsensical to say the least.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>New members will have to face many difficulties from the point of view of just getting to the venues of the meetings, and I would have expected the Government to rush in to ensure that our members <Col N="576" /> would be as fully equipped as possible by a system of briefings, or by facilitating their travelling allowances.  I was shocked today to find that even the briefings that the nominated parliament enjoyed are being discontinued.  What is this country coming to?  Surely there is a role for the members of the European Parliament to play on our behalf?  Surely it is in the interests of the country that these people should be given the very best facilities that we can possibly give. It will not be any skin off the Government's nose if they just brief the members on the situation as it is here in relation to any item that may hit the agenda whether it relates to regionalisation of transport, agriculture, or social affairs.  This is a shocking state of affairs if we are going to start into a new era, where, at last, we have this tremendous step forward and a greater democratisation of the European Community, by putting everything possible in the way of facilitating and equipping our 15 members to the European Parliament.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 5 (2) provides that members will be disqualified from holding certain offices on being nominated to contest the election.  This is a little unfortunate, as it will deter people from allowing their names to go forward.  That should be amended.  People should be encouraged to allow their names to go forward and to contest these elections.  People should not be penalised for so doing.  That kind of a provision deters people from being part of the electoral system.  It is not in the interests of democracy.  I hope that the Minister will see his way to changing that disqualification to read &ldquo;elected to or nominated directly&rdquo; to succeed someone in the European Parliament.</P>
    <P>The Government have taken upon themselves the onus of providing pensions as well as salaries for the members of the Parliament.  From my reading of the Statues of the European Parliament I feel that the Parliament has absolute power over their own budgetary affairs. These matters ought to be left to the institution.</P>
    <P>There is no great sense of unity and there is no indication that the Community are drawing closer.  There is no <Col N="577" /> sign of any great European unity in a range of salary scales and pensions for members coming from different provinces.  This is quite shocking.  I hope I have misread section 2 and that there is just one salary for each member representing this country.  Has the Minister of State taken into account the fact that the salary scales in the other part of this country have been considerably increased or that there is a proposal to increase them this summer? This will mean that if this Bill goes through unamended the three members elected from Northern Ireland will enjoy a salary which is approximately 50 per cent greater than what is proposed for the better paid of the Irish representatives, and more than 100 per cent greater than what is proposed for the lesser paid of the Irish members.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a remarkable silence from the Government side of the House on the question of the allowances for members of the European Parliament. I do not know whether they are so chastened by the recent election that they have no view to express on this question.</P>
      <P>Like Senator Reynolds and Senator McDonald, I am extremely critical of the approach in this Bill and of the terms of the Bill.  It is regrettable that the decision to have the allowances and other pay and conditions of members of the European Parliament decided at the national level was taken by the Council of Ministers at the Bremen meeting in December 1978.  As I understand it&mdash;I hope the Minister of State will comment on this&mdash;there was great political pressure from Britain.  Surely the Irish Government should not have fallen into the trap of undermining the pay and conditions of the 15 Irish members directly elected to the European Parliament. It was clear from the attitude of the European Parliament and from the power of the Parliament over their own budgetary affairs, that the intention in moving to direct elections was to have the pay and conditions of members directly elected to that Parliament governed by the European Parliament.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Prior to that decision in Bremen there <Col N="578" /> was a very high level deputation to the European Council putting forward the view of the delegates to the European Parliament that the salary or allowance of members of the European Parliament would be determined at the European level and would be pegged to a percentage of the salary of members of the European Commission and therefore would be increased to take account of rises in the cost of living and so on and that it would be the same rate for all the nationalities represented in the European Parliament.  What we are doing by having it decided in this unequal way at national level for the different countries of the European Community is undervaluing democratic representation, under-paying the members of the European Parliament for the job we are asking them to do, and this is very serious. We are witnessing a further diminution of democratic representation and democratic control at the European Community level.  The pressure seems to have come from Britain, because Britain had and continues to have problems in her membership of the European Community, and political problems in reconciling herself to being one of a Community of Nine and not a British empire which wants totally to control her own affairs and to call the tune in Europe. Britain seems to have succeeded in calling the tune in so far as the terms and conditions of the members of the European Parliament are concerned.</P>
    <P>There was a very weak decision by the Council of Ministers at that Bremen meeting on four different levels.  First, there was a decision that the allowances and conditions of members of the European Parliament would be decided at the national level for the nine member states; secondly, that pay would be regulated at the national level; thirdly, that the taxation provisions would be determined at the national level; and fourthly, that pensions would be decided at the national level.  They were weak decisions; they are not a strong base for the European Parliament and they were contrary to the views and wishes of the existing members of the European Parliament.  As I understand it, a number of countries have introduced temporary legislation in this matter. <Col N="579" /> Perhaps the Minister of State in his reply would give us an account of the state of the legislation in the other states and would indicate to this House the member states which have introduced temporary legislation.  I propose to table an amendment for Committee Stage which would suggest that this legislation should be temporary in its nature and should have a date for its termination so that we would have good reason to try to influence the attitude of other member states and also good reason to listen to the views of the newly elected members of the European Parliament.</P>
    <P>After the election and all the publicity given to it our 15 directly elected members of the European Parliament are in danger of becoming forgotten people. This may be part of a Gaullist idea that the European Parliament should not be given any significance in the European Community.  During the election campaign a very strong view was expressed by the Fianna Fáil Party that they did not want to see more power and influence given to the European Parliament. One way of ensuring that there is no more power and influence at European Parliament level is to under-pay and under-equip the members of the European Parliament.</P>
    <P>I would regret very much if that Fianna Fáil attitude during the election were carried over now in considering the allowances, pay, conditions and back-up services to members of the European Parliament.  It would be a highly regrettable step which would diminish the influence of a directly elected parliament and would diminish the aspiration of the peoples of Europe to have a parliament which would represent them and which would give them a stronger accountability for decisions being taken in the Council of Ministers.  The members should be equipped and in a position to fulfil one of the most difficult jobs that elected representatives can possibly have, the job of representing a very large segment of their own population in a European Parliament where conflicting views have to be reconciled and where they have not only to influence their own political group and work in the committees, <Col N="580" /> but also make a contribution in Ireland so that their constituents can understand what they are trying to do, can understand the enormous influence that the European Community have on our daily lives; and can understand the enormous number of very important decisions that are now taken in Brussels, not by the European Parliament but by the Council of Ministers under a very strong influence from the Committee of Permanent Representatives, and the representatives of the national bureaucracies.</P>
    <P>The development of the European Community from the beginning has not been a healthy democratic development. Decision making was not carried out in an accountable and responsible way, responsive to the democratic structures. Having had the experience of a direct election of members of the European Parliament it would be sad to dilute that and dimish it by under-paying and under-equipping the members of the European Parliament for the job they have to do.  That is my first major criticism of this legislation.  I propose to table an amendment for Committee Stage to provide that this be a temporary measure pending the realisation of the role of members of the European Parliament and the need to have their allowances and conditions standardised, equal for all members, regardless of their nationality and determined at the European level.</P>
    <P>Did the Government seek any legal advice on the compatibility of this legislation with the powers of the European Parliament and their relationship with their own budget?  Was any legal advice sought as to whether or not it was compatible with the Treaty of Rome and with the status and powers of the European Parliament to have the salaries determined at a national level and to have them, therefore, unequal in relation to the different member states?  If this advice was not sought by the Irish Government from the Attorney General's Office, is the Minister aware of whether this advice was sought at the European level, perhaps of the legal service of the Commission or of the legal service of the Council of Ministers, and if so is the Minister able to give us the <Col N="581" /> benefit of any such legal advice?  For reasons outlined by both Senator Reynolds and Senator McDonald it seems that there are very strong constitutional objections to the result achieved by leaving it to the member states to determine the pay and conditions of directly elected members of a parliament.  In Ireland's case two of our members are not Members of the Oireachtas at all, but were directly elected by the people to a Parliament which is having no direct say in relation to the allowance to be paid to those members despite the budgetary structure of the European Communities and the hitherto jurisdiction of the European Parliament over the allowances of the members of the Parliament.</P>
    <P>My understanding of section 2 is that the allowance which will be paid to the Irish members of the European Parliament, is the equivalent of the existing Dáil salary, whether or not they are Members of the Dáil or Members of the Seanad.  Between the 15 they would have an equal but a humiliatingly low salary as members of the European Parliament in comparison to what their German, Dutch, Danish, French, Italian and other counterparts would have.  I have a list of the existing salaries for members of the different national parliaments, but Senator Reynolds already made reference to this, and I will not delay the House by repeating the figures.</P>
    <P>It is a great pity that instead of insisting as a member state of the European Community that our 15 representatives be paid a salary commensurate with their responsibility and with the job they have to do, which would be equal to that paid to the German, French, Italian and Dutch counterparts, we allowed the British difficulties in psychologically coming to terms with the membership of the European Community, to undermine these important values and standards, resulting in the situation in which we have second class members of the European Parliament paid a second class rate but expected to do a first class job on behalf of the people who elected them.</P>
    <P>What is the precise meaning and scope of section 3 of the Bill?  This section <Col N="582" /> provides that the Minister may, if he thinks fit, by order, provide for the payment of allowances for expenses to representatives in the Assembly, who have been elected or appointed thereto in the manner described in section 2 (1) of this Act.  The question of the <i>per diem</i> allowance for attendance, and the subsistence allowance, I understood, was to be a matter for the European Parliament. As I understand it at the moment, the <i>per diem</i> subsistence allowance is approximately £62 per day at the European Parliament and the new European Parliament may review this and may decide whether or not to increase it.  I do not understand the significance of having a section here relating to the allowance and I would be grateful if the Minister could expand on that in his reply.  This was not part of the Bremen decision between the Government and the Council of Ministers which only related to pay, taxation and pensions.</P>
    <P>I would refer also to the provision in relation to the pension scheme.  Section 4 provides that the Minister may make a contributory scheme for the granting of pensions to or in respect of persons who have been elected or appointed to the Assembly in the manner prescribed.  This scheme is to be similar to the existing scheme for Members of the Oireachtas. Having been involved in a procedure before the Labour Court, which resulted in a determination that that scheme was discriminatory on the basis of sex, and awaiting a revision of this scheme for Members of the Oireachtas so that it does not discriminate against married women and so that it makes provision for the benefits of the scheme to carry over to widowers as well as to widows of Members, I would like to have clarification from the Minister and an assurance that the scheme for members of the European Parliament will not continue this discrimination as so found by the Labour Court.  Deputy Eileen Desmond is a widow and our other female representative in the new European Parliament is not married but she may well have intentions in the future in that regard.  On her behalf and on behalf of any future married women elected to the European Parliament I hope that the Government will move forward and will <Col N="583" /> not continue an existing discrimination which I hope will be remedied as soon as possible when this scheme is reviewed and the necessary amendment is made to remove the existing discrimination on the basis of sex.</P>
    <P>The other provision of the Bill relates to the question of disqualifications of Irish representatives from membership of or employment by certain bodies, and these bodies are listed.  They are the standard bodies for which a person is disqualified if he becomes a Member of the Oireachtas.  This is a measure which it is appropriate to have in legislation of this sort.  There are strong reasons why it is desirable to have this provision that a person who is elected would be automatically disqualified from membership of that kind of body.</P>
    <P>I would refer to the whole question of the relationship between the directly elected members of the European Parliament and the Oireachtas.  This was the subject of discussion this afternoon in the Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the European Community. Senator McDonald was also present at the Committee discussions.  It was felt by members of the Joint Committee that there had been a very precipitate cut-off of the existing facilities which were extended to the former delegates of the European Parliament. These delegates of the European Parliament had the valuable assistance of the staff of the Oireachtas in making bookings and travel arrangements, and as Senator McDonald said, there are very complex travel arrangements.  It as Senator McDonald said, there are very complex travel arrangements.  It can often be very difficult to get from a part of Ireland to either Luxembourg or Strasbourg and it may be necessary to make arrangements there for a different route home if it is necessary to come home earlier or later, depending on the business.  It is a little precipitous that this facility should be withdrawn without any alternative scheme.</P>
    <P>It is right that any provision for this kind of support and arrangements for the newly elected members of the European Parliament should ultimately be provided out of the resources and the staffing of the European Parliament and <Col N="584" /> the European Parliament office here in Dublin, but until such an arrangement is made there is a very strong need not only to continue the existing facility but to ensure that members of the newly elected European Parliament are facilitated in every way in the interests of this country, with every help and support in the sometimes very arduous, difficult and time consuming travel arrangement they have to make.  I hope that the recommendation of the Joint Committee, that the facility be continued until replaced by some alternative system, will be accepted and that the arrangement will continue.  It will also be necessary to have very substantial briefings of members and research facilities for members of the European Parliament. Will the Minister of State make any comment on whether or not the Government have considered the question of providing separate research facilities for members of the European Parliament?  It may be that the European Parliament will ultimately make allocations for research, but this certainly is not there at the moment.  Any research carried out by the central staff in Luxembourg&mdash;and valuable research is carried out by the staff there&mdash;would be valuable as far as the European dimension is concerned, in collating material from different countries and in giving members up-to-date material on European problems, but it is not possible from Luxembourg to carry out the kind of detailed research and back-up at the Irish level, at the level of the four regional constituencies.  It is important to ensure that there are independent research and back-up facilities for members of the European Parliament in each of the regional constituencies, so that they can come to terms with the size and shape of their constituency, and can have this assistance, briefing and indepth research which will be necessary if they are to make substantial representations on behalf of these regional constituencies, not only in the European Parliament but in their political groupings. Senator McDonald would perhaps bear witness to this more than I can.</P>
    <P>It was quite frightening at times to see the level of briefing available to former delegates of the European Parliament <Col N="585" /> from other countries.  They came in grasping in-depth files which contained broken down figures and which put the national position in a very prominent way.  This kind of research and documentation will be all the more necessary to the new members of the European Parliament because they have a definite constituency in which to work, and a very grave responsibility to represent the people of their areas in the European Parliament.  They also have a responsibility to lobby in the general European decision making process, and to lobby the Commission and Council in Brussels.  It is important that the Government take this responsibility very seriously and ensure that this kind of facility is available.</P>
    <P>I would hope that the provision in section 3 about the possibility of the payment of allowances might be extended. Perhaps this could be done by an amendment if it is not already within the scope of the Bill, so that there might be the establishment of a research facility in each of the regional constituencies for the benefit of the members of the European Parliament who represent those constituencies.  They should have a resource to draw upon, from Ireland, a resource specifically provided here in recognition of the need for very well equipped and well briefed members of the European Parliament to represent our interests at the European level.</P>
    <P>My approach to this Bill is a very critical one.  It was a mistake on the part of the Irish Government to bow to pressure from Britain for British electoral reasons.  We should have stood firm for the need for members of the European Parliament to be paid a salary commensurate with the responsibility and work which they would do determined at the European level.  That would be in the interests of democracy.  It would ensure that we value our elected representatives and that we equip them to carry out the very responsible task for which the people elected them.  On that very critical note and with the intention of submitting amendments I await the Minister's reply to the debate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AndyOBrien" hpid="Mr. O'Brien Mr. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with those who say it was wrong of the Government <Col N="586" /> to agree to a system of remuneration for the members of the European Parliament which could result and is resulting in members of the same Parliament being paid different salaries.  That was a mistake, and I agree with Senator Robinson about that.  Those who spoke before me have made the case very well and I do not intend to detain the House very long.  Because we have only 15 people in the Parliament it is of the utmost importance that these representatives should have a highly efficient back-up service so as to be able to get our point of view across.</P>
      <P>I should like also to draw attention to the size of the constituencies that these members represent.  Take our constituency of three Ulster and five Connacht counties and take into account that the three members representing us will in the course of their duties travel widely over that huge constituency to ascertain the views of people on different problems.  I ask how could we expect that to be done on a meagre salary?</P>
      <P>In general the best thing to do is to ensure that these people are adequately remunerated, that the back-up service is highly efficient, and it should go without saying that it is ridiculous to visualise a parliament of 410 members all doing the same work at different rates of pay.  It is so ridiculous that it should never have been mooted.  I suggest that the Government immediately set about having that ridiculous situation rectified.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Public Service (Mr. MacSharry)</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to thank the Senators for their contributions. While many of them made similar points I will endeavour to go through the points that were raised. Senator Reynolds and Senator Robinson were critical of the legislation and of the necessity for it.  That brings me to the second point that was raised by some of the speakers&mdash;the decision that was taken at Bremen.  While press speculation suggested at the time that there was British pressure to have such a decision taken the facts are that the nine Heads of State agreed at that Council meeting in Bremen that they themselves in their own countries would decide on remuneration for members of the European <Col N="587" /> Parliament.  Regardless of who initiated it or what pressures were there, the fact is that the nine Heads of State agreed to it.  Last week the nine Heads of State met again and there was no change in that decision notwithstanding the fact that the British Government, which is the one that was mentioned, has changed since and that though there are different people there now, there has not been any question of changing the decision taken last December at the Heads of State Council in Bremen.</P>
      <P>What we are doing is similar to what is being done in the other nine countries. We must deal with the situation that we find ourselves in at present.  In the absence of any decision that might subsequently be taken in the future by the Parliament or by the Council or both, the position is that unless this legislation is passed not only here but in other countries there will be no provision for payment of any allowance or salary whatsoever to the members of the European Parliament.</P>
      <P>Much discussion has taken place on the question of different salaries in different countries.  I think all of us will appreciate that one of the reasons for making this decision by the Heads of State at Bremen was that in their opinion, the salaries should reflect the different standards of living that obtain in each of the nine countries.  This is one of the main reasons for the different level of salary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>Not necessarily.  We would hope the standard of living would be the same all over and at the highest level but that is not the situation as everybody is well aware.  The salaries are reflecting the standards of living in each of the nine countries.  The question was raised about the salaries for European members.  It is the same for all the Irish representatives in the European Parliament.  The figure at present is £6,911.  They are all entitled to that salary regardless of what other incomes they might have as Members of this House, Members of the Dáil or in any <Col N="588" /> other capacity in the private sector. Senator McDonald raised the question of the necessity for the legislation. Senator McDonald, Senator Robinson and Senator O'Brien raised also the question of the facilities provided by the Dáil staff in relation to the nominated members from the Houses of the Oireachtas for the last number of years. They were our nominees and therefore the Houses of the Oireachtas provided whatever facilities they could.  Now the situation is that they are directly-elected members of the European Parliament and it is the duty and the obligation of the European Assembly to provide the necessary facilities, let they be here nationally or in Europe itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>The new situation is that there are now 15 representatives and such facilities as back-up service, briefing and so on are the responsibility of the European Parliament.  I do not think we would see this House being used in the way of providing facilities other than for Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas but if there is to be a change it would be a matter for the various agencies within the Houses of the Oireachtas to decide on the situation then.</P>
      <P>Senator McDonald made the point that section 2 is not clear.  He did admit that he was not in for my speech at the outset of the debate.  I said then that it is not necessary to provide specifically in the legislation for the allowances and salary in respect of either a Deputy or a Senator.  We are dealing here solely with the provision of an allowance or salary for members of the European Parliament.  The other question has already been dealt with in other legislation.  It was not therefore found necessary to mention the question of the dual salary or to have it included in this legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of section 5 <i>vis-à-vis</i> the disqualification&mdash;a point raised by Senator MacDonald&mdash;I welcome the contribution in that regard made by Senator Robinson.  I agree fully with <Col N="589" /> what she has said.  For this time, the date of election is the date of disqualification. In future it will be the date of nomination. It was not possible this time because the legislation was not ready. As Senators are aware, nominations closed even before the legislation was circulated to Deputies and Senators. What is being done in the legislation is similar to what applies to Deputies and Senators.  This time it had to be from the date of election but in future it will be similar to the situation <i>vis-à-vis</i> Deputies and Senators on State Boards, from the date of nomination.</P>
    <P>Senator Robinson asked about the legislation in the other countries.  We do not have the full and up-to-date position, but the question of temporary legislation was mentioned.  I can give Senators the information I have.  In Italy no decision has been taken yet but the information I have is that they were discussing it on 20 June.  We do not have the information for Belgium.  In Germany the law has been passed.  I do not have the information about it being temporary legislation or otherwise, but that was mentioned in the Dáil yesterday.  I do not know whether that is true.  In Denmark the Bill is under discussion.  In France it is on its way to the Senate.  In Britain the Second Stage is being concluded.  For Luxembourg we do not have the up-to-date information and in Holland the regulations are being presented to parliament soon. We know what is the situation in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Senator Robinson talked about the possibility of an amendment on Committee Stage but I would suggest that it is not necessary to have temporary type legislation or a date for amending or repealing the legislation.  If the situation as we know it changes in the future, as Senators are well aware, this legislation or any other legislation can be amended or repealed if it is so warranted.  I would respectfully suggest that that is the position and has been the position in relation to much of the legislation passed in the various parliaments in Europe.</P>
    <P>We are satisfied from the legal advice we have got from the Attorney General and the parliamentary draftsmen that the legislation is legally in order, and I have no reason to doubt it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="590" /> Senator Robinson asked me to explain the position regarding section 3. Members of the European Parliament have, in the past, received allowances in respect of travel, subsistence and secretarial expenses.  It is understood that these payments will continue to be determined by the Assembly and met from the Assembly budget.  It is not envisaged, accordingly, that any expense would fall to be met from voted moneys. It is considered desirable, however, to have a provision in the legislation enabling payment of expenses to be made from voted moneys if the necessity should arise in the future, for example, if the expenses should cease to be borne out of Assembly funds.  Section 3 is an enabling section to allow us do this if the occasion arises.  It is a practicable arrangement that is necessary in this legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>It is an enabling section to do anything in relation to travel, subsistence and so on.</P>
      <P>Section 4 deals with the pension scheme.  This is also an enabling section which enables us to set up a pension scheme similar to what exists for Deputies and Senators at present, that is, a contributory pension scheme.  Senator Robinson, and rightly so, raised questions relating to the existing scheme. This is an enabling section to allow for the setting up of a scheme but any revision of the existing scheme will be incorporated in the new scheme for members of the European Parliament.</P>
      <P>I do not think there is any other point which was raised that I did not reply to. We can only deal with the situation that we find ourselves in.  It was mentioned here about sending second-class citizens to Europe.  I do not think any of the members who were elected are second-class citizens.  They have all come through a rough ordeal.</P>

For the last six years we have had representatives there who had to exist&mdash;if that is the word&mdash;out of the allowances from the European Assembly which are very generous.  I am sure there are some Senators here who would be aware of this.  Now they will have a salary in addition to this allowance.  I recommend this Bill to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you.  The reason why this notice has been put down, in the first place, is the remarkable concern that is being felt all over Ireland, and particularly in the West, in relation to the acquisition programme of the Land Commission, or it is as well for me to be very blunt about it, their lack of a land acquisition programme.  To my knowledge, particularly in the last six or seven weeks, you might as well say that the Land Commission have got themselves completely out of land acquisition, by virtue of the fact that the section 40 orders, which I will come to in a moment, are not being served as heretofore on the sellers of land.  However, when I say that this part of the Land Commission's activities has come to a halt, I would point out, at this stage, that one would have to accept that land distribution, as opposed to acquisition, at the moment, is quite all right; I have no grievance there.</P>
      <P>There is, certainly from my point of view, a remarkable change in policy as far as land acquisition is concerned.  Is the Minister aware that the entire acquisition programme is halted?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="593" /> To eliminate and alleviate all the tensions of small farmers, would the Minister tell the country what his proposals are, until such time as the new Land Act is implemented in both Houses of the Oireachtas?  Is the Minister aware that all types of people are purchasing land the handy way, at the moment?  Is he aware that land speculators of one type of another, professional persons of one type or another, beef farmers of one type or another, and, indeed, anybody who has an easier way of earning money than small farmers, are, at this moment, grabbing the land of Ireland?  It is as well to point out, for people who might not have an interest in this particular aspect of the Land Commission's activity, that the normal procedure is that, when an estate is offered for public auction, subject to the normal pressures being applied by the local congests, a report is compiled by the local office of the Land Commission, forwarded to the acquisition section in Dublin, who in turn, after due deliberation on the subject, will or will not serve what we call a section 40 order.  Basically, without getting into the legalities of it, what that means is that whoever purchases that estate has to be vetted by the Land Commission before he or she is entitled to become the registered owner.  The present position is that there is tremendous pressure, particularly in the west, on behalf of small-holders, to get the Land Commission to serve the section 40 orders on the people who are selling their holdings, with a view to ensuring that, at least, outsiders will not be in a position to bid for the land.</P>
    <P>There is no way we can stop bidding at a public auction, but we have now reached a situation where people with money to spend, and believe that land is a good investment, now know that the Land Commission is ineffective, that they can get away with it and can become the registered owners, thereby doing two terrible things at the one time. The first, most unsocial thing, is depriving people in the local area of making a living.  The second, by virtue of the fact that they have an easier way of getting money, is making the land dearer. Without overrating the situation, there are certain sections of the community, <Col N="594" /> the small farming community in the west, that are near revolt.  I am talking about eligible small farmers; I am not talking about bachelors or people who are not able to use the land they have; I am talking about people who are married, who have children, who are working well the land they have, who have no other training but for agriculture and no way of getting a job anywhere else. Those are the people who are in competition with persons who have a better and easier way of making money&mdash;perhaps not easier, but they have a handier way of making much more money.</P>
    <P>A situation has now developed where farmers are only wasting their time calling to any of the area offices of the Land Commission across the country and there is not much point in taking the case to the Land Commission in Dublin. For that reason I am extemely thankful to all concerned for being allowed to raise the issue this evening.  The only person who has absolute authority, through the Government, is the Minister for Agriculture.  He himself is not here this evening but is ably represented by the Minister of State, a neighbour of mine, who, I am quite sure, understands the position quite well.  Unless there is some tightening up done now, there will be damage done that will never be undone.</P>
    <P>The Minister is likely to say that we are awaiting the new Land Bill.  As far as I and thousands of small farmers in Ireland are concerned that answer will not do.  It is likely to be the end of 1979, or maybe 1980, before the Land Bill gets to the Dáil.  By that time, thousands of acres will have changed hands.  I appeal to the Government to be honest and to tell those small farmers exactly where they stand.  The Land Commission may not be able to acquire land because of lack of money in the Exchequer. It would not be the first time that the Land Commission has suffered from lack of money; in my opinion down through the years it was always the sick baby.  Land Commissions, in my opinion, never got enough money from any Government, which was one of the reasons for all the problems and the tremendous <Col N="595" /> amount of criticism that has been levelled at them.  It is fair to say that had they got a sufficient budget down the years they would have done remarkably better.</P>
    <P>I want the Minister to speak directly to the small farmers and say &ldquo;As far as the sales in your area are concerned, until the Land Act comes in, we will not intervene.&rdquo; On one hand, that would be bad news, but a lot of farmers who might be able to borrow the money might be able to buy the land themselves.  My suggestion, at this stage, would be that the powers vested in the Land Commission through the Land Acts be maintained and that a section 40 order be served for every sale that is brought to the notice of the acquisition section in Dublin.  The postal strike may be the reason given for the fact that the section 40 orders have not been served. That is not necessarily correct; there are area offices all around the country and it is quite possible to serve these orders.  I understand the problems concerned; sometimes the sellers are outside the country but, by and large, if the commitment was there the section 40 orders could be served.</P>
    <P>Once the area officers decide to recommend that a section 40 order be served, that section 40 order should be served.  Once this became known it would automatically mean that a lot of people who now believe that they can jump through the loophole because of a limbo situation in the market place would realise that they would have to go through the Land Commission machinery before they could be registered.  At the end of the day they might succeed but at least it will act as a brake.  From a social and economic point of view, this must be stopped, or it will create an unhappy social situation, particularly in the small farming areas, even in two short years.</P>
    <P>Land is extraordinarily dear; many people are selling land, for one reason or another.  If we get another seven or eight months of the type of activity that is now being created, we will be left in a position where irrespective of what the <Col N="596" /> Land Act has to say, the horse will certainly have left the stable.</P>
    <P>If nothing is done, the price of land will keep on increasing because of the unfair competition.  I understand that in the last week or fortnight there has been some clamp-down on loans by banks and lending agencies generally; nevertheless, while you have a man with the necessary money, who believes that there is a good future in land as a property no matter what the banks do, or the law, it will create an environment where those people will flourish.</P>
    <P>There are thousands of farmers most anxious to hear what the Minister intends to do in the interim period between now and the Land Bill.  I quite well understand that drafting the Land Bill is going to be a very prolonged business.  I do not have to tell the House that at the best of times, anything to do with land is a very tough, onerous and thankless job.  It is very hard to please everybody.  There are always congests who believe they are entitled to land and do not get it, and so on.</P>
    <P>What I am talking about now is an entirely different matter, more specific and, certainly, with a much shorter time schedule.  If the position is to continue as I have seen it for the past two or three months, we will wind up in a position where a lot of small farmers will be saying that there is no future for them.</P>
    <P>I take this opportunity of asking the Minister another important question, that is, the whole idea of the half-annuity system.  Do I take it, in fact, that that only extends up to the first £3,000 in value of land given to congests, or can we take it that, through the EEC, land acquired and given to small congests will qualify for a full 50 per cent right across the board?  There are other things that I would like to have said at this stage, but I would appeal to the Minister to give a very clear answer to my questions; all the small farmers of Ireland are waiting for the answers.  With that, I will ask Senator O'Brien to make his contribution.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AndyOBrien" hpid="Mr. O'Brien Mr. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to Senator Connaughton and to the House <Col N="597" /> for affording me the opportunity of saying a few words on this problem which, as Senator Connaughton has said, is causing very grave concern in many parts of the country.  I hope the Minister of State can say that it is wrong to believe that the present policy of the Land Commission is not to acquire any more land; that is firmly believed in various parts of the country.  It would remove a lot of concern if the Minister could say that that, in fact, is not the policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is widely believed in Cavan, Monaghan, Leitrim, Longford and counties in my area that it is the policy and that, in fact, no land has been acquired by the Land Commission in those areas in recent months.  I can give a few specific examples: In the parish of Lavey, quite convenient to me, a month or two ago a farm of 150 acres went on sale in the townlands of Feaugh, Lateever and Drumhilla.  That land was bought by a speculator who came in from another county and who owns upward of 200 acres of land on the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic.  The position is that that is a congested area, and this farm of 150 acres of land, if it had been acquired at market value from the owner, would have made viable five, six or seven uneconomic holdings in that area.  But it was not done and the opportunity has passed.  Now resentment is very high in the area because a similar thing happened maybe six or seven years ago, in the same area, but more convenient to the village of Stradone.  Now, this is a congested area of small farms between these large estates which are going on the market.  The small farmers know these estates are their only hope of acquiring enough land to have a viable holding.  Now these chances are slipping away and there is great resentment.  In the last month or so, the self same thing happened in the townland of Shannow, not far from the village of Ballinagh; here we have case after case, month after month, of land becoming available that should be acquired by the Land Commission and divided among local people who are working farms that are barely economic; who are in a position to develop whatever land they would get <Col N="598" /> and bring up their families in comfort and produce more wealth in the locality. We have come to the time when we will have to have a definite statement from the Minister, or somebody in authority, that the position whereby the Land Commission take no interest in these holdings with a view to making uneconomic holdings viable will not continue.</P>
    <P>In addition, there is grave discontent with the length of time it takes the Land Commission to divide the farms that they have already acquired, in some cases five, six, seven or eight years.  People cannot understand how it takes so long to do this; people who are hoping to get some of this land are not in a position to plan for the future and it is retarding development.  As Senator Connaughton has said, I hope that we will hear something today that will remove the concern from the minds of the people.</P>
    <P>The last point I want to make, with the limited time I have, is that, with the half annuity scheme that was operating in the western counties and was extended by Deputy Fitzpatrick when he was Minister for Land to cover Counties Cavan, Monaghan and Longford, these smallholders would have some hope of being able to acquire land by way of the Land Commission.  If the Land Commission is not acquiring land and these people have to go on the open market to compete against speculators, there is not the slightest hope of their ever being able to acquire as much as a single acre.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture (Mr. Hussey)</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, it is not true to say that the serving of the section 40 notices has been suspended. In fact, 307 holdings, comprising 7,301 hectares, were the subject of section 40 notices in the year ending 31 March 1979.  Included were 59 holdings, comprising 1,061 hectares, in County Galway.  Section 40 notices were normally issued by registered post, so that recent postal difficulties caused disruption. As the Minister has stated on more than one occasion in Dáil Éireann proposals on future land policy will be coming before the Oireachtas in due course.  In the meantime, the curren <Col N="599" /> policies of the Land Commission will continue to operate, but priority must be given to the allotment of 28,000 hectares of letable lands already in the possession of the Land Commission, and to finalising the substantial area of land already in the pipeline of acquisition&mdash;20,400 hectares.  This means that, for the moment at least, the initiation of acquisition proceedings can only be contemplated in exceptional circumstances.  In assessing such circumstances, there would normally be strict interpretation of current policy requirements, that is the one mile distance and standard holdings of 40 to 45 adjusted acres.  Each case would have to be judged on its merits, but obviously there would have to be a clear and definite need for extra land by full-time progressive farmers already using their existing lands to maximum capacity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The authority of the Minister to issue or not issue a notice under section 40 of the Land Act, 1923, is set out in section 27 of the Land Act, 1965.  I would like to say that the issuing of those section 40 notices does not necessarily mean that the Land Commission will automatically acquire that land, and in many cases I would say that only a very small proportion of the farms on which those section 40 notices have been served have been acquired.  I have said on many occasions, and I am sure that Senator Connaughton and Senator O'Brien would <Col N="600" /> agree, that the best way that we can help the small farmers with whom we are all so concerned is to get rid of the land pool that the Land Commission have on hands.  I have in my opening statement given the acreage they have on hands.  It is important that the Land Commission should be encouraged to divide that land as soon as possible and they can best help the small farmers by doing so.  Very often the Land Commission cannot possibly compete on the open market with people who are buying land.  Indeed, it is not always the case that speculators buy those farms.  Very often the people who go out to buy the farms are farmers themselves who are adjoining those lands, who want them for additions to their holdings and so on; I do not think anybody could complain about that procedure.  It is important that farmers, by way of loans or whatever facilities can be made available to them, should be encouraged to purchase farms where they can do so, and so help to enlarge their own holdings.</P>
    <P>As regards the annuities, which Senator Connaughton also mentioned, the position here is that half the annuities are charged up to £3,000 of the purchase price and this is fixed by statute, so there is nothing that I or anybody else can do to change it.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 6.30 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 3 July 1979.</P>
