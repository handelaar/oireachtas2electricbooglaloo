      <P>Amendment No. 1 is the first of a series of Government amendments changing the description &ldquo;tenement factory&rdquo; to &ldquo;multiple factory&rdquo;.  They meet a series of similar amendments by Senator Hawkins.  This amendment, with its consequential amendments Nos. 3, 8, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 39, meets 4, 9, 38 and 40, and it is suggested that the grouping for the debate be in this form: 1, 3, 4, 8, 9, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39 and 40.  The decision on amendment No. 1 should cover all these amendments.</P>
      <P>Government amendment No. 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (1), page 7, to insert the following definition before the definition of &ldquo;owner&rdquo;:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;&lsquo;multiple factory&rsquo; means any premises where mechanical power <Col N="1396" /> from any prime mover within the close or curtilage of the premises is distributed for use in manufacturing processes to different parts of the same premises occupied by different persons in such manner that those parts constitute in law separate factories;&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Norton) William Norton">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Norton)</NameTxt>
      <P>There was a view expressed in the Dáil that it was desirable to change the definition of &ldquo;tenement factory&rdquo; to &ldquo;multiple factory&rdquo;.  The position is that &ldquo;tenement factory&rdquo; has a particular connotation in our factory legislation over the past 50 years, and probably a certain amount of case law has been built up around that definition.  No one liked the idea of a tenement factory, inasmuch as it was inclined to be associated in the public mind with some kind of undesirable tenement. houses.  We were, therefore, in general agreement that we should endeavour to apply this description in order to meet this view.  This amendment is submitted as I suggested in the Dáil and in the Seanad on the last occasion to substitute the description &ldquo;multiple factory&rdquo; for the description &ldquo;tenement factory&rdquo;.  That gives effect to the view expressed in the Dáil and in the Seanad.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (1), page 7, to insert the following definition before the definition of &ldquo;owner&rdquo;:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;&lsquo;occupier means the employer of the persons engaged in the work carried on in the premises in respect of which the word is used.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would suggest that this amendment should be accepted.  I do not know whether my wording is best but it would seem to me that it would meet <Col N="1397" /> the case.  I know that in previous Acts there was no such definition, and I do not know whether it is desirable or not to insert it in this Bill.  Looking at it solely from the legal point of view, it does seem to me to be desirable, and that the term &ldquo;occupier&rdquo; should be clarified.  I would suggest that it be considered by the Seanad.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The word &ldquo;occupier&rdquo; has never been statutorily defined. Even the British, in their 1937 and 1948 Acts, did not attempt to describe or define who the occupier was.  There have been a number of court decisions determining who was the occupier, and that being so, it is better to leave the description in the Bill as &ldquo;the occupier&rdquo;.  If we were to attempt to define it in this Bill in some other way, we would run the risk of upsetting the already accepted definition of &ldquo;occupier&rdquo;.  The courts have interpreted &ldquo;occupier&rdquo; as meaning the person who runs a factory, who regulates and controls the work in the factory, and who is responsible for the fulfilment of the provisions of the Factories Acts within the factory.  That seems to meet the point which Senator Cox has in mind.  We think, in all the circumstances, it is probably better to leave the matter as it stands.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 3 is consequential on amendment No. 1.</P>
      <P>Government amendment No. 3:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (1), to delete the definition of &ldquo;tenement factory&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>In sub-section (2), page 8, lines 37 and 39, to delete &ldquo;passing or&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is again merely a drafting amendment. It does seem to me that there <Col N="1398" /> are two dates mentioned-the passing of the Act and the commencement of the Act-which may give rise to confusion and difficulty.  The sub-section ends with the phrase &ldquo;as the case may be&rdquo; but that, I think, deals with &ldquo;as the case may be&rdquo; as between, on the one hand, the passing or commencement of the Act, and, on the other hand the making of the regulations. Again, I merely draw attention to a possible ambiguity.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Cox seeks to delete the words &ldquo;&lsquo;passing or&rdquo;, leaving the section to deal with things to happen after the commencement of the Act.  There are two contingencies provided for in the Bill and you have to take the Bill as a whole.  Some things happen after the passing of the Act and some things happen, which are related to the commencement of the Act.  In Section 11, the phrase &ldquo;commencement of the Act&rdquo; is used, but you will find that Sections 33 and 45 relate to certain things which happen on the passing of the Act and it is therefore necessary to keep these two phrases &ldquo;passing&rdquo; and &ldquo;commencement&rdquo; because some things come into operation on passing and some on commencement, and this section therefore merely dovetails into Sections 33 and 45 where &ldquo;passing&rdquo; is an operation which has to be fitted in with this section.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 6:</P>
      <P>In sub-section (1), paragraph (b), before &ldquo;altering&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;packing,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The first word in this paragraph is &ldquo;altering&rdquo; and I think it is not quite clear whether that means packing or not.  I thought I had better draw attention to it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I looked into this amendment when I received it from Senator Cox and I am advised that, if it were accepted, it would mean that a retail grocer packing tea, on the counter might be held to be operating a factory.  In any event, no amendment of the definition appears to be necessary to take care of the work of packing articles when done under factory conditions.  If the Senator will look at paragraph (3), lines 28 and 29 on page 9, he will see that &ldquo;any premises in which the business ... of packing articles is carried on as a separate business, or incidentally for the purposes of any factory&rdquo; is deemed to be a factory, but the Senator's amendment would catch a grocer packing tea on his counter or any other commodity.</P>

      <P>In sub-section (1), paragraph (vii), line 50, to add &ldquo;but shall not include premises used solely or primarily for office purposes&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>There may possibly, be a point here. The paragraph refers to any operation in the nature of printing, but in nearly every office or in a great many offices nowadays&mdash;even lawyers' offices &mdash;operations such as photostating and so on are carried on, and whether there should be a distinction made to exclude that kind of reproduction or not, I do not know, but I thought I should draw attention to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am advised that this amendment is not necessary to ensure that the Bill does not apply to office premises where perhaps some reproduction of documents work is carried on as part of the office work.  I think this paragraph has to be read with the whole of Section 3 and in relation to the stipulation that the work must be carried on by way of trade.  I am advised that the section as it stands cannot be held to apply to the kind of reproduction work which takes place in offices.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked the Minister, on Second Reading, whether he would consider the possibility of adding a sentence to that clause giving him power to exempt bleach houses and dye houses from its provisions, and I asked whether he had power under any other section of the Bill to provide exemption in cases of houses where they could not completely comply with the provisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I think you have to look at Sections 15 and 16 together. If it is a floor which is not capable of being drained, there is nothing we can do about it, but Section 16 sets out:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Where any process is carried on which renders the floor liable to cause persons employed to slip, effective means shall be provided and maintained for protecting the persons employed from slipping.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In other words, if the floor is wet, well and good&mdash;you are obliged to take steps to drain it off, if it is possible. If the operation is a continuous one as a result of which the floor is wet all the time, you cannot prevent it being wet, because wetting the floor is incidental to the operation.  In a case like that, you have to pass on to Section 16, which says that, because it is slippy, there is an obligation to protect a person from slipping on the incurably wet floor and it is left to <Col N="1401" /> somebody to devise means of meeting the liability in respect of slipping on a permanently wet floor.  I do not think we can do much more about it, but if the Senator has any suggestion as to what could be done in the very difficult circumstances, I shall be very willing to consider any such suggestion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot really make any suggestion.  I only wanted to be quite certain that the Minister would have powers in the Bill if there was a case, as in a dye house where you often have a very wet floor which can be drained but which often remains damp and clammy.  Most dye houses provide their employees with clogs to get over the possibility of endangering their health.  I only wanted to be certain that the Minister has power to exempt factories or places of that kind from the provisions of the Bill in such circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Senator's point is covered by Section 15.  If you cannot drain the floor there is nothing more you can do except to employ all your talents to see what can be done to prevent slipping.  I think a combination of Sections 15 and 16 covers what the Senator has in mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>

      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P>Sections 16 to 18, inclusive, agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">SECTION 19.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ArthurCox" hpid="Mr. Cox Mr. Cox">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 10:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (2), paragraph (c), page 15, line 50, to add &ldquo;and have not been incurred in or about any unsuccessful legal proceedings&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>There is one exception at the end of Section 18 which provides for the payment of costs in an unsuccessful proceedings. Section 19 seems to be of a similar nature but that exception is not made and I suggest that it is right that that exception should be made in Section 19.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a matter on which I have no very fixed views.  The <Col N="1402" /> general idea in Section 19 is that where a sanitary authority will not do what is expected of it under the Bill the Minister may move in in order to ensure that the property owner complies with the regulations.  It may happen that the Minister, having instituted proceedings, which the sanitary authority ought to have carried out and did not carry out, will be unsuccessful in the courts.  The section is merely ensuring that if the sanitary authority does not do its duty under the Act it should be compelled to pay the coats if the Department has to move in.  If the general opinion is that the Department should underwrite the costs I am prepared to move an amendment to that effect on the Report Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>As Sections 18 and 19 are correlated as to the responsibility of the sanitary authorities I take this opportunity to say that I would consider that the period of one month from the date of the notification of the active default after which the Minister takes power to compel them to do the work is rather short.  The work may be of a very involved nature such as the construction of a new sewer and such work could not possibly be done inside one month.  The Minister would have to take power to take into consideration the work involved and the length of time it might take to have it completed.  It may be that the local authority proposes, in order to comply with the requests made by the inspector, to do some work which would take a considerable length of time so that even with the full cooperation of the local authority or sanitary authority it could not be completed within the month given in this section.  I would like the Minister to look into the period of one month allowed and see if more time could be given to the local authority and the Department in order to make for the good working of the Bill rather than that the Minister should take action within a month.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Senator is slightly misunderstanding the question. Originally, it was not intended to give any notice to the sanitary authority of the inspector's intention to move and the month was put in by the special committee when the matter was before the Dáil.  This is to meet a case where the sanitary authority will not do the work and the Minister gives a month's notice of his intention to move in the matter.  In effect, it means that if the sanitary authority does not move to have the work done within a month the inspector will move in.  The intention is to give the sanitary authority a month to reflect on the wisdom of deciding not to do what it should do.</P>

      <P>I would like to point out to Senator Cox and to the House at this stage that amendment No. 11 is the first of a series of amendments inserting the word &ldquo;reasonably&rdquo; before the word &ldquo;practicable&rdquo;.  These amendments are Nos. 11, 12, 14, 15, 16, 17, and 18.  They are all cognate, and if it is agreed they could be debated together and a separate decision taken on each if necessary.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 11:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (1), page 18, line 45, before &ldquo;practicable&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;reasonably&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The word &ldquo;reasonably&rdquo; is used consistently throughout the Bill and is very properly used, but in this section the word &ldquo;reasonably&rdquo; has been left out which would rather seem to impose an absolute duty.  I thought the point should be raised so that it could be inquired into.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>In this amendment and in six others Senator Cox is anxious that the word &ldquo;reasonably&rdquo; should be inserted before the word &ldquo;practicable&rdquo; so that the words &ldquo;reasonably practicable&rdquo; would operate.  The expression &ldquo;reasonably practicable&rdquo; is used elsewhere in the Bill, for instance, in Section 54 in relation to the obligation <Col N="1404" /> on an employer to provide accommodation for clothing.  The courts are quite used to the interpretation of the word &ldquo;practicable&rdquo; and they are also familiar with the words &ldquo;reasonably practicable&rdquo;.  I feel that the insertion of the word &ldquo;reasonably&rdquo; before &ldquo;practicable&rdquo; in Section 29 would definitely tend to weaken the obligation which is imposed on the occupier of a factory of taking steps to ensure that factory workers do not fall into a container containing corrosive oil or scalding water.</P>
      <P>I think that where we are providing against that contingency we cannot soften or weaken the Bill.  It is because of the fact that it is not desired to soften or weaken the provisions of the Bill that the word &ldquo;reasonably&rdquo; is left out.  The test is the practicability of doing it.  The phrase &ldquo;reasonably practicable&rdquo; occurs in respect of Section 54, which section applies to the provision of accommodation for clothing and where there is no danger of a fatality if there is any slothfulness on the part of the occupier of a factory in providing the necessary accommodation. Anything that softens or weakens this particular section will tend to do so at the expense of the lives or the health of those who are affected by the section.</P>
      <P>I feel that any amendment which has the effect of weakening the section from the point of view of the obligation put on the occupier of a factory to provide substantial protection for his workers would be an unwise provision so far as the Legislature is concerned. Having given that explanation, I hope the Senator will see the section in a different light from that where you are dealing only with accommodation for clothing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 13:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In lines 8 and 12 to delete &ldquo;woman or young&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Section 31, as it stands, says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;A woman or young person shall not clean any part of a prime mover or of any transmission machinery while the prime mover or transmission machinery is in motion, and shall not clean any part of any machine if the cleaning thereof would expose the woman or young person to risk of injury from any moving part either of that machine or of any adjacent machinery.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>It is, of course quite natural to understand the purpose of the section which is to guard against accidents to women employees or young persons.  If we examine the accident figures in our factories we will find that in the majority of cases they are not due to either of the classes mentioned in this section.  The accidents occur because of familiarity with the particular machine resulting in a lack of attention to the particular work that has to be undertaken.  If the cleaning of a particular machine is of such a nature that we must provide in this Bill that women or young persons are not to be engaged thereon, then I think we should go much further and stipulate that no person should be asked to undergo risks by working in such circumstances.  We are providing that two types of people should not be employed on this particular work.  I think we should go a step further.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Maybe if the Minister feels that there is something in what Senator Hawkins says, he might provide for the contingency in the regulations. It might be undesirable to accept the Senator's amendment.  I am sure there is certain machinery that has to be cleaned and which has to work continuously.  It may not be practicable to stop such machinery.  I have seen people clean machinery in motion because it was much easier to do it that way.  I am sure that adequate <Col N="1406" /> protection could be assured to operatives by the intelligent use of regulations.  These regulations have always been applied in the past and I am sure the Minister will have them applied in the future.  It would be very hard to insert a definite provision in the section which might interfere with some industrial process or make it difficult to maintain some industrial machinery.</P>

      <P>In other words, it says that a woman or young person must not clean any part of a prime mover or transmission machinery at all under any circumstances. They are debarred from cleaning the prime mover or transmission machinery while it is in motion.  Apart from that, the section goes on to say:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;... and shall not clean any part of any machine if the cleaning thereof would expose the woman or young person to risk of injury from any moving part either of that machine or of any adjacent machinery.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This section, in fact, says: &ldquo;Take special care to put women and young persons in a special position.  They cannot touch this particular class of machinery at all.  That is prohibited absolutely.  They shall not touch any other part of the machine if there is any risk of injury.&rdquo;  They are put in a special category and this section legislates specially for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>You have another class of worker&mdash; the male worker who all his life has been a fitter or machine mechanic.  In his case, the situation is entirely different.  In the first place he is mechanically minded.  Secondly, his work may consist in taking these machines to pieces or assembling them. He has got to get them to move in order to do the requisite assembling or dismantling.  I do not think it unreasonable if he were to switch on the <Col N="1407" /> prime mover or the transmission machinery in order to get at an inaccessible part of the machinery.  He may have to do that in the course of assembly or dismantling operations on the machine.</P>
    <P>In any case there is another kind of contingency which has got to be provided for.  A person may, in regard to a processing machine, have to do some cleaning, not in the sense of polishing or oiling the machine but in the way of taking off some excess waste product processed in the machine.  If he merely scooped that away every time it passed him by it might well be held to be cleaning of the machine.  This matter was discussed in the Dáil and in the Special Committee.  These considerations were advanced and after full consideration of the matter it was generally felt that the security given is as good as you can make it unless you run the risk of saying: &ldquo;No person shall ever clean the machine if it involves cleaning it while the prime mover or the transmission machinery is in position&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Anybody who has experience of a factory knows that that may have the effect of stopping processing operations from time to time and even stopping them when there is no likelihood whatever of any injury being caused.  If you draw this section too tightly you may make it impossible to provide safeguards for the processing machine which must run continuously during processing.  It may stop at some vital part of the operation when the product might be destroyed and when it might become impossible to continue the process.</P>
    <P>I might mention that this section is not new.  It is merely a redrafting of a section which appeared in the 1901 Act.  It is, therefore, a very familiar section so far as our factory legislation is concerned.  If there was any possibility of making this tighter from the point of view of a woman or young person, I should be glad to look at it sympathetically, but I think that we have gone as far as it is possible in this matter.  That is especially so when one also looks at the provision in Section 32 with regard to the training and supervision of persons working at <Col N="1408" /> dangerous machines.  I think that the combination of both sections is the best provision that can be made in this matter.</P>

      <P>I am obviously at a great disadvantage in discussing this matter with so eminent a legal personality as Senator Cox.  I shall have to ask his indulgence in arguing some points against his amendment. In this amendment, Senator Cox seems to me to be departing from what are the established procedures.  I think it is an accepted rule of law that if there is an offence there must be a penalty, no matter how small, unless, of course, the Probation of Offenders Act is <Col N="1409" /> applied.  Senator Cox's amendment seems, however, to make proof of guilt dependent on the issue of negligence which in itself is a difficult thing to establish.  In this particular case, an offence can be committed by making a false report or a report which is deficient in a material particular.  That is the issue in the case before a court can impose a fine on a person, that he would have to be found guilty in a court of summary jurisdiction of that offence.  If the court finds a person guilty of an offence, the offence being the supplying of a false report or a report that was deficient in a material particular, then the court has the power to impose a fine.</P>
      <P>I think the Senator's amendment is travelling outside of that by bringing in something which is foreign to the section, namely, is there any question of negligence?  In this case the negligence issue is not raised at all.  In this section the question is, is it a fact that a person made a false report or a report which was deficient?  If so, then in a court of summary jurisdiction a persons convicted of that offence can be fined by the court.  The Senator's amendment brings in the question of negligence which is not raised by the section.  It is merely a matter of determining whether the report was false or was deficient.  If the court says it was not, then that is all right, but if the court decides that it was false or deficient, and if the person is convicted of that offence there is an obligation to impose a fine.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ArthurCox" hpid="Mr. Cox Mr. Cox">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know if that is a complete answer in this case.  The section says if a person fails to make a thorough examination or a report which is false or deficient in any material particular he shall be guilty of an offence.  My case is that a man could conscientiously make a careful examination and that the examination had failed to detect something.  It might happen that a conscientious engineer could make a careful examination. He might be quite satisfied that everything was perfectly in order and later an accident might happen. I think it is only fair that, in a case like that, the mere fact that he had <Col N="1410" /> failed to detect something should not in itself lead to his being automatically convicted with perhaps the result of serious injury being done to his career. I think that the court should have the opportunity of saying that it thought he had exercised reasonable and proper skill.  I do not intend to press the amendment, but I think the point is one that should be considered by the Minister.</P>

      <P>An offence is committed automatically if he fails to make a careful examination and if, as a result, something happens.  If a man makes a careful examination of a machine and reports that, in his opinion, it is in perfect working condition, and if a month later an accident occurs, he is caught automatically.  I think that in a case like that, an injustice might occur.</P>

      <P>Surely it is for the court to decide whether a thorough examination has been made or whether the report that has been made is deficient in a material particular.  It is a question of fact for the court to decide whether or not a person has made a thorough examination.  Surely, the court must decide that in the light of the person's qualifications.  For example, I could not make a thorough examination of a factory, but the person contemplated in the sub-section is a person presumably of special skill in making such examinations.  Presumably, the court would take into consideration whether his examination was thorough or not in relation to his established skill.  The same thing would apply to the words &ldquo;material particular&rdquo;.  Without professing to understand the meaning of the word &ldquo;negligence&rdquo; in law it seems to me that the court, having got all the particulars before it, would still be able to decide with the words in the section just as it would if the other words were added in.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 21:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before sub-section (2) to insert a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(2) In any premises which is used partly as a private dwelling, the owner thereof shall provide such reasonable safeguards in case of fire for the persons dwelling therein as may be prescribed by the Minister in regulations under this Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 45 makes it essential for the sanitary authority to issue a certificate that they are satisfied with the means of escape in the case of fire in relation to the factory building.  We had recent experience where this provision did not compel the sanitary authority to take into consideration where the factory might be part of a dwelling.  We had some rather tragic cases in recent <Col N="1412" /> years and it was to guard against those things that I put down the amendment. If the Minister suggests that his amendment meets the case, I am quite satisfied.  I think the Minister's case is in relation to the issue of the certificate by the inspector appointed under his Department, whereas by incorporating my new sub-section it would be made an obligation on the sanitary authority as it is in the first case.  It is not right that the sanitary authority should be called upon to issue a certificate in connection with the factory building itself and not have regard to the adjacent buildings or tenements in the same building.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>An amendment was moved in the Dáil to Section 45 to provide that in any premises used partly as a dwelling-house the owner shall provide such reasonable safeguards in the case of fire for the persons dwelling in the premises as may be prescribed by the Minister.  I did not accept that amendment, but in view of the discussion which took place and because I realised the issue was one of considerable importance, I undertook, to. examine the matter further.  I have made that examination in considerable detail.  There is clearly a problem to be faced, but my difficulty is that it is not one for settlement in this Factories Bill.</P>
      <P>The sole purpose of the Factories Bill is to protect the life and health of those who work in factories.  When this point was discussed with the parliamentary draftsman to see what further steps might be taken, he warned that I might be going outside the ambit of the Long Title of the Bill if I were to take powers to impose obligations in relation to parts of buildings which are not factories.  I am convinced from my examination that very little amendment, if any, of legislation is necessary.  Local authorities are charged by the Oireachtas with the duty of taking steps to prevent fire.  They have very wide powers under the Fire Brigades Act of 1940, powers which seem to me to be adequate for dealing with the point raised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have to remember that in relation to tenement houses there are other conditions besides the existence <Col N="1413" /> of a factory in the premises which give rise to added fire risk for occupants of the building.  I need only mention that in many of such buildings you will find a shop on the ground floor where packing and other inflammatory material is losely stored or scattered, giving an incentive to the promotion of fires.  The existence of a factory in the building is only one of the problems of fire hazard in a crowded dwelling-house of that kind.  I am anxious to be as helpful as I can in this matter and the best I can do is contained in the amendment which I have tabled here.</P>
    <P>Sub-section (18) of Section 45 lists the type of factory to which the provision of Section 45 will apply and the amendment which I have moved will ensure that Section 45 will apply to a factory in a dwelling-house no matter how small the factory may be.  It must be remembered also that Section 45 applies only in relation to persons employed in the factory.  By including this type of factory in sub-section (18), however, we will ensure that its existence is notified to the local authority for appropriate action.</P>
    <P>My Department has been in consultation with the Department of Local Government on this particular matter and that Department is now undertaking to send a special notification to local authorities about the particular attention to be paid to fire precautions which should be imposed on the owners of buildings of this tenement type in which a factory is situated.  I think we have covered this as comprehensively as possible without going outside the ambit of the Bill.</P>

If <Col N="1415" /> the court is not so satisfied, then there is no obligation on it to make an order.  That gives the court a discretion which, presumably, is behind the Senator's amendment.

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGuire</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of the definition of what is &ldquo;basement&rdquo; is very important.  Under the section, as it is at present defined, it would mean that certain bakery basements, bakehouses, which are not, in fact, basements, would be considered as basements; for instance, in the case of a building built on the side of a hill where there might be one side or more open to the landscape.  We could take the example of Cork where there is a bakery built on the side of a hill looking down over Patrick Street.  That might be desirable from the point of view of fresh air and hygiene, and it may be an ideal place to operate from a psychological point of view, also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Such a place, under the present <Col N="1418" /> definition, would be described as a &ldquo;basement&rdquo;, and would be prohibited from carrying on as a bakery.  When the sub-committee met, and this particular section was discussed, reference was made to Jacobs of Dublin, and Thompsons of Cork.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce, speaking at this committee, on Section 64, as reported in column 115 of the Report, said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;This matter, I think, was raised on the Second Reading of the Bill and has been the subject of representations. These representations have been made to the effect that the section, as drafted, would have the effect of closing down the main bakehouses of two large bakery premises, Jacobs, of Dublin, and Thompsons, of Cork.  Both these premises which have been inspected are regarded as suitable for use as bakehouses from the standpoint of construction, lights, heat, ventilation, but, by reason of the contour of the surrounding ground on some sides of the building, they might come within the definition of a basement bakehouse in sub-section (2).  A satisfactory amendment of the definition could not be devised which would exclude these premises but would ensure that genuinely underground premises of an unwholesome nature would still be included.</P>
    <P>I thought it best, therefore, to take power to exempt premises such as the kind I have in mind from the operation of Section 64 where I am satisfied that the bakehouse is completely satisfactory in every way. There is a safeguard that the certificate of exemption calls for renewal at intervals which may not exceed five years.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That means that such bakehouses would exist only on a temporary certificate, and I understand that there is a firm&mdash;one of those which have been mentioned&mdash;which has in fact got new premises in Cork which it intends to develop and extend.  It is obvious that they could not develop and extend premises and spend a lot of money, if it were only on a temporary certificate which might not be renewed after five <Col N="1419" /> years.  I have a suggested amendment which might be taken on Report Stage which succeeds, I hope, in providing the satisfactory definition which was not found by the Special Committee, and I beg leave to read it.  I propose to put in on Report Stage the following amendment:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In page 42, Section 65, between lines 4 and 5, to insert a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(4) Notwithstanding the limitation of period provided by the preceding sub-section, a certificate may be issued for a period in excess of five years if at least one side of such basement bakehouse is not below ground level.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>The original intention when the Bill was introduced was to ban basement bakehouses at the expiration of three years from the commencement of the Act.  In the light of representations that were made and discussions that took place at the meetings of the Special Committee appointed by the Dáil, there was a reprieve granted in respect of certain bakehouses&mdash;bakehouses in use on 7th July, 1954, and where there was suitable provision for the use of the premises as a bakehouse, even though it was underground in accordance with the terms of the Bill&mdash;so that, as compared with the provisions of the Bill when introduced, there has been a very substantial modification.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The names of two bakeries were mentioned in the course of the discussion at the Special Committee and during the debate here, and so long as these conditions were fulfilled in respect of these two bakehouses, I think that very probably&mdash;I do not want to commit myself definitely&mdash;there would not be great difficulty in continuing their exemption from the provisions of the section for a longer period than five years, but, of course, that is conditional on certain things happening. One of these firms, or both of them, might have a quite satisfactory premises now which could be used as a bakehouse, even thought they might be regarded as underground, for the purposes of the provisions of the Bill, <Col N="1420" /> but suppose they allowed the premises to deteriorate, took no steps to prevent the dampness creeping into the underground basement or allowed structural defects of one kind or another to continue without attention, nobody would suggest that they should get a certificate to continue to operate an underground bakehouse for all time.</P>
    <P>I think therefore we have to take a reasonable period over which to allow them to operate and, at the same time, provide for periodic review of the conditions of the bakehouse.  The Minister for Health who is concerned with the maintenance of and compliance with food hygiene regulations has an interest in this matter and consultation, as provided for in the amendment I have moved, will take place with the Minister to see whether the basement bakehouses referred to here are such as to enable compliance to be secured with the food hygiene regulations which that Minister may make.</P>
    <P>The Senator may take it from me that this provision will be administered sympathetically so long as the basement bakehouse is of a kind in which it is not undesirable to ask workers to bake bread but, generally speaking, the basement bakehouse, unless it is up to a high standard, is not something upon which we should put the legislative seal and I think it is only reasonable to require, where a bakehouse is a basement bakehouse, that the highest possible standards will operate to justify its being licensed for the purpose of baking bread.  That puts an obligation on the owners of these premises to ensure that they are kept in first-class condition, and, if they are kept in first-class condition, I should think that the general view of any Minister for industry and Commerce would be to treat them reasonably, so long as there is no injury to the workers health and they make an effort to comply with the requirements of the Bill.</P>

      <P>I am afraid I did not make myself clear to the Minister.  I quite agree that, when a bakehouse is a basement bakehouse, all the things the Minister has said are true and that it would be necessary to examine the situation every five years, but I am saying that premises are being defined <Col N="1421" /> under this section as basements which are not, in fact, basements at all. Suppose a house is on the side of a hill. One side may be looking out over Killiney Bay.  The whole front might be sheet glass&mdash;a beautiful place for a bakery.  Surely that is not a basement but it would be under the section, because it refers to the floor being more than three feet below the surface of the road adjoining.  That road could be at the back of the house, above it. I am saying that this definition covers premises which are not, in fact, basements at all and the drafting of my amendment does make the point clear.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 25:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (2), line 25, before &ldquo;and&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;and the maximum weights to which bags or other containers containing the products of factories may be filled.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I raised this matter on the Second Stage as I felt that something tangible <Col N="1422" /> should and can be done within the Bill to regulate the maximum weights that may be contained in sacks or other containers of that nature.  It is quite clear that this section, in its first sub-section, is of a very drastic nature.  It renders completely illegal the lifting of any weight that may injure a worker.</P>
    <P>Sub-section (2) provides that the Minister, after consultation with the Minister for Health, may make very specific regulations in regard to the weights that may be lifted and defines the weights that may be lifted by different types of persons&mdash;I presume that would have relation to young people and female workers.  I think it should not be impossible for the Minister to be empowered to make regulations governing the size of sacks or containers that may be used for containing the products of factories.  As the Bill is concerned mainly with workers in those factories, I think this amendment could be inserted and that the Bill would be improved by its insertion. If products are packed in sacks of 2 cwt., it is almost inevitable that workers will be called upon to lift them at some stage or other in the process of their removal from the place of manufacture.</P>
    <P>We all know that in mills or factories where sacks of materials or fertilisers are being filled the occasion will arise in which those sacks will have to be shifted by mechanical or manual labour.  If they are of a certain weight, there is certain to be a considerable danger of workers being called upon to shift unnecessary weights.</P>
    <P>There is another reason for this amendment inasmuch as if the Minister has not got the power to make those regulations governing the size of sacks there may be an economic consideration that may induce manufacturers to pack fertilisers in a large sack so as to save a certain amount of expense in the cost of the sack and in the labour involved in dealing with it.  In that event you may have a considerable number of manufacturers packing fertilisers in a 1-cwt. sack and still another larger number packing them in larger sacks to save time and <Col N="1423" /> expense.  In such a case I think it would be most desirable that power be given to the Minister to regulate the size of the sacks.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>When this matter was first discussed I had great sympathy with the suggestion now being made by Senator Cogan but I do not think it is something that we can incorporate in an Act of Parliament.  Take bacon, for instance&mdash;the weight of a side may vary from 1¾ cwt. to 2¾ cwt. and it would be most expensive to put these sides in cwt. wrappings.  It would be an impossible position.  The economic question is very important and it would be very expensive to pack fertilisers in cwt. sacks.  It would be more economic to put them in jute sacks.  I think that the demand by the consumer and the user and more efficient handling in the factory will lead to the use of the cwt. sack in the future.  I think we can very well leave this matter to the consumer and to the factories because these people will eventually come to the conclusion that it would be best to use the cwt. sack where it is more reasonable to do it.  It would be unreasonable to ask the Minister to incorporate this provision in an Act of Parliament.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that the object of this amendment is to protect beyond the factory, and beyond the protection accorded to factory workers, other workers against the use of excessive weights.  I have a lot of sympathy with the sentiment behind the amendment but I do not think that I can legislate in a Factory Bill for the weights to be carried by persons not employed in factories.  This Bill deals with factories and makes provision that a person shall not be employed in a factory to lift, carry or move any load so heavy as to be likely to cause injury to him.  How can you legislate in a Factories Bill of this kind for problems which arise outside the factory and which might originate on the farm and finish on the farm?  How can an amendment of the kind suggested by Senator Cogan come into legislation dealing with factories?  I <Col N="1424" /> want to put it to the Senator, while impressing upon him that I am in sympathy with the spirit of the amendment, that it might disorganise a whole industry whose machinery could be upset by forcing them to alter the size of the packets in which they market their produce.</P>
      <P>This Bill provides protection for factory workers against lifting, carrying or moving excessive weights but you may have a situation where a factory may move most of its goods by machinery.  The goods may be mechanically lifted from the factory on to a lorry and from the lorry on to a ship.  The suggestion here is that, not only must you protect the persons employed in the factory against moving or lifting or carrying excessive weights, but also anybody who handles the product between the factory and the ultimate place of delivery.  The amendment means that you must extend the protection which is being accorded to the factory worker to everybody who handles the product between the time of dispatch and delivery, despite the fact that in that time it might never have to be carried or moved by a human being.  You cannot give protection such as that in a Factories Bill and you must get another Bill if you want to give effect to a matter of that kind.  I am going as far as I can to ensure the necessary protection for factory workers but within the scope of a Factories Bill it is not possible to provide for all the contingencies which may arise outside the factory in connection with the handling of the product by human labour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to call the Minister's attention to sub-section (2) of this section.  It says that &ldquo;the Minister may after consultation with the Minister for Health, make regulations prescribing the maximum weight which may be lifted, carried or moved by persons employed in factories, and any such regulation may prescribe different weights in different circumstances and may relate either to persons generally or to any class of persons or to persons employed in any class or description of factory or in any process.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1425" /> It will, therefore, be seen that under this sub-section the Minister is given fairly wide powers in regard to the making of regulations.  I was rather puzzled for a while as to whether it might not be possible, even without any amendment, for the Minister, under this sub-section, to regulate the size of sacks or containers that might be used.  Obviously, those regulations must be of a very specific kind.  They are not the type of regulation, perhaps, that could be completely embodied in an Act.  It would be necessary for the Minister to specify the particular type of products that it was required to deal with.</P>
    <P>For example, he might say in the regulations that fertilisers might not be packed to a weight exceeding one cwt.  If he were dealing with such a commodity as maize he might decide that half a cwt. or less would be quite an adequate weight to pack in one sack.  In the same way, he might prescribe a different type of weight for cereals such as grain or flour.</P>
    <P>All these are dealt with in factories and it is not true to say that this amendment seeks only to protect workers outside the factory.  It also seeks to protect workers within the the factory.  Therefore, it comes within the scope of this Bill.  Even though in normal circumstances it might be possible to convey sacks of fertilisers to the place of loading there are certain other arrangements which would require these sacks to be handled by the workers in the factory. Accordingly, the amendment will not only protect workers outside the factory but also those inside the factory.  Therefore, it is in compliance with the Long Title of the Bill.</P>
    <P>With regard to the points raised by Senator Burke, a side of bacon or two sides of bacon would be of a certain fixed weight.  I do not suggest that the Minister should include such commodities in the regulations.  If there are definite reasons why they should not be included, then there is no reason why they should not be excluded. When you are dealing with commodities such as cereals, feeding stuffs, fertilisers and commodities of that kind which are manufactured on <Col N="1426" /> a very large scale and which are standard to a certain extent, there should be no difficulty whatever in making a regulation governing the size of a sack in which they may be bagged. I cannot agree with the Minister's objection to this amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Cox stated that Section 67 applied to any person. I wonder would he have a look at Section 117, which says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Save as in this Act otherwise expressly provided, this Act shall apply only to factories, as defined by this Act, but shall, except where the contrary intention appears, apply to all such factories.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no want of sympathy on my part in regard to this amendment but I cannot see how I can make it effective. In so far as a man who works in a factory is expected to handle, move or lift goods, I can make regulations which will ensure that the man employed in the factory and with whom this Bill deals will not be required to move, handle or carry any excessive weight, but if a factory decides to fill a bag to twice what might be the normal weight and if no man is going to handle that bag and it is going to be mechanically filled, mechanically loaded on to a lorry and mechanically driven from the factory <Col N="1427" /> to a ship, where is the reason, for the purpose of a Factories Bill, in saying you should prescribe the weight of a bag or a container?  This thing spins on two issues.</P>
    <P>So far as human labour is involved, we will take power to make sure that the burden on the human being will not be excessive but what Senator Cogan wants me to do is to ensure, whether the article is handled by a human being or not, you must prescribe what weight will go into the bag or container even though it is not handled by human labour.  There may be a case for doing that but a Factories Bill does not seem to me to be the place for doing it.  An ingenious Senator suggested on the Second Stage that we might very well commune to see in what way we could introduce a Bill which would deal with this whole problem of carrying weights not merely so far as the man in the factory is concerned&mdash;he will be protected under this Bill&mdash;but also the person who has no intention of working in a factory or working on a farm.</P>
    <P>What Senator Cogan is trying to do is to fit into a Factories Bill and the narrow compass of a Factories Bill a provision which has much wider ramifications. Take the case of a foundry which does castings.  Suppose it has a big casting.  The casting is in one piece and it cannot be broken up.  That casting may have to be put in a container. It will be lifted mechanically and it will probably be delivered mechanically.  How can I make regulations prescribing the weight to be put into that container?  The whole casting has got to go in and there is no question of breaking it up.  There is an example of a case where nobody is burdened with the human toil of moving it.</P>
    <P>You might encounter cases where goods are lifted by mechanical means into a crate.  The crate may be packed mechanically.  The human operation involved consists merely of wiring the crate together.  All the operations may be done mechanically.  Why should it be prescribed what quantity or weight of goods should go into that particular crate when it does not matter?  The <Col N="1428" /> machine is going to lift the crate.  The crate is going to be lowered and the goods will be taken out one by one at the other end.  Why should that be broken up into a whole lot of small crates, especially when there is provision to ensure that it will not be handled by human labour?  I would be in favour of the spirit of the Senator's amendment if he were ever in a Bill to introduce an amendment of this kind proposing this sort of protection, but I do not think that you can do that within a Factories Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate what the Minister has said that he would be prepared to support any specific legislation with an aim such as that set out in the amendment.  I feel, however, that he could, without any undue difficulty, accept this amendment and implement it in the regulations which he proposes to make.  It is a mere exaggeration to refer to foundry castings or other articles of that kind which are packed in crates.  One does not pack artificial fertilisers or grain, barley or wheat, or meal stuffs in crates.  Neither does one pack sugar in crates.  Senator Hickey referred to that.</P>
      <P>In the making of regulations under this amendment, it would be possible for the Minister to specify exactly the commodities to which he was referring in the regulations.  He could state whether they were grain, cereals, meal, flour or fertilisers.  The regulations could be made very specific.  The Minister says that the intention in the Bill is to make sure that workers within the factory are not called upon to lift excessive weights.  There are other ways in which we should make sure that workers are not called upon to lift excessive weights.  Wherever possible, he should make sure that manufactured goods are not packed to a certain maximum weight which would make them excessive on the worker who is handling them.  Take, for example, sugar which is packed in 2 cwt. sacks.  If, for example, something goes wrong during an emergency, it may be necessary for the workers to shift those sacks by manual labour.  The same could apply to fertilisers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1429" /> I have said that, in abnormal circumstances, even though you had the machinery to shift the sacks it might become necessary for men to handle them manually.  If you want to ensure that workers are not called upon to lift excessive weights, then the best way to achieve that is by prescribing that the commodities are not made up in excessive weights, that is as far as it is possible to do that.  We all know that you cannot cut down the size of a motor engine, but you could specify that such things as cereals and meals, flour and sugar and other commodities of that kind are not packed in sacks which are excessively heavy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator is now making a slight amendment in his original proposal.  If he will look at Section 67, he will see that I am taking power to make regulations prescribing the weights which may be lifted, carried or moved by persons employed in factories, etc.  I cannot make regulations with regard to weights which are not lifted, carried or moved.  In regard to sugar and fertilisers, I think that these will be covered by the section as it stands without any amendment, because in so far as workers have to handle fertilisers and sugar, one of the first things that arises immediately is the weight of the sugar or the fertiliser that a factory worker would have to carry.  The question then arises of making regulations and of prescribing the weight. Those who have to handle those commodities later will naturally get the benefit of whatever the reduced weights are, as provided for in the regulations.  I think that meets the Senator's point.  As I have said I cannot make regulations with regard to weights which are not lifted, carried or moved.  I think that what I have said meets the point which the Senator has made in his last speech.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 26:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (1), paragraph (c), line 58, to delete &ldquo;at each meeting of&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;on&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment appears on the Order Paper in the name of Senator Douglas and myself.  Senator Douglas spoke about the safety committee on the Second Reading of the Bill.  I do not propose to go into the details behind my amendment except to say that it is agreed that, in the carrying out of all these Factory Acts and factory regulations, it is absolutely necessary and highly desirable that there should be a good spirit prevailing between the owners of factories and the workers. It is much better to get things done by agreement than by force or bickering or by watching one another.</P>
      <P>There is definitely the feeling that, in this safety committee, there is introduced something which might interfere with that good spirit.  At a meeting of the Special Committee of the Dáil, Deputy Larkin said: &ldquo;We are trying something entirely new here, and we possibly have to feel our way.&rdquo; I would like to suggest, as I have been in very close consultation with both the Chamber of Commerce and the Federated Union of Employers&mdash;this point has been expressed in the Dáil by several members&mdash;that there is a certain uneasiness about the safety committee as it is envisaged in this section.</P>
      <P>On the Report Stage of the Bill in the Dáil the Minister said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The whole success of this depends on the spirit behind it.  If the committee is a nagging committee the employer need not participate.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Minister also said:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;If the committee turns out to be a nagging committee, a knocking <Col N="1431" /> committee, if I may so describe it, more a source of irritation than of the promotion of better health and safety, the employer need not participate in its functions.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think it would be a bad thing if the employer did not participate in its functions.  I think that everything should be done to ensure that he would fully participate in its functions. Paragraph (c) provides that</P>
    <P>&ldquo;the occupier shall be entitled to be represented, by at least one person nominated by him, at each meeting of the safety committee.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Senators will observe that he is entitled to be at the committee, but he is not on the committee.  The Minister, when speaking in the same context in the Dáil, said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;So far as the employer is concerned, he can put man for man on the committee with the workers if he wants to do it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Senators will see that the words used by the Minister were &ldquo;on the committee&rdquo;. That is what I have in my amendment.  The section will then read:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The occupier shall be entitled to be represented by at least one person nominated by him on the safety committee.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I do not think anyone could reasonably object to that, and in view of the fact that the Labour members have already said this thing is purely experimental, I think it would be a bad thing if it went off to a bad start by any feeling of suspicion or doubt of this committee.  I feel that if my amendment were accepted it would help to inculcate the spirit of goodwill in the working of this committee.</P>

He has the same status there whether you put &ldquo;at&rdquo; in the section or &ldquo;on&rdquo;.  I would call the attention of Senator McGuire to the opening part of Section 73, which says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(1) Where the persons employed in a factory have selected from among themselves a committee (in this sub-section referred to as the safety committee) for the purpose of promoting the better safety, health and welfare of the persons employed, the following provisions shall have effect:&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I am advised that that means that if the employer is &ldquo;on&rdquo; the committee he is part of the machinery of selection, he is part of the voting mechanism which produces this voluntary committee of members.  The device of &ldquo;at&rdquo; was resorted to in order to keep him apart from the machinery of selecting those who will constitute the voluntary workers' committee.</P>

    <P>If you look at the whole section and take it together, it will be seen that the general intention is to enable workers in a factory voluntarily to select a group of persons employed there to constitute this safety committee. They can do that if they want to do it, there is no compulsion on them to do it and they need not do it if they do not like to do it.  Where there is existing a works council, it can function as the safety committee for the purpose of this Bill.  The selection of the committee is in the hands of the workers employed in the factory.  The purpose of putting in &ldquo;at&rdquo;, as I say, is not to make the employer part of the selection committee or part of the voluntary operation of the workers in selecting a safety committee's representative, but to ensure in the section that every time a meeting is held the employer will be there.  Does it really matter whether &ldquo;at&rdquo; is in or &ldquo;on&rdquo; is in? Is not the main thing to have the employer represented at the meeting? <Col N="1433" /> Sub-section (1) (e) of Section 73 says that the employer shall be entitled to be represented by at least one person nominated by him, at each meeting of the safety committee.  His status will neither be exalted nor denigrated whether I put &ldquo;at&rdquo; or &ldquo;on&rdquo; in this section, but &ldquo;at&rdquo; is a device which enables the employer to stand clear of the selection machinery.</P>
    <P>I saw a deputation on Saturday last from the Dublin Chamber of Commerce and the Federated Union of Employers and I explained all this to them at very considerable length.  After hearing my explanation of it and after hearing the reasons why &ldquo;at&rdquo; is used instead of &ldquo;on&rdquo;, they went away quite satisfied.  For all practical purposes &ldquo;at&rdquo; and &ldquo;on&rdquo; are the same. The employer would be at the meeting and entitled to be there if he so wished and that would happen even if I put in &ldquo;on&rdquo;, but &ldquo;on&rdquo; will give us administrative complications about the selection committee and for that reason I would urge Senator McGuire not to press the point to the extent of amending it, in which case it will make these difficulties, which will probably have to be got over in some way.  Since &ldquo;at&rdquo; or &ldquo;on&rdquo; makes no difference to the status of the employer at the meetings of the committee, I think it is of very little value to press the matter to that stage.</P>

      <P>I must say that my experience always is that the Minister is able to give an explanation for everything&mdash;perhaps I should say &ldquo;all Ministers&rdquo;, speaking in generic terms &mdash;but if the Chamber of Commerce, as a result of hearing the Minister's explanation, are quite satisfied I am of course perfectly satisfied, too. Therefore, I hope that these committees will turn out to work in a spirit of friendship and not dependent on &ldquo;ats&rdquo; or &ldquo;ons&rdquo; to make them effective.</P>

    <P>In sub-section (1), to delete &ldquo;safety and health&rdquo; in page 44, line 62, and in page 45, line 3, and <Col N="1434" /> substitute in each case &ldquo;safety, health and welfare&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>This is a matter which I discussed with the Dublin Chamber of Commerce and the Federated Union of Employers.  They were anxious that in paragraph (f) it should be made clear that the representations which the safety delegate was entitled to make were representations on matters relating to this Bill.  They feared that he might make representations on matters outside the scope of the Bill. I did not think there was any ground for their fears in that respect, particularly having regard to Section 117. I undertook to meet their point of view by making it clear that the inspector shall consider any representations made to him by the safety delegate on matters relating to the safety, health and welfare of the persons employed in the factory.  That is done in three places in this particular section.</P>
      <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Fearon</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 28:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (1), paragraph (f), line 4, to delete &ldquo;an inspector&rdquo;, and substitute &ldquo;if a safety delegate is dissatisfied with the results of a representation made to the occupier he shall be then entitled to submit such representation to the inspector, who&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Two features of this Bill are the advisory council and the safety committee and as they are very important features I have concentrated on them. Strangely enough, 30 years ago I was on a safety committee myself in connection with a college, organised for the safety, welfare and health of the students.  I have practical experience of the safety committee and the type of problems we had to deal with, and I think those problems will arise again in the wider university of the factory and of industry.  The function of this committee as set forth in sub-section (1) is to assist in securing compliance by the occupier of the factory and any persons employed therein with the ptovisions of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For the purposes of this committee, <Col N="1435" /> there will be one member who will be called a &ldquo;safety delegate&rdquo;.  As stated in sub-section (1), paragraph (f):&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;an inspector shall consider any representations made to him by the safety delegate and, for this purpose, may inspect any records of the proceedings of the safety committee.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think this is giving, by statute, to the safety delegate, the right of access to the Minister, behind the back of the occupier, over his head, or under his feet.  I think, by this legislation, we are going to give to the safety delegate a private key to the Minister's door.  It would, I think, be so much better, to ensure mutual and happy working, that matters should be so arranged that the delegate, first of all, should see the occupier, submit his proposals to him, and then if dissatisfied, go to the higher authority.</P>
    <P>With regard to the safety committee with which I was associated, the same position arose because we had to receive complaints.  Above and beyond that, we could have gone to the vice-chancellor direct.  We never contemplated that, because we thought that would be putting things a bit too high, and would not promote good feeling and understanding.  I am afraid that, if we are to accept this as it stands, it will, sooner or later, mean that the delegates will avail themselves of this statutory device of approaching the inspector, and the occupier will not know what is happening, and will be uneasy as to what the safety delegate will be up to. There is a danger of the safety delegate flying off the handle at meetings of the safety committee, and there is also the danger that this proposed legislation will give him enormous power.  I ask the House to consider my alternative suggestion, as set out in the amendment.  This would strengthen the hand of the safety delegate, strengthen the position of the occupier, and would make things easier for the inspector.</P>

      <P>I hope that, under the circumstances, keys will be quite unnecessary for the purpose of these private representations.  This is a proposal, as I said both in the Dáil and here, to set up a safety committee. Before the scheme will work, it will require goodwill between workers and employers.  If goodwill is not present on either side, it will not work.  If there is no goodwill, it would probably be better that it should not work.  This legislation provides that the safety committee has certain functions which are set out.  Then there is the procedure to be followed by the safety committee, and the safety committee appoints a safety delegate.  The occupier shall consider any representations made to him by the safety committee only on matters affecting the safety and health and welfare of the staff employed in the factory.  Then is stated:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(e) The safety committee shall consider any representations made to it by the occupier on matters affecting the safety and health of the persons employed.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(f) An inspector shall consider any representations made to him by the safety delegate and, for this purpose, may inspect any records of the proceedings of the safety committee.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>As it stands, the sub-section provides that the inspector shall consider any of these representations, and for that purpose, he may inspect the records. What is the safety delegate to talk to the inspector about if it is not a question of the health, welfare and safety of the workers?  I take it that, in accordance with the ordinary law of sensible human procedure, any safety delegate will proceed to the inspector only about these matters, if they have not been settled in consultation with the employer, and at the meeting of the safety committee.  I would hope that the safety delegate would not find it necessary to see the inspector, except when he is dissatisfied, and does not get satisfaction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope that that will be the procedure <Col N="1437" /> generally in such cases. Perhaps it is hard to argue against this amendment because, while this arrangement ought to work, it seems to me it would be a mistake to read into the Bill a provision which would throw on the inspector an obligation, first, to make sure that the safety delegate is discussing the matter with the occupier of the factory: secondly, that in fact, he did not receive satisfaction. The question as to whether or not he received satisfaction, or did not receive satisfaction, or whether he received a measure of frustration, has got to be sorted out.  I think it is no harm to let the safety delegate talk to the inspector, to let the inspector bring his experience to bear on the safety delegate, and at the same time, to bring in the employer and say: &ldquo;Look here, what is wrong in this whole business?&rdquo; Having heard both cases, he should try to find a solution to the problem. I think it is a mistake to set up procedure whereby the inspector will have to find out: did the safety delegate go to the employer and, whatever happened there, did he receive satisfaction or dissatisfaction?  In any case, this would not get the safety delegate away from the inspector.</P>
    <P>If this committee is never set up, it will not prevent someone representing the workers of the factory, and making representation to the inspector.  At present, workers can write to me; in fact, they do, and sometimes their parents ask: &ldquo;Are you aware of the fact that such and such is happening in such a factory?&rdquo;  The letters have to be dealt with, because every citizen is entitled to have his or her complaints investigated.  I send the letters to my Department, and the inspector goes down to inspect the factory, and investigate the complaints.  This is happening at the present time without any safety committee, and this has been the procedure for over 50 years.</P>
    <P>It is to avoid a situation of that kind arising, and to devise a more satisfactory method, that this safety committee is to be set up.  I think, in a case of that kind, instead of sending the inspector down the country to visit the factory about which complaint was made in the letter, it is easier to <Col N="1438" /> get that letter raised at a meeting of the local safety committee, and get the matter ironed out there.  That is the purpose of this section.  It has to be broadly understood, and there has to be tolerance and understanding on both sides.  It you do not get that, as I said, it will not work.</P>
    <P>I do not think the amendment which has been moved by Senator Fearon will carry it one bit further, or make this committee work.  If you could get one section of this Bill showing that, by the exercise of common sense, goodwill and toleration this committee should function in the best interests of the factory, that might make it work.  No amendment which Senator Fearon or myself would table could make this committee work, unless there was good sense on both sides.  For that reason, I should say it is a mistake to imagine that you can import efficiency and smoothness into this, by amendment.  If there is no goodwill, as the basis of approach to the safety committee, it will not work.</P>
    <P>I prefer to give it a trial on the basis of Section 73, because that section represents the distillation of all the wisdom of the Special Committee appointed by the Dáil, and which was brought to bear on an examination of this problem.  I think we should leave it there, and see how it works.  There is no statutory obligation to set up this committee.  It should spring from a desire to ensure the health, safety and welfare of the workers.  If that problem is approached with understanding, it should work.  Neither this amendment, nor any I could move&mdash; and I have often been pressed to move other amendments to sections&mdash;would make it any better than it is, unless it is founded on a basis of goodwill and understanding.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that if the Minister is going to set up this safety committee it should, as far as possible, work on the basis of goodwill.  I am not certain that, under this legislation which we propose to introduce, we are laying the best foundation for working on the basis of toleration and understanding between employer and <Col N="1439" /> employee.  In spite of what the Minister has said, I would recommend this amendment to him.  Sub-section (c) with which we dealt a few moments ago and which we have not amended reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The occupier shall be entitled to be represented, by at least one per son nominated by him, at each meeting of the safety committee.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That does not mean that the members of the safety committee are in fact going to have the occupier present at the meetings, and I feel that the amendment will make it clear to the members of the safety committee that they still can go to the occupier himself, if they are not satisfied with the explanations of his representative who may attend the particular meeting.  I do not feel that this amendment will make it more difficult for the committee to work; rather do I feel that it will help to bring about that toleration and understanding which the Minister desires.</P>

      <P>My view on this amendment is that it is unnecessary, where there is goodwill on the part of the workers and the employer.  The whole purpose of the Bill is to make provision for the health and welfare of those employed in factories and there is nothing new in this suggestion of setting up safety committees.  They have been tried in other countries and have worked very successfully.  I take it the proposal is that the workers come together and set up a committee. The employer is entitled to be present at the meetings or have a representative on this committee.  They appoint one of their members to act as a delegate and I assume that the main function of this delegate will be, not to act as a trouble maker as between the inspector and the employer, but to ensure that the workers play their part in the carrying out of the necessary duties as agreed on by the committee, in consultation with the employer.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe there is a great deal in Senator Fearon's amendment. What the Minister has said about goodwill is admirable.  Nothing <Col N="1440" /> can work smoothly in a factory without goodwill.  We can have rules and regulations, agreements and so on, but, unless they are used in a spirit of mutual respect and confidence, we will not make any progress.  I came across a case recently in which, because the works manager in a factory happened to be, if you like, a tactless individual, a little trouble arose. There was, in fact, a lightning strike, and one of the suggestions made by the labour side was that there should be some machinery whereby, if anything of the sort occurred again, they would be able to see the manager.  I presume that the managing director would be considered to be the occupier of the factory and that the works manager would likely be the person to be appointed as employer's representative on the committee.  If, as would be the case under the amendment, the matter went first to him, I think it might obviate a lot of trouble from time to time.  I think it is an earnest of a desire to overcome difficulties of this sort rather than to have somebody taking up the attitude &ldquo;If you are not very good, I am going to tell the Minister&rdquo;.  That attitude ought to be avoided.</P>

We have often heard it said that there were no bad landlords&mdash;that it was the agents who were bad, and there may be a certain amount of truth in that assertion.  You may have trouble with a tough works manager, when you might have a very reasonable chairman or managing director, if you could have access to him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot understand all the anxiety about this safety committee delegate.  I am afraid that we are suspicious that there will not be goodwill in the committee.  I should like <Col N="1441" /> to know in how many factories in the country there is any contact at all with the occupier or owner, because factory life nowadays has become quite impersonal from the point of view of the owner of the factory.  They are all run by managers and foremen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>These would be the big factories.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>And the small factories. What is wrong these days is that everything is very impersonal, so far as contact between worker and employer is concerned.  I know big factories and small factories where there are works committees set up without any Minister and without any Bill which are working quite satisfactorily. What we should try to develop is a sense of responsibility in a factory and I am not a bit afraid that the safety committee delegate selected by the men will be the undesirable man we all seem to think he will be.</P>
      <P>It is very desirable sometimes to have somebody to tell the inspector, because I can tell Senator Burke that, if the man is a safety committee delegate and he reports something to the managing director&mdash;not to the owner&mdash;or to the foreman, there is a nice quiet way of telling him off.  He is looked upon as a nuisance, whereas, if he tells the inspector, who he knows is responsible for the carrying out of the factory laws, it is quite safe.  The inspector will have tact and understanding and will be able to take action as if he had never got a report. Under the Factory Acts at the moment, inspectors have been found to be very lax in doing the things they should do when they visit factories.</P>
      <P>I do not think there is any need for the amendment.  Let us give the Bill a trial and see what happens.  I do not believe that there is any danger of this delegate chatting to Senator McGuire or to any man like him in a factory.  I suggest that we give the Bill a trial and see what happens and I agree with the Minister that there is no need for the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ArthurCox" hpid="Mr. Cox Mr. Cox">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me that possibly the very fact that this section deals only with things which could be done without the section might make <Col N="1442" /> such an amendment as has been suggested necessary.  It is perfectly true that at present anyone could go to the inspector, but here he is being given a statutory right to go, and it does seem that the very fact of the passing of this section might, in certain circumstances, lead to an absence of goodwill.  Suppose the safety committee were to insist on meeting three or four times a week during working hours?  Under this section, it could possibly be used as a method of producing ill-will in the factory, if there were people who wanted to create ill-will. It seems to me that what is suggested in the amendment, namely, that the occupier, the employer, should be told, if the move comes officially from the safety committee, is reasonable. It does not in the least take away the right which the Minister has stressed and Senator Hickey has stressed that anyone could go to the inspector at the present time.  Of course he can.  If a statutory right is given, there ought to be some kind of provision that a committee is not to be used as a means of making matters unreasonably difficult in the working of the factory.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DominickMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I oppose this amendment very strongly, indeed.  It seems to me that if it was agreed to sub-section (c) of this section would not be availed of.  I quite agree that the occupier or person in charge of the factory should be aware of any grievance that arises but if he is availing of sub-section (c) he will be represented on this particular committee and he should then be aware of it.  If we are to have this amendment inserted, it means that after discussion or disagreement at a factory the safety delegate can do nothing further until he can contact the occupier.  It would mean that we would have to put in another amendment that, on request, the occupier should see him in so many days and a further amendment that the occupier should give a reply in so many other days.  I would not like to be a safety delegate trying to contact some of the occupiers or owners of these factories and I think Senator Fearon should not press this amendment further.  If he will consider this matter in the light of sub-section (c), <Col N="1443" /> he will see that it is not worth while pressing it and if the occupier avails of sub-section (c) he should be aware of the grievances arising and should be able to correct them without having the safety delegate go to the inspector at all.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Take a case of where the inspector arrives at the factory and knows that there is a safety committee and knows that it has been meeting.  He asks for the records of the proceedings of the committee.  He sees that a whole lot of matters have been raised and settled without any difficulty and then he sees that there has been a disagreement.  He sees that there is a problem there and then he goes further and sees that other problems have been settled and that a second difficulty has arisen and that there has been a disagreement.  Presumably at this stage the safety delegate will desire to see him in respect of these two matters, and I imagine that the inspector will say to him that if there are any other matters he had better raise them at the next meeting. He will have seen that there has been disagreement on two points and presumably, the inspector will desire to discuss these matters both with the safety delegate, the safety committee and, if necessary, the manager.  That is the reasonable way and it is the way, I imagine, that these matters will be dealt with.  I do not fear the difficulty that is behind Senator Fearon's amendment.

It seems to me that the Bill is rather better as it stands, as it gives the right to people to ask questions, or to get a friend to ask questions, if they cannot attend themselves or employ solicitor or counsel.</P>

      <P>The purpose of the phrase &ldquo;or agent&rdquo; is to enable some friend of the deceased person to appear at the inquest and ask questions if he so desires.  Admittedly, it is widening the normal scope of access to the inquest but it was felt that a person might desire to allow a friend of a deceased person to attend at the inquest. For that reason the phrase was put in originally.  I have no very special views on the matter and if the House felt it desirable to delete it, I would not be unwilling to do so.  On <Col N="1446" /> the other hand, if it was desired that provision be made for the possibility of a friend attending, I would allow it to stand.  I do not think it is very important.</P>

      <P>I can understand the point made by Senator Sheehy Skeffington but, as the section stands, it seems to open the door to a type of remunerated agent other than a legally qualified practitioner.  I must admit that I am fighting my own corner, but this does not seem to me to be desirable from the public point of view having regard to all the safeguards that are necessary to protect the public.  We should avoid any danger of creating a class of unprofessional agents.  If the Minister could provide that such an agent would not be remunerated I would agree with Senator Sheehy Skeffington.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quite happy to take together the five amendments standing in my name for the reason that the first of these, amendment No. 41, is consequential upon the passing of amendments Nos. 42 and 45, which are comprehensive amendments.  The remaining two amendments, Nos. 43 and 44, are amendments to allow the House and Senators to decide to amend the section in a minor way if not in a major way.</P>
      <P>Before I come to the point I made on the Second Stage when considering this Bill in relation to this section, I should like to say that the Minister's attitude on this Bill has been extremely conciliatory.  That was apparent in the Dáil, and in the Special Committee.  It was apparent from the fact that the Minister put down a number of amendments to meet points made in the Seanad on the Second Stage.  Finally, it was apparent from his attitude here to-day.  I welcome that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I noted with satisfaction that in his reply on the Second Stage he said, in relation to this section, that he did not feel very strongly about it; that he had certain doubts in his mind, but <Col N="1448" /> that he was in sympathy with some of the points I put.  The purpose of this whole section is to see to it that the provisions of the Factories Act shall apply to factories which are run in connection with public institutions, either of a charitable or of a reformatory character.</P>
    <P>Consequently, I would commend sub-section (1) of Section 84 because it lays it down that all the benefits with regard to health, safety, welfare and so on, which are to be granted under this Bill to workers in ordinary factories, are to be granted also to workers in factories attached to and run by institutions, whether they be reformatories, mental homes and or similar establishments.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, I am a little disturbed by the fact that, having stated that principle and having included it in the Bill, the Minister felt it necessary to frame clauses making certain exceptions to the general provisions of the Bill when applied to the workers in public institutions.</P>
    <P>I made the point before, and I think it is worth stressing, that workers in ordinary factories, who are now going to get this additional protection, already have one form of protection which the inmates of reformatories or mental homes or institutions of that kind have not got.  I refer to the protection of trade union organisation. The protection that the ordinary worker now has in a trade union organisation is quite strong.  The sort of workers who will be affected by these excepting and excluding clauses, if they are allowed to stand in the Bill, have no such protection; and it is for that reason that, while I accept sub-section (1) in the section, I am surprised to find the exceptions asked for by the Bill in the other sub-sections.</P>
    <P>It is for that reason that my main amendments would delete entirely sub-sections (2) and (3).  I should like to ask the Minister, and the House, what reasons, what positive reasons, are there for desiring that workers who otherwise are to be considered as working in a factory, workers who work there as inmates or as detainees, should not be offered precisely the same measure of protection as is offered to workers outside in a <Col N="1449" /> privately run factory?  I should like not a negative approach to that question, but rather that some positive advantage should be suggested as resulting from refusing to give these people precisely the same protection as other workers.  I would say, as I have suggested, that, if anything, they merit more protection, by reason of the fact that they have not got available to them the ordinary protection of a trade union organisation.</P>
    <P>Sub-section (2) says that if any institution is carried on for charitable or reformatory purposes, the persons having control of the institution, having satisfied the Minister that &ldquo;the only persons&rdquo; working therein are persons who are inmates of and are supported by the institution, then certain exemptions may be made.  I draw attention to the phrase that the managers of such institution have to &ldquo;satisfy&rdquo; the Minister.  I have mentioned that the factory work there is being done only by inmates.  If there is so much as one outside worker there, one man or one woman, he or she may seek the ordinary protection of a trade union organisation, and then this section does not apply.  I cannot help wondering what is the concern underlying this provision, that the Minister has to be satisfied that it will be only inmates or detainees who will be&mdash;and I use the word advisedly&mdash;deprived of certain of the protections guaranteed by this Bill?  Why does he want to satisfy himself that it will be &ldquo;only&rdquo; such people as these?</P>
    <P>I should like to mention the two sub-sections of Section 2 upon which I suggest it would be possible, if the Seanad should decide not to reject all of Section 2, to take a vote separately.  I should like the House to have a look at these two sub-sections and at the type of exception as well as the general provisions that are asked for by the Minister in the Bill.  Paragraph (a) of sub-section (2) provides that:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The medical officer of the institution (if any) may, on the application of the managers, be appointed to be the certifying doctor for the institution.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I suggest that that might result in the <Col N="1450" /> placing of the doctor of an institution in an invidious position, which no doctor would relish, that is of having to act as the certifying authority over conditions and circumstances within his own control.  He would have, in a sense to be investigating conditions for which he himself would be responsible. I notice&mdash;if I may without digression refer to another provision in the Bill&mdash;that in Section 77 for instance which relates to inquests, certain provisions are made in paragraph (c) which reads:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;No person having a personal interest in or employed in or about or in the management of the factory in or about which the accident or disease occurred or was contracted shall be qualified to serve on the jury.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is considered sufficiently important, in relation to the jury at a coroner's inquest, to see that nobody even remotely connected with the running of the factory shall serve on that jury. Similarly, I suggest that it is equally important to see to it that the certifying doctor under the various provisions of this Bill shall not, in fact, be employed or connected with the institution, be wholly or partly employed by it, for the same obvious reasons that such a doctor employed in or by the factory in question might find it awkward and embarrassing to have to pass judgment on the management which was employing him.  Indeed, he might have to discover certain instances of remissness with regard to sanitation and so on, for which remissness he himself had in the past been responsible.  Therefore, it seems to me to be an unwise provision.</P>
    <P>Another purpose for which the certifying doctor is used is, of course, in connection with the health of workers, and the fitness to work of certain categories of workers.  I wonder if the Minister has considered what exactly happens in a laundry or a woodworking factory, or a factory of any kind, in connection with an institution when the doctor in that institution discovers that a particular worker, while not ill enough for hospital treatment, is not fit for particular work in the factory.  What, in fact, is done with <Col N="1451" /> such worker?  What is his position, be he a detainee or an inmate?  I wonder if the Minister has faced the problem which might arise for the doctor himself from the necessity of certifying as to their fitness to work of certain categories of workers in an institution which was, in fact, employing that doctor.</P>
    <P>I now turn to paragraph (b) of sub-section (2).  This paragraph seems to me to be one for which no defence at all can be made.  The paragraph says that if a factory is being carried on in an institution which has been set up for reformatory purposes, and if the manager gives notice to the Minister to that effect, an inspector shall not, without the consent of the managers or the person having charge of the institution, examine any inmate of the institution save in the presence of one of the managers.  I do not know what kind of a mental world is inhabited by the draftsmen of this Bill, whether they live in a realistic world or in a world out of all touch with reality, but I wonder if they would pause and think how an inspector of the Department is likely to get full and frank answers from an inmate of a reformatory, if that inmate is to be questioned by the inspector only in the presence of the managers of the institution.</P>
    <P>I think it is obvious to anyone with common sense that an inmate who is to be a witness, and who is to be examined as to the facts and conditions, possibly the very conditions which gave rise to an accident, will only speak freely if he is alone with the inspector, or at any rate if the managers are not present.  That is not by any means necessarily a reflection upon the managers.  It may be simply a reflection on the stupidity, the stubbornness or the imaginary fears of the inmate, but that stupidity, that stubbornness, or those imaginary fears would exist in 99 cases out of 100.  Consequently, if we are to insist that where an inspector wants to examine an inmate he cannot do so except in the presence of the managers, if the managers so request, I am afraid we are including in this <Col N="1452" /> Bill a clause which is very surprising indeed, and quite unjustifiable.</P>
    <P>It is true that at the end of the paragraph the Minister is given the right, if he is satisfied that he should use it, to waive the clause; but how does a Minister become &ldquo;satisfied&rdquo; that the inspector would have got different answers from an inmate if he had questioned him in private rather than in the presence of the managers? I do not find this a satisfactory clause, and my hope is that it will be removed. It is for that reason partly that I put the amendments down in this somewhat fragmentary form, so that even if Senators might feel that certain other elements in this section should be retained, no one will feel that that paragraph is justifiable.</P>
    <P>There is another point in that paragraph on which I should like to ask the Minister a question.  Am I right in assuming that the phrase &ldquo;an institution carried on for reformatory purposes&rdquo; includes an industrial school?  I am not quite sure whether &ldquo;reformatory purposes&rdquo; could strictly speaking be applied to an industrial school.  I think I am right in saying there is a difference in law between the concept of the industrial school and that of the reformatory.  I know that some inmates of industrial schools go there through no fault of their own, but simply by reason of the poverty of their parents, whereas I take it that the person who is an inmate of a reformatory has at least been found guilty of an offence.  There is a distinction there, and I should like that cleared up, if the Minister would answer that question in relation to this paragraph (b) in sub-section (2), which I hope to see disappearing altogether.</P>
    <P>Finally, I have suggested the deletion of sub-section (3).  It simply says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;This Act shall not, except in so far as the Minister may by Order direct, apply to any premises which do not constitute a factory if the premises are subject to inspection by or under the authority of any Minister of State.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>An institution which is &ldquo;under the authority of a Minister of State&rdquo; is <Col N="1453" /> not to have the protection of this Bill! I wonder just what is implied by that? We all know, of course, that whatever is being run by a Department aims at being a model institution, and we all realise that the purpose of such institutions if they are under the authority of a Minister of State is of the highest; but we heard it said in relation to the whole Bill on the Second Stage that &ldquo;the good employer&rdquo; in an ordinary private factory will welcome this Bill because in fact the Bill enshrines principles which he has already applied in his factory.  I should like to believe&mdash;and I hope we can all believe&mdash;that this Bill enshrines principles which are already applied in every institution under the authority of a Minister. What objection can there be, therefore, to having the provisions of the Bill applied to those institutions? What more objection can there be than in the case of other factories run by good employers?  Why are institutions under the authority of any Minister to be removed from the provisions of the Bill?</P>
    <P>Furthermore, in this sub-section (3) we are told that the Act shall not apply if the premises are &ldquo;subject to inspection by any Minister of State&rdquo;. I made the point on the Second Stage that they might in fact be subject to such inspection for reasons quite different, and quite unrelated to the preoccupations underlying this Bill.  It seems to me that it would be absurd to relieve such an institution from compliance with the provisions of the Bill simply because a part of the premises was being inspected by the Department of Health or by some other Department.</P>
    <P>For all these reasons, therefore, I am putting forward these five amendments standing in my name, making it clear that the first amendment is a consequential one, consequential upon the removal of sub-section (2) and sub-section (3) in their totality, and that the other amendments I am proposing would arise only if the two comprehensive amendments standing in my name were to be defeated.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RogerMcHugh" hpid="Dr. McHugh Dr. McHugh">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McHugh</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I support Senator Sheehy Skeffington very <Col N="1454" /> briefly, for two reasons?  I do not think any institution existing for charitable purposes could reasonably object to this Bill without sub-section (2).  The purpose of the Bill itself seems to be an eminently charitable one in the widest sense of the term, in the sense of demanding for others the kind of treatment we want for ourselves.  The second consideration is&mdash;and it does not seem to have struck the mover of the amendment&mdash;that the exemption of any institution might very easily invite the rigging of dummy charities, rather like the rigging of dummy companies by profit-making firms, by a factory which wanted to escape through the meshes of the Bill.  For these two reasons I would support Senator Sheehy Skeffington, particularly on the amendment which proposes to delete sub-section (2).  I have one question for the Minister&mdash;are jails exempt?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be willing to recommit Section 84 on the Report Stage if it is desired to shorten this discussion and have a longer discussion then.  I think Senators Sheehy Skeffington and McHugh are approaching this from an entirely wrong point of view.  Section 84 says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Where, in any premises forming part of an institution carried on for charitable or reformatory purposes, any manual labour is exercised in or incidental to the making, altering, repairing, ornamenting, finishing, washing, cleaning, or adapting for sale, of articles not intended for the use of the institution, but the premises do not constitute a factory, then, nevertheless, the provisions of this Act shall, subject as hereinafter in this section provided, apply to those premises.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>These premises do not constitute a factory, nevertheless, they are included within the purposes of this Bill as a factory.  The discussion has proceeded and the questions have been raised, as if a place carried on for charitable or reformatory purposes is excluded from the scope of the Bill.  It is not.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>That portion of my reply was not intended to apply to the Senator.  The section says that even if such premises do not constitute a factory they still come within the scope of the Bill.</P>
      <P>Is not that clear?  It is a factory for all practical purposes.  Then sub-section (2) says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;If in any institution carried on for charitable or reformatory purposes and to which this Act applies the persons having the control of the institution (hereinafter referred to as the managers) satisfy the Minister that the only persons working therein are persons who are inmates of and supported by the institution, or persons engaged in the supervision of the work or the management of machinery, and that such work as aforesaid is carried on in good faith for the purposes of the support, education, training, or reformation of persons engaged in it, the Minister may by Order direct that so long as the Order is in force this Act shall apply to the institution&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Even then it can apply, &ldquo;subject to the following modifications&rdquo;.  Is it perfectly clear now that the charitable organisation and the reformatory institution come within the scope of the Bill?  A charitable organisation, an institution which is used for charitable and reformatory purposes, may be brought into the Act, if the Minister is satisfied.  Then the Act operates, subject to certain modifications.  What are the modifications?  They are:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(a) the medical officer of the institution (if any) may, on the application of the managers, be appointed to be the certifying doctor for the institution;&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But it does not say he shall.  He may be appointed by the manager, if the manager asks that he should be.  What are his functions?  Senator Sheehy Skeffington contemplated a medical officer here&mdash;I do not know whether it was holding inquests or testifying at inquests.  The medical officer has no such functions.  He has got the rather <Col N="1456" /> mundane task of examining a young person at 16 years of age to see whether that person could work at these operations, or he has to certify as to industrial disease.  As far as the other activities are concerned, his function is to mind his own business. He has no other functions, and there is no purpose in creating a monster out of that doctor in the institution.  These are simply pedestrian tasks, which the doctor performs for the purposes of this Bill.</P>

The total effect of Senator Sheehy Skeffington's amendment would be that he would create, if it were accepted, an extremely difficult situation. Section 84 relates to institutions which are not factories.  They may engage in any of the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;making, altering, repairing, ornamenting, finishing, washing, cleaning, or adapting for sale, of articles not intended for the use of the institution.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Sub-section (1) is employed because, for the purpose of these industrial activities, it might have outside people as well as institutional people.  It is carried on for charitable or reformatory purposes. In Section 84 (2) you get the kind of situation in which these inmates are being supported by an institution. They may be people who are subject to medical care, people who are insane, people who may be mental defectives, but even there they get the protection of the Bill, subject to certain modifications. What are the modifications? The first is that the doctor can have a look at them if they are going to be sent to this work and if they are under 16 years.  He looks at them until they are 18&mdash;one simple task.  He cannot do that unless the manager asks that he should be allowed to do it and unless the Minister for the time being says: &ldquo;Very well; you may do it.&rdquo; He can never do it if the Minister will not allow him.  The second is in relation to this question of the examination of the inmate&mdash;that the inspector examines the inmate in the presence of the manager.  Is there anything seriously wrong in that?  Here is an inmate&mdash;a mentally defective man or woman, boy or girl.  Is there anything wrong&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am not saying that one is the same as the other, but you could have a place for the reformation of people, and, if you have a place for <Col N="1459" /> the reformation of people, this section operates.  The approach to this whole problem is an approach to the problem of what you should do in dealing with this class of person&mdash;those who are in charitable institutions, those who are in institutions for reformatory purposes and those who may be in these places for medical care, physical or mental.  For all practical purposes, they have the full protection of the Bill, except in respect of these two limited functions.  I do not think you can push things to the extent that you can regard an institution carrying on by solicited contributions and maintaining the inmates as being in the same position as the biggest factory in the City of Dublin.  You have to recognise that some of these people are there in the most peculiar of circumstances and that this section is bent in order to deal with that situation.</P>

      <P>There is no question of a boy in a factory giving evidence at all.  If an inspector goes into a factory for the purpose of any inquiry, he sees the person concerned in the presence of the manager, but you are not dealing with ordinary people here.  If these were ordinary people, one could say that this is not necessary, but the persons concerned here are not ordinary factory workers.  They are miscreants of one kind or another. They are people who are in there, in these institutions, for the public good &mdash;not so much for their own good as for the public good.  They may be persons who are physically or mentally ill and that is why there is this approach. In any case, in one way or another, this section has been in our factory legislation since 1907&mdash;for the past 48 years&mdash;and it has not caused any of the problems which have been conjured up in the course of this discussion.</P>

Is the inspector to knock at the door of the institution and to say: &ldquo;I want to see Mary Murphy&rdquo;, that Mary Murphy being in the institution for a variety of reasons, all odd in themselves and not calling for public approbation, and, having found Mary Murphy, to say to her: &ldquo;I want to talk to you about some things which happened in this factory&rdquo;?  Is there anything wrong in a case like that in the manager or manageress of a female institution of that kind sitting down while Mary Murphy is being asked questions by the inspector?

One of the limitations is that the manager or manageress should be there&mdash;neither need be there, if they do not wish&mdash;when the inspector puts his questions and in an endeavour to remedy that we are creating a situation in which an inspector can stalk into a female reformatory and interview anybody he likes.

      <P>I think it should be obvious to nearly everybody present that my objection was not to something dreadful which the inspector would do, but to the very simple situation in which an inmate of a reformatory would be afraid to tell the truth to the inspector in the presence of the manager or the manageress whom he or she might regard, even wrongly, as being responsible for the conditions about which he was giving evidence.  There is nothing to prevent the inspector from bringing in somebody else to accompany him, but the fear would arise from the presence of the manager who might, perhaps quite wrongly, be considered by the inmate as being responsible for those very conditions about which the inmate is being questioned by the inspector.  I do not think anybody will remember my suggesting that an inspector is likely to do something wrong.  I am simply stating that a boy or girl will not speak freely if he or she can speak to the inspector only in the presence of the manager.</P>

    <Title>Traffic Regulations&mdash;Motion.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That in the opinion of Seanad Eireann (1) the present traffic regulations should be more strictly enforced; (2) the law should be amended so as to provide (a) a driving test, (b) power to enforce speed limits in certain areas without public inquiry, (c) rights of pedestrians at certain crossings, (d) clear legal indication as to major and minor roads, (e) limitations on the use of motor horns.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This motion is put down in order to enable the House to discuss a matter which, I think it is generally agreed, is of very great importance.  The motion is in two parts.  It asks for a more strict enforcement of the present traffic regulations, and it suggests certain amendments of the law; but the motion is not intended to be taken as <Col N="1463" /> insisting that the things it contains are things which absolutely must be done.  I recognise that this question of traffic control and of the avoidance of casualties to life and limb on the roads is something which calls for the pooling of intelligence and experience.  It is a matter which has no political limitations or implications of any kind.</P>
    <P>The number of vehicles on the roads whether commercial, private or public has been increasing steadily, and to that has recently been added the tractor with the mechanisation of agriculture. Driving is easier, speeds higher and roads better, and the result is greater danger.  I will not worry the House with any figures of casualties but it is well known that they are steadily increasing.  There are several interests in this matter&mdash;the motorists themselves, cyclists, drivers of other vehicles, and pedestrians.  All or nearly all motorists are at some time pedestrians, but it must be remembered in discussing this matter that pedestrians include children, old people, women with perambulators and other classes, including people who can run and who because they can run are likely not to be injured.  All these people have rights, but none of them ought to have licence, and their rights should be exercised in relation to other classes.</P>
    <P>With regard to the law of the roads I take it that there are really first and foremost the common law, which applies within certain limitations, and the rest is divided between two Ministries. Most of the rules and Orders come from Local Government and some from Justice.  Enforcement is entirely a matter for the Department of Justice. The present law so far as I understand it depends on the Act of 1933 and a multitude of Orders made under it.  I would like to ask as a query at this point&mdash;is there a traffic code?  I would like to know whether there is any booklet in which one can find a complete account of the traffic code which is something which ought to be obeyed as distinct entirely from the statutes. There should be these laws and these rules, and as well as that what one might call the rules of common <Col N="1464" /> decency, and that, I think, is the law that is most frequently broken on the road.  It is quite clear to anybody whether walking or driving that the law is absolutely unknown to a great many road users, or if it is known it is constantly broken.</P>
    <P>The motion, before I go into it, omits parking altogether.  That seems to be the only part of the law which, in Dublin at any rate, is strictly enforced. Coming to the first part of the motion, the enforcement of the present law, as far as my experience goes, prosecutions for breaches of the law take place mostly after an accident has occurred.  I would like to suggest that no improvement can be effected until you have prosecutions and drastic punishments for breaches of the law where no accident has occurred.  Let us take for example the traffic lights in Dublin.  I take it that the obligation is that one stops before the traffic light and that one gives the road to pedestrians at pedestrian crossings. There are pedestrian crossings at every traffic light.  I do not know if I am right in that, but pedestrians certainly make efforts to cross at the traffic lights.  What is the position?  At every traffic light in this city cyclists are on the pedestrian crossing.  Very often they are right out in front.  Many cars, including buses, lorries and private cars, are half over the pedestrian crossings; and a great many cars and nearly all cyclists start to cross the road before they get the green light.  This very day coming down here to Leinster House at 2.30 a car passed me in Leeson Street racing to get the traffic light.  It did not get the light. It went right across the pedestrian crossing.  The driver was so impatient he kept on crawling forward until he was half way across the road at the Vincent's Hospital side into Stephen's Green, and he gave no signal.  This is, of course, a common thing.</P>
    <P>Another common thing here of which nobody seems to take any notice is that cars are parked at the lights. Part of the lights system here is an arrow showing that you can go straight forward.  In any case where there is an arrow cyclists never observe it&mdash;or perhaps I should put it the other way <Col N="1465" /> around; cyclists always observe it, always assume that it is there and always go forward.  Two examples which come into my mind mostly are the arrow at Rathmines opposite Castlewood Avenue and the arrow at Harcourt Road.  Where there are arrows cyclists assume that they can always go forward.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of signals. When one goes to Belfast from here it becomes immediately obvious that you get a great many more signals on the road and in the city than here.  Cyclists are often blamed for not giving signals, but on many occasions I have taken the opportunity of watching what happens cyclists when they do give signals at certain road junctions.</P>
    <P>My experience for what it is worth is that a great many motorists blow the horn and accelerate when a cyclist puts out his right hand.  They regard as absolutely essential that they should pass a cyclist out.  There is some explanation for the notion that they ought to give no signal at all. Before we proceed to do any amending of the law we ought to make up our minds as to what we ought to do about these traffic lights and get the present law strictly enforced.</P>
    <P>It is against the law for cyclists to go three abreast.  Is it against the law for cars to go three abreast?  Can C pass out A and B at the same moment? I understand he should not but it is done constantly.  If you travel on any particular main road in Dublin to a place like Harold's Cross Bridge, for instance, you will find three lines of traffic coming down, including buses, all keeping fairly steady and behaving very well.  On the right of these people comes a motorist.  He breaks out from the line, gets in front just out against the red light and finally passes everybody else.  A prosecution against a person of that type would be of great assistance in preventing accidents.  It is that type of person who causes accidents.</P>
    <P>I also understand that it is against the law to pass on a cross-roads within a certain distance of a corner but that is done all the time.  A great many of the devices on the roads have no legal <Col N="1466" /> significance at all and it seems to me that they accomplish the reverse of what they are intended to do.  Take the case of the &ldquo;winking willie&rdquo;.  I do not know whether that has any legal significance but I know what motorists on the Rathgar Road do in regard to the &ldquo;winking willie&rdquo; at the corner of Rathgar Road and Frankfurt Avenue. The motorists just blow their horns and accelerate.  That is what they do nearly all the time.</P>
    <P>It seems to me to be a complete waste of time to paint &ldquo;Slow&rdquo; notices on the roads.  I stood for 25 minutes at one of these notices situated about 50 yards beyond an intersection.  The great majority of drivers simply blew the horn and accelerated The question arises as to what is the present law in connection with the matter.  Is there any legal significance to the &ldquo;winking willies&rdquo; and the signs on the roads? Do these signs mean anything?  I suggest that at the present time they mean little to motorists and still less to cyclists.</P>
    <P>I am also told&mdash;I am not an authority on this&mdash;that a motor-car is supposed to have lights of equal size and intensity, but when one travels at night one frequently meets cars which have a big bright light on the right-hand side and a small weak light on the left-hand side.  That is very disconcerting. A great many motor-cars have only one light.  There certainly should be some rule about that.</P>

      <P>If there is a law about it, it is more honoured in the breach than in the observance.  One sees all kinds of varieties of lights. Sometimes you see a bright light on the right-hand side of a car and a dim one on the left.  The reverse case is also frequent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I have never seen anybody prosecuted for it.  It is extremely dangerous.  I do not know <Col N="1467" /> whether the law compels you to dim your lights.  Most people do so, but there are some who do not.  Some road-hogs with plenty of nerve simply turn on their long lights and drive by.  So much for the enforcement of the traffic regulations.</P>
      <P>I think it is very bad for public morale that there should be regulations which are not enforceable. Regulations should be clear and, when made, should be enforced.  They are certainly not enforced now, particularly the one dealing with passing on a corner.  Often when you come to Terenure corner, which is a dangerous corner, and you slow up, people coming from Senator McCrea's county, County Wicklow, blow the horn as much as to say: &ldquo;What kind of a fool are you?  Why do you not go on?&rdquo; Admittedly, they are not all Wicklow men.  Some of them are Dublin men like myself.  One is frequently passed on the corner.  I do not know whether that is legal or not.</P>
      <P>With regard to amending the law, I think a great deal could be done without any amendment of the law at all if you had reasonableness and proper and drastic enforcement of the law by what I regard as the most important penalty of all, depriving people of their driving licence, That is the only penalty which motorists fear.  They do not mind fines at all.</P>
      <P>The first amendment of the law I would suggest&mdash;I am not standing absolutely pat on these suggestions&mdash;is that there should be a driving test.  I know this matter has been discussed up and down and that official opinion has been very much against it.  It has been stated that driving tests have not improved the position in other countries. The present position here is that there is no safeguard whatever against the physically unfit.  No discovery of any kind can be made as to what was wrong with a person driving a car until after an accident has occurred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the very least an applicant for a driving licence on the first occasion should be seen by somebody.  Surely he should come into the physical view of somebody giving him the licence so <Col N="1468" /> as to see whether he is physically fit. If a driving test means that an applicant is examined about the engine I would not pass it.  I know nothing about engines and I do not propose to learn anything about them.  It seems to me that the experts on engines are about the most dangerous drivers on the roads.</P>
    <P>The least important thing of all is the knowledge of the car itself. Apparently the modern car can be driven by almost anybody.  I know that a driving test is expensive, but there should be some measure of security to provide that people physically unfit should not be allowed to drive and that the too young should not be allowed to drive a car.  The people who drive cars should be examined about the rules of the road. A great many people who drive cars nowadays obviously know nothing about them.</P>
    <P>The next point concerns the power to enforce speed limits in certain areas without public inquiry.  I understand that it is very difficult at present to impose a speed limit.  Again, it has been suggested that it is very difficult to enforce speed limits, but there are speed limits in Section 46 of the Road Traffic Acts and I do not think they are ever enforced.</P>
    <P>I understand, as far as my reading of this is concerned that the speed limit for double-decker buses is 20 miles an hour.  Anyone who lives on any road outside of Dublin and sees the speed at which these buses go, and particularly anyone in Dublin who sees buses going to the garage at night, well knows that the limit of 20 miles an hour or 25 miles an hour or 40 miles an hour is not observed.  There appears to be no speed limit.  The speed limit for single-decker buses seems to be 35 miles an hour.  They travel at a much greater speed than that as people well know.  Is there any limit for lorries?  I have followed lorries in a fairly good car at 40 miles an hour and I was able to make no impression on them.  In any event, I think there should be a speed limit and enforcement of it.  On roads leading to Dublin, say on those outside of <Col N="1469" /> Inchicore, there should be an obligation on motorists coming long distances to pull up and slacken their speed.</P>
    <P>At the present moment the power of punishment for driving at an unreasonable speed is rarely used.  I do not know whether I am allowed to criticise the courts in general, but I suppose one can express a view.  My view is that the punishments which are inflicted in these cases appear to be absurd.  For example, I read a report in the newspapers myself of a motorist who was pursued on a particular road by the Gardaí.  They had to do 70 miles an hour to catch up on him.  His excuse was that he wanted to be home in time to see the baby bathed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. P. O'Donnell Mr. P. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>It must have been the first one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>His excuse was very funny and may have been very laudable, but I suggest that he should have been deprived of his licence so that in future he could go home by train or by bus over the next five or six years to see the baby bathed.  That kind of thing is making a mockery of the courts.  For that reason I think there should be either the imposition of a speed limit or a more rigid enforcement of the regulations.  For example, if you live on any particular road and watch cars passing at any particular moment, you can see the same cars every day at the same time doing the same highly unreasonable speeds.  You have the same persons doing the same speed every day.  I do not agree at all that young people or women are the worst drivers on the roads.  It seems to me that old men seem to do the most foolish things. They are people with hair as white as my own.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The next point is about the right of pedestrians at certain crossings.  One is tempted to compare Dublin City with London or Belfast, and to ask whether pedestrians are recognised at all by the law in this State?  Have they any rights at all on the road? Where a Guard is on duty everything, of course, is all right.  The Guards <Col N="1470" /> carry out their duty perfectly in that regard.  Their work outside of schools is wholly admirable.  But where there is no Guard on duty it is impossible to get across any road in Dublin.  There is no place between Rathfarnham and the quays, and that is a long distance, where a pedestrian can cross the road without having to risk his life.  There is no use in saying that a person has rights if he has to risk his life in order to exercise them.  Of course, in our more heroic days people were prepared to do that, but it is not fair, I suggest, to ask people to do that morning after morning.  The fact is that a person cannot cross the road to get a bus to go to work.  It is quite impossible to cross the roads in the morning at present.</P>
    <P>I know roads myself and it is absolutely impossible to cross them to the bus stop.  There is no place on that whole road where a pedestrian has any rights.  People have those rights in Belfast.  There is a new traffic light on Merrion Road.  A member of this House got it put there.  I was there one Saturday evening and I watched cars passing for 20 minutes.  No one could cross the road.  A woman came along with a perambulator and seven cars passed the red light before she could get across.  Take the bottom of Leeson Street which I cross very frequently on the way to the university. It is an experience and a thrill to see what happens there every day.  Crossing the road there is far more dangerous than being out in a rising because death is quite up against you all the time.</P>
    <P>I wonder what is the police view of this?  If I am walking across a road when the lights change have I the right to go on or have cars the right to drive on top of me?  That is what they do.  In Belfast they do not.  They let you pass.  There is another thing that I have noticed.  If a motorist does stop to allow a pedestrian, say a woman with a perambulator, to cross the road he may not be doing her any good, but the reverse because a motorist behind him may pass him on the right or on the left and endanger the woman's life. I saw an example of that.  I was not driving the car myself, but was being <Col N="1471" /> driven by a Garda sergeant.  He stopped to let a woman cross the road and the fellow behind him started to blow his horn.  The sergeant got out and showed his card.  The owner was very civil when he discovered that he was up against a policeman.  Of course, the bully is always a very cowardly person, but his explanation was that he thought he had the right to go on.</P>
    <P>Have we any clear indication of major or minor roads or is there any such rule for Dublin traffic?  In this State of ours we appear to have no such indication.  At the moment we have nothing here but disorder and in Dublin no one ever knows to whom one ought to give way.  For example, is there a rule that you have to give way to traffic on the right?</P>

      <P>If there is, I should like the Minister some day to visit the bottom of Harold's Cross Green and watch the double-decker buses, the lorries and other motor traffic coming from Kimmage.  They come along on the left-hand side hell for leather.  If I am driving into town I can exercise my rights if I like, but I am afraid I am no longer a hero.  I must tell the Minister that no such rule is being observed.  I live on Templeogue Road and coming into Terenure I meet an intersection from Kimmage Road.  Do buses or cars give way to me?  They do not.  There is no such thing as giving way to you.  I gave way there yesterday myself to an ambulance and a driver behind me almost lifted the roof off his car blowing the horn.  No one ever gives way to traffic on that road.  I do not know whether there is any such thing as a major or a minor road.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am living in Dublin all my life and I have been driving a car for more than 30 years, and yet I feel that I could not bring anyone to any place in Dublin and say: &ldquo;Here is a major road&rdquo;.  My observation does not lead me to believe that there is any such thing as a major road.  I say that with all respect to <Col N="1472" /> the Minister.  Perhaps he is thinking of a legal concept.  Perhaps I should say that Rathgar Road may be a major road.  If there is a major road there is no such thing as a regulation about it, or general practice, observing it.</P>
      <P>In regard to the limitation on the use of motor horns, expert drivers always told me that driving on the horn or on the brake was bad driving, that if you used your horn constantly you were a bad driver.  If that is so, there must be a considerable number of bad drivers in Dublin, as you hear horns blowing day and night.  One of the practices in Dublin is that the moment the light changes to green at the traffic lights the boys begin to blow their horns to tell those in front to hurry up.  They use horns constantly at traffic lights, winking willies, &ldquo;slow&rdquo; signs and at night to a disgraceful extent.  They may not be all drunk&mdash;I am sure some of them are sober&mdash;but they constantly drive on the horn at night.  I am well aware of that, as I have always lived within the city.  You hear horns blowing steadily even though people have lights they can use.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest that the use of the horn should be totally prohibited between certain hours, say, from 10 p.m. to 8 a.m.  It might be a good idea to prohibit totally its use except in an emergency, so that one would have to prove one had justification for using it.  It would make the roads much safer, since many people in city and country drive cars on the basis that if they blow the horn everyone will get out of the way and there is no danger.  Pedestrians and others have got so used to horns that they use their ears instead of their eyes, and when they do not hear a horn they think the road is safe.  I remember that on the last week of my holidays one year I was 140 miles from Dublin, beyond Dungarvan, when something went wrong with some part of my car which meant I could not use the horn. I drove from Dungarvan to Dublin without using it and found it far safer and not a bit slower.  Horns as used in this city make the life of those who <Col N="1473" /> live on corners dreadful at night. Horns are blowing all the time and it is regarded as the natural thing.  I know there is some rule about it, but it is never enforced.</P>
    <P>I left out one point and would ask you to allow me to deal with it now. I know that the observance of Christian charity or even pagan courtesy will solve nearly all the problems of the road.  The majority of the people are quite all right, they are decent people who observe the rules; but the minority make the roads unbearable. It is said that for safety first we must do some teaching and some propaganda. I say that motorists and cyclists are much more in need of teaching than school children.  Too much is expected from the teachers and too much reliance is placed on what they can do.  The human boy, thanks be to God, is not entirely dirigible and it would be a very bad thing for us to teach in the schools that everyone must walk on the path and do this and do that in order that reckless people with no manners may drive cars fast on the roads.  Safety propaganda is more necessary for motorists and road users than for children.</P>
    <P>I do not know what the common law is but in spite of the Road Fund to which motorists contribute, I understand the roads are not primarily for them and that others have rights there, including cattle.  I have found myself with people in motor-cars who took most unreasonable views.  Perhaps I am an unusual motorist, but I have no sympathy whatever with the impatient person who runs into a fair in a country town, wonders what all the cattle are doing and why he cannot get through in a hurry.  I think he should be glad to see the cattle, to &ldquo;hold his horses&rdquo; and watch the people and be glad they are there.  A cow has a common law right to use the road.</P>

      <P>She exceeds her common law rights very frequently, and most frequently in Donegal, in my <Col N="1474" /> experience.  The same thing applies to impatience outside churches. Motorists act in a disgraceful way at 11.30 on Sunday mornings when congregations are coming in and going out; they act as if they were on a lonely country road and expect to get through accordingly.  The same thing applies when school children are going home; and at six o'clock in the evening they are impatient with cyclists. It would be a good thing for the soul of the motorist if he had to wait, and good for his character, too.  The object of legislation should not be to make a straight streamline of everything so that people could travel as fast as they wished.</P>
      <P>I suggest that the punishment for motorists is far too small.  There should be more frequently the loss of licence for a period and, on second offence, loss of licence complete and entire.  The motor-car is an extremely dangerous weapon.  I do not know how to apply that rule to cyclists, but it should be done, too.  It would effect a wonderful improvement.</P>
      <P>One of the great troubles is the drunken driver.  That trouble is rampant and it seems clear to those who read newspapers that the defence for drunken driving is far too easy. Most extraordinary defences are made up.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>The motion deals with motoring generally.  I did not mention drink as I did not want to be specific.  There is no doubt that people drive out of Dublin to get as much drink as they can before a particular hour and, having taken all the drink they can hold, they get into cars to <Col N="1475" /> drive home.  That cannot be safe and no police force could supervise it.  The <i>bona fide</i> traffic should be abolished. It may involve a revision of hours in Dublin City.  Anyone who stands outside one of those places at closing time can see people stagger into cars.  That cannot be safe or reasonable.  There was a time when people were travellers, travelling in good faith and in need of refreshment, but with modern methods and modern social conditions, it has nothing at all to recommend it.  Abolition of the <i>bona fide</i> trade would effect a great improvement in safety on the roads.</P>
      <P>On the question of penalties, it is possible to kill a cyclist, do a period of imprisonment, come out and drive and drink again.  The slogan is: &ldquo;If you drink,&rdquo; don't driver if you drive, don't drink&rdquo;, but apparently it is difficult to prove a person is drunk.  Some motorists remind me of the characters in the old tales of Fionn MacCumhail and the Fianna&mdash;they seem to be under <i>geasa.</i></P>
      <P>One of the things that seem to be in the minds of Dublin motorists is never to allow anyone to turn to the right, to park, or delay for one moment, because when they are in cars, they want to go on themselves.  I feel that, since the majority of people are reasonable, and observe the rules of the road, the only thing we can do is to see that the minority, who are not reasonable, and who do not observe the rules, should be punished and put off the roads.  After all, a motor-car is nearly more dangerous than a loaded gun, which you have to load, cock, aim and discharge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is an Irish phrase which says: &ldquo;An té ná gabhann comhairle gabhadh sé comhrach; a man who will not take advice will have to take fight&rdquo;.  It seems to me that is the position of road users.  We ought to have reasonable rules clearly embodied in a code which should be available for everybody who drives a car.  Before they are allowed to drive cars, people should be tested on their knowledge of these rules, and if they break them, there should be drastic and swift <Col N="1476" /> punishment for doing so.  If that were done, the situation would be very much improved, because it cannot be improved by better roads; it cannot be improved by taking off corners, and letting people go faster; it cannot be improved by enforcing such rules.  The aim should be to make them clearly understood, and by seeing that the people who can drive know them.  I am aware, of course&mdash;I do not want to appear to be too harsh&mdash;that cyclists and pedestrians have defects. Even if they have defects, they should get more consideration than they are getting at this time.  If interest is stimulated, and if we can bring about a situation in which we can have a code, reasonably enforced, I think safety on the roads would follow.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGuire</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not a great deal to say.  It is seldom that we get an opportunity of speaking on this subject, and I would like to reinforce what Senator Hayes has said.  I was Just thinking motoring in to-night after having had something to eat, how long I had been driving myself.  I found that I had a driving licence for 38 years, so that I can remember quite a long time back.  I would say, thinking from the early days of motoring until to-day, that the most noticeable thing that has changed is the behaviour of the people on the roads.  In those days there was not only courtesy between motorists themselves, but also courtesy to other users of the roads&mdash;pedestrians, horses and all other users.  We all remember how hard it was to be truly courteous in the early days when motor-cars made a lot of noise.  In 1918 when horses were more extensively used in transport, the animals used to shy when meeting motor-cars, but there was a very high degree of courtesy amongst travellers.  As I drove in to-night, I thought that the thing most lacking to-day, apart from ignorance of road conditions, rules, and other things, was courtesy, as Senator Hayes quite rightly said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have often felt that, in this respect. <Col N="1477" /> we in this country have not displayed very much originality.  In matters, such as taxation, we have copied England very slavishly.  I would say, as regards road behaviour, something will have to be done about it.  If we could get hold of the English code, and read it.  it would have a very good effect. We do not have to go and write it down: it is there for us readymade.  It must be known in England like a catechism before people go through their driving tests. In this country, how can you have anything but the situation such as Senator Hayes spoke of to-night?  Here anybody can get a driving licence merely by putting down the money.</P>
    <P>I remember a man who came to me for a position as driver of a commercial van.  He had actually only one leg, which was slightly paralysed, one eye, and had some fingers blown off in the war.  Yet that man had a driving licence, and said he was capable of driving a delivery van.  Of course the thing was laughable.  Therefore, I suggest that the first thing we should do is to introduce a driving test which would involve reading the road code, understanding it, and at least knowing what should be done.  After all, how are people to do the right thing if they do not know what the right thing is?</P>
    <P>There is nothing in life that one learns instinctively.  If you do not know the rules, how can you observe them?  I venture to say that 98 per cent. of drivers in this country, good and bad, have never read the code of road rules.  They have merely picked up knowledge by their experiences and by hurting people&mdash;I do not mean physically&mdash;though they injure them mentally, by fright.  That is the way people learn to drive in this country to-day and if this is so, obviously we get the situation about which we have heard from Senator Hayes.  One of the first things which require to be done is to enforce the present traffic regulations more strictly.  Traffic regulations are not only for motorists; they are for everybody.  Motorists, cyclists and pedestrians, are all road users.  They have a duty to observe the rules of the <Col N="1478" /> road, and to make an orderly use of them.</P>
    <P>There are a few points I should like to mention.  One of these is the question of main and secondary roads. Senator Hayes is quite right when he says that people drive straight on to the main roads, and people using them every day know this is quite wrong. They drive straight on to the main roads and then find out what is coming; sometimes they are threequarters of the way across the road, at a most dangerous angle.  Danger is created thereby, and cannot be mitigated by travellers on the main road.  I would suggest that halt signs should be erected, as they are in England, and every motorist coming on to the main roads should be made observe them.</P>
    <P>There is an idea prevalent that slow drivers are, in fact, good drivers.  I think that slow drivers can be the biggest menace on the roads to-day, especially on roads which are narrow and carry a great volume of traffic.  I have seen them driving at 20 miles per hour or less, using the middle of the road, obviously causing danger and inconvenience to all the other road users.  It is no crime to hurry on the roads if you are driving properly.  I have seen business men, morning after morning, being driven in to town, while the driver smokes a pipe in front, and a great political conversation goes on all round.  A stream of traffic about a mile long comes behind them.  I would again suggest that it is the slow driver who is a menace on the roads: he is discourteous, and completely careless. Slow drivers who are careful and who do not smoke pipes keep well in to the left-hand side of the road, and leave it free for other users who are quite legitimately entitled to go faster about their business.</P>
    <P>Passing a slow driver is often taken as an insult to his vehicle, and he will not let you pass and he will keep out as far as he can on the middle of the road.  Even at night, he will switch on the headlights, and blind you.  These are the sort of things that are done. They are very great dangers on the road and anybody who drives in this country for the first time notices the <Col N="1479" /> slow driver on our main roads as a dangerous driver.</P>
    <P>There is then the question of signals and the position in this country is that the circumstances are often more dangerous when a signal is given than when it is not.  Very few people have any idea of what a signal is.  One sees a driver twirling his arm around in a circle and one does not know whether he is turning right, whether he wants you to pass or whether he is going right.  Usually, it is only a matter of a man knocking the ash off his cigarette. There is really no knowledge of signals here and it all comes back to a proper knowledge of the road code in relation to signals and courtesy.</P>
    <P>One thing which ought to be dealt with immediately by the police is driving with headlights in the city.  Headlights are a menace both in the city and in the country, if improperly used, and I suggest that, in our well lighted streets in Dublin and other cities and towns&mdash;but particularly in the cities&mdash; there is no need for headlights and their use should be prohibited.  We have had reference several times in debates here to the necessity for dimming lights on our main roads.  I not only agree with that, but I go further and suggest that we should adopt the Continental system of having coloured lights, yellow bulbs, in the headlights for use on main roads, because dimming on a main road can be as dangerous as not dimming, for the reason that one is taken from one extreme to another.  You get a very bright light coming against you and then suddenly the whole thing blacks out, whereas, if everybody had a medium light the whole time, there would be no necessity for this abrupt change from brightness to darkness.</P>
    <P>I heartily agree with Senator Hayes that there should be a complete prohibition on the use of horns at night, especially in the city.  We all remember what Paris was like in the old days.  The situation there was a joke and if they could do away with them in Paris, they could be done away with anywhere, and especially in Dublin.  It is really remarkable to see the difference <Col N="1480" /> in the whole city of Paris at night. The traffic is able to move just as fast and just as efficiently without the use of horns&mdash;in fact, more efficiently&mdash;as it did in the days of horns.  At that time, people thought that all they had to do was to blow the horn and everybody had to blow themselves off the road. Now people cannot blow them, so they have to use discretion and drive quietly and carefully.</P>
    <P>One other matter is the special responsibility of bus drivers.  A bus driver has a special responsibility for two reasons&mdash;the size of the vehicle he is driving which takes up so much space on the road and the lives of the passengers he is carrying.  He has a very great responsibility, and, although we have very many bus drivers in this city who are good, there are a great number now who do not seem to carry out the signalling regulations and do not pull in close enough to the kerb when pulling up to take on or put down passengers.  I know that driving a bus is very heavy work and that it is due to a form of laziness and tiredness. but, at the same time, bus drivers should pull their buses into the kerb every time they drop passengers or take them on, because they create traffic blocks and dangerous situations every time they stay out too far on the road.</P>
    <P>I hope that C.I.E. does insist on every bus driver knowing the code of the road, the rules of the road, because it would be absolutely suicidal that men in their position should go on the roads without a full knowledge of how to drive and the need for consideration for the safety of their passengers and people on the roads.  I agree that the solution of this whole problem is a test which involves a proper knowledge of how to drive with full regard for public safety and for the safety of the drivers themselves. The three things involved in good driving are knowledge of how to drive, courtesy, and people who are really courteous will naturally do the right things, and good sense.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamFearon" hpid="Professor Fearon Professor Fearon">
      <NameTxt>Professor Fearon</NameTxt>
      <P>In supporting this admirably enunciated motion, I should like to put forward a few points in <Col N="1481" /> relation to remedies for the conditions which the proposers and subsequent speakers have drawn to our notice. With regard to the suggestion that the present traffic regulations should be more stringently enforced, I do not think we require any further enforcement of the parking regulations, which seems to me to represent almost more than 100 per cent. efficiency.  I feel that the various other matters can be met by an immediate expansion of the motor cycle patrols which are doing an extremely valuable service.</P>
      <P>I believe that their institution was partly the result of representations made by our own Automobile Association of which, incidentally, I am not a member.  An expansion of the motorcycle patrols would, I believe, meet a great many of the difficulties which have already been emphasised&mdash; cyclists, careless motorists and so on. It would be a tremendous help to us to have some of these people available at peak periods in certain parts of the city and country and a corps of these officers would be of immense value at certain times when police supervision over certain areas is required.</P>
      <P>As to a driving test, the world is divided on the subject of driving tests, but I think the evidence is in favour of a driving test, using the word in a comprehensive sense.  I would test both the driver and the car.  Some drivers are very curious and some cars are very curious, and a car should be tested on the occasion of the initial driving test and subsequently when it is being insured.  Certainly, the way in which braking efficiency can deteriorate and lights and so forth become neglected means that it is essential to have a car examined from time to time.  You cannot carry on with it as you do with your own body, until something really goes wrong, because, in the case of a car, it will go wrong under sudden strain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is then this question of a driving code.  We require an explicit specified driving code and a copy of that code should be available for the original driving test and the would-be driver examined in the code.  He should also be examined in the rudiments <Col N="1482" /> of parking and a little bit of first-aid.  A copy of that driving code should be presented to each motorist on renewing his licence every year, so that the excuse would not be possible: &ldquo;I got a copy a few years ago but I left it in the bank for safety or I mislaid it.&rdquo;  He should get a fresh copy every year.  It is not going to cost very much but it will mean that he will have the thing in front of him as a code and will realise that it is his passport, if not actually to salvation, to preservation, while driving a car.  I would certainly enforce the claim for a driving test.</P>
    <P>Another point is in relation to assurance. I understand that some of the assurance companies are going to raise their tariffs.  We are compelled by law to insure cars and is there not a rather curious situation arising here, in that, as a result of financial changes, we are compelled to pay more in this roundabout way for something we are legally compelled to do?  I should like somebody to take that up and develop it with better knowledge of the subject than I have, but it seems to me to be very odd.</P>
    <P>With regard to speed limits, there is a lot to be said for the argument about the slow driver being a dangerous driver, but I feel that we could learn a good deal from studying traffic conditions in other countries.  The country I would suggest in this regard is a country, the people of which are so closely related to our own folk, people who, like us, are Celts&mdash;France.  You do get the cyclist in France riding in three directions simultaneously and yet you find that cyclist going through the traffic of Paris and surviving.  I think it would be very helpful if some of our officers went to study conditions in Paris and how to speed up traffic a little bit with safety, in addition, of course, to the study they are giving to the problem in America and in Britain. It is the wrong speed at a particular time which constitutes lack of safety.</P>
    <P>One trouble in safety I attribute to the change in our car taxation policy. As a result of this curious change we have developed the very small car which can only be driven comfortably at a high speed.  You have to drive at <Col N="1483" /> 35 or 45 miles an hour with some of these small cars and the result is that when I am crawling along in the morning these things are whizzing all around me.  It is really most exhilarating to see them chasing themselves at up to 55 miles an hour.  I suppose that every other day they collide and that when they do so they bounce.  I am not quite sure how they survive.  There is the danger of driving a small car that it has to go fast to get a comfortable range of speed.</P>
    <P>With regard to safety areas and speed limits, I do not think that they will solve the problem.  I think that an increase in the motor patrol system will help.  As the law is at present there is quite sufficient mechanism available for prosecuting for dangerous and careless driving without this awful difficulty of deciding when a speed limit is exceeded.</P>
    <P>Most certainly I think we ought to have pedestrian crossings.  It is rather difficult for the traveller going to Belfast to proceed to cross the road.  He sees a car or a bus coming towards him.  He is at a corner, he stops, the bus stops he looks at the bus driver, and the bus driver looks at him.  He raises his hat and the bus or the car raises its hat.  Then the other driver realises that he comes from Dublin where there are no such things as pedestrian rights and waves him on. We should have pedestrian crossings clearly marked, but should bring them in only one by one and see how they work.  If they do work you can have more of them, but let us begin with one or two.</P>
    <P>Senator Hayes pointed out his particular <i>bête noire.</i>  Mine is Westland Row, trying to get to the station and watching your train coming in and being unable to cross because of the stream of traffic.  I often think that the safest way to catch a train in Dublin is to miss the one that is going before it.  Let us have pedestrian crossings clearly marked for the motorist before he comes to them, beginning one by one, bit by bit, and working them up.  If it is found after a few months that we cannot train <Col N="1484" /> motorists and people into the use of pedestrian crossings, abandon them. but let us make a proper trial in the matter at first, until people get to know what the characteristic marking means.  It means that the pedestrian is the king, or, as we are a Republic, the President, at crossings.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to say anything on motor horns, but I have had experience of both sides of the matter referred to by Senator Hayes&mdash;when my horn would not work and I certainly qualified for the description of a slow driver, and on the other hand when my horn would not stop blowing and people inquired if I was doing it deliberately or was deaf.  I strongly support the motion and suggest that it should receive great consideration from the Minister.</P>

      <P>If we had known that this motion was to be followed by discussion this evening, we would have given it more consideration, although we have to admit that it has been on the Order Paper for quite a long time. It seems to me that the discussion so far has developed along the lines of the solution of the problem here in Dublin City.  No doubt the problem of traffic congestion and regulations here in Dublin is a very formidable one, so formidable that I would not like to attempt to deal with it here in any kind of constructive way.  I do not think that I could.  But we must consider this problem from the point of view of the country as a whole.  I suppose it must be admitted that the time has come when it would be wise to have a re-examination of the traffic problem from the point of view of the country as a whole.  I am however, afraid that in a discussion like this all we can do is to touch on the fringe of the problem.  After all we must remember that the rights and privileges of the public are involved in this matter, and, that being so, it is a subject that should not be lightly dealt with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was thinking myself in connection with this problem that it might be a good thing to set up a committee or a commission which would examine it very carefully, the membership of <Col N="1485" /> which would be composed of people of long experience.  After all we have been dealing here to-day and last week with a measure, the Factories Bill, where the rights and the safety of a certain section of the people were involved.  In dealing with that the Dáil in its wisdom set up a Select Committee to examine it.  I think it must be admitted that the problem we have here of road traffic, either here in the City of Dublin or on the country roads, is no less important than the problem of safeguarding the factory workers, because this problem applies to the community as a whole.</P>
    <P>From listening to this debate and to the remarks of other people on other occasions it would seem to me that the motorist is always looked upon as the villain of the piece.  At least it would appear that the greatest fault is ascribed to him in connection with the non-fulfilment of the road regulations. I doubt if that approach to the problem is the proper one, because very often to my own knowledge the pedestrians crossing the streets here in Dublin and sometimes crossing the roads in the country are more remiss than the motorists.  While I know very well that there are motorists abroad who certainly, to say the least of them, are not careful enough, still maybe it should be admitted that the vast majority of those in charge of cars are careful enough.</P>

      <P>As Senator Professor Hayes said in his opening speech, in a case like this it is always a small minority that creates the problem.  But how to deal with that small minority is another question.  Driving tests have been mentioned here.  I do not know if I would be so much in favour of them.  I would, of course, be entirely in favour of a driving test if I thought it would remove even a small proportion of the dangers with which the public are confronted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my view many of the accidents that occur in this country could be laid at the door of the experienced drivers who think that, because they are experienced, <Col N="1486" /> they can do what they like with their cars.  The person who is not experienced is generally more careful and more circumspect as regards his own safety and the safety of the general public.  I cannot for the life of me see how the application of a driving test would get over the problem we are discussing this evening.  Of course, I know very well that they have this driving test in countries such as Britain, for example.  I should like to know whether it would be asserted by the authorities over there that the application of the driving test has improved, the driving position there very much.  We have no evidence of that here&mdash;no evidence whatsoever.</P>
    <P>The question of speed limits has been mentioned and I am in agreement with those who say that in their opinion the enforcement of a speed limit would not remove the dangers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>Even in passing through cities or towns?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonKissane" hpid="Mr. Kissane Mr. Kissane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kissane</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a different thing.  I was about to come to that. Generally speaking, I do not think that the enforcement of a speed limit would improve the position very much, if at all, but I would be entirely in favour of a speed limit within a built-up area of any considerable size.  We should bear these two things in mind, the enforcement of a speed limit generally or the enforcement of a speed limit for built-up areas in cities, towns and villages.  Let us consider that.</P>
      <P>I would be in favour of the enforcement of a speed limit as regards cities. towns and even villages.  If we went as far as that for the time being, it would not be bad.  As Senator Hayes said, parking regulations were not mentioned in this motion and I do not know whether we are at liberty to mention them or not.  I daresay we are in passing.  I suppose parking regulations would come under the general heading of traffic regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>You could not park <i>en passant.</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonKissane" hpid="Mr. Kissane Mr. Kissane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kissane</NameTxt>
      <P>My experience is that there are no parking regulations in provincial towns.  I am not speaking <Col N="1487" /> about Dublin.  We have to get away from Dublin because there are other parts of the country besides Dublin about which we want to speak.  It is a common sight to see in those provincial towns two lines of motor-cars on both sides of the street.  Sometimes it is next to impossible for a passing motorist to make his way through. Quite recently I spoke to an officer of the Garda Síochána about that, and, of course, he told me he had nothing to do with the matter; that if he went to do anything an order would have to be made by the local authority.</P>
      <P>I suppose that before any traffic regulations can be made an order to that effect has to be made by the local authority.  This officer told me that in his opinion if he applied to the local authority for the making of such an order his case would be turned down. I do not know whether it would or not. The officer said that in any case no accidents occurred in places like that because the people have to stop.  If the principle were applied in every case that in order to avoid an accident you would have to stop, that you could not go on, everything would be all right.</P>
      <P>I think it was Senator McGuire who mentioned bus drivers.  My experience of bus drivers is that they are the most careful people on the roads and if everybody in charge of a motor vehicle exercised the same care, the same diligence and the same patience as the bus driver we would have very few accidents but I am afraid that we cannot say the same about some lorry drivers.  Some of our lorry drivers are in a completely different category in so far as the safety of the road is concerned. My own experience is that there are many lorry drivers on the road to-day who should not be on it. Because they happen to be in charge of a powerful vehicle, they think they can ride roughshod over everybody else on the road.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the rule of the road which is supposed to prevent people from coming out of a by-road or a secondary road on to a main road, the greatest offenders against that <Col N="1488" /> important rule of the road are the lorry drivers sometimes.  I should like to draw a clear distinction between bus drivers and lorry drivers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>And motor-cyclists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonKissane" hpid="Mr. Kissane Mr. Kissane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kissane</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to take this opportunity of paying a compliment to the bus drivers of this country but I am afraid I must stop there as far as some of the lorry drivers are concerned. Senator Hayes referred, if I understood him rightly, to the inadequacy of the penalties that are sometimes imposed for breaches of the traffic regulations.  I think he is right. Sometimes the penalties are too trivial and the drivers in question know they can do the same thing again with a certain amount of impunity.</P>
      <P>Take the case of a person who is brought to court on a charge of dangerous driving.  In the majority of such cases the charge of dangerous driving is reduced to one of careless driving.  In fact, my experience has been that a charge of dangerous driving is hardly ever sustained unless there has been an accident.  In the absence of an accident, the charge, as I have said, is almost invariably reduced to one of careless driving.</P>
      <P>Reference has been made to drunken drivers.  They are in a category all to themselves, and I do not think I should spend very much time on them because they are specifically dealt with in the Road Traffic Act of 1933, and in all cases under that Act their licences are suspended for 12 months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. P. O'Donnell Mr. P. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>A minimum of 12 months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonKissane" hpid="Mr. Kissane Mr. Kissane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kissane</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the law.  I propose to make a statement which may be regarded as extraordinary.  It is, that I regard the driver who is not drunk at all but who comes out from a by-road on to cross a main road, without any regard whatever for oncoming traffic, as a greater menace than the drunken driver.  I had an experience of that myself.  I was driving along a road when a man came out from a by-road on to a main road. He did not look either to the left or <Col N="1489" /> to the right, so that I was put to the pin of my collar to avoid him.  I did not know whether to go in front of him or behind him.  He was travelling slowly and I did not know whether his car was going to gather momentum or what was going to happen.  There you had the case of a person doing the thing consciously, crossing a road and offering himself as a menace to oncoming traffic.</P>
      <P>There is another point.  Sometimes people, when they are about to turn at a crossing, will put out their hand. Other people have on their cars what we call trafficators.  I think the time has come when there should be an obligation on everyone driving a car to have a trafficator because sometimes, when you see a person putting out his or her hand, it is done so halfheartedly that you do not know what the intention is.  In the case of the trafficator, there can be no doubt whatever. That is a suggestion which I think is worthy of consideration.</P>
      <P>We have been discussing this problem from the point of view of the motorist and the pedestrian, but there is another problem which seems to me to call for attention.  On this I propose to refer to country roads and not to Dublin City.  I refer to the problem of wandering animals.  Some time ago that problem got great attention, but somehow lately I think there has been a little bit of relaxation as regards the vigilance exercised in the case of wandering animals.  The greatest offenders are the itinerants who come along with a string of piebald ponies.  Nobody seems to take the least notice of them, but they are a proper menace.</P>

      <P>Whether it is popular or not, I think I should mention it in connection with this problem.  In conclusion, I want to say again that this problem is so involved in its nature that all we can do this evening is to have a kind of rambling discussion on it.  If that will do any good we shall not have wasted our time.  I would suggest again that a Select Committee <Col N="1490" /> be set up&mdash;I would have to think over what the nature of it would be&mdash;to examine how and to what extent the laws as they exist at present should be amended for the further safety of the people of the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to preface my remarks by saying how much I welcome a motion such as this. We have had a few such motions within the past few years.  They are valuable I think not only because of the points of view expressed by those taking part in the debate but also because they focus the attention of the public on such matters.  Road safety is something of which we should all be conscious. Discussions of this kind tend to focus the attention of the public on it.  For these reasons, I welcome the motion.</P>
      <P>We are very fortunate that, so far, the increase in the incidence of road accidents is lagging behind the increase in road traffic.  We are all aware of the increased traffic on our roads, but, thank God, there has not been a corresponding increase in accidents.</P>
      <P>Senator Fearon referred to the necessity for a traffic code, and said that copies of it should be distributed to applicants for drivers' licences so as to ensure that when they had procured their copies they would not lock them up in the safe for safety.  I am afraid from what I have heard some Senators say here this evening that they have been locking up the traffic code in their safes.  There is such a code which is known as the General Bylaws of the Control of Traffic of 1937 made by the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána. I might also mention that illustrated booklets have been published from time to time and issued to every licensed driver, setting out, in simple language, the main rules of the road. Every driver, at some stage or other, has got these leaflets.  I think it was Senator Burke who said that he had never heard of them.  I think it was in 1952 that the then Minister not only exhibited them in the Seanad but read extracts from them.  Some Senators may have locked them in their safes.</P>

      <P>It is not right to suggest that the traffic regulations and the Road Traffic Act are not being enforced.  Any lawyer with experience of our courts of summary jurisdiction knows they are cluttered up with road traffic prosecutions.

      <P>I am not concerned with the motorist now but with the enforcement of the law.  That shows vigilance on the part of the Gardaí. I live in rural Ireland and have had some experience of prosecutions in the district courts.  I know the Gardaí are vigilant in enforcing traffic laws in rural Ireland.  It is difficult to have a Garda stand at each corner in Dublin to prosecute people for breaking the law.  There is an onus on the citizen himself when he sees the law being broken.  There is a word I do not like to use but which we should accept, that of &ldquo;common informer&rdquo;&mdash;one should report cases and become a State witness.  That is the only way we can protect ourselves, as we cannot have a Garda on every half mile of the Bray road or other main arteries.</P>
      <P>Taking the second part of the motion, the first two proposals, regarding driving tests and speed limits, involve amendment of the Road Traffic Act of 1933.  We would require to amend the law to deal with either of those things.  Proposals for the amendment of the Act are at present being examined by the Departments concerned and I hope that in due course a Road Traffic Bill will be presented to the Oireachtas for consideration. When it is being drafted, I hope the suggestions made here this evening will be borne in mind and examined carefully and if possible incorporated in the Bill.  It would not be proper for me at this stage to anticipate Government decisions on the question of driving tests or speed limits.  Those decisions will be embodied in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some Senator referred to Press reports of prosecutions in district courts.  As one with some experience of the courts, I can assure the House that Press reports are often very, very misleading and sometimes <i>viva voce</i> evidence is misleading and in contradiction of what actually is said immediately after the accident when the <Col N="1494" /> facts are fresh in the minds of the parties concerned.</P>
    <P>May I tell the House, with your permission, a Leas-Chathaoirleach, a story which circulated in legal circles some few years ago when the Road Traffic Act first became law here?  An old gentleman, a pedestrian down the country, was plaintiff in an action for damages against a motorist.  He gave his evidence: he said he was proceeding along the road, driving his cow and on the proper side, when a car suddenly came around the corner, crashed into himself and the cow and so seriously injured the cow that she had to be destroyed and he himself suffered severe personal damages and pain. This story was a very convincing one as told to the court, until counsel for the defence got up to cross-examine him and said: I have only two questions to ask the plaintiff, my lord: &ldquo;Did you have a conversation with the driver of the car immediately after the accident?&rdquo;  He said he did.  &ldquo;And the facts were then fresh in your mind?&rdquo;&ldquo;They were.&rdquo;  And did you tell the driver of the car that you were not injured in any way?&rdquo;&ldquo;I did.&rdquo; Counsel for the defence sat down and his lordship immediately sat up and asked: &ldquo;How can you reconcile the story you have told to-day with the story you told the Guard immediately after the accident?&rdquo;  He said: &ldquo;My lord, would you allow me to explain? I was driving along the road with my cow, on the proper side.  The car came around the corner very fast and knocked the two of us into the ditch. I was semi-conscious.  I heard the driver get out and examine the cow and then say to his companion, &lsquo;She is very bad.&rsquo;  They went back to the car and took out a shotgun and shot her.  Then they walked to me and asked: &lsquo;Are you all right?&rsquo;  and I said I was.&rdquo;  One can readily understand from Press reports how evidence, on occasions, may be misleading, and it requires a very learned judge to find out on which side the truth is, and who is right.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to go into the merits of the driving test.  There may be a number of methods by which a driver may be examined.  Somebody has suggested <Col N="1495" /> that, in addition to the driver being examined, his car should also be examined.  One can imagine three or four members of a family who can drive a car, and every time, before one of them can get a driver's licence, he must present the old &ldquo;tin lizzy&rdquo; for inspection.  Who is going to examine the car?  Is it an official of the county council?  Who is going to examine the applicants for a driver's licence?  Is it a doctor?  The applicant may have only one eye, or he may have poor vision in the other.  Who is going to do the driving test?  Somebody suggested a proper medical test, and a proper examination in the regulations laid down, and that the old &ldquo;tin lizzy&rdquo; should be annually checked over.  I do not wish to anticipate the decision of the Government in these matters.  As I have said, that decision will be embodied in a Bill.  I hope that its introduction will not be too far away.</P>
    <P>In this motion the making of speed limits is proposed.  At present, I can fix a speed limit for a particular area only.  I can fix it only for a particular area, after having held a local public inquiry.  One can appreciate that it would mean considerable expense holding local public inquiries in every little town or village, as to whether there should be a speed limit, or otherwise. The motion proposes that this requirement of an inquiry should be dropped. To do so would spare local authorities a certain amount of expense, but would involve that persons and organisations vitally affected by a local speed limit would be precluded from having their case heard publicly and openly.  A more comprehensive amendment of the law on the subject has been proposed on a number of occasions, namely, that there should be an automatic speed limit in all built-up areas, in the same way as there is in Great Britain.  It is undoubtedly true that speed is an important factor in accidents, particularly in relation to their severity.  The ideal solution is that vehicles should be driven at a speed appropriate to the circumstances.</P>
    <P>Under Section 50 of the Road Traffic Act, 1933, it is an offence for a person <Col N="1496" /> to drive without exercising reasonable consideration for others and under Section 51, to drive at a speed or in a manner which is dangerous.  Section 50 makes it an offence for a person who drives a vehicle in public to drive without exercising reasonable consideration for others.  Such a person is guilty of an offence under this section, and is liable on summary conviction therefor, to a fine not exceeding £10.  There is a section governing speed, be it fast or slow, so long as it is in a manner dangerous to individuals or to other vehicles using the roadway.  Possibly it could be amended by an amending section in a new Bill.  A man could be charged under Section 51, as Senator Kissane, I think, pointed out.  He could be charged under that section, and the justice might convict on Section 50.</P>
    <P>As to the second part of the motion dealing with pedestrian crossings and major and minor roads, the rights of pedestrians at crossings are set out in the general by-laws for the Control of Traffic, 1937, made by the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána, as are the rights and duties of vehicle users in respect of junctions between minor and major roads.</P>
    <P>Familiarity breeds contempt.  Every Senator who spoke this evening requested us to introduce legislation dealing with pedestrian crossings, and also with the major and minor roads. We have spent some time discussing anticipated legislation, but we have the law there since 1937.  Whether it was that cars were laid up and were off the roads during the war, we appear to have forgotten what the law is.  Regulations are laid down which distinguish major and minor roads. These were made in 1937, and they were published in the General By-Laws for the Control of Traffic 1937.  If Senators could purchase that little booklet, they would find that out and it would save me the trouble of explaining it.  I am afraid that I my self do not remember how they are distinguished, but it is set out in the regulations.</P>

      <P>There is the difficulty that it is expensive.  It would mean holding local public inquiries for every village and town in Ireland, and this would be absolutely impossible.  I have already taken steps to amend the law in certain respects.  Senators will recollect that last week, or the week before, we spent considerable time discussing a Bill known as the Local Government Bill, 1954, now the Act of 1955.  Section 36 of that Act, which has just been enacted, proposes to remove the various defects in Section 69, following which it will be open to the Minister for Local Government to make appropriate regulations regarding roadway markings and road signs.  These regulations will be made as soon as possible, and there will be no legal limits on the Garda authorities in their efforts to enforce better order at pedestrian crossings, and at junctions of major and minor roads. That particular section was intended to amend the old section in the 1946 Act.  I shall now be able to make regulations for the entire country, and that, in my opinion, will meet many of the points raised here this evening.</P>

      <P>The making of regulations in themselves will not supply the full answer to the problems which most of all require consideration. We must depend upon the individual road user to use his discretion.  That is very essential.  Courtesy is something which we cannot write into a regulation or an Act.  Courtesy is something which we must practise and something which we must be taught. Having been taught courtesy, we must put it into practice, and the only place in which it can be taught is the national school.</P>
      <P>As to the concluding paragraph of the motion, I think that reference to Section 13 of the Road Traffic Act of 1933, and, in particular, a reference to paragraphs (f) and (g) of sub-section (1), will show that there is sufficient legislation in regard to the use of motor horns at present.  I wonder are we all aware of the law governing motor horns?  Senator Hayes has described to us his drive from Dungarvan to Dublin without one. Every mile he travelled he committed an offence.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. P. O'Donnell Mr. P. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>However, in the Road Traffic Act of 1933, there is ample legislation as to the use of horns. Everyone will agree that a motor horn is a very necessary instrument on a motor vehicle and sub-section (3) of the section I have referred to actually requires the Minister to provide in any regulations made by him for the compulsory carrying of such an instrument on every motor vehicle.  What is objected to is the abuse of the motor horn, and I feel that that has been <Col N="1499" /> adequately dealt with in the regulations made.  I cannot do better than quote Regulation 65, sub-section (2) of the Mechanically Propelled Vehicles (Construction, Equipment and Use) Order, 1934, which reads:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;No person shall use or permit to be used any instrument provided on a vehicle for the purpose of giving audible warning, whether the vehicle is or is not in motion, except when such use is reasonably necessary on grounds of safety.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I do not know what the experience in the City of Dublin is, but I know that down the country we very often have a number of prosecutions brought under these regulations and I will tell you a case in which one of these prosecutions arises.  A hackney driver goes to a dance with a number of passengers and, when the dance is over and he is anxious to get home, one or two of the passengers cannot be found.  He sets off then blowing the horn and keeps blowing until the passengers turn up, with the result that all the people sleeping in that village are aroused and have lost their night's sleep.  The Guards are rather vigilant, however, in this respect now and a number of these gentlemen have been prosecuted in recent years, although the law has been in force since 1934. I may add that neither my Department nor the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána has received any representations which would suggest that the existing law is inadequate.</P>
      <P>In conclusion, may I say that I welcome this discussion?  Every suggestion made will be carefully examined by me when I come to make the regulations under the 1955 Act and I shall also put forward to the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána a request that he will carefully consider the suggestions made in relation to the regulations with which he is concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>While we welcome a discussion on a matter of this kind, I think there are very few Senators who will be prepared to support every item set out in this motion.  The subject, of course, is a very important one and, while it is no harm to introduce a little <Col N="1500" /> humour into it, it is nevertheless a matter of very serious import for everybody. We have been told repeatedly by speakers here about how far advanced the British and people of other countries are in regard to the road code and in regard to regulations governing road traffic and motor traffic.  Yet, at the same time, we read in the English newspapers that slaughter on the roads in that country is increasing year by year and has reached terrifying proportions, so I think it will be accepted that no amount of legislating alone will protect our people.  What is needed perhaps more than anything else is a change of mentality in regard to this whole matter.  I was particularly interested in a reference to bus drivers. Some Senator referred to them as being careless and discourteous and guilty of every road offence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>The point I want to make is that my experience of bus drivers, and not alone bus drivers but the employees of C.I.E. generally, is that they are very careful&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>Their record is a praiseworthy one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>For the purpose of the argument I propose to use, I should be very anxious to hear the record, because my feeling is that we will never curb accidents on the roads until those who use motor vehicles become really safety-conscious.  I believe there are no people using the roads at present who are as safety-conscious as the drivers of C.I.E., and particularly the bus drivers.  If the record shows that they have fewer accidents in proportion to the mileage of road they travel than any other section of the community, it would confirm the viewpoint <Col N="1501" /> I hold that, if people were educated really to fear having an accident, we would be making some progress.</P>
      <P>I think that if we could get a comparison of the number of accidents in proportion to the mileage travelled in the case of that section of the community&mdash;the drivers of C.I.E.&mdash;we would find that they have a better record than the average motorist, and that is not saying much.  I think it would go to prove that the most essential and important thing is to create a spirit of safety-consciousness amongst those who use vehicles on the road, and I should say that the reason you have careful drivers of C.I.E. buses is perhaps not entirely because good drivers are recruited, but that every driver knows that he will suffer a severe penalty if he is involved in even a minor accident and even if he is not the guilty party.  I have had the experience of seeing bus drivers on country roads violently angry because some foolish person pulled a horse against the side of a bus and damaged it slightly.  The reason why the man was so angry in the particular case was that it was something he would have to explain and something which might be used against him.</P>
      <P>Every driver of the C.I.E. buses is, therefore, particularly aware of that position, and particularly anxious to avoid even the type of accident in which he would not be by any means the guilty party.  If the same attitude of mind was adopted by all other road users we would have a definite improvement.  We cannot, of course, get away from ordinary human frailty or what might be described as the unguarded moment in everybody's life. We had a case some years ago, a very tragic one, of a bus driver in England who was to receive a medal for good driving for over 30 years, and who on the eve of receiving it was involved in a most deplorable accident in which a number of children were killed by the bus.  No matter how careful we are, now and then there will be some unfortunate accident, but the percentage can be very greatly reduced if everybody is endeavouring to avoid such misfortunes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What we should aim at is not so <Col N="1502" /> much to have a lot of penalties imposed which very few people can remember and which perhaps they might not wish to remember.  It would be far better instead of that to try to build up a spirit of consciousness of the gravity and seriousness of driving a fast-moving vehicle on the road.  In this connection it will be remembered that immediately after the emergency, when cars were coming back on the roads, the Department of Local Government initiated what might be described as a road safety publicity campaign.  It was very widely publicised, I think, in 1947.  An attempt was made at that time to build up a feeling of consciousness of the dangers of road traffic.  If I remember rightly the person mainly responsible for that was Deputy Childers, who at that time occupied the position of Parliamentary Secretary.  It was rather a pity that that campaign was not continued and intensified for at least a longer period, although sometimes arising out of it some amusing things did happen.  I remember that at that time there was a slogan on the windows of cars: &ldquo;I am taking care, will you?&rdquo;  I recall going into a garage and seeing a car which was battered almost out of all recognition and which hardly could be described as a car, but it bore this slogan: &ldquo;I am taking care, will you?&rdquo; Apparently somebody either did not see the slogan or did not observe it, whether it was the driver or somebody else I do not know.  It would be no harm if that type of publicity and propaganda, if you like, was continued and intensified.</P>
    <P>The Minister made one remark in particular which to some extent interested me.  He said that steps are being taken in regard to the definition of major roads.  He pointed out, I think to Senator L'Estrange, that there is a distinct regulation in regard to that matter.  If you are travelling on a country road and come to a crossing it is always very difficult to know which of the two country roads is the major road.  Both are of equal status. Both are county roads and there is no means by which anyone can define which is the major road.  I think it would not be serving any useful purpose if some regulations were to be <Col N="1503" /> made by the Department of Local Government setting out certain roads as being major roads.  The real solution would be for the county council or the local authority to put a sign on every crossing.  It does not really matter which of the two roads is the more important.  All that matters is that the county council or local authority has defined one of them as being the more important road.</P>
    <P>Then it is up to the motorist to accept the road from Ballymacracken to Ballydehob, which might appear to be as important as the road from Ballygobackwards to Ballinamuck, as not being the major road.  It would be impossible for the motorist to make up his mind as to which was the more important of the two roads, until somebody in charge such as the local authority will decide, and having decided it it would be necessary to have a clearly marked sign at the crossing.  There would be no use in the motorist being aware even that there was a certain regulation governing this matter.  It would serve no useful purpose if any cars collided for the driver of one of them to know that there was such a regulation.  That is one matter which the county councils should take in hands.  No matter where the two roads cross, one of them should be declared to be the major road and recognised as such, so that motorists would observe their obligation to slow down when coming out from the other road.  At the present time there is a substantial change in regard to the matter of road making.  Most roads are being resurfaced with tar and motorists are inclined to think that they are on a major road whereas in actual fact any other county road crossing such a road would be of equal importance.  This is a matter which local authorities should be instructed to take up at once.</P>
    <P>Another matter is the removal of blind turns.  I do not suggest that big widening operations should be undertaken wherever two roads intersect. All that is needed is to remove the boundary or fence and give motorists a view of the other road so that at least they will see the traffic approaching the particular corner. <Col N="1504" /> It is strange in view of the many accidents which occur that there is not a greater outcry in regard to unprotected quays and harbours.  Local authorities should be instructed to provide some protective boundary or guard wherever there is a waterway adjoining the road surface.  There is no justification whatever for leaving quays and harbours unprotected.  The cost of affording some protection by way of railing or chain or other barrier would not be prohibitive, and many lives would be saved.  Anyone who has knowledge of such accidents knows that it is utterly impossible for a motorist driving at night to know where the road ends and the waterway begins.  Thus in the case of canals and harbours many serious accidents are caused.</P>
    <P>I do not think that the type of suggestion contained in this motion will solve the problem.  I do, however, agree that there is need for greater improvement in vehicles using the roads and for a check-up on the braking system, the lighting system and the steering system of cars.  Very many accidents are caused through defective brakes.  Anybody driving a car should at least be able to pull it up within a reasonable time whether the car is being driven at a fairly high speed or not.  But there are many cars which cannot be stopped in a reasonable time.  Some cars, particularly of pre-war vintage, some of the old Fords, which cannot be worn out, never had a very effective braking system, and some of them even when driven at a comparatively low speed are exceedingly dangerous.  That is a question to which attention should be given.</P>
    <P>If you have a system of patrolling the roads by the Gardaí, attention should be given to the question as to whether the braking system on cars is sufficiently effective to bring the cars to a standstill within a reasonable time.  We hear particularly from people with very good cars and more from city people than from country people complaints about the defective dimming lights on cars.  I think that this is a matter more for the motor manufacturers and garage owners than it is for the actual motorists.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1505" /> On many makes of cars the dimming system is very ineffective, particularly on lorries.  Pressure should be brought to bear upon the manufacturers of cars to provide some solution to this problem.  It may be that the suggestion in regard to the provision of coloured glass on cars would be a good one but certainly there are very many cars on which the dimming is completely defective.  When the lights are dimmed on such cars, they are even more dangerous than if the full headlights were on.  That is true also in regard to driving on a smooth surface on a wet night when the dimmed lights thrown against the road, are reflected and are just as dazzling as if the full headlights were on.</P>
    <P>I think that the two solutions of the problem are to make our people more safety conscious and get our car and motor manufacturers to improve the lighting and braking systems on their particular type of vehicle.  I believe that even more effective brakes should be provided if the speeds at present operating are to be sanctioned by law. I am not going to express any opinion as to whether there should be a speed limit or not.</P>
    <P>I think it would be impossible to operate a speed limit on roads in general.  It might be desirable to have such a speed limit in built-up areas.  In this connection there are many towns in regard to which proposals for speed limits are considered but are turned down by the local people or the local representatives on the ground that it might to some extent deflect some traffic from coming through the particular towns if a speed limit was introduced.  I do not think a speed limit alone will go very far towards a solution of this problem.  It is a human problem and a mechanical problem and we have got to reform both the motorists and the cars in general.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DominickMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>This motion is rightly divided into two parts and I may say that I attach a lot of importance to the first part which expresses the opinion that the present traffic regulations should be more strictly enforced.  I think the very fact that this motion was put down is symptomatic of the <Col N="1506" /> general uneasiness amongst the citizens at the present time in regard to the enforcement of traffic regulations.</P>
      <P>Indeed, we have been told by the Minister that we, Senators, are particularly ignorant in regard to the traffic regulations; that there are plenty of laws enacted by us and our predecessors about which we know very little.  That is quite true but I think the fault must he with the Department concerned.  It is not very much use passing laws unless the people affected by them know of the laws and know that when they are transgressed there should be prosecutions as an example to the transgressors and potential transgressors.</P>
      <P>In Dublin recently we had the introduction of the courtesy cops.  Then we had those high-speed Garda cars cruising around.  I may say that I, in common with most people, expected that we would see an improvement in, the traffic conditions in Dublin.  I am afraid that, apart from a slight improvement for a couple of weeks, things have gone back to their original very low level.</P>
      <P>I have often been a pedestrian and a motorist, in Belfast.  I have often wondered, when I go to Belfast, what is the difference between the regulations and their enforcement in Belfast and in Dublin.  I do not think that there are more R.U.C. men per head of the population or per motorist in Belfast than there are Gardaí in Dublin, but it is a definite fact&mdash;and Senator Cogan can be convinced of this&mdash; that courtesy on the roads, the enforcement and the recognition of regulations are at a far higher level in the northern city than they are here.  I think the general unease in regard to traffic regulations is confined more to Dublin than anywhere else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Motorists, cyclists and pedestrians are always criticising the chaotic traffic conditions in our capital city.  It is said that when you become a motorist you automatically blame the cyclist for every offence, I am afraid I must express the opinion that the cyclists are the greatest offenders in Dublin. For some weeks I noticed a Garda standing a few feet out in the roadway directing cyclists to keep within so <Col N="1507" /> many feet of the sidewalk.  That practice has apparently been dropped and cyclists again wander out over the roadway, cycling four and five abreast, to the danger of themselves and of motorists.  Another favourite pastime of cyclists which, apparently, goes uncorrected is that of darting out from side roads and cycling for some time on the wrong side of a main road.</P>
    <P>Nobody likes saying it, but I think it is the general opinion that the traffic regulations, apart altogether from not being well known, are not being enforced in this city and, to a certain extent, in the remainder of the country. One could hardly travel a mile along the streets without seeing half a dozen traffic offences.  I am not speaking now of parking offences, which are more against the convenience of other road users, but rather of the more serious offences against the safety of a driver or the cyclist himself and other road users.  The regulations are not being enforced, and I wonder why that is.  We thought that, when the strength of the Garda Síochána had been increased by the new recruits, we would see a more general enforcement of the regulations.  I hope I am wrong, but it is my opinion that we have not seen the improvement which we had expected and which I think we were all hoping for.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will have regard to the points made about the enforcement of the traffic regulations.  Despite what he says about all the laws that are there at the moment or the regulations which are going to be issued later or the point that he made that out of 131,000 prosecutions, 102,000 were traffic offences, I think that the fact that this motion was put down and has been debated shows that we are all convinced that there is not sufficient enforcement of the present traffic regulations.  In my opinion the first part of the motion is the more important because it does seem a bit silly that we should call for more laws and more regulations if we cannot observe and have enforced the existing regulations.</P>
    <P>A lot of the faults of road users have been stressed here this evening. <Col N="1508" /> I do not want to go over all that has been said, but I should like to stress a few points.  The first is in regard to the driving and operation of road lorries.  The point was made by various Senators that the bus drivers in public transport and the lorry drivers in public transport were careful and courteous, and were generally the best road users in the Republic.  I think that is a fact, and that it is due to two things.  First of all, the campaign in public transport for safety, with the co-operation, I think, of the Safety First Association, draws the attention of the employees concerned to the desirability of safety.  The fact that they may get a medal, or some presentation, for so many years' safe driving, is not to my mind the real reason why they are safety conscious but rather to the fact that their attention is drawn to it, and that they take a pride in having a safe driving record. That is one of the reasons why they are amongst the best drivers in the country.</P>
    <P>The second reason why they are amongst the best drivers is the fact that their vehicles are properly maintained. I want to say definitely that the same cannot be said about other lorries which operate on our roadways. They operate to the danger of other road users and to the expense, I would suggest, of other road users.  Every Senator, I am sure, has had the experience of meeting these lorries on the roads overloaded, not mechanically maintained, defective in a lot of case and probably driven by men on duty since early morning and returning to the ends of Ireland well past midnight That is happening every day of the week.  The drivers are to be pitied.</P>
    <P>It is a fact that the lorries are generally overloaded and not properly maintained. Senators may have had the experience of driving behind these lorries.  Usually, it is difficult to pass them.  They must have seen them, by reason of the fact that the lorries are overloaded, churning up the roads. Some of them may be carrying road materials.  I have often smiled at the contradiction of these lorries carrying road materials and at the same time churning up and breaking up the roadways <Col N="1509" /> already there.  That certainly helps to keep them in employment.  I think that the regulations already there in regard to the loading, driving and maintenance of freight lorries are not being observed or enforced.  I would say that there is a need for a tightening up and probably for an improvement in regard to the regulations generally.</P>
    <P>Another subject which was touched on was our old friend the drunken driver.  I think I read a statement made recently by the Minister for Justice to the effect that anybody whose licence was taken away on conviction for driving while drunk need not appeal to him for its restoration. I think that all of us, on all sides of the House, would like to congratulate the Minister on making such a statement. We all condemn the drunken driver and would uphold the policy of declining to restore a licence to people condemned of these murderous offences.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect of road safety to which I would like to refer. <Col N="1510" /> I had an experience of it myself lately. That is the practice of allowing animals to stray on the roads.  I had the ghastly experience, lately, of coming on an accident on one of our main western roads.  It occurred to a young girl who had been travelling as a passenger in a car.  In the dark the car crashed into a donkey which had been left wandering on the road.  The girl was unconscious and apparently nobody knew who owned the donkey. It was unfortunate for the donkey&mdash;he was dead.  I would have liked to get hold of the owner.  Too often donkeys and cattle are allowed to stray on the road.  I remember that in my youth, when there were far fewer cars on the road, it was a very serious offence and the Gardaí were continually after people who allowed their cattle to stray on the road.  I move the adjournment of the debate.</P>
