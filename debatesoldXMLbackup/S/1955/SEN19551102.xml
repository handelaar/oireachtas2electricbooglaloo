      <P>We shall take business Nos. 1 and 2, as on the Order Paper.  The first business in the Dáil to-day is the Imposition of Duties (Confirmation of Orders) (No. 2) Bill which, it is presumed, will be passed to-day and will probably be certified a Money Bill.  That must be taken by the Seanad within seven days.  I suggest to the House, therefore, that, having completed No. 2 on the Order Paper, we might leave over until Wednesday next this Money Bill&mdash; assuming that we get it&mdash;and on that day, next Wednesday, do the motion in the name of Senator Patrick Crowley, if that is convenient.</P>
      <P>Agreed.</P>

      <P>As a means towards protecting and developing the Irish woollen weaving industry imports of woollen and worsted piece goods have, since 1935, been prohibited, except under licence, under the Control of Imports (Quota No. 13) Order, 1935.  Printed fabrics are not produced by the Irish mills, and accordingly there is an exemption in the quota for such fabrics. Within the past year it came to light <Col N="458" /> that a cloth was on offer to the trade here which had been specially prepared to evade the quota.  This cloth had a permanent pattern printed on one side and was finished in such a way that either side could be used as the outer side of a garment, and under the terms of the Order was entitled to be admitted freely.</P>
      <P>This evasion of the quota was regarded as a serious threat to the Irish mills.  Some of the mills who had gone into production of rayon suitings in a fairly substantial way, found that orders placed with them were not being confirmed as traders feared that when the weakness in the quota became generally known, there would be large-scale importations of cloth designed to evade the quota control.</P>
      <P>The Government, accordingly, made an Order deleting the existing exemption for printed fabrics and substituting an exemption for fabrics with a bona fide design or pattern permanently printed or painted thereon which is visible on both surfaces of the fabric.  This Order came into operation on the 9th June, 1955.</P>

      <P>Tairgim:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Gurb é barúil Sheanad Éireann gur cóir bord a bhunú láithreach leis an Fhíor-Ghaeltacht a chaomhnú agus a fhorbairt.</P>
      <P>Tá suas le 20 duine annseo a bhfuil a n-ainmneacha le fáil fén rún seo.  Tá baint ag cuid acu le Páirtí polaitíochta sa Stáit seo agus tá cuid eile acu neamhspleách.  Mar sin, tá mé ag caint anois mar <i>primus inter pari</i>&mdash;the first speaker among equals.  Creidimíd go bhfuil an Ghaeltacht ag fáil bháis, go bhfuil na daoine ann ag éirí gann go tapaidh, agus, muna ndéantar rud éigin díreach chun an Ghaeltacht do shábháil anois, go mbeidh deire léi a bhfad roimh dheire na haoise seo.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Creidimíd gurb é an tslí is fearr chun an Ghaeltacht a shábháil ná bord neamhspleách a chur ar bun gan aon <Col N="459" /> bhaint a bheith aige le cúrsaí polaitíochta ach freagarach don Taoiseach nó don Stáit.</P>
    <P>Cloisfidh an Seanad óráid níos fearr ná mo cheann-sa, ach tá sé mar dhualgas trom orm anois mo chuid féin atá le rá agam a chur ós comhair an tSeanaid agus déanfaidh mé é sin chomh maith agus is féidir liom.</P>
    <P>I do not think any of us will dispute that the Gaeltacht is declining.  However, I should just like to give some practical proofs of the fact&mdash;some proofs which have emerged fairly recently. Not so recent is Volume 8 of the Report on the 1946 Census of Population.  That report showed that the number of Irish speakers in the Gaeltacht decreased by about 20 per cent. between 1936 and 1946.  It is also certain that a kind of increased velocity attaches to this kind of decline.  It is certain, too, that with the growth of emigration and the passage of time, that velocity must attain almost maximum and fatal proportions during the decade 1946 to 1956.</P>
    <P>More recent figures published by Comhdháil Náisiúnta na Gaeilge show that, on the most conservative computation, the number of traditional Irish speakers has shrunk very seriously in 25 years: it has been reduced from 70,000 25 years ago to something over 30,000 at present.</P>
    <P>Recent maps prepared by Muinntir na Gaeltachta show that, since 1925, the Irish-speaking areas of Donegal and Galway have shrunk by 50 per cent.  They show, still more alarmingly, that, in the same period, in the Kerry areas Irish speakers have dwindled by 75 per cent.  Equally alarming are the figures in regard to the Mayo Gaeltacht.  Only one-eighth of the Mayo Gaeltacht of 1925 now remains.</P>
    <P>Lastly, and I do not think its accuracy can be questioned either, the figures published by Comhdháil Náisiúnta na Gaeilge show that the number of households in the Gaeltacht in which Irish is spoken is now somewhere only between 7,000 and 8,000.</P>
    <P>In short, to ring the changes of the <i>London Times</i> of 100 years ago, the Gaeltacht is going and going with a <Col N="460" /> vengeance.  Long before the end of the present century, at the present rate of decline, it seems certain that, as an Irish-speaking area, it will have finished altogether.  I do not think it is necessary to argue at great length that its preservation is vital to this nation.  I take it that none of us is interested in preserving the Gaeltacht as a kind of Indian reservation to which the well-to-do will go in search of culture and in search of backgrounds and I take it also that there is no necessity to underline its cultural value to the nation.  That has been done <i>ad nauseam.</i>  While there has been a great deal of talk about the tremendous heritage of which the Gaeltacht is part, there has been nothing really significant in big enough proportions to arrest its decline.  I should like to emphasise the right of its inhabitants to a decent way of life that will ensure the continuity of their traditions.  That is a fairly obvious right in a democracy such as ours.</P>
    <P>I should like to point out further that on the Gaeltacht and on its preservation rest two things&mdash;first of all, the movement for the revival and restoration of Irish as a spoken language and, secondly, the strength of the modern writers of Irish.  I am certain that none of those who have set their names to this motion will hold&mdash; although we can hold if we want&mdash;that neither our older tongue nor the modern literature born of it is necessary to this nation, but we cannot have it both ways.  We cannot say that we believe in the Gaelic tradition and in a modern Irish literature and at the same time allow the Gaeltacht to die. So I turn to the best methods of preserving it.</P>
    <P>It has been argued from time to time that idealism alone can save the Gaeltacht.  I have long ago reached the conclusion, as many of my generation have, that idealism alone is not enough.  It must be translated into practical action.  Idealism alone certainly cannot conquer the very formidable material considerations weighing against the existence of the Gaeltacht in the present circumstances.  It is perfectly certain that where Irish is the language of the home and English <Col N="461" /> is the language of the market-place, English will win.</P>
    <P>The President of Muinntir na Gaeltachta, Mr. Peadar Ó Ceallaigh, recently pointed out that Irish was lost in the Iveragh peninsula because it is divided by a mountain mass at its centre, and part of its Gaeltacht abutted on English speaking places such as Cahirciveen and Valentia.  Irish declined there and not alone did it decline but the decline inevitably spread to the parts on the other side of the mountain mass.  The only natural Gaeltacht remaining in Munster is the Dingle peninsula.  One can go on to show that that same process has gone on east of the Corrib and in parts of Donegal.</P>
    <P>Idealism must, therefore, be translated into action.  That action, I think, must have a twofold purpose&mdash; to foster Irish in the Gaeltacht itself and to provide steady employment on a proper scale in the Gaeltacht. Idealism then is not enough.  Other methods must be discussed in all fairness to those who are identified with the matter.</P>
    <P>There is a suggestion that this problem can only be tackled as part of the wider problem of unemployment and emigration.  It is pointed out by its protagonists that the Gaeltacht is merely part of a larger area, corresponding roughly to that in the Congested Districts Board.  I do not think this argument holds good because the Gaeltacht itself demands special treatment because it combines two problems&mdash;a linguistic and an economic one; even if wider schemes were launched for a wider area such as that covered by the Congested Districts Board, the Gaeltacht would still need special treatment.  In any case, in tackling the wider areas of the Gaeltacht, the Breac-Ghaeltacht or the area covered by the Congested Districts Board, you have to concentrate on the problem common to the Fíor-Ghaeltacht, the Breac-Ghaeltacht and whatever little pockets&mdash;big or small&mdash;there are where English is spoken.  As well, you have to concentrate on the common problem which is economic and you must emphasise the no less important problem which is a linguistic one.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="462" /> Further, the language of the people, operating wider schemes of the nature I have indicated, would unquestionably be English and, again, English would win.  Therefore, tackling the problem as part of a wider area might very well destroy what it was in fact intended to save.</P>
    <P>I turn to the next alternative which is, I think, a more serious alternative and one worthy of somewhat lengthier consideration.  It has been suggested that the proper method of facing this problem should be that of setting up a Government Department, under a Parliamentary Secretary, who would, perhaps, delegate fairly large powers to a number of commissioners.</P>
    <P>This is a suggestion worth considering. It is advanced by a number of people whose judgment I value.  It is argued by these people that a Minister or Parliamentary Secretary is absolutely necessary for the proper operation of such an area if the case of the Gaeltacht is to be fought in the Cabinet and fought also with the Department of Finance.  I think that a closer consideration reveals certain obstacles which to my mind at any rate outweigh these few advantages.</P>
    <P>First of all, I think that the Government Department charged with this task can function effectively only with the close co-operation of other Departments and, generally speaking, under the control of the Department of Finance.  I think there would, therefore, be conflicts of interest and slowness of procedure where you have these various Departments having to come together to iron out their differences and then having to iron out their differences with the other Departments concerned.  As the utmost flexibility is called for, the arrangement of a Government Department with commissioners, perhaps, would not work.  I do not want to try to judge in advance what Senator Hawkins is going to say.  I think his amendment may be linked up with that idea of commissioners for the Gaeltacht with the Gaeltacht Development Fund.</P>
    <P>The second argument I have against the running of this by a Department of the Government is that experience <Col N="463" /> suggests that whatever efforts have been made in the past by Government Departments have not, in fact, provided large-scale employment in the Gaeltacht and that they have arrested neither the emigration which is still going on nor the decline of spoken Irish in the Gaeltacht.  Further, I would argue that civil servants are to a large extent, through no fault of their own, bound by a fairly rigid system of grading and promotion and also bound &mdash;and this may be partly their own fault&mdash;by routine.  They are not as a rule&mdash;and I say this with all due respect for the work they do&mdash;the most imaginative of people.  I think that this task calls for flexibility of system, originality of view and also calls for an almost crusading zeal, so formidable is the task of saving this area.  Further, I do not think that a Civil Service Department would have the kind of responsibility which a board would have.  I would argue at any rate that a board could be directly responsible to the Taoiseach, whereas with a Civil Service Department you would have to have commissioners, also a Parliamentary Secretary who in turn would be responsible to the Taoiseach and, of course, the control of the Department of Finance would have to be brought in somewhere.  I suggest that that kind of Department, operating by this kind of remote control, would be operating through a control almost as remote as its prospects of success.</P>
    <P>Finally, as regards these reasons against a Government Department running the scheme, a Government Department would undoubtedly, much as we dislike the idea, be affected by political considerations, by the number of voters in certain areas and by pressure from different Deputies in certain areas.  I cannot imagine any political Party in power facing with equanimity the task of reconciling not only the conflicting interests of these various Deputies but also the various conflicting interests of the politicians involved. It is logical to conclude that a board is the correct means.  A board such as Bord na Móna or the E.S.B., with independent powers, not tied politically but responsible to the Government <Col N="464" /> as the Government has some say in financing it, could function effectively.</P>
    <P>As regards the constitution and financing of such a board, the Comhdháil has made certain proposals.  The Comhdháil visualises a board of six part-time members, Irish speakers with the best business experience and administrative qualifications and with a genuine interest in Gaeltacht products. They say in their memorandum:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Persons likely to be subject to local pressure should not be chosen. If the Government so desires the Comhdháil will be happy to suggest suitable nominees.  The day-to-day management would be in the hands of a full-time managing director, who should preferably be a member of the board.  Consideration might be given to the appointment of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Government as ex-officio President.  It is not suggested that he should be under an obligation to attend meetings of the board but if he were a member he would always be in possession of information regarding the board's activities and would be a most valuable link between the Government and the board....  The board should be represented throughout the Gaeltacht by 14 or 15 local officers each having an area with a population of about 3,000....  The board's staff, all of whom would have to be fluent Irish-speakers, would require to be specially selected for organising capacity, ability in public relations, and familiarity with the Gaeltacht and its problems and, in the case of technical members, appropriate qualifications and experience....  The board should be financed by means of a Grant-in-Aid, which might be fixed at about £25,000 for the first year.  This amount would need to be increased very substantially thereafter according as the board's operations matured....&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I do not say that is the only way of constituting a board and financing it but it gives a working basis and should be considered.  It is a positive approach and a possible one as well. The board would foster the use of spoken Irish in the Gaeltacht and provide <Col N="465" /> adequate employment there.  Its work would include the promotion of industries, the improvement of holdings and the development of tourism and recreational facilities.  It would also provide employment outside the Gaeltacht for those who wished to leave the Gaeltacht&mdash;since the Indian reservation complex is a bad one.  The board would advise on the special conditions of the Gaeltacht in regard to any larger schemes such as afforestation and fishing.  The board is the best and perhaps the only means by which the Gaeltacht may be saved.</P>
    <P>Senator Hawkins's amendment implies an alternative, but a Gaeltacht development fund of itself could do practically nothing.  Such a fund must be administered and must have means to apply what it collects.  I do not see how the amendment could be translated into action: the mere creation of a fund might be like the creation of the Anti-Partition Fund, which did not do a lot.  Tá mo dhóthain ráite agam anois.  Iarraim ar na daoine nach bhfuil ar aon-aigne leis an dtairiscint seo, go nochtóidis a dtuairimí go soiléir.  Creidim go bhfuil grá don Ghaeltacht ag an chuid is mó de na Seanadóirí, ach is beag an tairbhe é má theipeann orainn í do shabháil.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrederickHawkins" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>I move the following amendment:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Bord&rdquo; a scrios agus &ldquo;Ciste Forbartha na Gaeltachta&rdquo; a chur ina ionad.</P>
      <P>To delete &ldquo;Board&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;Gaeltacht Development Fund.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>We should approach this question realistically and without exaggerating the difficulties or minimising the work before us.  The wording of the motion is simple, but the results of its acceptance are not so simple and could not be put into operation as easily as Senator McHugh suggests.  I do not propose to hold an inquest on the last 30 years in relation to the Gaeltacht, but to deal with the motion before us. Senator McHugh has drawn our attention to the success of the E.S.B. and Bord na Móna.  This motion bears no relation to those activities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="466" /> I suggest we should take each Department of State and examine its relations with the Gaeltacht.  I am pleased to see here the Minister for Education, whose Department I have placed first on the list, as it is responsible for recruiting teachers, erecting schools and extending primary, vocational and university education.  We should have better schools there, staffed with the best teachers, who would give leadership in that school area.  Secondary education is lacking in many Gaeltacht areas and our young people there should be given every inducement to become proficient in secondary education.  There are difficuties there and difficulties will not be overcome by sympathy with the project. They can be overcome by a very definite decision made, and that decision must be made by the Department in control of that particular sphere of activity.  We must be prepared to establish secondary schools throughout the Gaeltacht, and where people passing out of primary education are far removed from secondary schools we must be prepared to supply them with the necessary transport and whatever other subsidies might be required in order that they might get the best that the State can give them.</P>
    <P>There is another very important field, that of vocational education.  The county councils and the vocational committees in the various counties in the Gaeltacht have co-operated to the utmost with the Department of Education. They are anxious to do everything they can, but there are limits to what the local authority can do, as there are limits to what the central funds can help them to accomplish. One of our first considerations should be to equip our people in the Fíor-Ghaeltacht and in the Gaeltacht generally to become leaders of Irish Ireland in the future.  The best start we can make in that is in our vocational and general educational institutions.</P>
    <P>Another field is that of university education.  Various county councils in the Gaeltacht areas have provided very generous scholarships over a number of years.  If we are going to give the people in those areas their just reward we must greatly increase <Col N="467" /> those scholarships and make available to the people in the Fíor-Ghaeltacht even more opportunities than we would be prepared to make available to the people in other areas, because we owe to those people a very great debt.  The only way that debt can be paid is by the Government, acting on behalf of the people, recognising that that debt is due and by being prepared, if necessary, to raise from other sections of our community the moneys necessary to do what I suggest.</P>
    <P>I do not want to dwell very long on this question of education.  I am sure it is one of the most important and if we are ever going to reach the day when Ireland can become not alone free but Gaelic as well, we must give every facility possible to the people who have maintained the Irish language and Irish culture down through the years, so that they will become the leaders of Irish Ireland in the future.</P>
    <P>Let me pass now from the Department of Education to the most important Department of the State, the Department of Finance.  The Department of Finance plays a very important part in the life of every individual of this State but plays a much more important part in the life of the people in those areas which this motion proposes should be preserved and developed.  Through that Department the Office of Public Works is charged with undertaking minor and major relief schemes, development of harbours and piers, the maintenance of all public buildings and quite a number of other public works.  There is a very wide field for development and for further expenditure and there are many worthwhile schemes on which I and many of us who come from the Gaeltacht areas could propose that moneys could be very wisely and well spent.  Many a time I visited and made recommendations to the Department and I am quite satisfied that they do the best they can having regard to the amount of money that is put at their disposal.</P>
    <P>I would ask Senator McHugh whether he proposes that the board he suggests should be set up, should take over all the functions of the Department <Col N="468" /> of Education as it relates to the Gaeltacht areas and whether, in the taking over of these activities, we would have better trained teachers, that there should be a particular school set up to train them for the Gaeltacht areas and that because of the very fact that we set up this board we would have immediately better schools, an increase in vocational and university scholarships and an increase of opportunities for those people to become leaders of Irish Ireland.  I would put to him the same question in relation to public works. Does he propose that the operations now undertaken by the Office of Public Works would be more efficiently undertaken and that it would be to the better advantage of the people of the Gaeltacht, if they were under the direction of a separate board?</P>

      <P>There are many more questions that I propose to put to the Senator and being the proposer of the motion he will have an opportunity of replying later.  However, if he wishes to interject I am prepared to give way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>The next most important Department of State in relation to this particular area is the Department of Lands.  The Department of Lands might be broken up into quite a number of sections but, as far as the Gaeltacht is concerned, it is the most important Department of the State. The Department of Lands has the power of acquisition and redistribution of land.  Of course, in that connection there are many people who would like to set up another boundary around the country and who believe that that boundary should take within its sphere the Gaeltacht areas.  There is quite a number of people in this country who have the view, and I feel that Senator McHugh is one of them, that the migration of the people of the West, or of the Gaeltacht areas in general, to the Midlands is not a scheme that should be nationally accepted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="469" /> Other speakers say&mdash;I think he referred to it here to-night himself&mdash; that the development of our tourist industry is something not to be looked upon with any great faith because of the consequences that might arise.  On another occasion, we had the Undeveloped Areas Bill before the House. We had quite a number of people speaking as Senator McHugh spoke here to-night and putting forward the view that if we industrialise and give employment in industry to the people of the Gaeltacht we are taking the first step in eliminating the Irish tradition &mdash;Irish language and Irish culture&mdash;in those areas.</P>

      <P>This is a very wide field.  The mover of the motion has advanced certain arguments as to why this board should be set up.

      <P>I do not want to limit the discussion at all.  The House would not desire that.  However, the Senator's attention has been drawn to the fact that he seems to be basing a case on an argument which Senator McHugh says he did not make and which the Chair understands he did not make.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>If Senator McHugh or anybody else wants to run away from statements they made in the past, I cannot help them.  These are facts and they are on record.  We will proceed from the Office of Public Works and just ask Senator McHugh if, in his <Col N="470" /> motion, he suggests that all the activities of the Office of Public Works&mdash; from minor relief schemes to the provision of harbours, piers and all the other activities that provide employment for the people of the Gaeltacht&mdash;should now be transferred from the Office of Public Works and vested in this new organisation of a Gaeltacht Board?</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrederickHawkins" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>Neither does he agree that the activities of the Department of Education should be transferred from the Department of Education to this new board?  Now we come to the next very important matter.  As a matter of fact, I was dealing with it when the Senator interrupted me but I suppose that that is what university education does.  I cannot help that. When I was interrupted, I was referring to the Land Commission.  The Department of Lands have very wide powers.  Their powers are outside the question of this or the other House. They have powers of acquisition, distribution and redistribution of lands.  I have read many statements on the question.  As a matter of fact, the last statement I read was made at a meeting of a particular organisation in the City of the Tribes, Galway, where very serious objection was taken to the transferring of persons from the Gaeltacht areas to the lands of Meath.  Of course, there is this question there. Do we agree that, in the setting-up of an Irish Parliament, we intended to undo the conquest?  Do we agree that we were going to bring back the people from the West and give them their rightful place in the Midlands of this country, or do we not?  Do we accept now that it is a sin and a crime to bring back these people and give them holdings?  My one objection to the whole scheme is that the holdings have not been large enough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, we now have an organisation and the speaker speaking on behalf of that organisation suggests that it is bad to remove these people from very small patches of land in Connemara, Donegal or Kerry, and bring them up and give them a livelihood in <Col N="471" /> the fair lands of Meath.  Over a long number of years this activity has been carried on.  Something over 400 families have been removed.  I was very pleased, and I am sure there are many Senators in this House who are very pleased, to read in cold print&mdash;not from a critical organisation, but in cold print&mdash;as reported from the Irish Land Commission, that these people made good, that the scheme was worthwhile and that they recommended its continuance. Does Senator McHugh or the people who advocate the setting-up of this board suggest that it is possible that the functions of the Irish Land Commission in this regard could or should be taken over by this board?</P>

      <P>The board suggested in this proposal is a board to preserve and develop the Gaeltacht.  In order to do that, in order to give an opportunity to people to remain there, we must take a number of people out.  We must undo at some time the Cromwellian approach of &ldquo;To Hell or Connaught&rdquo;. Does Senator McHugh suggest that the activities of the board should be directed to maintaining the people there in Hell or in Connaught? Does he suggest that it is a good thing that those people should be taken out and given an opportunity to live a life in the fields from which their forefathers were probably removed?</P>

      <P>A question arises very seriously out of Senator McHugh's interjection. That is a question which must worry every member of this <Col N="472" /> House.  Are we going to get from Senator McHugh or the advocates of this motion any clear and definite statement as to the functions of the board which they propose should be set up&mdash;or is Senator McHugh going to get annoyed because somebody asks a question?  I have a very open mind. I should like the Senator to influence my decision here to-night as to whether or not the setting-up of this board would be worthwhile and as to whether or not it would do the things we should like it to do.  If Senator McHugh tries to shelter behind an appeal to the Chair to make a decision, every time a question is directed to him, then I am afraid we shall never get to the end of the questions I propose to ask the Senator.</P>

      <P>The Senator must realise that we cannot carry on the debate here on the basis of question and answer.  He must make his speech as Senator McHugh has made his.  The Chair cannot permit the Senator to question Senator McHugh and expect Senator McHugh to rise in his place and give an answer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrederickHawkins" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator has an obligation to the House at the same time.  He is the mover of the motion and if any member of this House asks a question in order that the other members might be guided as to what decision they might make, I think it is only reasonable to expect the Senator to give an answer to these questions.  If he is not in a position to answer, or if he is not willing to answer them, then the only option I have is to continue with the observations which I wanted to put before the members of this House this evening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have got as far as the Land Commission dealing with land acquisition, distribution and the redistribution of holdings after these people have been migrated to the Midlands. It is an achievement that something in the neighbourhood of 400 families have been removed from these small patches of land in the Gaeltacht and given holdings in the Midlands.  They have Justified that experiment.  It is a very dear experiment and so would this <Col N="473" /> proposed board be a very much dearer experiment, if the Department of Lands are charged with the responsibility of operating the forestry section. A matter about which we have heard very much over quite a number of years is the plantation of the Gaeltacht areas in general and what afforestation might mean to our people.  We never seem to come down to realities and realise that the people who now occupy the lands, which many summer tourists might feel and suggest might be better employed in growing trees, are people who depend entirely for their livelihood on sheep grazing in these places.</P>
    <P>If we are enthusiastic about forestry and afforestation, we must accept responsibility for giving to these people at least that income and remuneration which they received in their former occupation of sheep grazing or whatever else it might have been on these particular lands.  If we are not prepared to face up to that, then it is only hypocrisy on our part to suggest that these people, the poorest of the poor, are people whom this motion proposes to help by the setting up of this board.  It is only hypocrisy to suggest these should be called upon to make the greatest sacrifices in depriving themselves of an annual income from the sheep and the produce of sheep on these particular grazing lands.</P>
    <P>I am all for afforestation but does the Senator now propose that in order to increase afforestation in the Gaeltacht areas this particular function of the sub-department of the Department of Lands should be taken over; that it would be better developed; that we would have greater results and that the institutions that are being set up under the Forestry Department at the present time, for the growing of seeds, etc., can be handled more efficiently and with greater results than is being done at the present time?</P>
    <P>There is one particular section of the Department I am prepared to support. Here I am at one for once with Senator McHugh.  A case could be made in this connection for the setting up of a board.  I would recommend it and I think it is time that we should do it because it would be a good thing <Col N="474" /> if it were done and good results might follow from it.  I refer to Gaeltacht Services.  Time has favoured the products of Gaeltacht Services.  I think the time has now arrived when we should take that out of the everyday running of the Department and set up an independent board, composed of business persons, who understood that business and who might be in a position to develop and maintain it.</P>
    <P>I would stress the maintenance, rather than the development, because as far as I see we are now probably at the height of the demand for Irish tweeds and products of that kind and for the products of Gaeltacht Services in general.  To my mind it will take all the energy and enthusiasm that the Department can muster in that section to maintain the present output and develop any further field.</P>
    <P>The Department of Local Government, for instance, through the county councils and local authorities control the making and the maintenance of roads, the building of houses, hospitalisation, social services and all these other activities.  Would the Senator tell us that greater benefits would flow from the section if it were directed through this particular board?  I do not think so.  I have very close associations with the Gaeltacht and it is because of that that I have thought fit to put down an amendment to this motion.</P>
    <P>I think it is right for somebody to say this.  From my experience of meeting the people in the various Departments of State throughout my 18 or 19 years as a member of this House, I find that they have all been very sympathetic with every proposal that one put up.  Many of these people come from the Gaeltacht areas themselves and are the sons and daughters of people who live in the Gaeltacht.  The majority of them spend their holidays in these areas and they enjoy these holidays.  They would like to do everything they possibly could to make life and conditions for the people in the Fíor-Ghaeltacht, and in the Gaeltacht in general, more happy and more comfortable than they are at the present time.</P>
    <P>There is just one other question.  In <Col N="475" /> asking myself that question I was prompted to put down this amendment. No matter what Senator McHugh may say, to do the things that we would like to do for the Gaeltacht will require the expenditure of money.  Setting up a board is only an excuse, something which would enable the Government of the day to say it has done its duty and that if the board has not done the things expected, it is not the Government's fault.</P>
    <P>The nation owes something to the Fíor-Ghaeltacht.  I do not want to be a party to the building of a partition wall around the Fíor-Ghaeltacht.  I want to show our appreciation of everything done in the past and to give an opportunity to those people to become leaders in the future.  We would then see the Fíor-Ghaeltacht extending out from parish to parish and from county to county until the country becomes &ldquo;not free merely but Gaelic as well&rdquo;.  The mover of the motion has not suggested what the board should do.  It has been said that nothing was done in the past.  An attempt was made under the Undeveloped Areas Bill to introduce industries into those areas.  It is extraordinary that those who felt they were the custodians of Gaelic culture objected very seriously to that Bill and to the attempt to set up industries and develop tourism there.  Emigration from all areas is a bleeding sore and will continue to be difficult to deal with while we have the prevailing inducements of full employment and better conditions in a neighbouring country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrederickHawkins" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know what &ldquo;preserve the Gaeltacht&rdquo; means unless we are to build a wall around the area and say that inside it the Irish language, culture and tradition must survive.  We should give opportunities to those brought up in that atmosphere to become leaders in the future, and that can be done only by Government action in providing money to give a <Col N="476" /> reasonable livelihood to those people in their own areas.  Some years ago, an organisation was set up to co-ordinate the activities of Government Departments in this respect.  That work would take a while to become effective, but it was effective in many directions.  It would not do just to set up a board to which the Government could pass on its responsibility.  We should revive the parliamentary secretaryship to which Deputy Jack Lynch was appointed under the Fianna Fáil Government and under which very much useful work was carried out.  I will refer to just one of those works. It has never been explained to my satisfaction why the grassmeal project in Bangor Erris was abandoned&mdash;because some people in a particular Department and one particular Minister thought fit to do that.  I have an idea that it is because of that particular incident that we have this motion before us to-night.</P>
      <P>When the National Development Fund was set up, requests were made that a percentage should be earmarked for Gaeltacht works&mdash;and I think 25 per cent. was allocated.  Nothing can be done without money.  We have had experience in the past of boards charged with directing such an industry as this.  We had another board and found that when there was a change of Government in a short period of three years we had three changes in that board, resulting in confusion and the work of the board being brought into political day to day discussions. That was bad for the board and for the purpose for which it was set up.  I refer, of course, to the Irish Tourist Board, which in three years had no less than three presidents or directors.  It would be bad for the personnel of this proposed board and for the Gaeltacht in general, if its activities were brought into political day to day discussions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think Senator McHugh has made a case for the board.  I suggest we revive and extend the old organisation but instead of a Parliamentary Secretary we should have a Minister to co-ordinate those activities.  I cannot see how the various activities of the different Departments that are <Col N="477" /> functioning in the State could be effectively operated by a board set up as a result of our passing this motion.</P>
    <P>I hope that those people who hold the views I hold on this matter are not going to be taken as objecting to any good being done for those people.  It is because we have that particular interest in it that we are anxious that some practical good should be done and that we are not prepared just to allow a smokescreen, as it were, to be drawn over this whole question. Therefore, I ask the Seanad to accept the amendment rather than the motion.</P>

      <P>It seems to me it would be a great pity if the force of this motion were divided and weakened by this amendment.  We are trying to do the same thing, both those who support the amendment and those who support the motion.  On the one hand, Senator McHugh in proposing the motion emphasised the need for personnel, for the people who will work this effort.  On the other side, Senator Hawkins, I think, is emphasising the need for money and the need for an independent approach.  It does seem to me that there is hardly enough difference between the two to make it a matter for dividing or a matter for even quarrelling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know how this debate will proceed.  The beginning seems to be a little sticky, if I may say so.  Some, I imagine, will emphasise the practical desirabilities and difficulties.  But perhaps one of us at least should be allowed to speak on an aspect of the spirit that lies behind this motion.  I welcome the opportunity of supporting it for two reasons: firstly, for personal reasons as an Irishman and as a professor of another historic language; and, secondly, as a representative of Dublin University.  In many ways I think my university has acquired a bad name in this respect, but we have some things to be proud of and satisfied with in the past in connection with the Irish language.  Thomas Davis, as we all know, was one of our graduates; Flood was another; many of the greatest scholars in the Irish <Col N="478" /> tradition, the Gwynns, the O'Gradys, Whitley Stokes, were graduates of our university.  I think it would be a pity if at least one representative of Dublin University did not support this motion.  On the other hand, I do not want to support it under false pretences. There is a risk of some hypocrisy in supporting a motion of this kind.</P>
    <P>There are, I think, four possible attitudes to this motion in particular and to the problem of restoring the Irish language in general.  First, there are those who are against it; I would remind the House, and I think it is important to remind them, that those are not, and were not, simply those of English extraction or grouped with the Ascendancy.  Daniel O'Connell, with great sincerity, recommended that Ireland should adopt the English language.  He may not have been right, but at least he recommended it so, sincerely, as a thorough Irishman. Now I wonder will there be anyone here this evening who will oppose the motion on those grounds.  It would be very interesting if someone would.  But I hardly think anyone will.  Secondly, there are those who are simply indifferent. Just how many there are is very hard to estimate.  They remain anonymous; they remain underground; but they are there.  Thirdly, there are those, and I imagine most of those present here to-day belong to this group, who believe that without the living language the Irish nation would lose its nature and destiny.  I recall for a moment the tradition of Pearse and I will return to it, if I may, in a moment or two.</P>
    <P>There is a fourth group.  I belong to it.  This group comprises those who see the modern Irish nation as a unity, or a hoped-for unity, of many diverse elements, linguistic, religious and racial; who see the Irish language and the Gaelic tradition as the most distinctive and most dynamic element in this hoped-for unity and value it highly as such.  Now this was the way of thinking of Thomas Davis.  I hope it will not be considered unsuitable if I quote some lines from Thomas Davis. With reference to that concept of the Irish nation as a unity of diverse elements&mdash;and <Col N="479" /> all the stronger for being a unity of diverse elements&mdash;this is what Davis said in his essay on the &ldquo;Ballad Poetry of Ireland&rdquo;:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;At last we are beginning to see what we are, and what is our destiny.  Our duty arises where our knowledge begins.  The elements of Irish nationality are not only combining&mdash;in fact, they are growing confluent in our minds.  Such nationality as merits a good man's help, and wakens a true man's ambition-such nationality as could stand against internal faction and foreign intrigue&mdash;such nationality as would make the Irish hearth happy and the Irish name illustrious, is becoming understood.  It must contain and represent the races of Ireland.  It must not be Celtic, it must not be Saxon&mdash;it must be Irish.  The Brehon law, and the maxims of Westminster, the cloudy and lightning genius of the Gael, the placid strength of the Sassenach, the marshalling insight of the Norman&mdash; a literature which shall exhibit in combination the passions and idioms of all, and which shall equally express our mind in its romantic, its religious, its forensic and its practical tendencies&mdash;finally, a native Government which shall know and rule by the might and right of all; yet yield to the arrogance of none-these are components of such a nationality.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>When Davis said this, he was not, as everyone here knows, disparaging the Gaelic elements in Ireland.  We all know his devotion to the Gaelic tradition. But he was facing realities.  He was thinking of a 32-County Ireland. He saw that many genuine Irishmen could never be Gaelic by race, and probably would never be speakers of Irish. He saw what is the historical reality, if we reckon with the six northeastern counties.</P>
    <P>Davis loved the Irish tradition and the Irish language with his whole heart but he believed that in the Ireland of 1840&mdash;and it is at least as true in the Ireland of 1955&mdash;the hope of an all-Gaelic Ireland was illusory.  Further&mdash; and this, I think, is important&mdash;he <Col N="480" /> believed that this very variety of elements in the modern Irish nation was a strength rather than a weakness. Let me quote again.  I would be happier if I were quoting this in the presence of the bust of Thomas Davis in the other Chamber but, unless we could arrange to have the busts of Pearse and Davis removed to stand here for the present debate, that would be impossible.  Here is a short quotation from Thomas Davis:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;However closely we study our history, when we come to deal with politics we must sink the distinctions of blood as well as of sect.  The Milesian, the Dane, the Norman, the Welshman, the Scotsman and Saxon naturalised here must combine regardless of their blood.  The Strongbownian must sit with the Ulster Scot and he whose ancestors came from Tyre or Spain must confide in and work with the Cromwellian and the Williamite.  This is as much needed as the mixture of Protestant and Catholic.  If a union of all Irish born men ever be accomplished&rdquo;</P>
    <P>&mdash;I think this is highly significant&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Ireland will have the greatest and most varied materials for an illustrious nationality, and for a tolerant and flexible character in literature, manners, religion and life, of any nation on earth.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I am working towards that steadily.  I promise you I will not delay the House one-tenth of the time that perhaps some of the Senators will.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These are the principles under which I personally support this effort to preserve the living language in its natural strongholds.  I know there are many here who may find such principles too moderate, too restrained let me say. I know that many of our living and dead leaders have maintained that the language is the palladium of our nationhood and that without it Ireland must cease to be truly Ireland.  I honour those leaders.  I honour especially Patrick Pearse, who held that view and died for it.  But I do hope that <Col N="481" /> those who follow Pearse will not in this motion or in any other national effort reject those who follow Davis. They stand side by side in the Dáil Chamber and I would like to put it on record here that at least one Senator and many visitors that he has brought to the Dáil Chamber very deeply appreciate the spirit that lay behind placing those two men side by side in the Dáil Chamber&mdash;one a graduate of Dublin University and the other a graduate of the Catholic University.  Side by side they stand there: in different ways they serve the Irish nation.</P>
    <P>When I and many of the university constituency which I represent support this motion it is in the spirit of Davis.  I hope I have at least made it clear that those who are in the Davis tradition are still eager to stand side by side with those who follow Pearse in supporting the spirit of this motion.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I think perhaps we might begin on this motion and the amendment by stating where we are in agreement. Everybody here is in agreement with the aims of the mover of the motion and of those who have been advocating a board for the Fíor-Ghaeltacht. The aim is to preserve the Irish language in the places where it is now spoken as the traditional language.  It is spoken by people in those areas as an ordinary vernacular, as a normal means of intercourse, not <Col N="482" /> for a national object, not to qualify for any benefits but because it is the Irish language which, as they say themselves, is buige a thagann chucha, comes easiest to them.</P>
    <P>The sole compelling reason for discussing this motion at all is that the Irish language&mdash;which, as Davis appreciated, for 2,000 years was moulded by our history, by our failures, our successes, our native mind and by our various invaders&mdash;should survive in its natural environment.  We may all want to do that but we differ as to the means by which it should be done.  Before we discuss the means by which it might be done perhaps we should appreciate the various difficulties and complexities of the problem.</P>
    <P>I find myself in the position that I disagree both with the motion and the amendment.  It seems to me that no case was made here this evening for the setting-up of a board: no explanation was given as to what precisely a board would do that a Government Department, for example, could not do.  Anybody who has experience of administration will realise the difficulties that would confront a board: I will come to that in a moment.  Neither do I agree that the matter can be solved merely by the provision of money.  There is a school of thought which persists in saying that if you spent more money in the Gaeltacht you would get a better result from the point of view of the Irish language. That is not so.  Everybody&mdash;and there are not very many, by the way&mdash;who has an intimate acquaintance with any particular Gaeltacht area, is aware that economic factors are important but they are not all-important. There are other factors too and these would be the main problems of a board and indeed they would be the great difficulty of any body set up to deal with this matter.</P>
    <P>A board for the Gaeltacht has been compared to Bord na Móna and to the E.S.B. and Coras Tráchtála Teoranta but each one of these boards&mdash;the E.S.B. and Bord na Móna&mdash;has a specific and easily defined object and they were set up to achieve these objects.  A board to save the Irish <Col N="483" /> language in the Fíor-Ghaeltacht would have much more varied, complicated and much less easily definable objects.</P>
    <P>In fact, as I said here when we discussed this matter on the 4th March of last year, the objects which we are trying to achieve in the Gaeltacht may be shown in many directions to be rather contradictory.  That is to say you require to achieve economic improvement but economic improvement which will not injure the position of the Irish language.  As I said at column 612 of the Official Report for the 4th March, 1954:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The problem is how can we preserve Irish-speaking communities in their present situation&rdquo;,</P>
    <P>and not as migrants.  Whatever may be said in favour of migration, with all respect to Senator Hawkins, the real problem from the point of view of the Irish language is</P>
    <P>&ldquo;how to preserve Irish-speaking communities in their present situation. We must provide young people with a living which will not induce them to forget, despise or abandon Irish.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>You need unified direction to do that. You need also economic steps.  You need hard-headed business men, people with experience of administration, and you need people also who appreciate the linguistic and the spiritual values of the Irish language in the Gaeltacht.  If you desire to preserve the spiritual values which we associate with the Irish language you may find yourself hampered in putting certain economic measures into operation.  The provision of sums of money without taking any thought for the language or the spiritual value of the language is not going to carry you any distance.</P>
    <P>A board would need members.  It would need a staff and it would be very difficult indeed to get either for the board, or for the staff of the board, the kind of person who would have all the very great capabilities which have been mentioned and some of which the memorandum of Comhdháil Náisiunta na Gaeilge envisages.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="484" /> The problem involves a certain mental attitude and how you are going to change it.  This year&mdash;1955&mdash;in the month of August I was in a house with some very old friends of mine&mdash;an old man and his sister, both of whom were over 70 years of age, friends to whom I never spoke anything but Irish.  They spoke Irish with me and my son.  They never spoke anything but Irish together. On this particular day&mdash;it was a fine day&mdash;they had a boy of 16 or 17 years of age helping them. He knew Irish well and understood them perfectly in Irish.  But they spoke English to him and there was no use in arguing with them about it.  There would be no use giving them money to stop.  They would not stop for any monetary consideration or any other kind of consideration.  They have got that point of view.  It is understandable because it has certain historic causes, but there it is.  The problem of getting over that particular point of view and the curing of a particular mental attitude is a matter of extreme difficulty.</P>
    <P>If anyone thinks that lavish spending of money is going to cure that point of view, tá breall air.  He is completely wrong and confused.  It is not a matter of the lavish spending of money, but rather a matter of the intelligent handling of a certain sum of money.  It is rather a matter of prudent spending, cautious experiment and unified direction.</P>
    <P>One of the things the board could not do is that they could not speak to members of the Government on ministerial level.  I think the direction should be on ministerial level.  If I were asked to find a suitable person I would certainly say I could not find him at the moment, because you require three types of person.  You require hard-headed business men, sympathetic administrators and people who appreciate the spiritual heritage that you are dealing with and, again, people who appreciate, understand and are prepared patiently to cope with the mentality which obtains in the Gaeltacht and which is by no means an ordinary one.</P>
    <P>One can understand its historical roots but that does not prevent the <Col N="485" /> fact remaining that it is not in many instances a helpful mentality.  For that reason I am against the motion. I think a board would not do and I am against the suggestion that mere money will solve the matter.  It seems to me that unified direction might solve it and that the board could not.</P>
    <P>There is one other thing that should be said.  The more one understands this problem, the more sure one becomes that there is no such thing as a slat draíochta&mdash;a magic wand which can be waved by any Government, board or Minister to solve the problem. I feel that what you need is direction, not necessarily a man to interfere with other people.  The Department of Education has done a certain amount and the Department of Lands has done a certain amount.  A great deal has been done in certain compartments.  If you had unified direction you might accomplish more.</P>
    <P>Nobody should expect immediate results and nobody should expect wonderful results, even in the future.  The problem is a very difficult and very complicated one and every single aspect of modern life is against a solution&mdash;radio, television, aeroplanes. Every single thing in modern life is against the particular situation with which we find ourselves now confronted. I recall that in the 1880s, when Parnell was agitating for Home Rule in the British House of Commons, there were more than 1,000,000 Irish-speakers in Ireland which meant that over the whole area west of Athlone, large areas of Galway, an enormous area of Donegal and a large area of Munster, the Irish language was spoken.  That is not so now and it makes the matter very difficult indeed.</P>
    <P>I would proceed very cautiously.  I would take a particular area&mdash;the best area in many ways is Connemara&mdash;and see whether by spending a certain amount of money in a particular way you could gain results and, having established you can do it that way, try it in other areas but neither the board nor lavish spending of public money will solve a problem which is not only economic but linguistic.  It also deals with fashion and habit and it is psychological.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="486" /> I would like to see one individual at ministerial level doing the work. I am not certain he could succeed but I am certain he would get a most difficult and most complicated job to do.  I feel it is for us in this generation to make our best efforts to do that job because if we do not do it then, as I said here before, no kind of literature in synthetic Irish, no kind of development in Dublin outside the Gaeltacht, no Acts of Parliament and no amount of goodwill or speeches, can bring back the Irish of the Gaeltacht which is the well and source from which any development must derive. For that reason, I would urge that we should take that particular kind of action.  If we did we would be, I think, doing better than establishing a board.  We would do better than by merely providing a certain amount of money.  Something more than either of these two things is necessary.</P>

      <P>I put my name to this motion because I was anxious to hear the ideas underlying the drafting of it developed here.  Senator McHugh has not convinced me of the necessity for this board.  We know that the number of Irish speakers is decreasing and the position in the Gaeltacht is not as we would like it to be.  However, no Government in the last 30 years can be accused of indifference to this question.  Various experiments were made.  There was a system of trial and error.  The Department of Education from the outset has given preference to students from the Gaeltacht, in the recruitment of teachers. Those students are, or were, admitted to preparatory colleges on reaching qualifying standards; whereas I know of cases of students from other areas who had become proficient in Irish and other subjects by study but who could not secure admission to the preparatory colleges because of that preference -a preference to which I do not object at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was said that, at the outset, the State was not too particular about the officials sent to the Gaeltacht, that English-speaking Gardaí were sent there.  That has been remedied.  The work of the civil courts was being carried out through Béarla, but that <Col N="487" /> has been remedied also.  Vocational education committees throughout the country now have representatives from Gaeltacht areas, many of whose suggestions are accepted by the committees and seldom rejected by the Department if feasible.  In order to bring arts and crafts and other vocational facilities to students in remote Gaeltacht areas, a system of travelling scholarship has been initiated in Mayo, under which the transport cost of those students living remote from schools is paid.  That was put before the Department.  Within the last three or four weeks, the Minister has agreed to an extended system for County Mayo through which extra facilities are given to such students in the Gaeltacht.</P>
    <P>There is no comparison between the E.S.B. or Bord na Móna and this proposed board and no point in saying that similar successes can be achieved. We are up against modern developments that make this question very difficult.  No Government is indifferent to preventing the decay, but I cannot see that this board would have the desired effect or do anything more effective than is already being done.</P>

      <P>Ós na rudaí atá ráite annseo tráthnóna, ní dóigh liom go bhfuil aon deighilt in aigne na ndaoine. Chuir an Rialtas seo dhá chuspóir déag amach, agus dob é an chéad chuspóir ná &ldquo;Oidhearacht Chultúra na hÉireann do chaomhnú.&rdquo;  Tá gach éinne anseo ar thaobh na ceiste sin. I bpoinnte eile, dúradh: &ldquo;Aireacht i gcóir na Gaeltachta.&rdquo;  Is é tuairm an Rialtais, tar éis machtnamh ar an rún seo, ná déanfadh an Bord an rud is gá chun na Gaeltachtaí a shábháil. Tá fé bhráid acu, fé láthair, agus is beo-chúram orthu é, Aireacht a cheapadh chun na Gaeltachtaí do chaomhnú.  Táid ag socrú fé láthair an fhoirm ba cheart a bheith ar an Aireacht sin agus na haidhmeanna ba cheart a bheith ann, na cúrsaí sóisialaigh, na cúrsaí oideachais agus cúrsaí geilleagair do chaomhnú i dtreo is go mbeadh saol na daoine dá neartú agus an Ghaeilge á choimead agus á leathnú  na tíre, go mbeadh na ceantracha <Col N="488" /> sin go láidir i gcúrsaí oideachais agus geilleagair.</P>
      <P>Is léir go mbeidh buntáistí agus neart ag an Aireacht.  Beidh cúram daingean agus doimhin ag an Aire; beidh sé istigh i measc na nAirí eile, beidh a ghuth ann agus a chluas ann agus comhcheangal leis na hAirí eile, a chabhródh le na cuspóirí sin a bhaint amach, beartas náisiúnta do thabhairt os comhair an phobail i dtreo is gur éifeachtaí a dhéanfaidh gach éinne a chuid féin den obair.  Cabhróidh an Aireacht le hintinn agus beartas an Stát féin, na hEaglaise agus an Preas do neartú agus chun an aidhm atá ag an Rialtas agus ag an náisiún do léiriú dóibh sin.</P>
      <P>From anything that has been said here, it is clear that there should be no question of dividing on this motion. I appreciate what Senator Hawkins says, that this is not an occasion for going back over the past.  No one with any sense of responsibility would waste time in doing that.  All we have to get from the past is that things have been done and attempted and that there has not been the success we would all wish to see.</P>
      <P>In the 12 points that the present Government set out after taking office, the main things on which its mind would be directed were indicated.  The Government made it clear in the first point that one of the things would be to safeguard Irish cultural tradition. There is no one here at variance with that aim and it has been indicated here that the fullest support would be given from all sides to that aim.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In another point the Government say they propose to set up a Ministry to deal with the cultural and economic problems of the Gaeltacht areas.  When we set ourselves to deal with these problems we are not facing a purely economic problem.  We are dealing with a problem that is very difficult and intricate.  Senator Stanford speaks as the professor of an old and an older language and we know what that language means from the point of view of science, culture, and the humanities generally.  The language that is spoken in the Irish-speaking districts is, as Latin and Greek were, the vernacular <Col N="489" /> language of a people.  From the first time that literature&mdash;introduced, if you like, as a result of Latin&mdash;began to be written in Ireland, it was written in the vernacular.</P>
    <P>The language our people use in the Irish-speaking districts is a language that is old.  It has that polish of a very fine literature and is living in a very definite cultural way on the lips and in the minds of our people to-day, a literature that has come down to them in all its polished way without books, spelling or anything of that kind.</P>
    <P>It was that language that gripped the mind and the spirit of the Pearses and those who went to Irish-speaking districts in their day, and made them feel that Irish nationality was something other than merely a group of people living in a particular way in a particular island.  They were carried back to the past and realised all that the national language meant, used as it was over centuries and polished and enriched by a literature.  They felt there was a guide there to something of the mystery of life and they wanted to hold on to that.  They valued what that language meant in refinement of thought, in elegance of mind and character and in all the great strength of a particular Christian tradition which they found there.</P>
    <P>It is to save that that some people want to set up a board, and some people want to give money.  We think the time has come when it is necessary, if the problem is to be properly tackled, to set up a Ministry to deal with it.  I will answer satisfactorily, I hope, the questions that Senator Hawkins has put in regard to whether a Ministry would supersede the Department of Education, and so forth.  A Ministry needs to be set up there for the special purpose of seeing that the Irish-speaking districts are attended to, educationally, economically, and otherwise, to ensure that the people in the Gaeltacht maintain the love and the respect for the language and that they hold on to it, develop it and lift their heads as a section of the Irish race.  That Ministry is particularly wanted to-day when there are so many <Col N="490" /> people to point out that this population is failing, that this population is not maintaining the language, and where all kinds of people are perhaps blaming themselves and blaming one another that such a precious heritage has not been properly saved.</P>
    <P>The advantage of setting up a Ministry and of defining its functions as clearly as possible&mdash;and the Government is actively concerned at the moment to define what form the ministerial machinery will take and what will be the objectives of that Ministry &mdash;is that responsibility is concentrated in the Minister, and you put both Houses of the Oireachtas into the position that they can carry out a discussion in the presence of somebody deliberately charged to answer for that Ministry, in the first place, as regards what he wants to do and, in the second place, as regards doing something along the lines he thinks ought to be followed.  It puts the Government in a position that at the council table, where various plans and policies are being discussed, there is a Minister sitting down there who is responsible for seeing that in so far as he can add to those policies in the favour of the people in the Irish-speaking districts, he will do so and, in so far as he sees any aspects of those policies impinging on the successful maintenance of the Irish-speaking districts, he will be there to see that any dangers of that kind are avoided or reduced to the smallest dimensions.  Therefore, it fixes responsibility supported by the collective responsibility of the Government and it puts the two Houses of the Oireachtas in the position of being able to bring face to face with them the Minister responsible.</P>
    <P>It will have the effect also that it will help to clear the minds of the people generally, and various sections of the people, as to what the problem is, how the problem is being faced and what is expected.  It will help the Departments of State and it will help the Church, the Press and the people generally.  There is no doubt that anybody who has been closely in touch with the Irish-speaking districts knows that many people are confused as to what is expected of them in relation to <Col N="491" /> the language.  A number of things have been attempted in various ways and they misfired.  It is not exactly going back into history, or examining anything that was neglected or missed in the past, if I say that, but 25 years or so ago in the Department of Local Government, I examined the capacity of the staffs in that Department to deal with Government work in Irish and particularly with correspondence work in Irish.</P>
    <P>There was a board of health and a county council in each of the counties at that time.  It was quite clear, in regard to Donegal County Council and Board of Health and Galway County Council and Board of Health, that there was adequate power to have the correspondence between the Department of Local Government and these bodies conducted in Irish.  It was proposed that they should set themselves in line to bring about a situation in which that objective could be achieved after a period of five years.  One of the county councils wanted to know who was the slow coach and what did he think he was doing.  They solemnly passed a resolution stating that they intended to conduct all the correspondence in Irish as from the year 1932 instead of as from 1935 which had been proposed and to do that in honour of the centenary of St. Patrick.  They have not done it yet.  They have been trying comparatively recently to do some of their work through the medium of Irish but they have not succeeded.  It shows, however, that people have the desire and the impulse.</P>
    <P>In the beginning of this year I was at Knock and spoke there as Minister for Education, opening a new vocational school.  The Archbishop of Tuam came and spoke in Irish.  The parish priest spoke in Irish as did a number of others.  Every single word that was spoken there was spoken in Irish but the Press report of the proceedings-that had to be read in Galway and the neighbourhood&mdash;said the Minister spoke in Irish but the archbishop was presented as if he had spoken in English.  The same thing was done <Col N="492" /> with the parish priest.  The damage that is done in that way is very, very great.  One thing that can be done, to impress the importance of the matter on the public, is to have a Minister for the Gaeltacht in the Cabinet.</P>
    <P>As to the question of money, and the effect on the economic side, a very considerable number of things have been done.  I appreciate what Senator Hawkins says when he put the Department of Education first because I do feel that if more emphasis had been placed on the carrying out of the educational side of the Gaeltacht Commission's recommendations, the position in regard to the language would have been strengthened.  However, a fair number of things have been done on the economic side but sometimes one becomes a little shocked, a little surprised.  Dunquin is a small Gaeltacht area.  Four or five years ago about 50 farmers in that particular cup in the mountains&mdash;an area now dependent entirely on the small farms which the owners are working very well indeed&mdash;wanted a creamery so that they could get more profit out of their milk.  The Minister for Agriculture was not able at the time to provide them with a creamery.  It has since been provided, but not being able to provide it at the time the Minister sent down an assistant agricultural overseer from the Department to bring, in a concentrated way to a small Irish-speaking area, every single service that the Department had. Everything the Department had in its bag was brought down.</P>
    <P>The people were brought together and the parish priest was interested in it.  Another agricultural overseer, who had been very experienced in the west of Galway for a long time, went down after 12 months and he reported that there had been such advances that the district would be a model to the rest of the western counties.  Subsequently, a creamery was established. I was speaking a couple of days ago to a person from the area and I asked him how the people were going on. The only thing that he could remember was that the creamery had been brought in and that it was a good job that they had got the creamery as <Col N="493" /> early as they had because, if they were looking for it now, they would not be able to get it because the migration that had taken place from the district, in order to bring the Blasket people over, had reduced the number of cows in the area by 30.</P>
    <P>One never knows what one is doing for the strength of a people when one is dealing with certain aspects of economic matters.  Nevertheless, there has been improvement, I am quite satisfied.  The Irish language is strong in the area, and the Irish language will hold there.</P>
    <P>As I said, economic measures can cut in various ways.  There are certain parts of Meath and Kildare that have had Irish brought into them as a result of the migration to these counties. When you do that, you have to see that the schools in these areas are such that they will maintain the tradition and the morale of these people so that these migrants will hold and spread the language.</P>
    <P>On the money side you will get surprises too.  I had occasion to enter into correspondence with people in another part of the country who wanted a road into their bog.  The Office of Public Works were quite willing to do it and were prepared to put up £666 if the local people would provide £45.</P>
    <P>This road would open up the bog for 14 families and would put them in a position to sell turf to one of the new power stations the E.S.B. was setting up.  It seemed an excellent proposition, but I got a letter back saying they were not able to provide the £45. I asked them did they realise that the £666 and the £45 was going to be spent among themselves.  I was waiting to get an answer to that, with a view, perhaps, to going down and meeting the people when I got an answer back saying that the correspondence had gone to the parish priest and he had paid the £45.</P>
    <P>It is very wrong to think that money will deal with all the problems that are there.  I would suggest to all concerned with the well-being and the development of the Gaeltacht people and their language that, even though a Minister will have to be some kind of <Col N="494" /> a politician, it would, for a period, be better to entrust the purely Irish-speaking districts to a Minister rather than to a board, however immaculately filleted from the political side, however beautifully white-washed it is, or whatever amount of money it might have.  The proposal the Government has in mind is that a Ministry will be set up.</P>
    <P>It will define at the earliest possible moment&mdash;and it is working on it at the moment&mdash;what the objectives of that Ministry should be, and it will provide whatever machinery is required.  It will minister to the purely Irish-speaking districts.  As far as the services to be provided through the Departments that exist at present are concerned, they will not be removed, but the machinery of these Departments will be strengthened and will be used to concentrate everything in the most effective way.  Then, if there are other things, add the additional touch to the operations of the special Ministry, in whatever way it is decided&mdash;the additional touch that is undoubtedly necessary for these areas.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I suggest, there is no difference as to the result that is required judging by what has been said here.  I feel myself that the appointment of a Minister for the Gaeltacht, in that way and in that spirit, will bring this question into a perspective that it has not been brought into before.  When a board is set up, or a Parliamentary Secretary is appointed, there is nobody sitting in the middle of the Executive Council discussions to watch things.  With so many things to be done by various people, it is often not only very hard to remember all the things that have to be done, but it is very difficult to get in touch with people and to get face-to-face discussion on things.  Therefore, we offer for the Gaeltacht the face-to-face discussion you get around the Cabinet table, and we offer to those who are interested in the Dáil or the Seanad, the opportunity they have&mdash;you have it, particularly, in the Seanad&mdash;of summoning a Minister or moving such a resolution as would draw a Minister in to discuss anything they want to discuss with him.</P>

    <P>So much has been said in this debate that I shall be content with a few brief remarks.  First of all, it is very gratifying to know that this question of the rehabilitation of the Gaeltacht has captured the sympathy of all the people here.  It is very pleasing to know that the rehabilitation of the Gaeltacht and the saving of the Irish language are being regarded as very important national questions because, as I have said, one depends on the other.  As far as I am concerned I am always prepared to support any movement or policy which is calculated to advance the cause of the Gaeltacht and of course as well to improve the position of the Irish language and, above all, to save it from extinction.</P>
    <P>I think it was Senator McHugh who said that the language is dying in the Gaeltacht.  I do not know if I can go as far as the Senator, but at least the language is becoming weaker and we can see the inroads of the English language and of a foreign culture taking place before our eyes day after day. But even though we regret that, at the same time it is not an easy matter to find a solution.  Somebody has said here&mdash;or if nobody has said it I am going to say it now&mdash;that no matter what machinery we set up to achieve the objects we all have in mind, unless there is sincerity behind that machinery and good example, and a will to impress upon the Irish people that this is a great national task we have in hands, it will not succeed.  We have to get the people with us.  I am sure that the majority of the people recognise the importance of this question. It is our duty as public representatives to inculcate a spirit of sacrifice on behalf of the language.  We have to be prepared to make sacrifices. It is all very well for us to say that we will do this and that, but all these things will be of no avail unless each of us is prepared to make some sacrifice for the sake of the language.</P>
    <P>There are many sacrifices we can make individually and collectively. Collectively, it appears to me that the <Col N="498" /> community as a whole will have to be prepared to make the necessary sacrifices. For instance it is not right, in connection with rural electrification, to expect the people of the Gaeltacht, particularly of the Fíor-Ghaeltacht, to bear not alone the same charges as other sections of the community who live in more densely populated places but extra charges because of the fact that they live in a sparsely populated part of the country.  For that they have to pay more.  I am not blaming the E.S.B. because it is the duty of the E.S.B. to calculate what they consider are economic rents and charges. But there must be a national policy in connection with this.  No matter what organisation we set up, whether it is by a Ministry, a Government organisation under a Parliamentary Secretary, a board or a fund under some Government agency, we will have to attend to these things on a national basis, and make sure that the people of the Gaeltacht will get the amenities of life that are available to the other people of the country.</P>
    <P>This is a question fundamental to the whole issue, so I would recommend to the Minister and through him to the Government, that all these matters have to be considered in connection with the setting up of whatever organisation they have in mind at ministerial level.</P>
    <P>Another example, of course, is the fishing industry.  The fishing industry has declined and is continuing to decline by reason of the fact that those engaged in it have not the wherewithal to develop their industry.  Remember, when you talk about the fishing industry, that it is closely related to this problem of the Gaeltacht.  I think it is wrong to ask poor fishermen in those remote parts of the country to pay the huge deposit of 10 per cent. that they have to pay before they can get boats.  I will make one suggestion this evening&mdash;that wherever there are fishing crews operating in the Fíor-Ghaeltacht or even in the Gaeltacht as a whole, where it is proved that the Irish language is the ordinary vehicle of speech of those people, they should get a special reduction in their deposits. That would be a clear and <Col N="499" /> practical recognition of their position and of the importance of the Irish language.</P>
    <P>These are the things that count.  No matter what machinery or organisation you set up here at headquarters these things will have to get consideration as being of fundamental importance to the people living in these remote areas. As I said, I do not want to go into these matters to-day in very much detail.</P>
    <P>The Minister made a very important statement to-day to the effect that a new Ministry is to be set up for the Gaeltacht.  I must confess that I am in a small bit of difficulty in connection with that.  First of all, the motion before us refers to the Fíor-Ghaeltacht. Mind you, when we discuss this matter we must differentiate, or should we, that is the question, between the Fíor-Ghaeltacht and the Breac-Ghaeltacht, and if the organisation, whatever organisation is contemplated, is to be for the Fíor-Ghaeltacht only, I would point out that the Fíor-Ghaeltacht at present is a very contracting and a much diminished entity, and I do not think, even if there is an organisation set up here to do what is intended by this motion in principle, and do what is intended in the amendment to the motion, namely, to set up some means of improving the economic conditions in the Gaeltacht and thereby doing something beneficial for the Irish language it must be done with a clear recognition and understanding of these problems.</P>
    <P>If that is the aim we must bear in mind that it is a two-sided problem. We have the Fíor-Ghaeltacht and the Breac-Ghaeltacht, and I do not think that the organisation set up here should confine itself to the Fíor-Ghaeltacht, because if there are people in the Breac-Ghaeltacht who speak Irish &mdash;and there are plenty&mdash;they are also entitled to recognition and should be included in the Government's scheme.</P>
    <P>Again, I suppose it could be said that fundamentally this problem to set up a Ministry is not an innovation. It could be said that there was something akin to a ministerial organisation working here and it has been working <Col N="500" /> here over a number of years.  The idea, of course, of establishing a full Ministry to look after the requirements of the Gaeltacht was considered but at the time there were certain difficulties found in the way, chief of which was the fact that there are several Departments of State concerned with the Gaeltacht.  All these Departments have already been mentioned and I am not going to weary the House by making any further reference to them but I say that because of this difficulty it was deemed better at the time to set up a sub-department, under the guidance of the Parliamentary Secretary, whose function would be to co-ordinate matters between the various Departments that would be dealing with the Gaeltacht.  Perhaps, as has been said, that did not achieve the results that everybody expected but I submit that some results were achieved and in many cases good results were achieved.</P>
    <P>I think I would be wanting in my duty, because I was at one time associated with that office if I did not pay a tribute to the people in the office of Seirbhísí na Gaeltachta, who made it their business to acquaint themselves with the problems of the Gaeltacht and do everything possible, within the limits of the funds that were made available to them, to advance the economic conditions of the Gaeltacht. They did their best and the only thing that prevented their doing more than they did was that they did not get enough money from the Oireachtas to carry out some of their plans.</P>
    <P>I do not think I shall say much more, but I will end by emphasising in a brief way what I have already said&mdash;that it is our duty to enlist the support of the people generally for the objects we have in view in connection with the Gaeltacht, be it the Fíor-Ghaeltacht or the Breac-Ghaeltacht.  In any case, whatever it would be, would be for the sake of the promotion of the Irish language. Let us not think that it would be possible for us to do anything great without having the people with us. This is the case with all great national causes and so it is the case with the revival of the Irish language and the improvement of the economic conditions <Col N="501" /> in the Gaeltacht, both of which are related to each other.  We must continue to bring home to the people the importance of this task and, when we do that and have set the good example ourselves in connection with the use and spread of the Irish language, we shall get the wholehearted support of the Irish people.  They will be fortified with practical evidence of our sincerity.</P>

      <P>There are some 22 signatures behind this motion and it might seem that, as I am not one of the signatories, I would be automatically opposing the motion.  That is not the case, but I am rather disturbed at the fact that a motion can be canvassed, and with a better and more successful canvass we might easily reach the position where a majority of this House could put their names behind a motion before it was discussed at all.</P>
      <P>As I explained to certain people, I did not know enough about the idea. I would have preferred to see other Senators await the discussion and the argument in the House before making up their minds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The case made by the mover impressed me considerably.  He made a good case in support of the motion.  It seems also that the Minister, when he intervened on behalf of the Government, was prepared to go somewhat further&mdash;to set up a Ministry to deal with this problem.  I wonder whether that meets the desire of Senator <Col N="502" /> McHugh and his colleagues?  I hope it does.</P>
    <P>Senator McHugh underlined the two problems, the linguistic and the economic. I wonder if, in trying to cure the economic ills, the Irish language would in itself be weakened, but I submit that it would be wrong&mdash;and I think the Senator agrees&mdash;that efforts to cure the economic ills should be halted because of any effect that might have on the language problem.  Our citizens in the Gaeltacht are entitled to have everything possible done for them that can be done by the State to enable them to earn a decent livelihood at home.  It would be fatal, however, if simply from the viewpoint of saving the language in the Gaeltacht you should save the language and at the same time destroy the culture and the self-respect of the inhabitants there. You can do that by saying that because these people are speaking Irish they should get help in every direction, much greater than the speakers of English.  That would build up a tradition of speaking the Irish language simply because it pays to do so.</P>
    <P>I hope those who know more about the problem and who understand it better will not think that my note of warning is meant as a criticism of their efforts.  I may be quite wrong: I hope I am.  If the Ministry is set up as the Minister says, I hope that that danger will not develop and that people will not continue to speak Irish merely because of the financial benefit accruing from it.  That might save the language, but it would destroy the culture and the self-respect going with the language.</P>
    <P>I hope the Government will consider siting this Ministry outside Dublin and as near as possible to a Gaeltacht area. A lot will probably be said about that and problems related to it at some later date.  It is not a question of shifting a Department.  When a new Department is set up, there is an opportunity of introducing some sort of decentralisation.  It should be possible to site that Department somewhere outside Dublin.  Galway strikes me as the most suitable place, as there you have a city near a Gaeltacht area.</P>

      <P>I, too, put my name to <Col N="503" /> this motion because I felt it was necessary to have something done for the Gaeltacht.  I spent a holiday once in the Aran Islands.  Most of the people spoke Irish but I felt they wanted more than that.  Senator Kissane referred to the fishing industry.  That is a very appropriate one in a place like the Aran Islands.  In West Cork many people speak Irish, but if we do not give them economic security we cannot expect them to remain so. Although I put my name to the motion, I am more inclined to agree with the proposition of the Minister. It appears to me to be more direct and more practical.  I take it that the Minister will be responsible to the House and therefore, like Senator O'Callaghan, I reserve the right to vote as I think best, for whatever will make the Gaeltacht something in the life of the Irish nation.</P>

      <P>I am one of the signatories to the motion.  I signed it because I did not know enough about it to criticise it as it stood and I was anxious to hear it discussed on its merits.  We have had a fair discussion and it is now a question of deciding what is best&mdash;a board, a development fund or, as we are assured by the Minister, a special Department.  I do not think we have grounds here for division.  I share the concern expressed by Senator Murphy that, even by a Department, a board or a fund we may defeat the object we have in mind.  I feel that that is a risk which must be taken.  We are all genuinely behind the idea that as far as lies within our power the Gaeltacht must be preserved.  On that account, I suggest that this House could do a grave injustice to the Gaeltacht and to those preserving the Gaeltacht, in dividing our own counsels on it.  Like one of the other speakers, I want to make it clear that if I have to decide between the setting up of a Ministry, the setting up of a board or the provision of a fund, I will have to reserve to myself the right to decide how I should vote on that question if the House is divided.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Like other speakers I <Col N="504" /> feel that there is not a very deep conflict between the motion, the amendment and the suggestion put forward by the Minister.  The intention of the motion is laudable and, I think, is accepted by all in the House as desirable.  It is to promote and protect the Irish language in the Fíor-Ghaeltacht areas.</P>
      <P>I have tried to give this matter close attention and I have tried to visualise how this proposed board will operate. <i>Prima facie</i>, it does appeal to one as something which would get work done as against a Department manned by civil servants, who might be more inclined to mark time.  I think most Senators would be impressed by the undoubted progress that has been made by many statutory boards and State companies.  It is true that the E.S.B., the Irish Suger Company, Bord na Móna and other such bodies have, if I may say so, delivered the goods, but their task was to produce goods or services, offer them for sale and dispose of them.  It was purely a business function.</P>
      <P>It is difficult to see how a board setting out to protect the Irish language could discharge that function with an efficiency comparable to that of the boards and companies mentioned.  It would seem to me that the body that must be primarily concerned with the preservation and the protection of the language in the areas where it is spoken is the supreme authority in the nation, that is, the Government.  It is they who have the most far-reaching and effective power, if anyone has it, to deal with this problem.  In that way, I think there would be considerable support for the idea that the Government should be strengthened by having amongst its members a Minister who is directly responsible for this particular work and who can, in the councils of the Government, speak and act in support of this idea.  A board, on the other hand, no matter how efficient, would tend to cut across the various Departments which, in their own way, would be striving to achieve a similar object.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While much is being done for those areas, a considerable amount more might be done.  This is, of course, <Col N="505" /> where the amendment comes in inasmuch as it seeks to provide additional moneys.  We have at the present time a number of Departments which seek to cope with the problems which arise in the Irish-speaking areas.  We have the Office of Public Works; there is provision for employment relief schemes, for social services, old age pensions and other services of that kind; we have also the Land Commission, the Department of Education, which is in a very important position, naturally, and the Department of Local Government dealing with roads and making those areas accessible.  All those Departments do seek in their own way to help the people in the Irish-speaking areas but it seems to me that a special priority could be given to those areas.  If you take, for example, the Land Commission scheme it might be possible to give priority to the areas where people are speaking the Irish language exclusively or mainly, to give them, perhaps, special concessions in regard to the operation of that scheme&mdash;firstly, that the scheme might apply to them more rapidly; and secondly, that their contributions might not be as large as in other areas.</P>
    <P>In addition, there might be a more far-reaching measure of land rehabilitation for those areas, that is, in the provision of lime and fertilisers and other methods of improving the land because it will be recognised that the land is, in the main, inferior.  Then, in the same way, in regard to roads, it might be desirable in respect of private roads leading to the homesteads in these areas, that those roads be provided absolutely free, that there should be 100 per cent. grant against the 75 per cent. or, in some cases, the 90 per cent. grant in other areas.  That is in regard to the rural improvements schemes.  In the same way, in the assistance that has been mentioned to the fishing industry, the financial provisions might be more generous.  Therefore, all down the line of departmental assistance, a greater generosity should be shown to those areas than to any others.</P>
    <P>This poses the question that has been raised by some Senators that there would arise in the Fíor-Ghaeltacht a certain mentality of opportunism, <Col N="506" /> of a desire to commercialise the language and to speak it solely for the purpose of getting paid for speaking it. But I do not think that is likely to occur.  In this connection, we are not favouring so much individuals by being generous to the Fíor-Ghaeltacht.  We are favouring particular areas and those areas happen to be areas where there is not undue wealth; that, I suppose, is putting it mildly because there may be areas where there is considerable poverty.  I think it would not be undesirable if, in the future, the Gaeltacht was to be associated with a certain measure of prosperity rather than that it should be, as in the past, associated with poverty.  Irish-speaking areas are small islands, if you like, surrounded completely by the sea, the turbulent sea of English.</P>

      <P>When the House adjourned I was suggesting that as a contribution to the preservation of the Irish-speaking areas, special generosity should be shown in the administration of the various schemes which are in operation in rural areas.  Those include, of course, rural electrification, land reclamation, road improvements, the fishing industry and also schemes for the development of vegetable growing, fruit growing, poultry, pigs and other branches of agriculture which are desirable in an area of small holdings. While those schemes may be generous enough as far as the country as a whole is concerned they could, perhaps, be made even more generous in those particular areas.  I think that would be something to which a Minister specially appointed for those areas could direct his attention.  I would like to ask if the Minister, or someone on his behalf, could inform us when this new Ministry will be established. It is a fairly far-reaching proposal and it may be a valuable one.  At least I think it should be given a trial.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think this debate was a useful one and I would like to say in conclusion that I think Senator Stanford's contribution was rather valuable, inasmuch as he pointed out that, in addition to those who favour the preservation of <Col N="507" /> Irish-speaking areas as a means towards the eventual establishment of the Gaelic language as the spoken language of the entire nation, there is also a substantial minority, for whom he spoke, who would also favour the preservation of the Irish language in those areas, as he said, as a contribution to the variety of elements which make up this State.  I think, therefore, that this motion is not one that calls for disunity or division in this House. We are all rather united in seeking to have something effective done.  I do not think there is any necessity for a division.  As far as the establishment of a board is concerned, I would welcome any type of board if it could be shown it had useful work to do and work which it could do.  I should like perhaps to see&mdash;I have suggested it in the House before&mdash;a board set up for the purpose of the better utilisation and development of really waste land, mountain and marginal land, which might not be suitable for forestry or for the purposes of the Land Commission, but which could be developed by a land utilisation board.  As I envisage it, such a board would have a much wider sphere of operation than merely in the Fíor-Ghaeltacht or Breac-Ghaeltacht areas.  I think any board, as far as one can visualise a board on the lines indicated in this motion, would rather tend to add something to the confusion which already exists than eliminate it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The announcement by the Minister of the implementation of one of the points of the programme of the inter-Party Government, that a Ministry is now to be set up, alters my view to a considerable extent as to the necessity for the formation of a separate board to deal with the problem of the Gaeltacht.  It is obvious to everyone who is familiar with the position in that area that something much more drastic will require to be done in order even to retain the depleted population which now exists there.  I noted, in the report of the Gaeltacht Commission of 1925, that the population of certain electoral divisions in the Fíor-Ghaeltacht in my county was then 24,770.  I extracted the figures of the population in those electoral divisions in the 1951 census and I find <Col N="509" /> there is a reduction of over 4,000 in these particular areas.  That would mean a reduction of approximately 15 per cent.  Apart from the reduction in the population, as Senator McHugh has already pointed out, there has been a tremendous decrease in the number of people in those particular areas who use Irish as their ordinary language at the moment.  I think the House will agree that it is largely an economic problem.  The land in those areas is not sufficient to maintain the population there and a considerable amount of the agricultural produce which they consume has to be imported.  As the family budget of the average Gaeltacht household is made up from many different sources&mdash;as it has to be, of necessity&mdash;to my mind it is essential to have a much greater industrial programme for that particular area if we are to maintain that population.</P>
      <P>While the Undeveloped Areas Act may have decentralised industries throughout the country, the fact that industries financed under it could be established in provincial towns like Tralee, Galway, Ballina, Sligo and Letterkenny inevitably means that industrialists will establish themselves in those particular areas because they are much nearer to railways and other transport facilities and to centres of consumption.  In consequence, few, if any, industries have been established in the Fíor-Ghaeltacht as such.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Murphy mentioned the fact that it is doubtful whether we can achieve an Irish-speaking population if we establish industries in those areas, but the alternative is that those people will emigrate to Britain and the U.S.A., and there is a much greater chance of permitting them to retain their native language in their own areas than if they are exported to other countries.  There is a tremendous tradition of emigration from the Gaeltacht areas, and there is a particular draw from those districts at present because colonies from them have established themselves in various parts of Britain, and because the wages paid to those men who are prepared to work very hard and the allowances they are granted under the <Col N="510" /> income-tax code in Britain in connection with dependents allow them to have a very substantial income, and one which industrialists in those parts of the country cannot compete against.</P>
    <P>For that reason I would suggest that the Minister should consider giving certain facilities to industries which are or may be established in the Fíor-Ghaeltacht. I have in mind a firm where two members of a family owned a business of the same type that Gaeltarra Éireann carry on.  That business was situated in the Breac-Ghaeltacht, and a considerable amount of its activities was carried on in the Fíor-Ghaeltacht. One member of the firm died about four or five years ago, and the surviving member of the family has now died.  The estate duties that will be paid will be considerably over one-third of the total assets of that individual, and therefore of that company. That is going to affect very seriously the further development of the company and the carrying of a fairly substantial amount of stock which is required at various times of the year.</P>
    <P>As the Government has now given tremendous concessions to Canadians to establish copper mines in Wicklow, I suggest that they could easily grant tax concessions to industrialists who are now in the Gaeltacht or who are prepared to go into it.  It is just as important to develop and retain our population in the Fíor-Ghaeltacht as it is to provide employment for the people in places like Wicklow.  Private enterprise, to my mind, should be encouraged and bolstered up as much as possible, and when you consider that private enterprise in the Gaeltacht is competing with Gaeltarra Éireann, who are not liable for corporation profits tax, for ordinary schedules E and D tax or tax on dividends, and that they may have certain concessions in connection with rates on their buildings, it seems that the State industry has a tremendous advantage.  The private industrialist has to make a profit in order to justify himself, whereas the State industry may be subsidised to a fair extent by the Department of Finance.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt about the fact that <Col N="511" /> various Governments have done a fair amount for the development of the Gaeltacht in the way of turf-burning stations, Gaeltacht roads, housing, and water supplies, but a great deal more must be done if our people are to remain in those particular areas.  In connection with mineral resources, I feel that a much more detailed survey of those areas could be done.  There is no doubt that there are lead and silver and other mineral resources in those areas which have not been sufficiently surveyed as to their potential development.  Similarly in connection with afforestation.  At the moment there is a certain amount of hit and run in the sense that the Department only survey or are interested in land which is offered to them.  There is a good deal of suitable land which could be acquired if the officials of the Forestry Section of the Department went out and surveyed those areas. The Government could give a certain amount of priority to land for the development of afforestation in the Gaeltacht areas.</P>
    <P>As Senator Hawkins has already remarked, the fact that it will reduce the sheep population and the annual income of the sheep farmers, since they must wait for a considerable number of years before the timber matures and there is much work in connection with the thinning of the trees and the development of roads through those forests, may not make it a very attractive proposition for many land owners in those areas.  The amount that is offered is to my mind very niggardly.  The land of those people is valuable, and the fact that it is their home and, as some Minister said on one occasion, the place where they spend their holidays from their work in England makes it particularly valuable to them.</P>
    <P>I also feel that a good deal of further development could be done in connection with the salmon industry and that if more hatcheries were established and the rivers better protected it would give a very good return.</P>
    <P>In connection with the herring industry in Donegal, at the moment the <Col N="512" /> small inshore fisherman is complaining about the fact that cross-Channel boats, which have now been registered in Dublin, have come down with radar. They ring the herring, which is not done for the inshore fisherman, and have the markets in the city, and when the inshore fishermen get their herring to the big centres of consumption they find that the market has already been glutted with the catches of these bigger boats.</P>
    <P>Again, the fishermen are laying up their boats and there is further emigration in consequence.  Because the new Minister for the Gaeltacht will have a seat in the Cabinet and because he can co-ordinate the work of the various Departments, provided there are sufficient funds made available to him, we may achieve what was intended by the motion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. McHugh</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall be as brief as possible, because I feel I am fighting a losing cause.  But it was worth arguing the case in favour of a board as against a Ministry.  I should like to deal very briefly with some of the remarks made.  Senator Hawkins and Senator Ruane pointed out that there was no parallel between the case of the board that this motion envisages and Bord na Móna or the E.S.B.  It was only in one or two aspects that I compared them, in that these boards showed that a board can be independent, non-political and at the same time efficient.  I realise that their methods of operation and what they have to achieve are very different. Certainly on those other points there is a correspondence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards Senator Hawkins's numerous questions, there is only one, I think, that need detain us very long and that was answered already by another Senator.  Senator Hawkins asked whether this board would take over the functions of other Departments such as the Department of Local Government, the Department of Education and so on.  I am sure that nothing I said could have led him to draw that conclusion.  I would like to be quite clear.  I do not visualise this board taking over what would be the functions of these Departments any <Col N="513" /> more than a Ministry for the Gaeltacht would take over existing Departments.</P>
    <P>I would like to quote again from the memorandum of Comhdháil Náisiúnta na Gaeilge on this very point.  It seems to me to be very reasonable.  It says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Inevitably the field of the board would overlap that of Government Departments, local authorities, and other public bodies operating in the Gaeltacht, but with common sense and goodwill no difficulties need arise, since the board's function would be to supplement and not replace what is already being done... Thus the board would not itself generate electricity, or build vocational schools, or engage in reafforestation but it might take the initial steps and supply the additional funds which would secure the doing of such things where they would not otherwise be done.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It seems reasonable to me to suggest that, where independent action is possible to establish industries and promote employment, the board would possibly do that independently of any existing Department but, where co-operation with existing Departments or institutions is called for, the board would naturally co-operate and proceed in any way to help to advance the objects for which it was designed.</P>
    <P>I was asked by Senator Hayes what a board could do that a Department could not do.  I think I anticipated him to some extent by making the points in my opening speech that a board&mdash;and this is extremely important&mdash;could be independent; that it is flexible and, further, that it can be responsible directly to the Government in the way in which Bord na Móna, the E.S.B. and other boards are responsible. You would not have to go through the confusion of inter-departmental relations or inter-departmental political relations or between the commissioners and whatever officials you had to carry out the work of the Ministry to the Gaeltacht.  You would not have the inevitable hold-up by having to play off one Department against another.  You would not have to put up with one group of political <Col N="514" /> interests conflicting with another group and where, in the last analysis, all these conflicting claims would have to come before the Department of Finance.</P>
    <P>I believe in the system which operates in the case of these independent boards, rather than in the remote control that operates in the case of Government Departments and which would operate, particularly in this case, where different Departments would be inevitably involved.</P>
    <P>I come to what is really the big argument against my suggestion of a board, and that is the alternative suggested by the Minister.  He has indicated quite clearly that the Government has given serious consideration&mdash; and is still doing so&mdash;to a separate Ministry for the Gaeltacht.  Let me very briefly make these points again, against the Ministry as against the board.  Experience suggests that whatever efforts have been made by Government Departments have provided, in fact, no large scale solution of the Gaeltacht problem.  Secondly, civil servants are to a large extent bound up by red tape, routine and a rather rigid system.  This task calls for something more flexible, something more imaginative and something which demands an almost crusading zeal. Further, there is the matter of responsibility, which I have already dealt with.</P>
    <P>Finally, and this is a matter I have already touched upon, a Government Department would be subject to very strong political pressure, which would not necessarily have its eyes on the target&mdash;the target of saving and developing the Gaeltacht.  This motion has been on the Order Paper since last July, if not longer.  Some Senators said that they put their names down because they did not understand what the motion was about, but they had a good opportunity of finding out between last July and November.  I can give some of them credit for being quite sincere, seeing that they have put their names to the resolution and finding they have to vote against it.  They have an excellent precedent because Richard Lovell Edgeworth, who spoke <Col N="515" /> for the Act of Union also voted against it.  I take it that the Senators who have changed their mind are quite entitled to do so, and a consideration with them is possibly the suggestion advanced by the Minister&mdash;a separate Ministry for the Gaeltacht.</P>
    <P>I cannot withdraw this motion without consulting at least 17 people.  Even if four or five of those who spoke changed their minds, I happen to believe that a board is the best and only way to ensure that the Gaeltacht can be saved.  I think we are quite entitled to have a division.  I do not think the division will do the cause of the Gaeltacht itself any harm.  It merely indicates that we differ as to the methods.  I hope that these young organisations like Comhdháil Náisiúnta na Gaeilge and Muinntir na Gaeltachta will not feel too distressed if the motion is lost.  Because they are a young organisation in close contact with the Gaeltacht, they have helped to convince me that their agitation for a board is justified.  I hope they will not despair if the resolution is lost.  If the Ministry is established, it may work&mdash;I certainly will help it in any way I can&mdash;but I hope the question is simply not going to be put on the long finger.  It is a long time coming into existence and it should not be shelved any further.</P>

      <P>I am sorry that Senator McHugh calls upon us to <Col N="516" /> divide, having regard to the tone of the speeches here to-day and to the statement made by the Minister, lest the whole action in dividing the House may be taken in certain quarters as prejudicial to the interests of the Gaeltacht.</P>

      <P>Senator McHugh expressly hoped that Muinntir na Gaeltachta and Comhdháil Náisiúnta na Gaeilge would not be disappointed in the board being turned down by a vote of the Seanad.  I would like to draw the attention of Senators to the fact that the Taoiseach, accompanied by Dr. O'Donovan, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Government, received in his office the following members of the Comhdháil, on the 1st September, 1954: Earnán de Blaghd, Uachtarán; Liam Ó Luanaigh, Leas-Uachtarán; Seán Ó hEigeartaigh, Cisteóir; and Brian Mac Cafaidh, Stiúrthóir.  On behalf of the Comhdháil, satisfaction was expressed with the proposal to establish a Government Department for the Gaeltacht and it was said that it was a positive move by the Government to do something for the people of the area.  Certain discussions took place as to the steps to be taken in setting up the Government Department. Therefore, the Senator would be under a misapprehension if he thought it would be any disappointment to the Comhdháil that a Department should be set up in accordance with the Government's stated plan.</P>
      <P>Motion put and declared lost.</P>
      <P>The Seanad adjourned at 7.50 until 3 p.m. on Wednesday, 9th November, 1955.</P>
