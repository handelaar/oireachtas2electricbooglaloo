    <Title>Industrial Relations (Amendment) Bill, 1954&mdash;Second and Subsequent Stages.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Crotty)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is clearly indicated in the Long Title, from which Senators will see that it is merely to extend to persons employed by local authorities Part VI of the Industrial Relations Act, 1946.</P>
      <P>The Industrial Relations Act, 1946, which set up the Labour Court has been in operation for nearly nine years and I think it cannot be disputed that the Bill has achieved a substantial measure of success.  The Labour Court with its associated facilities for conciliation has undoubtedly avoided the eruption of industrial disputes which could only have resulted in economic distress both for the people immediately concerned and for the community generally.  It is against this background of achievement that the present Bill has been conceived.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is the declared policy of the Government to provide for employees of local authorities a scheme of conciliation and arbitration.  Senators will recall that schemes of conciliation and arbitration are already in existence for civil servants and primary and secondary school teachers.  The Minister for Education recently announced an extension of this latter scheme to embrace vocational teachers; and the Minister for Local Government recently received a deputation from the Local Government Officials' Union, who sought the establishment of arbitration machinery and to whom he indicated that he would give earnest consideration to their <Col N="406" /> proposals in consultation with the other Ministers involved.</P>
    <P>The House will recall the long discussions which took place during the enactment of the Industrial Relations Act, 1946.  It was generally accepted at the time that the measure was in the nature of an experiment. Various categories of workers were specifically excluded by the provisions of the 1946 Act from access to the Labour Court or to its conciliation machinery.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce has always felt very strongly that the employees who were generally classed as servants of various local bodies should not be denied access to the Labour Court. He had hoped originally that in widening the scope of the Industrial Relations Act it would not have been necessary to make any distinction between officers and servants of local authorities but after full consultation with his colleagues in the Government whose Departments are concerned in the conditions of employment of local authority officers, he has come to the conclusion that there are too many practical difficulties in the way of including in the Bill the classes generally described as officers.</P>
    <P>In this connection, it should, perhaps, be mentioned that an association which claims to represent 80 per cent. of the officers employed by local authorities coming under the jurisdiction of the Department of Local Government, represented to the Ministers for Local Government and Industry and Commerce that they wished to have excluded from this amending Bill the officers represented by the association. In so far as officers in general are concerned, there is a regular hierarchy of authorities who in one degree or another have a say, but not an exclusive say, in the conditions of employment of the officers.  Because of this we get far away from the simple direct relationship of employer and employee and it does seem that some type of machinery other than that envisaged in the 1946 Act would be better suited and more appropriate for investigating the claims of officers as a class in regard to their conditions of employment.  It is recognised, of course, that there may be exceptions <Col N="407" /> to that general rule and the Bill makes provisions accordingly.</P>
    <P>It will be seen from Section 2 of the Bill that Part VI of the 1946 Act, which deals with the investigation of trade disputes by the Labour Court itself, or through its conciliation conferences, is being extended to include the servants of local authorities, vocational education committees and committees of agriculture.  The term &ldquo;local authority&rdquo; includes corporations and county councils, port sanitary authorities and the various committees, joint committees or boards which have been established by any of the county councils or corporations.  The biggest single class to benefit by this extension will be some 30,000 county council road workers.  Other types of workers who would be embraced by the term &ldquo;servant&rdquo; would be&mdash;water-keepers, scavengers, messengers, porters, caretakers, cleaners and forestry workers, where these are employed by committees of agriculture, as in the Counties of Kildare and Donegal.</P>
    <P>Before considering the last three categories of workers mentioned in sub-section (1) of Section 2 of the Bill, perhaps I should invite attention to sub-section (2) of Section 2, which provides that the Government may, by Order, extend the meaning of &ldquo;worker&rdquo; in Part VI of the 1946 Act to include any specified class of officer of a local authority.  Many classes of workers are designated officers although it would appear that their duties are not substantially different from those of other employees classed as servants.  We have provided in this sub-section the necessary machinery to enable us to deal with any anomalies arising out of this situation.</P>
    <P>It was anticipated that, as soon as the Bill was enacted, a case would be made to include within it health inspectors, nurses employed by a mental hospital authority and certain officers of public assistance authorities.  As an alternative and to avoid the necessity for the making of a separate Government Order in respect of these classes, the Government gave authority to include them immediately in the Bill, even though these three <Col N="408" /> groups of employees are classed as officers and not as servants.</P>
    <P>This Bill sets out to provide for certain classes of workers the right of access to the Labour Court for the settlement of disputes arising out of their employment.  Whether or not they avail of that right is a matter entirely for themselves; they cannot be compelled to do so.</P>
    <P>I feel confident that Senators will have no hesitation in supporting this measure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrederickHawkins" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome any proposals that would remove from the controversy of the local authority the very vexed question of demands for increases in wages that have often led to difficulties on our local bodies, but I am very doubtful as to whether the proposal before us to-day is the best approach to this question.  Just a short few weeks ago we passed through this House the City and County Management (Amendment) Bill.  One of the proposals in that Bill which was stressed very much as giving back some additional power to the local authority was the right of fixing remuneration for their employees.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Local Government piloted that Bill through this and the other House and drew the attention of members to this important section.  He pointed out that it was one which would be welcomed particularly by the local authorities and their employees. Although the Parliamentary Secretary referred to road workers to-day he also pointed out that the Government were taking power to extend access to the Labour Court to practically every section of local employees who wished to avail of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That being the case, we should, I think, consider the purpose for which the Labour Court was first established. Nobody in this or the other House at the time the Bill proposing to set up the Labour Court was before us had any idea that the court would be asked to consider questions in relation to the remuneration of local employees.  The court was set up and the personnel chosen because of their experience in the field of trade unionism or because <Col N="409" /> they were representatives of the employers' association.</P>
    <P>I do not know if any member of the Labour Court, as at present constituted, has ever been a member of a local authority or has any intimate knowledge of local authority work. They have been chosen because of their knowledge and experience of trade unionism on the one side and as representatives of the employers on the other.  That is as it should be, but we are now bringing in a very wide field, one in which there is great interest.</P>
    <P>There are a few questions I would like to ask the Minister to answer so as to clarify the position before we pass the Bill.  The first is&mdash;is it proposed to supplement the membership of the court by adding some person or persons who may have an intimate knowledge of the work of local authorities? I think that would be very essential.  The second is&mdash;will the employers have an opportunity of having their representatives present to give advice before a decision is reached? In the case of the employees of a local authority those most concerned, but those who cannot to my mind be represented at a hearing, are the ratepayers and the persons representing them on the local authority are their elected representatives.</P>
    <P>We must ask ourselves at least three questions in connection with this.  The first is&mdash;when the application is made to the Labour Court who is going to represent the employers, the local authorities?  It is the county manager or two or three members of the local authority?  I can well imagine that a ratepayers' organisation which has no representation on that particular local authority or one individual ratepayer who might be interested in the matter may feel that the demands made are not justified and that they wish as ratepayers to be in a position to make the case of the ratepayers before the court makes a decision.</P>
    <P>There is no use in saying these matters will be decided by the local authority because the appeal to the Labour Court is, one might say, the last step before a strike.  The application <Col N="410" /> I imagine would have been made to the local authority to grant the workers' demands; the local authority would have considered it and made a decision.  That decision, prior to the passing of the County Management (Amendment) Act, was a decision that the county manager would make. Now we have passed on that to the local authority and it is the local authority which will have made a decision either to accept or reject the demand. If they accept there will be no appeal, but if they reject, it is against that decision the workers will now have the right to appeal.  Who is going to put the local authority's case before the court?  It is important that somebody should have that right and if you open the doors of this court to such a wide range of people as local authority employees you must also make provision for the individual ratepayer and ratepayers' organisations if they wish to be represented.</P>
    <P>Having made a recommendation, that recommendation will come before the local authority and I would welcome some form of organisation to deal with that.  I am not satisfied this is the best way to do it.  The Labour Court has been very successful up to this, avoiding quite a number of trade disputes, and its recommendations have been received in the spirit in which they have been made but there is grave danger that in passing this Bill we are going to bring this body into open discussion by every local authority.  When the recommendations come back to the local authority&mdash;and all the Labour Court can do is to make a recommendation&mdash;we will have one side or another criticising a Labour Court decision, pointing out that it was not justified in one way or another.  That is another reason I would advance against the proposals in this Bill.</P>
    <P>In bringing this Bill to the House the Minister did not seem to feel very confident himself that it was the best approach and he suggested: &ldquo;Well, it is the best we can do at the moment; we will see how it will work out for a year or two, and if it is not successful we can see what we can do.  I think that is a bad approach.  I think the Minister must make his mind up that this is the best that can be done and <Col N="411" /> that all Parties must make the best they can of it.  If it is to be just an experiment, and if, having dragged the Labour Court into discussion at every local authority meeting, somebody then has to come along in a year or two and say: &ldquo;This thing has not been as successful as we wished it to be: we must now set up some new organisation&rdquo;, serious damage will have been done to the prestige of the Labour Court.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is any great demand for this Bill by employees of local authorities.  Only in very few cases have local authority employees had to resort to strike action.  Members of local authorities usually include representatives of organised labour and all the representatives, no matter to what Party they belong, live in the area and understand the workers' conditions.  On the whole they have been sympathetic to any demands made by the workers regarding remuneration or conditions.  Local authorities are not bad employers.</P>
    <P>Another question will arise.  In making its decision at present in relation to any dispute that comes before it the Labour Court can make a recommendation that will apply to that particular industry whatever it may be, and if a recommendation is made that such-and-such a section of workers should receive an increase in remuneration or certain conditions these conditions apply to that type of employee throughout the country or throughout the area for which the application was made.</P>
    <P>The position is different in regard to local authorities.  Is the Labour Court, in making a recommendation for increased remuneration or particular conditions of employment, going to make that recommendation apply to every local authority if the court suggests that it should apply, say, to the workers of Cork County Council or Corporation?  Is the same scale of wages and conditions to be applied to local authority workers in some of the poor counties like Leitrim?  We have had these difficulties with local authorities where those who advocate increases in remuneration <Col N="412" /> and better conditions always point out the better off county and say: &ldquo;Workers in such and such a county have received these increases for so long, their conditions are so and so and there is no reason why this county should not come up to the same standard.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There is a number of difficulties in relation to conditions of employment and wages.  I want it to be clearly understood that I am not pointing out the difficulties because of any antagonism to the workers.  It is rather the other way round and I would like to see some organisation, perhaps a separate organisation, with representatives of persons who have a knowledge of the working of local authorities and representatives of the workers' organisations.  The road workers have organisations of their own, as have the nurses and all the other classes of employees; of course the clerical workers of the local authorities, who have an organisation of their own, have asked to be excluded because they have other means of putting their case for increased remuneration or better conditions before the Department.</P>
    <P>There is still another difficulty in this matter.  When the Labour Court makes a recommendation for improved conditions to any other section of workers it is only a matter for the employer to consider whether he is in a position or whether he is prepared to give it or not.  Usually, he passes that on to the consumer, and the local authority can pass it on to the ratepayer. That is all very fine, but no increase can be made by the local authority.  Even though we did provide that they would have a say in the County Management Bill, the final act must rest with the Minister for Local Government and his Department.  He must either sanction or refuse to sanction the recommendations after the local authority have accepted the recommendations of the Labour Court. Then they have to go a step further to the Minister who must make the final decision.  Therefore, there is no analogy between the relationship of the worker and the employer on the one hand, where their cases have gone <Col N="413" /> and will go to the Labour Court, and, on the other hand, the employees and the local authority.</P>
    <P>Although I welcome any proposal for setting up machinery to deal with this question, I have grave doubts that this is the best means of dealing with it and still graver doubts because of the Minister's own suggestion that he was not satisfied, that we could take it for 12 months and after 12 months or two years we could reconsider the whole question.  I suggest that a great deal of damage will be done to the prestige of the Labour Court and to the likelihood of its recommendations being accepted by the workers.  We should be satisfied that this is the best court and this is the best organisation we can find to deal with this matter and that there will be no such suggestion as: &ldquo;We will try this and if it fails we will try something else.&rdquo;  We should make up our minds that this is the best approach but if we are not satisfied let us hold our hand for the time being, reconsider the whole question and see if we can find some other form of organisation that will have a better chance of working, because of the knowledge and experience of the persons representing local authorities on the one side and employees of the local authority on the other.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGuire</NameTxt>
      <P>At first sight, this Bill would seem to be a desirable thing in giving these new persons an approach to the Labour Court and access to its conciliation machinery.  I must say, however, having listened to Senator Hawkins's remarks, that he did put his finger on some difficulties that will have to be considered.  First of all, he challenged the competence of the court.  Was it competent to hear this particular type of case?  As this organisation was set up to deal with industrial relations as between employers and employees and even in connection with State industries, I do not think his objections to the competence of the court really hold water.  He suggested that it would be necessary to have somebody on the court, on the employer's side, who would be familiar with the work of the county councils <Col N="414" /> and their method of dealing with their employees.  I do not think that objection is valid because the fact is that a county council is an employer like anybody else and the principles of industrial relations apply no matter who the employer is, whether it is the State, a county council, a corporation or an individual.  If you pushed that to its logical conclusion you would find that every industry would be making out that the court would want to have employers in their particular industry sitting as members.</P>
      <P>Senator Hawkins put the question as to whether this was the best course to take in dealing with the problem.  I do not see what alternative there is to this.  What is being done in this Bill is to give these workers an extension of the opportunities to which they can resort in the future to establish their claims for better wages and conditions of employment.  I think I am right in saying that Senator Hawkins has not given any alternative.  In fact, there is no alternative.  I think the Labour Court is the only vehicle that can be used for this purpose.</P>
      <P>I agree with Senator Hawkins when he mentioned the many difficulties that arise when the Labour Court does adjudicate on these particular cases we have envisaged in this Bill.  The idea of the Labour Court is a very good one but unfortunately it is not being used at present in the spirit in which it was set up.  I am sorry to say that it is very often abused and, where it is used, it is used merely for the purpose of raising the ante.  At the moment there appears to be what almost approximates to a campaign on the part of organised labour to avoid the Labour Court.  We had an example of that yesterday.  I think that is a pity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position seems to be now that where employees think they will do well by taking their dispute to the Labour Court, they go to the Labour Court; but, where they feel they have not a very good case, they refuse to go to the Labour Court.  They prefer to fight their case by strike action.  It was to avoid strike action the Labour Court <Col N="415" /> was originally set up; but very often now unjust claims are pushed, claims which are ultimately hurtful to the workers themselves, by strike action and the Labour Court is ignored.  I think that is a pity and I am afraid that the same abuses will arise in the future.</P>
    <P>Senator Hawkins also put his finger on another point.  He referred to the fact that where the Labour Court adjudicates in a particular case it may set a high rate of wages and conditions of employment based on the richest industry or the richest employer involved, or, as in this particular instance, the richest county council.  All others involved in that dispute, irrespective of whether or not they are in a position to do so, will be made to follow suit.  That is the pattern at the moment.  Where the Labour Court is availed of, the findings of that court are made to apply to everybody concerned irrespective of ability to pay. I think that is a fault in the present machinery though, on the whole, I think the idea of going before the Labour Court is a good one provided the machinery is used in the way in which it was intended it should be used when it was originally established.</P>
    <P>It is desirable that there should be some sort of final court in industrial relations, the findings of which would be binding and to which the two partners in industry could go, prepared to abide by the findings of that court. Unfortunately, that does not happen at the moment and it is only possible in the field of industrial relations to achieve peace and harmony through the goodwill of both sides.  That has been pointed out again and again. Recently a rail strike paralysed England.  It was felt by many people there that the time had come when the Government should take some steps to avoid these upsets to industry: but Sir Walter Monckton had to admit that there was no court one could set up which could force decisions on workers because of the magnitude of the workers' organisations.  If the workers will not abide by a decision, then nobody can force <Col N="416" /> that decision upon them since one is dealing with thousands of people and one cannot fine them all.  The success or failure, therefore, of negotiating machinery in industrial relations is dependent upon the goodwill as between the participants.</P>
    <P>Despite all the objections put forward by Senator Hawkins to this proposal, I cannot see any better one. With all its faults, I think it represents the best that can be done.  The only thing which will make this machinery work satisfactorily will be the adoption of a responsible attitude on the part of the councils, which are the employers, and on the part of the workers, who will probably be represented by trade unions.  Senator Hawkins asked who would put the council's case.  One might as well ask who would put Messrs. Guinness's case.  Guinness is not constituted of one man only, and in the event of an industrial dispute Messrs. Guinness would appoint an expert to act for them just as they would appoint counsel to act for them in a lawsuit.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DominickMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important in this matter that we should deal with the principles enshrined in this Bill and not allow ourselves to be drawn into an unhelpful discussion of the Labour Court and the present difficulties that exist in the matter of industrial relations. I do not think any question arises here as to the success or failure of the Labour Court and I do not think a discussion along those lines can help anybody at the present time.  Indeed, I think such a discussion should be avoided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the Bill itself, I would say without qualification that it is a very welcome one.  I could never understand why the Labour Court, which was established to maintain peace in industrial relations as far as possible, should not have its doors thrown open to the employees of local authorities merely because those employees happened to be working for local authorities and not for private employers.  It is quite true that the question of fixing wages and conditions of service for workers or servants of local authorities is full of complications.  I agree with Senator Hawkins in that.  Does it <Col N="417" /> make the position less complicated to, debar such workers or servants from going to the Labour Court?  I do not think it does.  I think the Labour Court should be available to them.  I think it is wrong that trade unions representing local employees should be debarred from making a case to the Labour Court simply because they represent local employees.</P>
    <P>This extension of the duties and work of the Labour Court raises the question as to whether there should be an extension of personnel on that body.  That is a matter which deserves examination.  I understand the T.U.C. has already made representations to the Minister in that matter.  Obviously there is need for an extension of the personnel, need for having people with knowledge and experience of local authorities represented on the Labour Court so that that court will be in a position to deal adequately with the duties placed upon it.</P>
    <P>In a discussion on another Bill I mentioned the question of negotiating machinery for officers of local authorities and I was very pleased to hear the Parliamentary Secretary say that the question of setting up separate internal machinery for these people was under examination.  I pointed out then that, while the Labour Court was excellent in principle, it was recognised that the setting up of internal machinery was most desirable.  Where there is a union anxious to set up such machinery and willing to accept its responsibilities in that matter, the Government should do everything possible to facilitate the setting up of such machinery.  I pointed out that there was in operation in England and Wales a joint council in the case of officers of local authorities.  I can see no reason why we should not establish a similar council here provided the union is willing and anxious to have that type of machinery.</P>
    <P>The problem relating to the servants of local authorities, particularly the 30,000 odd road workers, is somewhat different and I think it is very welcome to have the machinery of the Labour Court thrown open to the representatives of these people.  I <Col N="418" /> hope they will avail of the Labour Court and that that court will be able satisfactorily to deal with the problems which will confront it in the new duties placed upon it by this measure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>While there is not very much objection to this Bill, even the Parliamentary Secretary will admit that neither he nor anyone else who has spoken in favour of it has made a strong or convincing case.  It is not true to say, as has been said, that local authorities are in exactly the same position as other employers.  In the main, the ordinary employer is a person who is carrying on a business or industry and who is endeavouring to make a profit or, at least to avoid a loss through the management of the business.  An elected local authority is in an entirely different position.  It is a body which may be said to hold a balance, so to speak, between its employees and those who benefit by its expenditure and those who provide the money.  It is a difficult rôle, as we all know, and a complex one, as members of local authorities well know.</P>
      <P>The position of the private employer is altogether different.  He can come into court and say: &ldquo;I would like to meet the claims that are being made but, if I do, my business will show a loss and I will be unable to carry on and continue to give employment.&rdquo;  He may make that case.  The local authority, on the other hand, can always be told that if a claim has to be met, it can be met by an increased demand upon the ratepayers and that revenue can always be increased to meet expenditure.  There is that vital difference between a local authority and a private employer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we accept the principle that employees of local authorities should be encouraged to put their claims before the Labour Court, is it not equally true that employees of the State should also have the right to go before the Labour Court, that is to say, that members of the Defence Forces, members of the Garda, post office employees and all the innumerable people, civil servants, should have the right to bring <Col N="419" /> their case to the Labour Court if the Labour Court is of such benefit?</P>
    <P>However, because of the special difficulties of the position, there has been set up a special arbitration procedure for dealing with civil servants' claims and that would seem to indicate that a similar procedure should operate in regard to employees of local authorities. Local authorities are part and parcel of the State.  They are public bodies, elected by the people, giving employment, maintaining social services.</P>
    <P>I should like, Sir, to call your attention to the fact that, when Senators on this side of the House are speaking, Senator Hayes usually starts a very animated conversation and it is very difficult for anybody to concentrate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I apologise to the Senator.  I have noticed that he is very capable of concentrating for long periods.  I am sorry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that apology.  I was suggesting that, since it has been found necesary and desirable to set up a special tribunal to deal with the claims of servants and employees of the State, it should be equally desirable to apply the same or similar machinery to employees of local authorities, because civil servants and local employees are more or less on an equal footing; they are both employees of an elected public authority, they are both employees of the elected representatives of the people and, therefore, in all fairness, similar provision should be made for them.</P>
      <P>The ordinary representative of the employers is not competent to deal with the kind of problems that will come before the Labour Court if employees of local authorities make their claims there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is in this Bill what I consider a bad principle, that is, the making of a distinction between what might be described as the officers and the noncommissioned officers of the local authorities, the distinction that is made between officers of local authorities and servants of the local authorities. Why that distinction should be <Col N="420" /> made, I do not know.  It is undesirable and will lead to complications.</P>
    <P>There is provision in the Bill to bring in, at the Minister's discretion, by Order, a certain number of officers of local authorities.  There, again, there will be a good deal of influence exerted as to what particular types are to be brought in and what particular types are to be left out.  If you go on and extend the principle until you bring all officers of local authorities under the Labour Court the question will arise, why should not the Labour Court operate in regard to employees and permanent officials of the State?</P>
    <P>I think the Government have been rather hasty in the introduction of this Bill or, at least, they have not given the matter full consideration.  It should have been possible to set up, if necessary, a special tribunal to deal with the type of problem that arises out of local government employment.  It must be remembered that local government employment is of a very varied nature. There are permanent employees, both officers and servants, under local authorities.  It must be remembered, also, that there is a vast body of road workers.  I think the Parliamentary Secretary mentioned a figure of 30,000. An extraordinary problem arises in regard to those because, in giving employment to road workers, a county council is not always actuated by the consideration of getting the roads maintained or made but sometimes is actuated by the consideration of providing a kind of social service for the relief of unemployment.</P>
    <P>I came up against this problem in a very vital way recently.  When I consulted with a local engineer in regard to methods of roadmaking, he told me that, by the introduction of modern methods, mechanised methods of roadmaking it would be possible to reduce the number of men employed by the county council to less than one-fourth. One can imagine what that would mean in the distress it might cause amongst a large number of people who depend for their living on such employment.  It will be seen, therefore, that it is not really the same position as an employer who employs <Col N="421" /> men in order to carry on his business.  Sometimes he may be actuated by generosity in perhaps keeping on some men who have given long service and whom he could dispense with if he wished but, in the main, the number of men he employs represents the number necessary to carry on his business.</P>
    <P>Local authorities must always be actuated by consideration for the problem of unemployment.  Where there is widespread unemployment they must seek to provide employment as far as they can even though they could get a better job done with a much smaller staff.  It is extraordinary that with the modern technique of a pre-mixed tarmacadam surface you can provide a much better road with the minimum number of employees.  Nevertheless, local authorities feel that somehow or another they have an obligation to relieve as far as it lies in their power the problem of unemployment. In this way they are not employers but, if you like, the providers of a public social service for the relief of distress.  To compare their position with that of the ordinary employer is altogether wrong.  In my view, the Minister would be well advised to reconsider this matter and, though this Bill may go through this House and become enacted, he should, before it has time to do harm&mdash;as Senator Hawkins has suggested it may&mdash;get a better type of machinery into operation at the earliest possible date.</P>

      <P>I welcome this Bill which I think is long overdue.  Speaking from experience of county council work, I can say that this Bill will help to put road men on a more satisfactory basis.  I come from Tipperary and in that area we find men doing the same work, often on the same road, but with a vast difference in their wages.  Where North and South Tipperary are concerned, we have found that there is a difference of as much as 10/- a week in the rates of wages paid in those two areas for the same work.  There is a bridge at Portumna and half of that bridge lies in Senator Hawkins's area and the other half lies in our area.  When work was being done on that bridge there was a difference <Col N="422" /> of 12/6 in the wages paid to workers, for the same work, according to which area they were working in.  If a board or some committee were set up to standardise the rate of wages paid to road workers it would help to put Party politics out of road men's wages.  That has actually been the position down through the years. In order to get the better of another Party, one Party will come along and propose a certain increase in wages. It is easy to visualise what that type of thing can lead to.  The result is that the road men of this country have been the cockshot of all Parties.</P>
      <P>In my view, this Bill is a workers' Bill.  I am sure that whoever will be on this board will be straight and honest.  I presume there will be somebody to represent the local authorities and somebody from the Federation of Rural Workers or Irish Transport to represent the workers.  That will mean that, if we cannot have a standard rate of wages for road workers all over the 29 county councils in Ireland, the matter can at least be put on a new and more satisfactory basis.  I feel that this Bill is a welcome addition to our industrial legislation.</P>

      <P>I am very pleased with the reception this Bill has got in the Seanad.  It has been welcomed by practically every speaker.  On behalf of the Opposition, Senator Hawkins welcomed it with some reserve: I am sure that is only what we could expect as he could hardly welcome it in full. However, he welcomed it with some reservations.  He asked some questions and made some points.  The first question he asked was whether the personnel of the Labour Court could be supplemented.  He said he felt that they were appointed originally to deal with industrial disputes and that, therefore, the members might not have experience of dealing with employees of local authorities.  The personnel can be extended.  If it is found necessary to bring somebody else on to the Labour Court that can be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the original Industrial Relations Bill was going through the Oireachtas&mdash;I was not in the Dáil at the time&mdash;people were wondering, as <Col N="423" /> they are to-day, in connection with extending this to local authorities, what effect it would have.  The effect which the Labour Court has had on general industry in the country has now been seen.  It has been brought in on practically every case and it has meant that we have had peace in the general industrial sphere of the country.</P>
    <P>Senator Hawkins also mentioned that appeal to the Labour Court is practically the last thing before strike. I do not think that is so.  Many employers and employees, when employees do make demands, and the unions too are most anxious to have this appeal to the Labour Court made straight away rather than to wait for a threat of strike.  They are not anxious that it should go to that point. They are anxious for peace and harmony in their business and, for that reason, they wish the dispute or demand to be tried by the Labour Court.</P>
    <P>In practically every case that has gone to the Labour Court, the employers and employees have accepted the Labour Court's recommendations although they do not carry the force of law.  The Minister is quite satisfied that this is the best course to adopt in relation to road workers and the other persons who are named in this Bill.  They have been promised arbitration and the Minister, to follow up on that, has offered this course of arbitration and conciliation to the workers.</P>
    <P>Senator Hawkins mentioned that the Minister did not say that this is the last word on this matter.  I do not think anything done in any Parliament can be said to be the last word.  If it is found that this legislation does not work out as well as we hope it will we can examine the whole position again at the end of a year or two years but possibly there will be no necessity to do that.</P>
    <P>Senator Hawkins spoke about strike action by employees of industrial authorities.  The strike weapon has been used very little by employees of local authorities.  Strike action is not used very much by employees of local <Col N="424" /> authorities because usually the effect of their going on strike would not have any immediate consequences.  It is not as if it concerned supplies of material goods or products which people require every day.  The result is that if employees of local authorities go on strike and if the strike lasts even for quite a while, nobody will be upset about it. In that way, strike action is not as effective in their case as it is in many other cases.</P>
    <P>Senator McGuire wanted to know how the rate of wages was to be fitted in and if the standerd was to be set on the basis of the richest county.  There is another board, the Agricultural Wages Board, which does not set the rate of agricultural wages for the whole country on the basis of the richest county.  They usually have a zoning or regional basis; when this measure comes into force, a somewhat similar procedure will be adopted in the case of road workers and there will be a regional basis, with various wages in the different areas.</P>
    <P>Senator Murphy said he was very pleased to hear that conciliation machinery for the officers of local authorities was to be set up.  The Government have that matter under consideration at present and it will be brought forward, but all these things take quite a while, and there is therefore a necessity for this Bill in the meantime.</P>
    <P>Senator Cogan spoke of road workers being in a different category from industrial workers and said that industrialists sometimes work for profit and sometimes to avoid losses.  I have never heard of an industrialist starting up a concern to avoid losses. I do not think they try to avoid losses &mdash;their aim is not to do so but to make profits.</P>
    <P>The Senator also mentioned a point which I heard for the first time, that county council officials, county surveyors and so on, work on the basis of relieving unemployment rather than on the basis of employing people strictly for the repair of roads, that they employ workers from a social welfare point of view and that it is not a <Col N="425" /> matter of getting value for money.  I have been a member of a local authority for quite a while and I never heard that gospel being preached before.  There are such things as relief works to which the local authorities contribute and which come down to the local authority in the winter. Local authorities contribute a very small proportion&mdash;it might be only one in ten&mdash;towards the money subscribed by the central Government.  That is work for the relief of unemployment and in that case the men must be taken from the labour exchange where they are on what is known as the &ldquo;dole&rdquo;; but I have never heard of a county surveyor employing men for the purpose of relieving unemployment and I do not think any member of a county council has.  He tries to get the best value he can for his money, for those who employ him and for the ratepayers in general.</P>
    <P>As a member of a local authority, I thought this Bill was very welcome because I have been on boards and have seen applications coming in from workers in relation to wages.  The first question usually asked by the members is: &ldquo;What are the wages in the neighbouring counties?&rdquo;  That is why I was surprised when Senator Tierney mentioned a difference of 12/6 in the rate of wages as between one county and another.  That could not occur in my county, because, when an application comes in, the members usually inquire as to the average rate of wages in neighbouring counties.  They get that information at the next meeting and the rate is usually struck as an average between the rates in five or six neighbouring counties, so that we are always fairly near the mark relative to these other counties.</P>
    <P>I know from my own experience that the Bill will be very welcome in my county council, because people often ask if we could not have wages fixed on a reasonable basis and avoid Party politics being played with regard to them.  This will remove wages from the realm of Party politics, and I know that it will be welcomed by members of every Party in my council.  We are anxious that it should be removed from the realm of Party politics and that <Col N="426" /> the men should get a reasonable wage fixed by some authority with power to do so.</P>

      <P>It brings in the servants of local authorities and it includes a number of other people&mdash;established officers, such as health inspectors and others.  I want to re-establish the point that there is a very definite distinction between county council employees and industrial employees.  County councils do not on all occasions employ men solely for the purpose of getting the most out of them and of getting the work done, but they must, by reason of the fact that they are a public authority, have regard to social welfare generally, and it is true, even if the Parliamentary Secretary has never heard about it, that county councils could at the present stage of mechanisation of road work dispense with three-quarters of their employees, if it were not for social considerations. For that reason, I think it is necessary to put employment by local authorities in a different category from employment by private employers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary would be well advised to consider the matter again.  He may say that this is an improvement on the present position, and it is perhaps an improvement in one way, but it may be a disimprovement in another way.  It would be desirable if a certain amount of uniformity could be achieved between the rates of wages in the different counties.  That would be one of the advantages.  On the other hand, there is the disadvantage that it does not remove political considerations from the fixing of remuneration.  If a section <Col N="427" /> of the members of a county council are intensely dissatisfied with the recommendations of the Labour Court, they can make the county council a forum in which to attack the Labour Court, left, right and centre.  In that way, the Labour Court and its decisions will be carried on into local discussions and local disputes and it will be dragged into debate in the local Press.  That, in the main, would have a harmful effect.  That would not happen to the same extent in regard to recommendations of the Labour Court as between employers and employees.</P>
    <P>While I am not opposing the section, because it may bring certain advantages and because it is recommended by the Government, I think it is not the best solution of the problem.  A much better solution would be to set up a special tribunal to deal with the special problems of the local authority employees.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Crotty)</NameTxt>
      <P>The principal purposes of this Bill are: (i) To authorise an increase from £16,000,000 to £25,000,000 in the statutory limit of expenditure which the E.S.B. may incur on rural electrification and to provide for the making of advances from the Central Fund accordingly; (ii) to extend the borrowing powers of the board so as to authorise it to obtain moneys required for rural electrification from sources other than the Central Fund; (iii) to terminate the subsidy for rural electrification.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The remaining provision is a minor amendment of the 1954 Act which is required to make it clear that a <Col N="428" /> guarantee given by the Minister for Finance under Section 9 of that Act may extend to the payment of interest on, as well as to the capital repayment of, borrowings made under Section 4 of that Act.</P>
    <P>Section 7 of the Electricity (Supply) (Amendment) Act, 1954, authorised an increase from £8,000,000 to £16,000,000 in the total of advances which could be made to the board from the Central Fund for rural electrification and at the time that Act was enacted, it was anticipated that the provision then made would suffice until about March, 1956.  As a result, however, of the considerable increase in the rate of development which has taken place in the meantime, both expenditure and commitments incurred on the scheme have increased more rapidly than was anticipated.  Within the existing limit of £16,000,000 the total already advanced to the board is £13,600,000 and in the year 1955-56 the board's requirements for rural electrification alone are expected to total £4,000,000. The board's total expenditure and commitments at the end of May, 1955, in respect of the scheme were £15,057,769.</P>
    <P>It is clear that at the present rate of activity the total of expenditure and commitments on the scheme will have exceeded the existing statutory provision of £16,000,000 by the autumn of this year.  It will be appreciated that the statutory provision at any particular time should be sufficient to cover not only expenditure actually incurred on the scheme but also commitments which have to be entered into in advance and which are inherent in the nature of the scheme.  It is essential, therefore, that additional legislative provision should be made as soon as possible.  Taking account of the balance of £2,400,000 still available, the additional amount of £9,000,000 which it is now proposed to provide, will, it is expected, be sufficient to cover expenditure and commitments until 1958.</P>
    <P>The fact that it should be necessary to seek the approval of the Oireachtas for increased provision for rural electrification so much earlier than was originally anticipated is a reflection of the considerable increase in the rate <Col N="429" /> of development which has now taken place.  In other words, development is now proceeding at a rate double that of two years ago.  The following statistics illustrate the progress.  In the year ended 31st March, 1953, 49 rural areas were completed; 60 were completed in 1953-54 and 75 in 1954-55. The estimate for 1955-56 is 100 areas. At 31st March, 1955 the number of rural areas completed since the inception of the scheme totalled 364.</P>
    <P>In all there are approximately 780 rural areas in the country and as development in the current year and in future years is expected to proceed at the rate of 100 areas per annum, there is every prospect that the scheme will be extended to all areas by the 31st March, 1959.  As further legislative provision will be required before that date the House will have an opportunity then of reviewing further the progress of the scheme.  Even with the increased rate of development there is no evidence of a slackening in demand for extension of the scheme.  In 1953-54 the average percentage of householders who agreed to take supply in the completed areas was 67 per cent. as compared with 65 per cent. in 1952-53 and 60 per cent. in 1951-52.  The urgency of making additional provision now is therefore self-evident.</P>
    <P>The Government have decided that the continuance of subsidy for rural electrification from State funds is no longer necessary or justifiable and subsection (2) of Section 4 of this Bill is designed to give effect to that decision.  There seems to have been a good deal of misunderstanding about the effects of this decision and in particular it has been asserted that it will result in either a slowing down of rural electrification development or an increase in rural charges or both. That, of course, is not the case.  To clarify the position, I think it would be desirable that I should give the House an outline of the history of this subsidy provision and of the considerations on which the decision to withdraw it was based.</P>
    <P>The problems of rural electrification were examined in a report prepared by the E.S.B. which was submitted to the <Col N="430" /> Minister for Industry and Commerce towards the end of 1942.  This report was published as a White Paper in 1944 and copies of it are available in the Oireachtas Library.  In dealing with the economics of rural electrification, it was estimated in the report that the annual capital charges, namely, interest on advances, the provision of a sinking fund to repay the advances together with provisions for depreciation of the assets and for other costs, such as, maintenance and supervision, would amount annually to 12 per cent. of the capital cost of providing supply.</P>
    <P>On the best estimate that could be made at that time the annual revenue from fixed charges was expected not to be likely to exceed 9.7 per cent. of the capital cost.  There would be, therefore, an annual deficit of 2.3 per cent. of the capital cost.  Of the total annual charges of 12 per cent., interest and sinking fund charges were estimated to total 5.5 per cent.  It will be appreciated that these interest and sinking fund charges would not arise if the State provided the capital required for the scheme as a non-repayable grant which would be the equivalent of a 100 per cent. subsidy.</P>
    <P>On the assumption that the capital required would, as in the case of capital for the board's general purposes, be provided by way of repayable interest-bearing advances from the Central Fund the measure of the subsidy required to make the scheme economic from the board's point of view was the deficit of 2.3 per cent. expressed as a percentage of the interest and sinking fund charges of 5.5 per cent. or 41.82 per cent.</P>
    <P>The Government approved of the report from the E.S.B. in August, 1943, and decided that the scheme should be commenced as soon as materials became available and that the board should be recouped the amount by which the annual fixed charges fell short of the annual capital charges. Effect was given to this decision in Section 41 of the Electricity (Supply) (Amendment) Act, 1945, under which capital for the scheme was made available and which also provided that one moiety of the sums advanced to the <Col N="431" /> board from the Central Fund for rural electrification should be repaid by the board and that the other moiety should be repaid out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas at such time or times as the Minister for Finance should direct. The subsidy was fixed at 50 per cent. instead of the 41.82 per cent. originally estimated in view of the increases in costs which had taken place in the meantime.</P>
    <P>The scheme commenced in 1946-47 and it was arranged that one half of the sums advanced to the board in any calendar year should be repaid to the Central Fund from voted moneys in the succeeding financial year.  This payment was charged to the Vote for Industry and Commerce and in the financial years 1948-49 and 1949-50 a total of £550,000, representing one half of the advances obtained by the board in the calendar years 1947 and 1948, was repaid to the Central Fund from that Vote.</P>
    <P>In 1950 the Minister for Finance decided that the amount falling due for repayment to the Central Fund in the financial year 1950-51, and in succeeding years, should be funded and be repaid by way of an annuity payable half-yearly and extending over 50 years.  These were the terms of repayment which applied to the moiety of advances which were repayable by the board and it was felt that the benefit of these terms should be extended to the taxpayer also.  In 1952, the Minister for Finance decided to revert to the procedure of repaying the outstanding moiety to the Central Fund from voted moneys in one sum and, accordingly, in the financial years 1952-53 and 1953-54 one half of the amount advanced to the board in the two preceding calendar years was repaid to the Central Fund in lump sums totalling £1,300,000.</P>
    <P>In February, 1954, a further modification of the system of repayment was decided upon.  The net result of the previous arrangements was that at the end of March, 1954, the total amount remaining outstanding in respect of the moiety repayable from voted moneys, including the undischarged <Col N="432" /> portions of annuities fixed to repay the 1949 and 1950 advances, was £2,110,213 and it was decided that this should be repaid by way of simple instalments without interest over 25 years, and that this arrangement would also apply in future years.  The present position is that the board has obtained a total of £13,600,000 by way of advances from the Central Fund and that of the moiety of £6,800,000 repayable from voted moneys a total of £1,974,400 has already been paid. In other words, rural electrification has been subsidised to that extent.</P>
    <P>I think that in considering this question of subsidy, it is essential that regard should be had to the circumstances which prevailed when it was originally decided on and to the considerable alteration which has taken place since then.  In 1943, as a result of the unsettled conditions and the difficulties in securing supplies, the board was operating at a loss and, in fact, continued to operate at a loss right through the remaining war years. It was not until 1948-49 that the accumulated deficits of these years were finally wiped out.  When the decision to provide a subsidy was taken in 1943, there was every indication that the difficulties under which the board was operating might become greater and even with the return of peace might be aggravated by the necessity of overhauling, in an era of inflated costs, the arrears of construction which had accumulated during the war years.  It was only natural, therefore, that the board should not be expected to undertake any operations particularly rural electrification, the economics of which were then uncertain.</P>
    <P>To-day, however, the position is vastly different.  Since 1948-49 the board has been able to produce a surplus on its operations in every year with the exception of 1952-53 in which there was a deficit as a result of inflated fuel costs, and this has enabled it not only to make adequate provision for interest on advances, capital repayments and depreciation of its assets but also to provide other reserves which at 31st March, 1955. amounted to nearly £2,000,000.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="433" /> In the year ended 31st March, 1955, the gross surplus amounted to £928,659. The provision for interest and capital repayment on the moiety of advances for rural electrification for which the board was liable in that year amounted to £260,567.  It will be evident, therefore, that the board could have borne the full charges for rural electrification in that year and still have shown a substantial surplus.  It was in the light of these altered conditions that the Government decided that the continuance of subsidy was no longer either necessary or justifiable.</P>
    <P>An important feature of the results of 1954-55 was that the rural revenue account showed a surplus of £44,130 as compared with deficits of £9,988 and £30,610 in the two previous years.  The increased rate of development should result in a considerable expansion of sales of current in rural areas and it would be obviously absurd to continue to provide subsidy for a service on which there was every likelihood that surpluses would continue to be produced as long as the subsidy continued.</P>
    <P>The Government felt that the board had attained the position in which, taking its operations as a whole, it could not only bear all the charges on this service in the future, but could also take care of the undischarged liabilities.  In this connection it is important to bear in mind that the board enjoys exceptionally favourable terms for repayment of its liabilities to the State as such repayment is spread over a period of 50 years.</P>
    <P>Electricity development in this country has now reached the stage at which electricity consumers and taxpayers are largely the same persons. There would, therefore, be no point in arranging, on the one hand, for a relatively slight reduction if any reduction were possible at all in the price of electricity to consumers, and on the other hand imposing taxes on them to provide for a continuance of subsidy. The logical way to look at this is to regard the board's undertaking as one unit which by prudent management has reached the stage where it is self-supporting, and can bear the full charges for rural electrification from <Col N="434" /> the surpluses realised on its other activities.</P>
    <P>Since in future there will be no distinction between capital required for general purposes and for rural development in so far as liability for repayment is concerned there is no longer any reason for the board to rely solely on the Central Fund for its rural capital requirements.  Provision has, accordingly, been made in Section 3 of the Bill to authorise the board to borrow, from sources other than the Central Fund, moneys which they may require for rural development.  This is an extension of the powers conferred on the board by Section 4 of the 1954 Act.</P>
    <P>In case any doubts on the subject should still exist, I should like to take this opportunity of assuring rural consumers that there will be no increase in electricity charges as a result of making the board bear the full cost of rural electrification nor will there be any reduction in the rate of progress in carrying out the scheme. In fact, the position now is that, as a result of the increase in the rate of development, those who are still awaiting supply may expect to receive it all the earlier.</P>
    <P>The speedy enactment of this Bill will ensure that the board can go ahead with rural development at the present greatly accelerated pace and will hasten the day when practically every member of the rural community will have available to him this modern amenity and aid to increased production. I think it will be agreed that the board deserves to be congratulated on its achievements in this field and on the success which has attended it efforts. I, therefore, confidently recommend the Bill for the approval of the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill before us, as the Parliamentary Secretary pointed out, provides three separate proposals and the most important from the point of view of the Minister for Finance is that relating to the removal of the subsidy on rural electrification.  We are all pleased at the progress made by the E.S.B. and many of us would wish it had been even more rapid in the past. <Col N="435" /> When the Government in 1952 or 1953 considered proposals for rural electrification the E.S.B. prepared a case for it and, as the Parliamentary Secretary said, the case was issued in the form of a White Paper which is now available to members in the Dáil Library.  The case they made to the then Government was based on the procedure adopted in practically all the small countries of Europe and in the great half-continent of Canada.  In each case that the board put before the Government the Governments of these countries provided a subsidy for rural electrification apart from whatever proposals were made for the general supply of electricity.  In Canada, as far back as 1921, the provision made was as high as 50 per cent. for transmission purposes and they later went so far as to provide loans for rural dwellers and to subsidise wiring and provision of meters out of State funds.</P>
      <P>Because that information was put before them, the Government then decided that it was essential to bring light and power into rural Ireland.  To do that the board made the case that it would be necessary to provide subsidies and, as the Parliamentary Secretary pointed out, that subsidy has been paid and the proposal here now is to remove it.  The Parliamentary Secretary assures us its removal is not going to have the effect of increasing the prices of electricity to rural dwellers and is not going to cause the slowing down of the extension of the system.  It is very easy for the Parliamentary Secretary to say that this particular action will not increase costs because whenever they are increased another reason can always be provided and the reason probably will be the increased cost of coal or increased demands by employees.  But no reference will be made to the removal of the subsidy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary referred to the present financial position of the board and said it was now in a position to take the full weight of rural electrification without any subsidy from the Government.  The report just issued <Col N="436" /> shows the board made a profit of some £800,000 last year but practically £600,000 of that was attributable to the fact of the very bad weather which, while it was a serious disadvantage to the country and the farmers particularly, seems to have been a blessing to the E.S.B. who were able to save practically £600,000 on the purchase of coal.  However, that leaves a very small margin to work on, a profit of some £200,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>Out of the £16,000,000 provided I believe that some £15,000,000 of that is practically accounted for by expenditure and commitments in connection with rural electrification.  We are now giving authority to the board to procure money from sources other than the Government, to go to the public and borrow money for the purpose of the main work it carries on and also for the rural electrification scheme.</P>
      <P>In connection with this question of borrowing, will the Minister for Finance, having fixed the rate of interest that the banks will pay, also insist that these moneys be provided for the E.S.B. for this very essential work at a rate of interest fixed by him?  The Minister tells us 49 areas were completed in one year at the start and that that has been stepped up to 60.  That is only natural.  When works of that kind are begun one does not expect a large number of areas to be completed in the first year and to have a reduction in the number in the following year.  It is only natural there should be a big step-up in the number of areas and the amount of work carried out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While we all appreciate the benefits of rural electrification I think the House will agree that if there is any part of rural Ireland to which we should give priority of attention it is to the Gaeltacht areas.  These are the areas where inducement should be held out for the starting of industries and one of the first essentials is power. We cannot have that power if rural electrification schemes are not brought into the area.  Up to the present I <Col N="437" /> think the board requires that some 69 per cent. of the residents in the area should be prepared to take the supply when the canvass is carried out or otherwise that area is not connected up.  I refer particularly to a very thickly populated part of Connemara, that is from Knock to Carraroe, and I would ask the Minister to use his influence with the E.S.B. to have them reconsider the position in connection with this very important area.  You would have 69 per cent. of the people in some thinly populated areas but here you have a very thickly populated Gaeltacht district and 50 per cent. there would be equal to 75 per cent. in a more thinly populated district.</P>
    <P>The importance of the two areas I have referred to is connected with the fact that the Galway County Vocational Committee have erected two very fine vocational schools, one in each place.  The full benefit of these schools cannot be given to the boys and girls there if you have not electric power.  A great number of those young people will be forced to seek their livelihood across the water and it is most important that all the facilities should be made available to them to receive the very best training that the vocational committee can provide for them so that if they do seek their livelihood in the cities or towns here at home or if they are forced to seek a livelihood abroad they will be as well equipped as we can possibly make them.</P>
    <P>We all know how reluctant a great number of our farmers are not alone in congested areas like Connemara but in other districts, to sign a contract that they are going to take in a particular service until they first see that their neighbour has it and discover how it works out.  I have no doubt that if the board made a decision to-morrow to proceed with the scheme in these two areas, in a very short time the great majority of the people there would become subscribers.</P>
    <P>That is one of the requests I would make to the Parliamentary Secretary: that, in regard to the Gaeltacht areas particularly, the board should be more liberal and not adhere too strictly to <Col N="438" /> the results of their canvass.  I think their experience in the other places they have already wired up has been that the persons who were reluctant to accept supply have all come into the scheme now and are probably more satisfied than those who first signed.</P>
    <P>Sub-section (2) of Section 4 provides:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The total amount remaining due to the Central Fund at the passing of this Act in respect of advances already made under that section together with the total amount of moneys hereafter advanced shall be repaid by the board.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>What is the amount that this section provides will be paid back by the board?</P>

      <P>This is a very nice income to provide for in a simple measure of this kind.  While the Minister assured us that the passing of this Bill will not bring about an increase in the cost of electricity to the consumer, I wonder has the Minister given any consideration to what will result from the decision in Britain to increase the cost of coal by 18 per cent.  If the board is compelled to import coal at the increased price they will be very anxious to have another very wet year and up to the present I do not think it looks as if they will be met as generously in that regard as they were last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been held over the years that one of the great inducements to industry is to have cheap power.  The 1927 Act provides that the board must pay its way and we are now putting the responsibility on the board in paying its way.  If there has been a <Col N="439" /> profit made by the E.S.B. from the ordinary work for which it was first set up and if the E.S.B. is in such a strong financial position that it can now carry on without the assistance given out of the Central Fund for rural electrification, I think that one of the first steps that should have been taken was to reduce the cost of power and light to the consumer.  It is all very fine to say that the E.S.B. has been a very efficient organisation.</P>
    <P>The E.S.B., of course, has a monopoly and when a semi-State board finds it necessary to increase the cost of its product, it does not have to go before the Prices Advisory Body or even before this House.  It is put on automatically, and that is all about it. When the Minister is asked a question about the working of this body he says he has no function in the day-to-day activities of the board.  It is quite easy for a board carrying on under such conditions to build up reserves and have the appearance of being a very efficient body.  But there is another aspect to the activities of the board.  I do not wish to discuss all the activities of the E.S.B. under this particular measure, but there is one aspect of the board's activities which is causing some uneasiness.  I refer to the engaging by the E.S.B. in sales of electrical equipment in competition with other sections of our people. Many hold the view that this activity on the part of the E.S.B. represents unfair competition.</P>
    <P>I think it is to be regretted that the Minister is removing the subsidy for rural electrification.  I am not satisfied that the effect of that step will be to speed up rural electrification because the board will now have to meet all its demands out of its own revenue and make provision therefor.  I am afraid that the effect of this will be to slow up rural electrification and to spread it out over a much longer period.  There will not, of course, be any general abandonment of particular areas but the board will be more reluctant to push ahead than it would be if the State were to give the same subvention as in the past.  It has been <Col N="440" /> found good policy to subsidise rural electrification in Denmark, Sweden and other countries.  Admittedly, these countries had a much earlier start in developing rural electrification than we have had, but I think it is bad policy on the part of the Minister to remove the subsidy here at this stage particularly in view of the fact that this will affect the more remote rural areas. The possibility is that the board will be somewhat reluctant in the future to widen the scope of its activities because of the increased costs involved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanRuane" hpid="Mr. S.T. Ruane Mr. S.T. Ruane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S.T. Ruane</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this measure and, in doing so, I would like to endorse the remarks of the Parliamentary Secretary congratulating the E.S.B. for the marvellous progress made in relation to rural electrification which has brought such benefits to the country generally.  I think I am in order also in congratulating those men who originally conceived this idea and, in face of everything but encouragement, gave effect to a scheme which has now the enthusiastic support of every section of our community.  I think the E.S.B., too, deserve congratulations on the manner in which they work and the manner in which the operating staffs carry out their duties throughout the country.  Their application and their energy in the discharge of their duties sets a very excellent, if difficult, headline for other servants of public bodies and even for the servants of the State.  I know of no section of the community which gives such a fair and reasonable return for wages as do the workers employed by the E.S.B., especially those engaged in rural electrification.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Exception has been taken to the section in this Bill which is designed to make the E.S.B. self-supporting in future.  It is stated that the stage has now been reached when this service requires no further subsidisation out of public funds.  That is only to be expected considering that the service has been operating at a profit over a very long period.  I think there was only one year in the past ten in which anything in the nature of a loss occurred.  Reading the report we find that this year there is a surplus of <Col N="441" /> almost £1,000,000 and the board has reserves amounting to over £12,000,000. In addition to that, there is a contingency fund of £1,000,000, a fuel reserve and some other small reserves totalling almost £2,000,000.  With all that capital at their disposal the action of the Government in withdrawing further subsidisation is perfectly correct.  This enterprise is now a paying concern.</P>
    <P>If I had any fault to find with this particular body, it is that some of the profits should be utilised to make charges on consumers somewhat more reasonable than they are at the present time.  There is one particular charge which is a matter of concern to a number of people.  I refer to what is called the overhead charge, the charge originally fixed on a valuation basis.  Some time ago that particular charge was varied and, instead of fixing the charge on a valuation basis, it was fixed on the number of rooms serviced. As far as I recollect, the E.S.B. at the time the change was made notified consumers that the difference would be very little.  I know that in my own particular case the change has meant an increase of 33? per cent.  I think that is too much. During the summer months many people, especially in the towns, where valuations are pretty high, are paying for a service that they do not use at that period.</P>
    <P>There is another fault that has been brought to my notice.  In fact, I am aware of this from my own personal knowledge.  Where householders are removed from built-up areas the service will only be extended to their new dwellings if they agree to pay increased charges.  I do not think that is fair.  If we are to have rural electrification there should be no differentiation where charges are concerned.  I hope some means will be found of providing this service for people whose houses are remote from centres of population, where those centres of population are brought within the scheme.  If that snag can be overcome there will be very little to complain about and this amenity will be provided for people who are at present deprived of it because they cannot <Col N="442" /> afford the extra charges imposed on them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>The main purpose of this Bill, as explained by the Parliamentary Secretary, is to remove the subsidy on rural electrification.  It is, undoubtedly, a drastic step and, possibly, the last one would expect from a Government which in the past so frequently and so fluently denounced the removal of subsidies or the reduction of subsidies on necessaries of life.</P>
      <P>Food is, of course, a necessary of life.  So, also, is fuel.  In this matter, a previous Government, taking all the circumstances of the case into consideration, decided that it was desirable to subsidise to the extent of 50 per cent. the capital cost of installing electricity in rural areas.  It was a wise decision.  It was a decision which was applauded by everyone at the time.  It was recognised that considerable cost would be involved in installing electricity in widely separated and remote rural areas and that it was right, therefore, that the State should come to the assistance of the consumers in these areas by ensuring that half the capital cost of installation would be borne by the taxpayer.</P>
      <P>Now the Parliamentary Secretary makes two promises in regard to the removal of this subsidy.  The first promise he makes is that the removal of the subsidy will not slow down development.  We may take it that, in a general way, that promise will be fulfilled, not, perhaps, fully, but in the main.  The Parliamentary Secretary makes the second promise that there will be no increased charge as a result of the removal of the subsidy.  That is a promise which, as Senator Hawkins has pointed out, will, in all probability, be evaded sometime in the future, if necessary, because if costs increase in one way or another, either through the blessing of fine weather or through an increase in the cost of imported fuel or for some other reason, the charges will be increased and the increase will be attributed, not to the removal of the subsidy, but to what they would describe as these &ldquo;adverse circumstances.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="443" /> There was one promise that the Parliamentary Secretary was very wise and very careful not to make.  He did not promise that the automatic reduction in charges which would have taken place if the subsidy had continued will now take place.  We all recognise that if, as a result of favourable circumstances, the E.S.B. has a surplus, then, counting on this income from the State by way of subsidy, the board would have an increased surplus and there would be an obligation on them to pass that surplus on to the consumer, since the E.S.B. is not a profit-making concern. If there were a surplus as a result of the sale of current and as a result of their income from the State subsidy, it would be their first duty to pass that surplus or profit on to the consumer, who badly needs some relief.</P>
    <P>As a result of governmental action, this certain reduction in the cost of electricity to consumers will not take place.  This represents a tax on consumers of electricity, not only in rural areas but in urban areas because, if there were a surplus arising from income from all sources, it would have been possible for the E.S.B. to give relief wherever it was needed, whether in rural or urban areas.</P>
    <P>Senator Ruane, having congratulated the E.S.B on their efficiency and successful working, found it necessary to complain of the very high and unreasonable charges that are being levied on the consumers.  He complained, in particular, of the heavy overhead charges, both in urban and rural areas.  If there was some profit accruing to the E.S.B., the first people to benefit should be the people who suffer as a result of those high and unreasonable overhead charges.</P>
    <P>There is another section of the community who have been crying out and whose case does cry out for relief. They are people in isolated areas, pockets of residents throughout the length and breadth of rural Ireland. We find them everywhere.  Because the location of their homesteads is inconvenient from the point of view of the E.S.B., these people can secure light only by making a very high additional contribution.  They are called <Col N="444" /> upon to contribute the entire capital cost of the additional expense involved in installation.  They are promised, of course, that if additional development takes place in the area they may be recouped at a later stage.  In mountain areas, such as there are in some parts of Wicklow and other counties, and remote bog areas, one finds people who are not in a position to make the additional contribution and who, therefore, must do without the service provided by the E.S.B.  The Government has taken action now to ensure that those people will be left out for all time, as far as it is in the power of the present Government to do so.  It is a dastardly move and one which could not be justified under any circumstances, certainly not by a Government that has claimed so frequently to be in favour of subsidising the essentials of life.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect of this matter.  It has been pointed out that progressive countries all over the world have found it necessary and desirable to subsidise rural electrification.  There is a reason for that.  It is an attempt to bring the standard of living in remote rural areas up to that prevailing in the built-up areas and in the large towns and cities.  We all have deplored and must deplore the fact that there are still many houses in rural Ireland that have not the amenity of electricity.  Even where the current is brought to the homes of small farmers, they often find that, having paid the overhead charge, the most they can find out of their limited income is sufficient only to provide light whereas, if the charge could be reduced, as it would have been reduced if the Government had not cut the subsidy, it would have been possible for those smallholders in rural Ireland to purchase increased amenities, such as the installation of water in their house.  If the charge were reduced people would be able to use more electricity. They would be able to use it to heat their rooms, and so forth.  In that way they would raise their standard of living.</P>
    <P>It is not true to say that the cost of electricity supplied to the average <Col N="445" /> smallholder and to the agricultural worker in rural Ireland is very cheap. It may seem cheap to a person with a large income but, to the small farmer or to the agricultural worker or to the casual worker with a small wage, the overhead charge he has to meet every two months plus the charge for current is a heavy outlay.  If something could be done to reduce that outlay it would be a national benefit.  It is something urgently needed to tilt the scale in favour of the poorer classes in rural areas.  If some relief could be given in the electricity charges on people with valuations under £50, on the small farms and on the agricultural homesteads it would be of immense benefit.</P>
    <P>These are things which could have been done if the subsidy had not been withdrawn, as it is being withdrawn in this Bill.  Many reliefs, large or small, could be given.  Even if they were only small reliefs they would still be very much appreciated by people in the lower income groups.  Even if we only got the relief I mentioned in the first place, that is, the provision of electricity and the linking-up of isolated homesteads at the standard rate rather than at the excessive rate it would be a benefit.  If the Minister could promise that no matter where a person's homestead was located it would be linked up at the standard rate, then that would be a very valuable concession.  It is a concession which the Parliamentary Secretary has not promised and which I have reason to fear will not be granted now because of the withdrawal of this subsidy. If the subsidy had not been withdrawn I think that concession at least&mdash;and it is only a small concession &mdash;could have been made without the slightest difficulty.</P>
    <P>There is another economy which the E.S.B. have practised down through the years.  I do not know whether or not it would be possible to change it now because rural electrification has continued to a considerable extent. However, in the erection of poles and in the general extension of the service, no compensation whatever is given to farmers&mdash;or, if it is, it is of a very nominal nature&mdash;for damage done to their lands.  That is an <Col N="446" /> economy which has been achieved by the very drastic monopolistic powers which the E.S.B. possess.  They could possibly have done something in regard to that if this subsidy were continued.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of this matter which I think appears to have been lost sight of is the very great need for providing cheaper electricity in rural areas in order to promote the establishment of small industries in outlying areas. Electricity is the one thing, more than anything else, that can help in the decentralisation of industry.  Many of us who live in rural areas and who know the problems there and who deplore the rapid depopulation of those areas would like to see small productive industries springing up there serviced by electric power.  There are quite a number of concessions which it would have been possible to make to consumers generally both in urban and in rural areas if this subsidy had not been withdrawn.  Those of us who looked with pleasure to the fact that the E.S.B. were paying their way looked forward to some relief being given to the consumers.  That relief must now be deferred for a considerable time, if not for all time, because of the action of the Government.</P>
    <P>A great deal of the profit that has accrued to the E.S.B. in the last year came about by reason of weather conditions. The excessive rain which ruined the farmers' crops and which caused widespread loss to the farmers brought some profit to the E.S.B.  The fact that some profit came to them is now being used as an argument to withdraw the subsidy that was being given to rural areas.  The rural areas are being hit both ways.  They were hit last year by the adverse weather conditions and now they are being hit by the Government in taking advantage of the increased profit to the E.S.B., as a result of those adverse weather conditions, to reduce their income from State sources.  This is a mean and underhand method of raking in additional revenue to the State.  It is typical of Coalition methods of hidden taxation wherever it can be imposed&mdash;underhand, secret taxation which does not appear in the Budget <Col N="447" /> Statement, which does not appear as an increased tax but which has exactly the same effect.</P>
    <P>The Government's predecessors, who introduced this principle of subsidising rural electrification, would never under any circumstances have withdrawn it. If money accrued to the E.S.B. as a result of the subsidy and as a result of improved working conditions then that profit would have been passed on direct to the consumers and steps would have been taken to pass it on to the consumers who needed it most &mdash;to the consumers who were the most heavily burdened by present charges.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that most Senators will have welcomed any extension of rural electrification.  I hope that, in the not too distant future, we shall see electricity extended not only to the whole of the Twenty-Six Counties but to the whole of the 32 Counties.  The E.S.B. is a virtual monopoly.  I hope that the increased moneys which we are providing for under this Bill will not be used to extend their activities any further into what I might call the realms of private enterprise.  Prior to the setting up of the E.S.B., we were very well served by the electrical trade throughout the country.  In recent years, they have been exceedingly perturbed by the fact that the E.S.B. have extended into what I might call unfair competition with private enterprise.</P>
      <P>The electrical trade throughout the country, generally speaking, is not under the control of big industries. Generally, it is the small man who has been trained as an electrician and who sets up a small shop or office from which he is able to conduct installations throughout the country.  In these jobs, he now finds himself not only in competition with a great many of his neighbours, but with this virtual monopoly, the E.S.B.  It seems to me that a monopoly of this kind should not compete in a service which can be rendered by private individuals who have given up to the present quite a good deal of employment throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="448" /> The E.S.B. has the advantage of being able to offer refrigerators, wireless sets and even electric irons and kettles on hire purchase terms and it costs the E.S.B. virtually nothing to put it on the bill.  Only yesterday, I got my own bill from the E.S.B. and enclosed with it was a little advertising card saying that they would be glad to supply me with an electric kettle or iron for so much every two months.  That goes on the bill and there is no additional cost, so far as the E.S.B. is concerned.  The small electrical supplier has to make arrangements to finance these hire purchase facilities, but he is able to do so, and I suggest he is able to give just as good service to the people as this monopoly.  Installations by private firms are now carried out in direct competition with the E.S.B., but there again they are under the definite disadvantage that, when an installation has been made, it has to be passed and approved by the E.S.B. before the current can be connected. I consider that that is an exceedingly unfair activity for a monopoly.</P>
    <P>I believe that when the E.S.B. was first set up&mdash;was it in the year 1927?&mdash; its intention was to provide electrical current throughout the country and to allow the small man in the electrical trade to carry on with the work of making the installations and providing fixtures and fittings.  I hope that, when this Bill has passed, the additional money we are providing will not be used to enable the E.S.B. to go further into competition with the small man throughout the country and with private enterprise.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJCrotty" hpid="Mr. Crotty Mr. Crotty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crotty</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very pleased with the reception this Bill has got.  I cannot say that members welcomed it completely because they had a certain amount of criticism to make on it. Senator Hawkins quoted Canada and spoke about the subsidies given there, but the conditions in Canada are very different from those in Ireland because there they have to travel long distances and there are very thinly populated areas.  The Government felt that a subsidy was necesary at the time the rural electrification scheme was first <Col N="449" /> mooted.  At that time&mdash;it was during the war&mdash;the E.S.B. had shown a deficit over the previous two or three years and they felt that they could not ask the E.S.B. to take on new commitments without a subsidy being provided; but times have changed since then and we are all very pleased to see that in all but one of the past ten years, the E.S.B. has made very substantial surpluses, totalling practically £2,500,000.  The position is now much different from what it then was.</P>
      <P>The E.S.B. also have reserves, as I understand, running into £14,000,000 or £15,000,000, reserves which they can use for any purpose.  It has been stated that last year was a very good year for the E.S.B. and that due to the suitable weather, from their point of view, they were able to make a surplus. Senator Hawkins said that that surplus was £80,000, but the surplus last year was £928,000.  They have established a fuel equalisation fund of £500,000 to meet any unexpected fuel costs.  It has been suggested that the increased price of coal will reduce the profits during the next year but the use of coal by the E.S.B. has been going down steadily every year.  More electricity is being produced from hydroelectric and turf-burning stations and the Pigeon House is now the only coal-burning station in the country.  It is being used only during periods of peak loads, so that the price of coal will not have such a direct bearing on the cost of electricity or the profits or losses of the E.S.B. during the coming years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Hawkins also said that 69 per cent. of acceptances must be available before the E.S.B. will supply current. There is no particular percentage that an area must show before supply is connected.  The country is divided into different centres&mdash;I think about ten or 12 in all&mdash;and it is all according to which area in a centre shows the best percentage of acceptances.  That is the area that will be accepted.  The Senator mentioned especially the Carraroe area and I believe the acceptances in that area were very low entirely&mdash;about 35 per cent.  The board, however, have accepted a much lower percentage <Col N="450" /> than 69 per cent., although at present some of the acceptances are up to 70 per cent. and 80 per cent.</P>
    <P>Senator Cogan spoke of the removal of the subsidy and said that the present Government were altogether against the removal of subsidies.  We all know that they were against it, where it would put up the price of a necessary article, and if the removal of subsidy would have put up the price of electricity, whether in cities or country areas, the Government would be altogether against it; but when they see an organisation, an organisation which we are glad to say has proved itself very efficient, showing a surplus and having shown a substantial surplus continuously over the past ten years, the Government do not think it right and see no reason whatever to continue the subsidy.  This is an organisation 75 per cent. of the activities of which are profit-bearing and 25 per cent. not so profit-bearing, although that 25 per cent. has shown a profit of £40,000 last year.</P>
    <P>Senator Cogan said that concessions should be given to consumers if there is a surplus, but the Government felt that if there was any concession to be given, it should be given to the taxpayer. The Government do not feel that the taxpayer should be called on to subsidise an organisation which is able to pay its way on its total activities, and, if there is any concession to be given, they felt that it should be given to the general taxpayer in a reduction of taxes.  I am sure Senator Cogan, when speaking on the Appropriation Bill here, would have been in agreement with the Government on that point of view.</P>
    <P>Senator Ruane mentioned the charges.  These special charges are a feature of the E.S.B. scheme since it was founded.  They must establish a certain amount of special charges which they need to meet a certain amount of overheads. It would be wrong for any Minister to intervene in fixing these charges or to dictate to the board in such a manner as to interfere with its functions under the 1927 Electricity Supply Act.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="451" /> Senator Douglas said he trusted the board would not go into private enterprise any more than it has done already.  I am pleased to tell him that the board has made agreements with the Irish Society of Electrical Traders under which any trader in the country can offer any apparatus&mdash;electric cookers, washing machines or other appliances&mdash;at the very same price as the E.S.B.  They have, one might say, underwritten a number of the electrical traders so that they can give the same facility.  There is nothing in favour of the E.S.B., nothing that is not available to ordinary electrical traders.  I think the Senator will agree that that is a rather happy position to have brought about&mdash;and that has been done in the last 12 months.</P>
    <P>We have all seen that in the last year the E.S.B. sold over £1,000,000 worth more of electricity than it sold up to that time.  In January last there were 40 crews working throughout the whole country, as compared with 29 or 30 the previous year and 21 in the previous January.  That will show that this present Government is anxious that every consumer in the country should get an opportunity to enjoy the amenity, first, of electric light, which is very necessary instead of the bad light they had previously, and then that they should have this great aid to production.</P>
    <P>Senator Cogan mentioned that at one time the charges were very high and that people might find them very hard to bear.  When these people are able to bring electricity to the aid of production, they will find they will get much more profit and that the work will be much easier than before.  I think that I have answered all the points raised in the course of this debate and that I need not say anything further.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to ask the Minister one question.  Is it not true that, if the subsidy were not withdrawn as it is proposed to withdraw it under this section, it would be possible for the E.S.B. to give substantial reductions to the consumers in the very near future?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJCrotty" hpid="Mr. Crotty Mr. Crotty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crotty</NameTxt>
      <P>The reduction would not be substantial by any means&mdash;it would be only one two-hundreth part of a penny per unit.  Over the past three years, due to the increased consumption by the rural community, the average cost per unit to rural consumers from 1950-51 to 1954-55 has been reduced by 22 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of that, might I ask if the relief that could have been given were not given on a flat rate but were given to special cases&mdash;cases of people who are now charged a very high excessive rate, as Senator Ruane put it&mdash;would it not have been possible to give relief to a substantial number?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJCrotty" hpid="Mr. Crotty Mr. Crotty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crotty</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a very new principle.  Under Section 93 of the 1927 Act, preferential treatment is not to be given to any particular section in an area.  That has been carried out by all Governments up to this.  It has been the policy of every Government up to now.  The E.S.B. has been left a free hand as regards equating the charge according to the distance from the lines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not true that what I am asking for is not preferential treatment but that people charged an excessive rate over and above the standard rate should have their charge brought down to the standard level and put on an equal footing?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJCrotty" hpid="Mr. Crotty Mr. Crotty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crotty</NameTxt>
      <P>They are brought up to that rate because the capital cost of bringing a supply to them is much higher than in the case of the normal person.  That is why they have to pay a special charge.</P>

      <P>In other words, this provision for the withdrawal of the subsidy is actuating a bias against people in the remote rural areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJCrotty" hpid="Mr. Crotty Mr. Crotty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crotty</NameTxt>
      <P>This withdrawal of the subsidy will have no effect whatever on them.  If the subsidy were kept on for ever more, it would not remove these charges at all.  These charges have been imposed for many years, when the subsidy was given.  Therefore, even if the subsidy were removed, that would have no effect on them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, he gave figures by which he sought to convey that since the present Government took office the development has been speeded up.  He sought to claim credit for the move, which was a natural development in any efficient company such as the E.S.B.  Their progress would tend to extend from year to year.  While he claims credit in that respect, he completely disowns all responsibility in regard to what are admitted by Senators on both sides of the House to be injustices inflicted on certain people by the E.S.B.  He says the Government ought not and should not and will not interfere.  They can always interfere if they wish, by legislation.</P>

      <P>On this stage, I would like to make a second appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary and, through him, to the E.S.B. to reconsider one particular matter.  In reply to my request on the Second Reading, in relation to the areas of Knock and Carraroe, he informed us that the canvass there returned only 30 or 32 per cent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJCrotty" hpid="Mr. Crotty Mr. Crotty">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>That may have been the position but, again, I would like to point out that it is a very populous area.  Apart from the benefits to the persons themselves, I urge upon the board to take into consideration the two vocational schools.  It is very important and essential that these schools should be connected up with power and light.  There should be made available to the teaching staffs and the pupils such things as electric cookers and all the other up-to-date electrical apparatus if the schools are to fulfil the purpose for which they were provided by the vocational committee and the county council.</P>
