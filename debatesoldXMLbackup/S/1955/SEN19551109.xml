      <P>It is my sad duty to-day to bring to the notice of the Seanad the unexpected death since our last meeting, of Senator Matthew Smith.  At that meeting the late Senator was in attendance apparently in his usual good health.</P>
      <P>Senator Smith was elected to the Nominating Bodies Sub-Panel on the Industrial and Commercial Panel at the General Election of 1954.  During his short membership here he became popular with members of all groups.</P>
      <P>The late Senator took his Parliamentary duties seriously, and was in constant attendance in the House.  He entered wholeheartedly into all movements for the benefit of the country, whether national or local, giving of his best unsparingly.  At an early age he joined the Volunteers, and was a prominent figure in the fight for independence. He also took a keen interest in the business life of the community. Senator Smith's death will be deeply mourned.</P>
      <P>To the widow and relatives of the late Senator I shall convey, with your assent, your sympathy and appreciation. Solas Dé le na anam.</P>

    <Title>Imposition of Duties (Confirmation of Orders) (No. 2) Bill, 1955&mdash;Second and Subsequent Stages.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJCrotty" hpid="Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Crotty) Patrick J. Crotty">
      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Crotty)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill, as set out in the explanatory memorandum which I have circulated to Senators, is to confirm 13 Orders made by the Government under the Emergency Imposition of Duties Act, 1932. The commodities covered by the Orders are as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1) fabric gloves, (2) slashers or slash hooks, (3) artificial silk fabrics, (4) underfelt, (5) flexible mirror glass, (6) knitted woollen gloves, (7) artificial textile and union fabrics, (8) display shapes and stands, (9) storage water heaters, (10) angle iron fencing posts, (11) milk cans, (12) iron and steel bolts, (13) margarine.</P>
      <P>The Orders dealing with fabric gloves and knitted woollen gloves arose out of a threat to the glovemaking industry from low priced gloves manufactured in the Far East.  The existing <i>ad valorem</i> customs duties were inadequate to protect the industry against imports of such gloves and it was necessary to impose specific duties at rates sufficient to ensure the continuance of production and employment. A feature of the knitted woollen glove industry is that it is located almost exclusively in County Donegal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The danger of substantial imports of low priced fabrics from the Far East was also an important factor which led to the making of the Orders dealing with artificial silk fabrics and with artificial textile and union fabrics. A position had arisen where the output of the firms engaged in the production <Col N="519" /> of bag making cloth, linings, lingerie cloth and dress cloth was being seriously threatened by imports from the Far East and elsewhere at low prices which bore no comparison to normal costs of production.</P>
    <P>The duty on slashers or slash hooks was reduced from 25 per cent. to 20 per cent. <i>ad valorem</i> in respect of imports of United Kingdom or Canadian origin.  The British Board of Trade asked for a review of this duty in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Anglo-Irish Trade Agreement of 1938.  The review was carried out by the Industrial Development Authority who recommended that the duty should be reduced from 25 per cent. to 20 per cent. <i>ad valorem.</i></P>
    <P>The manufacture of underfelt was commenced within the past year or so and the duty was imposed in order to afford a measure of protection for the industry.  Underfelt is a textile material primarily used as an underlay for carpets.  It is also used as trimming and flooring in motor cars.</P>
    <P>The manufacture of flexible mirror glass is a small but interesting development in the glass trade and it was decided to afford it a measure of protection.  Flexible mirror glass consists of ordinary mirror glass cut into small rectangles and fixed to a textile backing which can be formed into various shapes and used for shop window dressing and display purposes.</P>
    <P>The Orders dealing with display shapes and stands and with angle iron fencing posts revoked the duties hitherto chargeable on these goods.  The duties were originally intended to be protective duties but the manufacture of the goods in question did not develop satisfactorily and no useful purpose was being served by allowing the duties to remain in operation.</P>
    <P>The manufacture of copper boilers and cylinders for use in hot water systems has been carried on satisfactorily here for many years and has been protected by customs duty.  This protection did not extend to what are known as indirect cylinders and calorifiers which are ordinary cylinders with hot water or steam carrying coils <Col N="520" /> inside them.  Indirect cylinders are used mainly in central heating units and calorifiers are similarly used in large premises where steam is generated. The Irish firms are equipped to meet the full demand.  It was accordingly decided to extend protection to the manufacture of indirect cylinders and calorifiers.</P>
    <P>Early in 1954 a customs duty of 15 per cent. (full rate), 10 per cent. (preferential rate) <i>ad valorem</i> was imposed on milk cans up to 12 gallons capacity as a measure of protection for the manufacture of these goods which had recommenced after a lapse of some years.  The industry producing the milk cans is equipped to turn out the full requirements of the country in cans up to 12 gallons capacity. Although the home-produced cans were competitive in price with the normal or list prices of similar imported cans there was evidence that exporters in other countries were manipulating prices to bring them down to or below Irish prices notwithstanding the duty payable.  It was considered necessary therefore to increase the rate of duty to 37½ per cent. (full) 25 per cent. (preferential) to afford the home industry adequate protection.</P>
    <P>There was a customs duty on certain iron and steel bolts not less than ? inches in diameter.  Bolts which were only fractionally less than ? inches in diameter were being imported free of the duty to the serious detriment of the firms who manufacture bolts here. It was, accordingly, necessary to close this loophole in the duty.</P>
    <P>Since 1927 there has been a customs duty of 3d. per lb. on margarine.  When this duty was originally imposed it was equivalent to an <i>ad valorem</i> rate of 50 per cent., and under this protection the industry developed to the point where the full requirements of the market were being supplied by the Irish manufacturers.  During 1954 importation of continental margarine commenced and developed to a point where it was necessary to bring the specific duty of 3d. per lb. imposed in 1927 into line with current money values to keep the industry adequately protected.  It was decided to convert the specific duty into an <i>ad valorem</i> duty at the rate of 50 per cent. (full), <Col N="521" /> 33? per cent. (United Kingdom and Canada).</P>

      <P>Tuigimidne ar an dtaobh seo den Tigh gur gá cosaint áirithe a thabhairt do na hearraí a déantar sa tír seo, chun ná tabharfar rudaí isteach anseo ó thíortha eile, tíortha inar féidir leis an lucht rialuithe daoine d'fháil chun iad a dhéanamh faoi choinníollacha agus ar théarmaí áirithe ná beadh aon ghlacadh leo sa tír seo.  Bhí sé de chuspóir ag an Rialtas a bhí againn an chosaint ba ghá a thabhairt don Aire a bhí ann an uair sin.  Aon iarracht atá a dhéanamh ag an Aire nó ag an Rúnaí Parlaiminte chun leanúint de sin, agus aon leasuithe a bheidh riachtanach le himeacht aimsire, is mian liom cabhrú leis chun iad a dhéanamh.</P>
      <P>This Bill is a small measure but, sometimes, of course, we find that in these small measures there can be provisions of a far-reaching character.  I do not say that that is altogether the case on this occasion.  There is a variegated assortment of articles mentioned as coming within the scope of the Bill and I dare say that the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary, after having surveyed the industrial field, deem it necessary to make these adjustments.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, sometimes when we are presented with measures of this kind, we have not the full opportunity of going into these matters in detail and oftentimes we have to be satisfied that the Minister himself and his Department have done that for us.  It is only right that we should afford whatever protection is necessary to keep our own industries here in existence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are, I know, of course, people in this country who believe that we are affording too much protection to our own industrialists.  These people have been rather vocal at times but we here at any rate believe that it should be the policy of the Government and of the Oireachtas to support all worthwhile industries in this country and to give whatever protection is necessary. That was always the policy of the Fianna Fáil Government and we are <Col N="522" /> glad the present Government have accepted that policy.  In bygone days some people were not too enthusiastic about giving the necessary support to our industries.  We were told at one time by one Minister that some industrialists were making inordinate profits&mdash;and he referred to a certain type of punishment that should be meted out to them-but no details were forthcoming to justify the statement, so we are doubtful if there was any foundation at all for the statement.</P>
    <P>Later on we will be discussing a motion on the decentralisation of industry and that will give us wider scope for debate.  Item No. 6 here seems relevant to the manufacture of woollen gloves.  I understand the manufacture takes place in Donegal&mdash;I take it that it is the Donegal Gaeltacht, though the Parliamentary Secretary did not mention &ldquo;Gaeltacht&rdquo;.  We all agree it is desirable to see such an industry, for which the raw material can be obtained here at home, being given the necessary protection, being encouraged by this or any other Government. We should see to what extent it can be developed or extended to other parts of the Gaeltacht and the extent to which export markets can be found for these products.  The House should have no hesitation in giving protection to such industries.  There are many items on this list which we have not had very much time to study. Three amendments were handed to us this morning, involving very important items of public policy.  I submit that it is hardly treating the members of the House properly to present them with amendments of this nature at such short notice.  It is due to us that we should get ample notice of these matters.</P>

      <P>I, like everybody else on this side of the House, am in full agreement with the reasonable protection of home industry.  I was sorry to hear a reference made by Senator Kissane a minute ago to the allegation that the Fianna Fáil Party were the first really to get going about Irish industry and the protection of Irish industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGuire</NameTxt>
      <P>The policy of Cumann na nGaedheal before 1932 was a policy, in connection with protection, of selective protection.  That is to say, before industries were given a full measure of protection there was proper inquiry made to see whether all the factors concerning these industries were properly considered before protection was applied.  There are many factors to be taken into consideration. I grant that when Fianna Fáil came into power in 1932 they started an industrial drive, but it was a helter-skelter one and I think it has been shown over the passage of the years that it was not a well-advised policy in the long run, because many people went into industries and lost a lot of money and a lot of industries were created which are showing themselves now to be uneconomic.  It is a very moot point as to whether it was worth the candle, all the fuss and hurry made.  I still think, in the light of experience, that the policy of Fine Gael&mdash;or Cumann na nGaedheal, as it was then&mdash;of selective protection would have given us industries which would be established in the home market now and in a much better position to deal with exports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A lot of people have fallen by the wayside.  I agree that there were attacks on industrialists, saying that they made a lot of money and that they were profiteers.  I think the few people who did well, and deservedly did well, should have been credited with success.  It is very often forgotten that large numbers of them did not make any money in Irish industry but lost money, in investing it here and creating employment.  In a small way I suffered a bit myself in that way and I know other people who did.  I think those who suffered in that way suffered from the rushed policy of the Fianna Fáil Party, in rushing all sorts of industries without proper inquiry as to <Col N="524" /> whether they were going to give good value to the public, to provide a decent article, to give proper employment and give a proper return to the people who put money into them.  I am sure that if you inquire you will find that a large number suffered in that way.  It is unfortunate at this stage that people should go on talking about what Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael did for Irish industry.</P>
    <P>If we are to have successful industries they should be run on economic lines mainly.  The Government must help and protect them, but only reasonably so and not in a political way, not claiming what this Party or that Party did for industry.  Any industry which has to be propped up by political pressure or support like that is not going to last or be of lasting value to the economy of the country.  This, in my opinion, applies not only to industry but to agriculture as well.  The sooner agriculture and industry can be taken out of the political sphere, out of the heat of political argument, the better.</P>
    <P>In regard to this particular Order to-day, I would like to think that the Department&mdash;and the Minister, when he is making these Orders&mdash;is fully cognisant of all the factors concerned and I would like to think that these things are properly gone into before tariffs are put on or tariffs are reduced. One of the most important factors in connection with tariffs is the price factor.  After all, an industry should not be set up merely to give employment. That is a very laudable object, but industry should be set up with all sorts of objects.  One is to give employment, but secondly, it has to produce articles for our own consumers at the right price.  That is a very important factor which very often is forgotten. I am very much in favour, fully in favour, of protecting the home market here, but I think it should not be protected against fair competition from outside.  At present some industries here are protected against all competition.  I think any of the manufacturers' associations will agree that that is not desirable, but that they should be protected against unfair competition or dumping from other <Col N="525" /> countries.  We are all in favour of that.  If the Department is fully aware of that and takes that into consideration on every occasion, I am always in favour of any impositions they may make to protect good Irish industries here at home.</P>
    <P>It does not always follow that there should be heavy protection in the form of tariffs or in the form of completely debarring goods from coming in or allowing them in only under licence.  I think that is a shortsighted policy, because the assumption is that by closing off the market to the Irish manufacturer, by closing out competition from outside, the Irish manufacturer is then going to have a strong market to himself. That may happen in some cases but I know from my own business experience that very often it only creates a shrinkage of the home market, because in order to stimulate purchases by the customer or by the consumer a certain amount of variety is necessary. Where there is a sameness in goods in a case like this, where the market is small, the number of manufacturers is small and they cannot afford to produce a large variety of goods and consequently the palate of the consumer and of the customer is not stimulated enough to make them interested.  I have in the course of my business experience seen cases of a heavy tariff wall put up, the market for the goods shrinking and loss of demand.  When there is a reasonable amount of goods coming in from other countries to make the market give a variety and make it interesting for the consumer to buy, that should be taken into consideration.</P>
    <P>I was glad to see in the Bill to-day that there are some tariffs and duties being removed altogether because those goods are no longer manufactured in this country.  That is important. Unfortunately, in the past tariffs have been retained when there was no excuse for their retention because the industries they were originally set up to protect had disappeared for some reason or another.  I am glad to see that this Government is showing that they are not going to retain duties merely for revenue purposes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Fearon</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one Order <Col N="526" /> being confirmed on which I would like to comment.  It is No. 348.  As one interested in textiles I would say that there are two kinds of felt, ordinary woven felt&mdash;with which we are not concerned&mdash;and fibre felt.  By the confirmation of this Order we are going to put a duty on imported non-woven felt to the extent of 37½ per cent. full rate or 25 per cent. preference.  The number of ways in which this fibre felt can be used is enormous.  The text just specifies an underlay for floor covers. I can think of a dozen other ways in which it is used.  It is used as a surround, in the manufacture of hats, in the manufacture of slippers, as an insulator in gramophone turntables.  Of all the articles being subjected to duty on importation, felt is certainly number one on this list.  I would like to feel assured that the Department is convinced that our new firm, our newly established industry, can meet the demand for a variety of supplies without increasing the price.  Felt is used also in piano keys.  This means that some things will go up in price during the interregnum.  Another thing follows from what Senator McGuire has said. Here is a new industry, we wish it well and we are going to protect it in the early stages, but we have to be sure that the effect of that protection will not mean that the quality of our felt will be lessened in view of the fact that there is no competition.  Many of these imported felts have been made by manufacturers for a century or more. For particular purposes, I ask can we really produce something equal in these materials?  We ought when providing an umbrella to protect a young industry at the same time let the young industry know that we expect it to grow under that umbrella and that we look forward to the day when that umbrella can be removed.</P>
      <P>Those are the things I want to say. First, we must realise the widespread implications of the duty.  Woven felt is an impregnated felt.  That leaves an enormous number of other felts and if we give this concession to a new industry we are going to expect it to justify our confidence.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I should say that Senator Kissane has expressed my views with regard to this Bill.  Firstly, we are glad that the Minister has brought in this Bill, and we are glad of the evidence that has been given that the Minister and his Department are going to be very careful with regard to the whole question of tariffs.  I think it is unfair for the last Senator to say that the policy of the Fianna Fáil Government was one of granting indiscriminate authority for the setting up of industries, that they were not careful with regard to the industries to which they would grant protection.  I think anybody moving through the country and meeting people interested in industrial development will find that there was a great deal of dissatisfaction that they were not given protection when they asked for it so that they might set up industries which they thought would eventually prove economic and would prove of national value.  I would like Senator McGuire to remember, and anybody else who may be critical of the policy of protection, the whole circumstances under which that drive for <Col N="528" /> industrial development took place, the conditions that existed and exist almost to the present day with regard to industrial development in this country. If we have regard to these conditions, I think, instead of criticising as they do, in the carping manner in which they do, they will find there is more an occasion for throwing a bouquet at what has been achieved rather than for speaking as they did.</P>
    <P>In the first place, I do not intend to argue whether the policy has been a success or not.  I think the men and women in employment and the results accruing to capital are sufficient evidence that the movement has been a success.  Whether it has been the success we would like it to be is another matter but it has been a success.  I would like Senator McGuire and other Senators to remember the conditions of industrial tradition in this country in the early 30's, when, because of Government policy over more than a century before that, practically every industrial tradition worth while was destroyed. One of the biggest tasks we had to face in this country was the establishment of an industrial tradition.  Our technical schools were not equipped to assist as one would have liked them to have been equipped in order to help in this work.  We ought to remember that practically the whole period since the 30's has been an abnormal one.  From, say, 1930, to the advent of the war, the world all over had been suffering from serious industrial depressions.  Many countries were trying to dump their goods wherever they could and they saw this country as a suitable place in which to dump them.  It is true that people could have got goods cheaply if we had been prepared to allow dumped goods in but the nation would have paid dearly for it in after years if we had given in to the clamour that went on all the time for the stoppage of the industrial drive and the admission of these cheap, dumped goods.</P>
    <P>Again, we ought to take note of the fact that the war period was one that militated heavily against the proper and efficient development of industry in the country.  Scarcities of raw materials and the unfortunate dismissal <Col N="529" /> of trained men and their going away to Britain-these were very serious obstacles to the development of industry here.  These were a considerable brake on industry here reaching the level of efficiency we would desire within the time we would think would be a reasonable time.  War conditions were bad but I think most people will agree that post-war conditions were equally bad, that for, perhaps, three or four years they were worse even than the conditions that obtained during the war.  We had the difficulty of getting suitable raw materials and the difficulty of replacing machinery.  Then we have had difficulties of this kind: the attitude of so many people towards the earning of profits by capital.  In fact, industrialists would be ashamed almost to say that capital had reaped any reward at all.</P>
    <P>We had the position where showing a profit was to draw an attack on the industry concerned.  Our policy of taxation was one that militated heavily against the development of industry here and one that prevented it reaching efficiency within the time that we would like.  These things have got to be taken into account and if they are taken into account then I say that Senator McGuire has no case against the policy that has been carried out here rather intensively since, say, 1933 on.</P>
    <P>Senator McGuire has referred to industries which he does not like.  What industries are they?  I am not asking him now specifically to name them.  He might not like to do so and perhaps it would not be fair to name them, but in the proper place perhaps the Senator and people like him would take the opportunity&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;to indicate the industries which are unsuitable and which should never have been given a chance to get going in the country.  I have no doubt there will be isolated instances where an industry has failed because capital and labour did not realise their responsibilities to the Government and to the public, but I think on the whole that, instead of expressing dissatisfaction, the occasion <Col N="530" /> is one for expressing satisfaction with what has been achieved.</P>
      <P>In regard to the quality of the goods, there have been many opinions as to what the right quality is but I think if we allow for this, that variety is not such as we would like, I think it is still true that by and large quality in Ireland can stand up against any test from any country.</P>

      <P>Just the point made by the two Senators about the time of presentation of the amendments. However, I will leave it till later on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In speaking on the Second Stage I should like to say that I agree with all the speakers so far that in general principle we welcome this Bill, and I welcome the principle underlying it of giving a measure of protection to home industries.  Nevertheless, I regard it as our duty here in the Seanad, as it is the duty of members of the Dáil, to examine and scrutinise just precisely what degree of protection is being given in various instances.  It is for <Col N="531" /> us, I think, not necessarily to be so familiar with all the details as to be able to give a final decision, but it is for us to ask the Minister or his representative to justify in some detail particular items arising out of the general principles which this Bill represents.</P>
    <P>I think we all welcome, as has been said, a reduction of duty in certain cases, as has been proposed by this Bill, or even an abolition of some protective duties.  It is quite clear we welcome it.  However, in some cases new duties are being introduced here which will more than double the import price.  Cotton gloves that are coming in at 54/- will apparently have a duty of 60/- put upon them.  It may be that that almost punitive duty has a justification. However, I should like to hear it because that measure of protection seems to me to be very high.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Kissane that we must give &ldquo;whatever protection is necessary&rdquo;, and I emphatically agree with Senator McGuire that when we give protection it must only be reasonably protective.  It is up to us to ask pointed questions, if necessary, as to what justification there is for the higher duties here suggested.  The general principle of protection is one we accept.  I can say, without having any Party political axe to grind, that it does not matter to me which Party would like to get the loudest applause for this kind of protection.  As Senator McGuire said, the justification for protection lies really in the industry itself &mdash;its flourishing state, its finished product and its value to the consumer.  I would add that it lies also in the capacity of the industry increasingly to do without protection, or, at any rate, to reduce its need for protection.</P>
    <P>As I see it, the protection of our home industry has three main advantages. They are obvious ones.  I do not intend to dwell upon them.  The first is home employment: Irish workers employed in Ireland.  Secondly, home control or, at any rate, a measure of home control by ourselves of the product, its presentation, its marketing, its price, and so forth.  I say: a measure of home control of the <Col N="532" /> product.  Thirdly, there is the Government guarantee of continuity of production&mdash;a continuity of supply of a particular product, even under emergency or wartime conditions.  One thinks of sugar in that context.  One thinks of the availability of sugar during the last war as opposed to its great scarcity during the 1914-18 war arising from the fact that in 1914-18 we had not got a home sugar industry, whereas in the last war we had.  Home employment, home control of the product&mdash;a measure of control&mdash;and a home guarantee of continuity of supply, even under difficult wartime conditions.  For these advantages, we, as a community, as consumers, are ready to pay a little more for the product itself in the retail market, and to our own manufacturers, than it would be necessary, without protective barriers, to pay to an outside manufacturer; and we may be compelled, as we have been in certain cases, to raise protective barriers.</P>
    <P>I was interested, nevertheless, to read in this morning's paper&mdash;and I read it with entire approval&mdash;a reference, at the F.A.O. Conference in Rome, by the Minister for Agriculture to his hope that the countries of the world would see the folly of raising more and more barriers against trade, and would see the advantages of dropping as many as possible of these barriers, in order to allow a free interchange of goods, of supplies, of raw materials and of manpower.  In contrast to that, I think anybody who follows the debates in the Council of Europe will recognise that the Irish policy in regard to protection and tariffs&mdash;when it comes to a European suggestion that there should be a general lowering of tariffs&mdash;is very, very strongly protectionist.  We do not appear to be prepared to accept the principle that, with general agreement, we might gradually&mdash;imperceptibly&mdash;lower these tariffs.  As a consequence, when I find a Bill before us to increase certain tariffs or to impose new tariffs, I put the question as to whether it is really necessary to impose all of these, and, if so, whether it is really necessary to raise them as high as all that.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="533" /> How soft and how deep is it necessary to make the cushions with which our industries, our manufacturers, are to be cushioned?  We have a number of metaphors in relation to these new industries of ours.  Senator Fearon referred to the umbrella that was given to the infant, I think he said, but the hope was that the infant growing up would be able more and more to dispense with the umbrella.  I do not care much what metaphor is used. My hope would be that we would see and have demonstrated in our legislation the logic of the proposition that an infant industry requires more protection than a thriving concern.  Yet we seem through this Bill to be saying to thriving adult industries that they require as much protection as or even more protection than an infant industry.  If we are to imagine an industry being started in this country to produce, say, product X, it is quite clear that the expenditure, time, thought, imagination&mdash;all of these things&mdash;will necessarily be at a higher level in the beginning than they will be later on.  In putting up buildings, the capital expenditure, equipment, machines, and so forth, will be costly. In other words, the getting going of an industry will be a more costly process than the keeping going of an industry.  I would say, furthermore, that those who run any industry worthy of respect will find they are learning monthly, yearly, more and more about production itself, about marketing, and so forth.  They will find they are acquiring an increasing body of skill in relation to the production, marketing, advertising, and so forth, of their product.  I suggest that that increasing body of knowledge ought so to increase their efficiency as a productive unit as to enable them to do at any rate with slightly less protection than they had to have when they were in the difficult early years. That proposition seems to me to be logically so obvious that I do not intend to labour it further.</P>
    <P>Who shall say that a new manufacturer who ceases to be new and has been in the business for five or ten years has, during that period, learned nothing to improve the techniques of his trade and the manufacturing and <Col N="534" /> distributing processes, and consequently requires absolutely to the last per cent. the same measure of protection as he did in the early years? In other words, if we do not find in our new industries&mdash;I use the word &ldquo;new&rdquo; to cover those that have sprung up, under protection, in the last 15 years or so&mdash;increasing efficiency, are we not entitled, when we are asking for new protective barriers, increasing tariffs and so forth, to ask why has there been no increasing efficiency?  Are we not entitled to ask: &ldquo;Are you not any better at all now than when you started, than when you went into business?&rdquo; The answer to that question by many Irish industries will undoubtedly be: &ldquo;Yes, we are more efficient.  We can produce more efficiently.&rdquo; However, there is&mdash;I suppose it is a human reaction&mdash;a reluctance to see the logical outcome of that, which is that they could, in fact, do with a shade less protection and sometimes considerably less protection. That is why I welcome one particular item here in relation to which the Minister has gone to the trouble to find out&mdash;admittedly at the request of an outside body&mdash;the particular efficiency of a particular industry and to reach the conclusion, under the I.D.A., that this industry has been doing so well that they can reduce the protective barrier of 25 per cent., which it used to be, to 20 per cent. That is one example, implemented by the Minister, which I very much welcome, one example of the sort of general pattern I should like to see, that is, a descending sliding scale of duties and protective barriers for industries as, more and more, they prove their efficiency by requiring less and less protection from the State-because this is protection from the State, from all of us here as legislators; and which is, in fact, paid for by the consumer and is, in effect, an indirect subsidising of the manufacturer by the consuming public.</P>
    <P>Frequently we are told that subsidies are uneconomic, and that an article must stand on its own feet, that a product must be allowed to &ldquo;find its own economic price level,&rdquo; and so forth.  In actual fact, when we raise a protective barrier, and force the <Col N="535" /> consumer consequently to pay more for a competitive article&mdash;for an article that would be more sharply competitive if we had not the duty&mdash;I suggest that what we are doing in implementing a Bill of this kind is recognising the principle of asking consumers to pay an indirect subsidy to the manufacturer. I am not saying that that may not be a good principle, but what I am arguing is this: are the manufacturers always aware of this principle and, if so, are they always suitably grateful to the consumer and to the State for this hidden subsidy of their own private enterprise?  I am prompted to put that question because I am afraid a number of our industrialists and employers tend to talk more and more &mdash;to use a new coined word&mdash;about Statism, whenever the State does something which they think interferes with them.  However, they have no objection to the State's providing them with a crutch, a bath-chair, a cushion, an umbrella&mdash;whatever metaphor you like to use&mdash;in order to protect their industry.  Statism, as they see it, is merely any suggestion that the State might have a look at how they are running their business, at their efficiency, their prices, their &ldquo;arrangements&rdquo; with other manufacturers, and so forth: such community vigilance is called &ldquo;Statism.&rdquo;  We have had the word used in relation to agriculture, to the marketing of onions, the marketing of fish, and so forth, over and over in the past year.  Yet it is a generally recognised principle in this country that certain things are the province of the State.  We are told that it is the province of the State to decide what books we may read and what books we may not read.  The State&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It is suggested, I say, by people who are going to be protected by this kind of duty that this kind of protective State intervention is all right, but that any corollary right which the State might take, arising from these protective duties granted by the State to certain industries, to have a look at these industries, is called &ldquo;unwarranted State intervention&rdquo;.  I should like to put this question to the Seanad through the Cathaoirleach.  At whose service ultimately do we want to put our community strength, as represented and symbolised by our power to legislate, to give protective duties, to protect? I would expect that we are all agreed that it should be used not simply for private interests but, as far as we can ensure it, for the public good.  And, so, if we find a particular industry sheltered behind a protective duty on their products coming in from abroad of 50 per cent.&mdash;as is the case in some of these&mdash;organising itself, and if there is a small number of manufacturers who insist that the gross profit taken by retailers in relation to that product shall be 50 per cent., and refuse supplies to any retailer who is prepared to take less than a gross profit of 50 per cent., we have got to put the question to ourselves whether this protective duty is being abused; and, if so, should it be modified, and, if so, again, was it, perhaps, too high in the first place?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator McGuire spoke about competition. I would agree with all he said and I think what he said is worth looking at again and worth studying. What he said is absolutely sound.  He made several points.  He made the point that sometimes it may even be to the good of the Irish product to get a little bit of competition from outside and that the unavailability in his experience of certain foreign goods, so far from increasing the saleability of comparable Irish articles, actually produced a slump, because the very <Col N="537" /> element of choice and competition had a beneficial effect on the sale of both. That is something which should be recognised, and I am very glad it was said.</P>
    <P>He made the distinction between fair competition and unfair competition. That distinction is often made, but Senator McGuire went further and gave a definition of what he meant. Many people in talking about that do not give a definition.  Senator McGuire suggested that the only kind of unfair competition was what might be called &ldquo;dumping&rdquo;, the bringing in of goods at a concealed subsidy price.  Otherwise, he said, let us have a bit of competition, and that will, in fact, improve the Irish market, and will not hit the Irish product.</P>
    <P>In my experience some Irish manufacturers&mdash;I would not by any means like to say all of them&mdash;have no objection at all to being sheltered, cushioned, and protected by the State at the expense of the consumer, but if the consumer is to ask for an account of their stewardship, through such bodies as the Prices Advisory Body and the Fair Trade Commission, then there is an uproar.  I think one may mention those two bodies because one was set up by one Government and the other by the other.  Therefore, in praising both, one distributes praise fairly evenly.</P>
    <P>I should like to suggest that in the principle of this Bill there is, in granting this measure of protection, an implied right to ask the manufacturers what they are doing behind this tariff wall.  I think the community have that right and duty.  Occasionally one finds a manufacturer saying: &ldquo;Let us do away with things like the Fair Trade Commission &lsquo;for the sake of freedom&rsquo;.&rdquo; I am quoting Mr. Dalton, retiring President of the Wireless Dealers' Association.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="539" /> I should like to quote another similar statement, this time by the chairman of a big company&mdash;the Sunbeam Wolsey Company.  I should like to quote him for two or three reasons&mdash; first for a summary by him of precisely what all Irish manufacturers ought to be able to say behind a tarriff wall, when it exists.  He says&mdash;I am quoting from their annual report which appeared in the daily Press on September 29th:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We have scoured the world for knowledge and information to keep our processes at a most advanced stage, and all these businesses operate efficiently, and are always competitive in prices where the economic size of the market and the wage levels are roughly the same as our own.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Would that all our manufacturers could say the same.  A statement of that principle seems to me to be the sort of thing one might reasonably expect.  We are not asking Irish manufacturers to compete against different wage levels and different economic levels; but where conditions are roughly the same we should like to think they are capable of competing.</P>
    <P>The same chairman, nevertheless, finds it necessary to attack in no uncertain terms the Fair Trade Commission which he calls &ldquo;an unwarranted intrusion on the rights of private enterprise&rdquo;. He asks for its abolition, although he says he is not in favour of the restriction of supply, and yet goes on to postulate his right to supply his goods only to &ldquo;desirable traders&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>I would suggest that in that field the competition is pretty intense.  All I would say is that many of our Irish industries are doing pretty nicely behind a protective barrier, and when we are asked to institute a new duty I think we have the right to ask for a detailed justification not merely of the putting on of the duty but of the degree of the duty proposed.</P>
      <P>I do not propose to say very much more on the Second Stage.  As the House knows, I put down three recommendations for the Committee Stage. I should like to say that I welcome in this Bill the reduction, or the abolition, of certain duties.  But I feel inclined to resist, particularly in some cases, increases of duties that appear to me to be too high, or unfairly distributed, unless a detailed and convincing case is put before us by the Minister or his Parliamentary Secretary.  I shall refer to them on the three recommendations when that stage comes, but the Chair might, perhaps, permit me to say that it was for the purpose of allowing this House, if it wanted to take the Committee Stage to-day rather than put it off until next week, that I made available the recommendations, which I would have been quite entitled to hold until the Second Stage was over and which would have entailed a few days of the time of this House next week. That might have meant inconvenience for the House.  It might have inconvenienced the Department and the Minister, because I understood it was the desire of the Minister to get the Committee Stage to-day if possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When it was suggested that my amendments might be circulated before the Second Stage was finished, I agreed.  They were circulated in printed form this morning, but they were circulated yesterday in duplicated form.  I should be quite happy to have this matter considered for a full week, and it is not my desire at all to <Col N="541" /> rush this.  If the Senators who have referred to the swift manner in which these amendments were put in feel strongly about it, I hope they will get up and ask that the Committee Stage be deferred to next week.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Like nearly every other speaker, I am favourable to the general principle of this Bill, subject to some explanations which the Parliamentary Secretary may offer.  The last Senator has taken advantage of this measure to give the House the benefit of a considerable amount of philosophy on economics and on protection versus free trade.  Like much academic philosophy, it would be improved if it were brought closer to realities as a result of practical experience.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>For example, the Senator said that while a new industry might be entitled to a measure of protection, that protection should be gradually withdrawn as the industry gains experience and efficiency.  He laid that down as a definite principle.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OwenSkeffington" hpid="Dr. Sheehy Skeffington Dr. Sheehy Skeffington">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>That means exactly the same thing, that it should be modified, withdrawn partially or completely. That would be quite true if conditions remained static, exactly as they were when the industry was established.  We all know that in the general world of trade conditions change from year to year.  A new industry might be established when conditions of competition might be reasonably fair.  In five years, when that industry had become more efficient, a large-scale attempt at dumping, disguised or otherwise, might be operated by some outside interest. Another circumstance could arise, in which the workers in that industry, who in the initial stages of its development might be satisfied with a relatively low wage, might demand a substantial increase in remuneration and if the industry, though increasing in <Col N="542" /> experience and efficiency, were to have its measure of protection withdrawn or curtailed it would probably be brought to a standstill or closed down.  I am sure Senator Sheehy Skeffington would not welcome such a development.  That is just an indication of how economic philosophy of an academic nature may not be in strict accordance with realities.  In the same way, Senator Sheehy Skeffington strongly condemned representatives of this country, irrespective of what Government was in power, standing up rather resolutely for the maintenance of protection&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;in the Council of Europe and other international assemblies.  Here again you are dealing with a position in which our representatives were defending a small and to a considerable extent undeveloped nation, whereas the advocates of the removal of all protective tariffs might be speaking on behalf of well-developed or over-developed industrial nations with very substantial resources.  Surely some distinction ought to be drawn between a nation which is only 30 years in the enjoyment of the power to protect its own industries and nations which have had hundreds of years, perhaps, of enjoyment of self-government and the right to protect their own industries?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We know that 200 or 300 years ago Britain was very violently and very vigorously protecting her own industries, even against the subject nation of Ireland&mdash;or the nation she endeavoured to make subject&mdash;by industrial protection and we know that by intense methods of protection&mdash;perhaps that would be a mild word to use&mdash;they suppressed industrial development here for the benefit of their manufactures. Surely a small nation starting out to establish its foothold in the world economy should be allowed to protect its own citizens, its own workers and its own manufactures?  In the same way, Senator Sheehy Skeffington loudly applauded a statement made by one of our Ministers in Rome in regard to &ldquo;the free exchange of men, money <Col N="543" /> and materials.&rdquo;  If we had a free exchange of men, money and materials, I wonder how long our little country would survive.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>We did.  A hundred years ago we had a very free exchange of materials as well as of men and as a result we wiped out more than half of our population.  That was practically 100 years ago.  Whatever about exporting men, it is true that the measures of protection that have been adopted over the past 20 years have provided employment here for 100,000 of our own people.  That is a substantial achievement in 20 years, seeing that eight of those 20 years were years of emergency in which it was very difficult to secure essential supplies to keep our industries going.  Nevertheless, we have made substantial progress.  For that reason, I am favourable to this Bill, inasmuch as it seeks to preserve and maintain that protection which was initiated 20 years ago.</P>
      <P>While the Bill seeks to provide increased duties for a variety of products, there is provision in the Schedule for the reduction of the duty on slashers and slash hooks, which are manufactured here&mdash;very efficiently I must say&mdash;by at least one Irish firm and I think by several.  I would welcome this reduction if it were dictated by the fact that the duty is no longer necessary, but if it is dictated by outside interests we should like to know how strongly, if at all, that dictation was opposed.  I would like to know also if the effect of this reduction will be to reduce production at home or to reduce employment.  I am quite sure some investigations have been made in regard to this particular matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the entire revocation of duty on display stands for business purposes, I am quite sure that that revocation was dictated by the failure of the Irish industries concerned to provide the goods.  I understand that is the reason for the revocation.  I would like to ask the Parliamentary Secretary if there was more than one <Col N="544" /> firm engaged in this line of manufacture and, if not, if any attempts were made to promote the manufacture of those products elsewhere.  It is a very small industry and a very light industry. All over the country we have development committees seeking to have industries established in the small towns and villages and anxious to know of some particular line of production which they could undertake. I would like to know if this particular industry was brought to the notice of people anxious to promote a new industry and if all possible efforts were made to have it undertaken here. We have an Industrial Development Authority and it should be one of their functions to promote industries of this kind.  I would expect that they would have submitted to the Minister a report on their efforts to ensure that this particular industry would be put on a sound footing or that a new industry would be established elsewhere to take advantage of that protective tariff before it was abolished.  If all efforts failed, then the Minister was quite justified in revoking the tariff.  If manufacturers fail to produce the protected commodities efficiently and at a reasonable price, the tariff must go, but not until the matter has been well investigated.</P>
    <P>I have no comment to make on angle-iron fencing.  I think the conversion of angle-iron into fencing or sticks or posts could hardly be regarded as a manufacturing industry, or as providing much employment.</P>
    <P>With regard to the substantially increased duty on milk cans, I would like the Parliamentary Secretary to tell the House how that will affect prices. I would like a clear statement as to how the prices of milk cans will be affected by this tariff.  The tariff is fairly substantial, but it does not follow&mdash;and I am not one of those who hold that it follows&mdash;that the amount of the tariff would be passed on to the consumer.  In this case the consumer is the producer&mdash;that is to say, the consumer of milk cans is the producer of milk, and he is finding his costs of production and his difficulties sufficiently trying at the present time.  An increase in his production costs would be very unwelcome at the present <Col N="545" /> moment.  I am not one of those who hold that a potentially useful industry in the manufacture of milk cans should be closed down merely because there is a temporary increase in the cost of the cans.  I hold that if the increase is substantial its effect on milk production should be taken into account and that any investigation that is being held into the cost of producing milk should include such an imposition, if there is an imposition.  I think the dairying industry generally, being an important industry, is entitled to have a statement as to how exactly the Parliamentary Secretary anticipates that the price of cans supplied to farmers will be affected by this tariff.</P>

      <P>I am in general agreement with the statements made by Senator Kissane and Senator Ó Buachalla, but I should like to dissent from the Order increasing the duty on milk cans.  Farmers engaged in milk production think the cost of producing milk is already too high.  A commission has been dealing with the costs of production for the past three or four years but, so far, the costs have not been produced.  In my view, it would be desirable that that part of this Order be deleted until such time as the costings in connection with milk production are produced.</P>
      <P>The general body of farmers believe that milk is being produced at an uneconomic price and now they will wonder why the price of milk cans should be increased.  I want to impress on the Seanad that I dissent from that Order because I believe the time is inopportune.  That is my own personal belief: I am not speaking for any Party or any other body but myself when I say that I dissent from that part of the Order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>When I read the debate on this Bill in the other House I saw that it was allowed to go a little wider than the terms of the Bill but I do not propose to seek your indulgence in trying to widen the Bill here.  So much has been said that I should like to suggest that, if Senators are agreeable, we put down a motion to discuss the whole question in a wider sense. <Col N="546" /> A discussion on the Order here for tariffs narrows the debate and we cannot follow anything to its logical conclusion.</P>
      <P>In any of the points that have been made&mdash;and many of them were admirable&mdash;you immediately find you have to seal them off when they show any form of development.  The result is that the evolution of one's thought is stultified.  Therefore, I suggest to the House that we could fruitfully put down a motion and presume that the Minister or the Parliamentary Secretary would be prepared to come here and help us and give us his opinion on these matters.</P>
      <P>I come now to the Bill.  One of the things the Minister for Industry and Commerce must have regard to is the protection of industries that are manufacturing here from native materials. For example, we have established a steel industry in Cork.  Anyone using steel in this country for the manufacture of products&mdash;and particularly for the export of products&mdash;must insist that they buy steel at a competitive price from the factory manufacturing the steel and steel products in this country.  If they are not put in a position to do that, then they are at a great disadvantage: I presume they would even be put in the position of asking for a further tariff to protect them.  I have heard of one or two cases where local steel is higher than the imported commodity and when I get some specific information I am going to send it to the Minister.</P>
      <P>In this Bill, there is a protection for felt.  I hope the people who are manufacturing this felt will use as little of the measure of protection as is necessary because tariffs are often put on for the purpose of allowing the home market to be used.  I say now that the home market ought not be abused. Manufacturers should try&mdash;and, by and large, the majority of them do&mdash;to sell considerably below the amount of the tariff.  It is quite common that a person who has the benefit of a 25 per cent. tariff is selling at only 10 per cent. or 15½ per cent. over the price of the imported article if it were allowed in free of duty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I sometimes believe it might be better <Col N="547" /> if we used a low tariff and a quota because there is the question of variety in a small market such as ours.  I think the shadow Minister for Industry and Commerce said in the other House that one of the difficulties with regard to this tariff on bill-hooks and slashers was that another trader in a town might like to have a different brand and a different style so that he might be able to say: &ldquo;That is a better one than you will get at Messrs. X.&rdquo;  We are up against that difficulty.  I think a small tariff and a quota would suit that type of trading and anybody with any experience of trading will know that that is so.  Therefore, I suggest that that is one of the things that might be considered.  I believe the Department of Industry and Commerce and the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Parliamentary Secretary would be able to see that quotas of that sort would in no way be abused &mdash;but there is that danger.</P>
    <P>Senator Sheehy Skeffington mentioned that we should be allowed to inspect industries because we give protection.  The real reason why we are giving protection here is that we have a market of only 3,000,000 people. Our neighbours across the water have a market of 50,000,000 in the United Kingdom alone and I suppose they have at least another 50,000,000 in the Empire and the dependencies: that means that they have a market of 100,000,000 persons, at least.  Consider the position of our manufacturers as against British manufacturers&mdash;not to say anything about our friend, Uncle Sam.  His productive capacity is so enormous that I suppose that if he worked for a day in one of these industries he would be able to supply all that we would require for a full 12 months.  That is why I am suggesting for consideration a quota and a small tariff rather than a high tariff. It would be a pity if having given that protection to cushion us against these very large competitors, we should think it our right to interfere with the day-to-day workings of an industry.  I doubt if civil servants, trained in that way, would have any real experience in the working of industry.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="548" /> I now find myself in the difficulty that this Bill gives, namely, that I cannot develop further.  With our whole system of taxation and the types of industries we have here, we must naturally have a small industry. Taxation was designed originally to suit big industry in Britain and you would have to orientate the system of taxation to suit our needs.  Our industries employ from 50 to 100 persons rather than 1,000 to 10,000 persons, as if the case, say, in America in a comparable form of industry.  It is obvious, therefore, that our whole set-up would have to be very different.</P>
    <P>I thought it was wise of the Minister to remove tariffs in favour of industries that were not producing in this country certain display figures, shapes or stands.  No doubt the Minister felt the best thing he could do was to remove the protection given to them.  I should like the Minister to continue along that line.  I am managing director of a particular firm and in our business we always want parts for various types of refrigerators.  No refrigerators are manufactured in this country but, nevertheless, we have to apply for a licence when we want to import.  I have found that recently the post office authorities are lenient with regard to allowing in small matters but lack of a part worth maybe a couple of pounds might impede the production of a large industry and these parts and the machines themselves are not manufactured in this country.  I suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that he continue that process of removing from the list of protected industries those industries which are no longer manufacturing or really seeking adequate protection in this country.</P>
    <P>I shall take the opportunity of putting down a motion, with any other members who might like to be associated with it, so that when the Minister feels he has the time he can come here and discuss this all-important problem with us in its widest implications.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>We all agree that our Irish industries deserve protection&mdash; necessary protection.  People with whom I am associated are as keen about giving protection to Irish industries as any other people.  I was somewhat <Col N="549" /> amazed by remarks made here this afternoon.  We heard one person say that labour and capital do not appreciate their responsibilities.</P>
      <P>The former Minister for Industry and Commerce prepared a Bill in 1947 known as the Industrial Prices and Efficiency Bill.  In that Bill, he proposed joint councils on which labour and the employers would have joint responsibility.  The Irish Manufacturers' Association issued an alarming statement in which they said that, so far as they were concerned, under no circumstances would they allow the workers to have any say whatever in industry.  A line could be drawn there&mdash;that labour had a greater sense of responsibility in developing Irish industries than the Irish manufacturers.</P>
      <P>It is only fair to say, also, that the industries of this country have been bad since they got protection.  I mentioned the profits here for 1938 on another occasion and the profits for 1944.  It was an amazing picture.  The wages and the status and the standard of living of the workers did not rise at the same rate as the rise in the industrialists' profits, and so forth.</P>
      <P>It is unfair to say that anybody was too critical of the industrialists.  If we are paying for protection&mdash;and paying dearly sometimes&mdash;and if we find that certain industrialists are not taking advantage of it but just sitting back and exploiting the home market, are we not entitled to say that the State should come in and see that the community are not exploited?  I do not disagree with Senator Sheehy Skeffington about the State's having that right.  Certainly the State should have that right.  Some of the Senators applauded the Minister because some protection was omitted in this Bill.  If the State gives protection surely it has an equal right to investigate those industries which are protected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can assure the House that we are behind the Minister and the Government in affording protection to Irish industry.  I could make some comments about some industries which got very strong protection.  They did very well and were paying good dividends to their shareholders and giving a good many bonuses.  I think we should <Col N="550" /> have a fair calculation as to how industrialists and industry are protected. Reference was made to profits.  Nobody suggests that people should not have something but we have not yet got back to the conception as to what industry stands for or what are the functions of industry.  Something more than finding profits should be the function of industry.</P>
    <P>Some Senators spoke about the reduction of tariffs but if there was more State intervention and investigation there would be less necessity for tariffs in certain industries and yet there could still be good industrial profits made and the productivity would not be any the less from an industrial point of view.  We are prepared to stand behind this Bill and we are prepared to give industry every opportunity of development.  As far as the people with whom I am associated are concerned we have made as many sacrifices and have done as much for the development and protection of industry as anybody else in the country.  That is why we have a Bill like the present one before us.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJCrotty" hpid="Mr. Crotty Mr. Crotty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crotty</NameTxt>
      <P>Judging from the general discussion which took place, everybody seems to be agreeable to the passing of this Bill.  The Bill itself shows the detailed manner in which the Minister has gone into the question of protection. It shows that in some cases increased protection has taken place whilst in others the protection has been reduced and yet in others it has been removed altogether.  The Bill shows that the Minister has gone into this whole matter in a very detailed way.  It does not give protection simply for the sake of protection.</P>
      <P>Senator Kissane and others mentioned profit.  Any industry in this country which is protected is also subject to control and practically all their accounts are submitted annually to the Department to have them examined with a view to seeing that reasonable profits&mdash;and only reasonable profits&mdash; are gathered from their endeavours.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator McGuire spoke about protection in general and indiscriminate protection. I can assure the House that before the Government or the Minister <Col N="551" /> can give any protection to any industry there is a very detailed examination as to the price and quality of the goods and the ability of that industry to supply the home market in full.  Before an industry gets protection that industry has to prove that a reasonably good article is produced for the Irish consumer.</P>
    <P>Senator Fearon mentioned the matter of underfelt and so also did Senator Burke.  There is a very big line of underfelt being manufactured in this country and anybody requiring supplies of underfelt which are not manufactured in this country will get duty free import licences freely.  I think that covers that point.</P>
    <P>Senator Ó Buachalla made reference to indiscriminate tariffs.  I think that in general both industrialists and workers have succeeded very well.  I think the only industry that ever failed in this country was an industry which failed through inefficient management. That was due, I am sure, to the lack of tradition and lack of suitable people with the knowledge of running these businesses either as managers or secretaries.</P>
    <P>Senator Sheehy Skeffington spoke about the price of gloves.  He said the price of imported gloves would be doubled as the result of this tariff.  The duty on fabric gloves is intended solely to keep out low-priced Far Eastern gloves which were on offer at prices with which the Irish manufacturer could not possibly compete.  The duty on gloves imported from the United Kingdom and Canada still remains as it was.  There is no change there.</P>
    <P>Senator Sheehy Skeffington also referred to the question of reduction and spoke about hidden subsidies. Protection is necessary in a small country like ours no matter how efficient our industries are.  We cannot have the same long runs in industries in regard to a particular item.  Our mills cannot, as they do in England and other places, specialise in the production of certain items.  The mill here has to produce a large variety of items.  That increases costs to a level higher than you would have in any other country. No matter how efficiently we can run <Col N="552" /> our industries here, unless it is built up to have a very large production through exports, we cannot hope to reduce our costs.  In other countries these industries have very large markets at their very doorsteps.  The Industrial Development Authority at the request of the Minister carried out reviews as to the efficiency of protected industries over a number of years and the results of protection in those industries.</P>
    <P>Senators Cogan and O'Callaghan raised the question of slashers and milk cans.  A review was asked for by the British Board of Trade.  That was held by the Industrial Development Authority.  Evidence was taken from the people who wanted to have the tariff removed and also from the manufacturers here.  That firm gave evidence.  The tariff was reduced. The firm in question has not so far made any representations.  I take it for granted that it has not increased the importation of slash-hooks.</P>

      <P>If anything.  Senator O'Callaghan spoke about milk cans.  I mentioned in my opening remarks that the industry producing the milk cans was equipped to turn out the full requirements of the country in cans up to 12 gallons capacity.  Although the home produced cans were protected in price with the list prices of similarly imported cans there was evidence that exporters in other countries were manipulating prices to bring them down to or below Irish prices notwithstanding the duty payable.  These people have guaranteed to the Minister that there will be no increase in the price of milk cans due to the increase in duty.  I think it is most essential that this country should have that industry.  If it was put out of being, I wonder would these people exporting cans to this country be manipulating prices to bring them down to what they are now? I think this firm deserves praise for <Col N="553" /> being able to produce these articles at competitive world prices at the present time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes. Whether or not a long time is required, I should like to give my reasons for the three recommendations, in order. The first one is to delete Order No. 105 of 1955 which relates to the duty on knitted woollen gloves.  Before I give my reason for moving this particular portion of the amendment, I should like to remind the Seanad that by reason of the fact that this is a Money Bill no Senator can move an amendment which is simply a modification. I personally should have preferred to propose a modification of this Order, because my objection to it is only on the ground of one detail.  I do not object to the general principle of the tariff.  I recognise the utility and the necessity of protecting this industry which, as the Parliamentary Secretary told us, is centred mainly in Donegal, where the people produce these knitted woollen gloves.  They probably have very few other sources of income.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My objection is that the rate of duty proposed for men's woollen gloves is equivalent to 72 per cent. and the rate proposed for women's gloves is equivalent to roughly 70 per cent., but&mdash;and this is what I object to&mdash;the rate on children's gloves is 100 per cent.  That is the detail I object to.  I should like to see a uniform percentage in respect of men's, women's and children's gloves.  I think that parents have quite enough to do to try and cope with paying for children's clothing, which is very far from being cheap, and which has to be provided more often than adult clothing.  I think it is wrong not merely to vary the sum of money of the duty, but actually the percentage duty on children's clothes which is considerably higher.  I should have no objection to its being lower than for adults in order to benefit the parents, but it is actually higher than <Col N="555" /> the duty on adult gloves.  If it had been possible for me to propose an amendment which would simply bring that duty into line with the other two duties I should have been happy to do so, but that, under the rules of the House, is not possible.  If, on the other hand, it were decided to delete this Order, the Minister&mdash;I speak subject to correction&mdash;could make another such Order to-morrow morning, enshrining a percentage which would be the same for all these gloves.  That Order would have, of course, to come before the Oireachtas within a period of eight months, but there is no difficulty about that.  In other words, if we delete this Order now, the Minister can to-morrow make a fresh Order along lines which would seem, I hope, more equitable to this House.  Consequently, by moving the deletion of this Order I do not feel that any harm or injustice will be done, because it is well within the power of the Minister to make a fresh Order to-morrow morning.  I do not think I will stress that part.  That is my only objection to it&mdash;the much higher duty on children's gloves comparatively with that on adult gloves.</P>
    <P>The second point has already been referred to by two Senators.  There is a proposal to increase the duty on certain milk cans.  The point has already been made, and it was Senator Cogan, I think, who made it, that the person who pays this increased price, if it means an increased price, will be the milk producer.  It may ultimately be the milk consumer.  I think we ought to be very hesitant indeed in proposing an increased duty on such an essential element in relation to a section of our agricultural production.  It is quite possible for a person to say &ldquo;I will do without a new pair of gloves this year&rdquo;, but if a milk producer requires a new 12-gallon can, he simply cannot do without it.  Therefore, in asking him to pay more, I think you are doing something wrong.  Now, the Parliamentary Secretary, in dealing with this particular item since it was objected to by one or two Senators, has said, in defence of the Order, that the local firm can meet the full requirements of the country in this respect. <Col N="556" /> I wonder is that either necessary or desirable?  I wonder what effect it might have upon the continuing high quality of these milk cans to have virtually no effective competition?  I am wondering, along the lines of what Senator McGuire said earlier, whether it might not be a good thing to have a choice, at a comparable price, between a good Irish product and a good non-Irish product.  Let the choice be more or less at a comparable price, not necessarily at the same price.  I am not satisfied that we want always to fulfil all our local requirements from Irish industry.  I think a little margin for competition would be extremely healthy for the quality and the durability of the article, and I think the Parliamentary Secretary might perhaps deal a little bit more with that point.</P>
    <P>I have no knowledge at all of the relative merits of 12-gallon milk cans. I am so ignorant that I sometimes call them milk churns, but I am sure Senator Cogan will be able to tell us what constitutes a good 12-gallon can, what constitutes a middling 12-gallon can and what constitutes a not so good 12-gallon can.  It seems to me that the element of durability, seeing what is done to these cans, as one sees them dealt with along the roads, is a very important factor.</P>
    <P>I am not criticising the Irish product. I do not know.  I am quite prepared to be told that it is as good as, or better than, anything that can be brought in.  If it is, then it can stand on that merit, because the farmer is no fool and he knows a good milk can, presumably, better than I do when he sees it.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="557" /> The Parliamentary Secretary has told us that some foreign firms have been &ldquo;manipulating prices&rdquo; in order to bring them down below the Irish price. I should like to hear just a little bit more about that.  It is quite obvious that there might be, say, British firms whose efficiency has lately been increased. I do not know whether these cans come from Britain.  Perhaps they come from Denmark, Scandinavia or France, but it might be that these foreign firms have increased their efficiency, and that the reason why there is a drop in the price of the product is that they are being more efficient at their business.  If that is so I do not think it would be quite fair to call that &ldquo;manipulating price&rdquo;.  It would mean that the Irish firm is beginning to feel the wind of competition.  I think that might be no harm.  It may be that the Parliamentary Secretary has evidence of something that could really be called &ldquo;manipulation&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>No, but if we have a foreign product and a home product there must be a measure of competition.  Perhaps it can be faced by Irish industry.</P>
      <P>I should like to have an explanation of the term &ldquo;manipulating prices.&rdquo;  It is possible the Parliamentary Secretary can tell us that they are being &ldquo;dumped,&rdquo; that they are subsidising the price.  I wonder can he tell us are these foreign firms selling these cans cheaper in Ireland than in their own country?  Unless he can say that, I must reject this term &ldquo;manipulating prices,&rdquo; as not being an accurate description of the Irish firm feeling a certain amount of outside competition.</P>
      <P>For these reasons I would move this second recommendation, in the hope that the Minister will accept it, delete this particular Order, and decide that it is not necessary to raise the tariff on these milk cans from 15 per cent. to 37½ per cent.  It is quite a jump, and I believe that the farmers will not like it.  I believe they may even say so, forcibly, to some representatives more closely in touch with them than I am.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My third recommendation is that the <Col N="558" /> increase in the duty on margarine should be deleted.  The Minister dealt with this in the Dáil, and the Parliamentary Secretary said much the same thing to us here to-day.  I should like to quote what the Minister said&mdash;column 359 of Volume 153, No. 3.  He says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;When this duty was originally imposed it was equivalent to an <i>ad valorem</i> rate of 50 per cent. and under this protection the industry developed to the point where the full requirements of the market were being supplied by the Irish manufacturers.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He goes on to say that since money values have altered, 3d. a lb. duty, which was the earlier customs duty, was no longer equivalent to 50 per cent. and says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;To keep the industry adequately protected it was decided to convert the specific duty into an <i>ad valorem</i> duty at the rate of 50 per cent. (full).&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He goes on to say that in order to keep the industry &ldquo;adequately protected&rdquo; it was decided to convert the specific duty into an <i>ad valorem</i> duty at the rate of 50 per cent. full.  My amendment is not moved for the purpose of suggesting that there should be no duty, but for the purpose of suggesting that 50 per cent. is too high.  It is not within my power to propose that the 50 per cent. should be 40 per cent.: I must either move the deletion, or drop my recommendation.  It is possible for the Minister, however, to make a fresh Order to-morrow which will not put on such a heavy duty.</P>
    <P>The Minister has asked for the duty to be brought into line as a percentage with what it was away back in 1927. I should like to relate that to something said earlier about the general principle of these protective barriers. Can we say that to be &ldquo;adequately protected&rdquo;&mdash;in his phrase&mdash;the Irish margarine industry requires as high a percentage tariff barrier as it required in 1927?  There may be factors to explain that it does, but if there are, we should be told of them.  I feel that we might be told that this industry is so well run&mdash;as I believe it is&mdash;that it <Col N="559" /> could afford to compete favourably with imported products on a slightly smaller percentage tariff rate than was necessary in its initial years, as is indicated by the 50 per cent. duty in 1927.  Consequently, I am proposing the deletion of this Order&mdash;not to suggest that there should not be any increase in the tariff from the 3d. per lb., but to suggest that to bring things back to the way they were in 1927, for an industry that has grown in efficiency I hope, is to give them a little bit too much protection, which might be bad for them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JaneDowdall" hpid="Mrs. Dowdall Mrs. Dowdall">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Dowdall</NameTxt>
      <P>As a person interested in manufacture, I would wish&mdash;as I am sure other manufacturers would wish&mdash;to have the same safety and protection that the Senator who has just spoken has mentioned.  He speaks a great deal about manufacture and says that manufacturers who needed a tariff in 1927 should not need anything like that degree of tariff at this stage.  I would remind him that food manufacturers in this country are competing against world combines that threaten their individual existence.  I would draw attention to one thing, that you always have the vagaries of human behaviour with regard to advertising. These world combines have the world Press&mdash;of which we get a share here&mdash; plugging their products all the time very attractively.  It has not been argued anywhere that the Irish goods are not as good as the foreign combine ones, but I repeat that the attractiveness of international advertising&mdash; which comes in in every magazine and every paper, costing vast amounts of money that no Irish manufacturer could hope to compete with&mdash;is the sort of competition that the Irish manufacturer, however efficient, is up against.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another speaker said that you need variety of goods to keep the market pepped up to attract the customer. There is no need for that pepping up in the matter of food: we all have to eat every week.  The one thing that is important in the manufacture of food is that it be consistently good.  We do not want variety, if the article produced is consistently good, if the customer has not been diverted by these <Col N="560" /> very attractive magazine advertisements. I am afraid most of our life nowadays is conducted on a sort of woman's journal approach to life, how it would be easier if we did this or that; and we get all our information about food, what to buy and how to cook it from these magazines.  That is one of the things Irish manufacturers of food products are up against.</P>
    <P>There is a fear in the mind of Senator Sheehy Skeffington that this protection may raise the price of the goods, but I think we can allay his fears. When these foreign goods were coming in they were never as cheap, on the same price level, as the Irish goods. The only reason for foreign goods getting in here at all is, I repeat, this advertising with which we cannot compete, no matter how efficient we may be and no matter how much money we have, since any quantity of money we have is just as petty cash to what these people could spend.  Therefore, in some instances I think these amendments are without thought and without much common sense.</P>
    <P>Senator Cogan has said that Senator Sheehy Skeffington speaks so academically. I do not profess to know business inside out, but I would repeat that it would be very happy and pleasant for manufacturers if they could be so sure of their everyday living as Senator Sheehy Skeffington must feel.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LouisWalsh" hpid="Mr. L. Walsh Mr. L. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>As one who lives in the village in which practically all the production of knitted gloves is done, I am fairly familiar with the conditions in that industry.  Formerly, there were quantitative restrictions which prevented the dumping here of cheap gloves produced under slave labour conditions in the Far East.  Some months ago these quantitative restrictions were removed and consequently the Irish market was wide open to the dumping of this particular commodity. Accordingly, it was necessary for the trade interests to have long discussions with the Department of Industry and Commerce in order to protect that Irish market.  For that reason the Department agreed to the imposition of the duties set out in the Schedule hereto.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="561" /> While the duty on children's gloves according to value may be somewhat higher than it is in the case of women's and men's gloves, the actual duty is less as far as the quantity is concerned. The industry concerned would not have requested that particular duty if they felt they could compete by a lesser duty than the 30/-, which is 100 per cent. duty in that particular case.  As the Parliamentary Secretary has mentioned already, the duty on United Kingdom and Canadian gloves is still only 25 per cent.  Consequently, gloves can be imported&mdash;children's, men's, and women's&mdash;at that particular rate. For that reason, I would ask the House to accept the imposition as set out in the Schedule.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardMcGuire" hpid="Mr. McGuire Mr. McGuire">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGuire</NameTxt>
      <P>I just wish to say a few words on these three recommendations. The House ought to welcome the fact that Senator Sheehy Skeffington put them on the Order Paper for to-day. On other occasions we have left Imposition of Orders Bills go through the House automatically or with very little discussion.  Unfortunately, there seems to be an idea that to discuss tariffs and their imposition in any way is to attack Irish industry.  That is not the case at all.  It is surely desirable that in any Chamber such as this the tariff policy which is designed to foster Irish industry and to give good service to the public and which, therefore, should be for the general good should be discussed in the way we have discussed it to-day.  We owe a debt to Senator Skeffington for putting down these recommendations.  The discussion has cleared the air about many things in favour of the Irish manufacturer. When Orders were made and merely passed automatically people thought that the Irish manufacturer was getting away with murder, but when we see something that may seem unreasonable in an Order of that kind and are able to discuss it as we have done to-day, and hear an explanation from the Minister as to why these particular tariffs are imposed, we see that they are reasonable and good.  I would like in connection with these three recommendations that the Minister should look into them and if, as in the case of the gloves, there seems <Col N="562" /> to be some little case the matter should be left to the courts.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Second Stage I asked the Parliamentary Secretary if he could give an assurance that the effect of these increases in tariff on milk cans would not be to increase the price of cans.  The Parliamentary Secretary has given that assurance and I accept it.  There are circumstances in which it is necessary to impose a fairly substantial tariff in order to protect the Irish manufactured commodity even though it is not the intention of the Irish manufacturer to raise the price to the extent of the tariff.  Such tariffs are necessary to prevent what I described as an actual or disguised dumping of imported goods.  It is very easy to understand that a very large firm manufacturing a certain product and with a world-wide market could for a short time reduce the price of that product on our limited market with the sole intention of eliminating Irish competition, and having done so proceed at once to increase the price and recoup itself for any loss suffered through this process. It is in circumstances such as this that it is sometimes necessary to impose a fairly substantial tariff.  I am satisfied that the Minister has consulted with his Department and the Parliamentary Secretary has full authority for the assurance he has given that there will be no substantial increase in the prices of these cans here.</P>
      <P>I have no intention of entering into a discussion with Senator Sheehy Skeffington with regard to the relative merits of different types of cans.  As far as Irish firms are concerned they are not interested in the manufacture of middle cans or inferior cans.  They are only interested in the manufacture of good milk cans.  If Senator Sheehy Skeffington wants to know what a good can is, it is one which will hold the milk and keep out the rain and stand up to a fair amount of rough treatment, because milk cans do undoubtedly receive rough treatment.  I am not going to encourage Senator Sheehy Skeffington to dance the cancan about milk cans to-day.</P>

      <P>There is just one point <Col N="563" /> I would like to discuss.  Mention was made of margarine, and I must agree thoroughly with what Senator Mrs. Dowdall said in regard to the influences on the consumer of the advertising by those outside combines.  I will not follow her, however, into the rather personal remarks which I think should not be made in this House. There is one point in which I am interested in regard to the duties on margarine.  I read in some British paper recently that under the Board of Trade Regulations in Britain the manufacturers of margarine are obliged to add certain vitamins to their products, and by the addition of those vitamins the nourishment value of the products would be somewhat equal to butter.  We have not yet reached the stage in this country where some parents do not have to use margarine, and I would like to know whether the product produced here is up to the same level in regard to vitamin content as the products which are being rightly discriminated against by this Order.  That is the only point I would like to make, and perhaps if the Parliamentary Secretary has not got the information Senator Mrs. Dowdall would like to help me in this matter?</P>

      <P>With reference to the recommendation proposed by Senator Sheehy Skeffington I would like to point out that the Federation of Irish Manufacturers have through their group passed a resolution and had it accepted by the Minister that the duty should be fixed by them.</P>
      <P>We have had gloves mentioned here by Senator Walsh, and leather gloves have been mentioned, made by Irish manufacturers, which are reasonable in price.  But there are gloves which are offered to Irish manufacturers by Hong Kong and China at such unreasonable terms that you could not afford to pay the girls a sufficient wage to earn the price.</P>
      <P>You must forgive me, Leas-Chathaoirleach, because my speech is affected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Somebody mentioned milk cans here. I will vouch for this personally that the <Col N="564" /> milk cans made by the Irish manufacturers not alone compete in price on the home market, but the manufacturers are exporting every one they can produce at the moment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crotty</NameTxt>
      <P>The first recommendation is concerning knitted gloves. Senator Sheehy Skeffington asked if that could be brought down a little. The percentage is not significant as the intention was to keep out all those goods and no one is called upon to pay the duty.  The difficulty arose from the difficulty in reconciling prices over a wide range.  Really, we are not allowing these gloves in at all, under any circumstances.  There is only a 25 per cent. duty on United Kingdom and Canadian gloves.  This industry is situated in County Donegal and 100 full-time factory workers are engaged there.  In addition, 1,500 home workers are engaged in seasonal employment in the same industry.  I understand&mdash;and this should give great satisfaction to the Seanad&mdash;there is a very substantial export trade from Donegal in these gloves.  Surely that is proof that the industry is able to stand on its own feet?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crotty</NameTxt>
      <P>There is the difficulty of calculation, and so forth.  However, I <Col N="565" /> do not think any would come in at all at these prices.  I have already given a fairly good explanation about milk cans.  Evidence was furnished to the Department that these firms were selling milk cans on the Irish market at the same price as they were selling them on their home market while, at the same time, they were paying 10 per cent. or 15 per cent. duty on these cans.  That, in itself, shows there was a manipulation of prices.  The firms here are well able to meet the full market for milk cans.</P>
      <P>The margarine industry did not need any higher tariff whatever until continental firms sent margarine here at lower prices than they were getting on the home market, although they paid the tariff.  There can be no question but that that is dumping.  We had to protect margarine, as well as other things, against this unfair competition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OwenSkeffington" hpid="Dr. Sheehy Skeffington Dr. Sheehy Skeffington">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I have the right to reply.  I shall not keep the house long, but I should like to deal with some of the points made. Senator Mrs. Dowdall mentioned very strongly the question of advertising.  I think her point was sound, but I am not convinced that it warrants the imposition of so high a duty as 50 per cent.  She said I spoke &ldquo;academically&rdquo; and used the phrase of Senator Cogan. In my opinion, no Senator speaks more academically than Senator Cogan.  I listen to him with pleasure, just as if I were sitting at the feet of a professor&mdash;which, incidentally, I personally am not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had hoped that Senator Cogan, who likes to appear as the bluff practical man in touch with reality, might have given us a little whiff of reality in relation to milk cans and Irish products. I hoped he would give some facts, figures, costings, comparative prices, and so forth.  I hoped he would give us some information as to the real durability of the respective milk cans, as to whether there is variation, and so forth.  I am afraid Senator Cogan remained very lofty and produced no facts, figures or costings.  In fact, he gave us no information at all on the comparative merits of the imported and the home products.  I believe that such information would be <Col N="566" /> very interesting.  I believe that Senator Cogan has that information.  I am very sorry that he did not give it to us.</P>
    <P>I am sorry also that Senator Mrs. Dowdall did not give us facts, figures and costings, because this is the place to mention them.  I should like to hear just what measure of protection is required.  The Parliamentary Secretary says, and Mrs. Dowdall says, and many other people say: &ldquo;We need 50 per cent. because our costs are high and because people are dumping.&rdquo;  I should like to hear a little more of the facts and figures behind that statement. It is very easy to say: &ldquo;Give us 50 per cent.&rdquo;  It is just as easy to say: &ldquo;Give us 75 per cent.&rdquo;  I should like to hear such an appeal backed with information on costings, prices, competition, and so forth.</P>
    <P>Senator Murphy asked a very valuable question.  It was on the same point of comparative value and comparative quality.  The Parliamentary Secretary did not answer that question on the vitamin content of the Irish product as compared with the other.  That is a question which I think could be answered entirely in favour of the Irish product.  I speak open to correction, but I think you can say that modern Irish margarine contains the same added vitamins A and D as any imported product.  I think that that should be said, and that there should be a feeling among those who speak on behalf of the manufacturers that they ought to justify their points of view, and not simply lay down the law.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Donnell&mdash;whom I am very glad to see back here again&mdash;made the point that the Federation of Irish Manufacturers wanted this tariff on gloves.  With all respect to him, I am afraid he did not meet the point as to why there should be a different rate of tariff on children's gloves from that on adults' gloves.  I would regard as irrelevant what he and others said about sweated labour in Hong Kong and Japan, unless you can prove that the labour is even more sweated when making children's gloves rather than when making adults' gloves.  I do not think that has been proved.</P>
    <P>I am not satisfied that it is not easy <Col N="567" /> to calculate for &ldquo;prices over a wide range&rdquo;, once you have a percentage. The Parliamentary Secretary told us moving stories of Hong Kong, but he did not tell us, when challenged, why children's gloves should have a more punitive rate than adults' gloves. Senator McHugh pressed that point&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The reply he was given was that no doubt the Minister acted on good advice.  As a Senator, I feel we are entitled to a more detailed reply than that.  I am sure all Ministers always act on good advice.  Could we just not hear what that good advice was, and why it was impossible to put the same rate of duty on children's gloves as on adults' gloves?  One Senator interjected and remarked that perhaps more children's gloves were bought.  Is that seriously an answer?  Are we trying to prevent a particular type of imported glove from being bought widely simply because it is for children?  I would not accept that.</P>
      <P>In dealing with the important question of what exactly was meant by monopoly prices, the Parliamentary Secretary said that, in relation to these milk cans, some firms were selling them on the Irish market&mdash;having paid the 10 per cent.&mdash;at the same price as the Irish product.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJCrotty" hpid="Mr. Crotty Mr. Crotty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crotty</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to correct that statement by the Senator.  I said they were selling them&mdash;having paid the 10 per cent. duty&mdash;at the same price as they were selling them on the home market in England and other places.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OwenSkeffington" hpid="Dr. Sheehy Skeffington Dr. Sheehy Skeffington">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>I see the point.  They were selling them on the Irish market at the same price as was paid on the English market, although here they had to pay a 10 per cent. duty.  That meant they had a smaller profit here, and had made a price concession in order to remain in the Irish market.  That figure of 10 per cent. is revealing because it shows that these cans came from Britain.  That 10 per <Col N="568" /> cent. has now been raised to 25 per cent.</P>
      <P>It is a very steep duty.  An <i>ad valorem</i> duty of 25 per cent. is added to the imported British milk cans, and the non-British, the other foreign cans go up to 37½ per cent.  This statement refers to the British.  I am not satisfied that the farmers will be pleased to find that the competitive article has been more or less removed from the market.  It is quite possible that some of those who are in close touch with the farmers will explain that they will be delighted, and, if necessary, pay the extra 25 per cent. if they want to get an English milk can but I am not satisfied that they will.  Consequently, it seems to me; again, that (a) there is no justification for a different rate for children's gloves; (b) it is a most dangerous thing to put up so steeply the import tax on milk cans and (c) 50 per cent. has not been shown to be a necessary tariff for imported margarine.  I believe it could be demonstrated that the industry would flourish on a smaller percentage tariff than 50 per cent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJCrotty" hpid="Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Crotty) Patrick J. Crotty">
      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Crotty)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that this Bill be read a Second Time.  The purpose of the Bill is to embody in permanent legislation certain matters relating to transport which were provided for by Orders made under the Supplies and Services (Temporary Provisions) Act, 1946.  The measure is introduced in pursuance of the policy of providing in permanent legislation where necessary for matters which have been dealt with under the Supplies and Services Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first question dealt with by the Bill is the carriage of milk to creameries and cream separating stations and the carriage of empty containers and separated milk back to the milk producers.  The collection of milk for delivery to creameries and the return of empty containers to the farmers present special difficulties and the public transport concerns have not found that the work is an economic proposition for them.  The bulk of the milk has to be collected in small quantities, often from farms in isolated areas <Col N="570" /> served by bad roads.  Generally, collection areas are far removed from central transport depots and the collection of milk and return of the empty cans by the public transport companies would require the traversing of very extensive areas with unladen or partially laden vehicles.  Milk collection furnishes only spasmodic part-time employment for vehicles and is not of a nature suitable for integration with other local public transport particularly as collection may have to be arranged outside normal working hours.</P>
    <P>Up to recent years the horse and cart was principally used by farmers or others for the transport of their own and their neighbours' milk to the creameries and no difficulty arose under the Road Transport Acts.  With the growing use of tractors and trailers and the reduction in the number of horses it became necessary to exempt this work from the provisions of the Road Transport Acts.  An Order to this effect has been made annually since 1949 under the Supplies and Services (Temporary Provisions) Act, 1946.  It is proposed to continue this exemption and to embody it in permanent legislation.</P>
    <P>The carriage of wheat by licensed agents for licensed mills presents a special problem.  Prior to 1942 wheat was purchased on their own account by licensed wheat dealers who transported it in their own lorries and then sold it to the millers.  The dealers did not require licences under the Road Transport Acts for the transport of the wheat as it was their own property. New arrangements for the purchase of wheat were introduced in 1942 and under these arrangements the wheat dealers purchased the wheat in the capacity of agents for the millers.  The wheat did not become their property and the transport of the wheat by them constituted carriage for reward.  Since 1942 an Emergency Powers Order was made annually to allow the wheat dealers to continue to carry the wheat in their own lorries without a licence under the Road Transport Acts.  It is proposed to provide power to exempt the carriage of wheat by licensed agents in the same way as has been <Col N="571" /> done over a number of years by Emergency Powers Order.</P>
    <P>When the Road Transport Acts were enacted in the early thirties the need for a safety valve in the legislation was not foreseen.  Experience during the war and succeeding years has shown that circumstances may arise when it would be necessary in the public interest to relax the control of carriage for reward embodied in the Road Transport Acts so as to avoid a serious crisis in the supply or transport of some important commodity.  At present the only means of doing so would be by an Order made under the Supplies and Services (Temporary Provisions) Act, 1946.  Provision is accordingly made in this Bill to enable the Government to make an Order exempting for a specified period the carriage of any particular commodity should this appear to them to be necessary in the interests of public safety or the preservation of the State or for maintaining supplies and services essential to the life of the community.</P>
    <P>The final provision of the Bill relates to some branch line train services which have been discontinued.  Under the authority of an Emergency Powers Order made in December, 1944, C.I.E. reduced or discontinued services on 20 branch lines.  Section 55 of the Transport Act, 1950, provides that the services temporarily reduced or discontinued under this Emergency Powers Order shall not be permanently discontinued save in accordance with an Order made by the Transport Tribunal.</P>
    <P>The legal position is, therefore, that unless an Order has been made by the Transport Tribunal authorising the permanent discontinuance or reduction of a service, the relaxation of the obligation to provide transport services which existed prior to the 1944 Emergency Powers Order is dependent on the provision in the Supplies and Services Act.  Applications in respect of ten of the 20 branch lines concerned have already been dealt with by the tribunal.  C.I.E. have now decided, however, to defer any further applications to the tribunal for the time being. <Col N="572" /> They propose to carry out experiments in the working of branch lines with light-weight diesel trains aimed at the more economic operation of branch line services.  Their future policy regarding the operation of branch lines will be determined in the light of the outcome of these experiments which will take some years to complete.  In the meantime it is proposed by means of this Bill that C.I.E. should not be obliged to restore services reduced or discontinued under the authority of the Emergency Powers Order on branch lines in respect of which applications have not been dealt with by the tribunal.  The obligation would revive three years after the coming into operation of the Bill except in the case of any line in respect of which C.I.E. had in the meantime made application to the Transport Tribunal.  The obligation of C.I.E. would then be determined by the findings of the tribunal. There is also provision to allow by special Order an additional period not exceeding two years in case the period of three years should prove too short.</P>
    <P>In recommending this Bill to the House I have every confidence that no Senator will object to the continuance of provisions which although originally embodied in emergency regulations are still of value to the public.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonKissane" hpid="Mr. Kissane Mr. Kissane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kissane</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure the Parliamentary Secretary that there is no objection from this side of the House to the continuance of these powers. These powers, as the Parliamentary Secretary has informed the Seanad, have been adopted under the Supplies and Services Temporary Acts passed by the Oireachtas annually, but one thing strikes one's mind and that is that it is a pity the comprehensive supplies and services measure that we had been promised throughout the years has not yet seen the light of day. The measure before us deals with two problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the first place, it deals with the haulage and transport of milk to and from creameries and also with the transport of wheat.  It is only right that a certain amount of flexibility in the transport of these commodities would be given to the farmers, but I would like to see all these things embodied <Col N="573" /> in a comprehensive measure of the nature of which we have been promised.</P>
    <P>The other problem that arises here is the problem of branch railway lines. This is a much debated problem at the present time and one which gives rise to great anxiety on the part of people who live in certain remote parts of the country.  Branch lines are being closed down and proposals are being made to close down branch lines.  I do not know to what extent that policy will be pursued because it appears to me that if that policy is pursued to its logical conclusion all the railway lines in the country would be closed down since the railway system of this country is not a paying proposition.</P>
    <P>In that regard there is one point I should like to bring before the Seanad. I wonder has the Minister, the Parliamentary Secretary and the Department of Industry and Commerce considered the possibility of using turf as a fuel on some of those remote branch lines?  That suggestion may sound fantastic to the members of this House but I should like to remind them that there was once in existence a certain branch railway line in my native county which was run on native fuel, turf, and it lasted for a number of years.</P>
    <P>I would refer to the railway known as the Lartigue Railway which was a monorail system.  Unfortunately, some years ago that was discontinued but at the same time I would point out that while that railway was in existence it gave satisfaction and people travelled by it and goods were transported over it.  Its length was about ten miles but if it was possible to run a train along that line at that time on native fuel, turf, could it not be possible to have some such system now? Of course, I do not advocate a system on the lines of the Lartigue but an ordinary narrow gauge system.  That is the point I would like to put before the Parliamentary Secretary and his Department.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DominickMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>There are three provisions really in this Bill and I should like to touch on two of them.  The first is the legislation that is now before <Col N="574" /> us putting in permanent form Orders which were formerly made under the Supplies and Services Act. These are related to the Road Transport Act of 1933 which was, I think, the first attempt by the Oireachtas to legislate and control road transport in this country.  The main provision of that Act, as the Seanad will know was, first of all, to license the existing road operators and also to empower the railway companies, the statutory undertakings at the time, to acquire these licences.</P>
      <P>The effect of the latter was rather unfortunate and costly eventually for the community because the private operators who were bought out were compensated not only for the physical assets, the lorries, etc., but also for the goodwill of the business.  It was found that more often than not the people who were bought out reopened the following week with new and better lorries but this time under the guise of general traders carrying the traffic which they formerly carried as freight operators.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>That was a rather costly error for the community because the transport concerns lost on that. They had eventually to be taken over by the Government when they had become semi-bankrupt and the community as such had to pay for the errors made in 1933.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DominickMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Seanad adjourned I was pointing to the fact that this Bill was in one section proposing to amend a section of the 1933 Road Transport Act and pointing to certain shortcomings in that particular Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another shortcoming which has become apparent in recent months as the result of a Supreme Court decision was to the effect that whatever the intention of the Oireachtas in passing the 1933 Act a lorry owner can now carry goods not his own for somebody else and plead that he was actually <Col N="575" /> hiring out his lorry and his driver to the owner of the goods.  That certainly of course, was not the intention of the Act.  It is a fault which has now been discovered in the wording of the 1933 Act.  The only thing I can see in favour of this particular fault is that it will provide at least a variation in the two threadbare excuses which are now made before the court in prosecutions under this particular Act.  One of these excuses usually is that the goods in question were not in fact being carried for reward but as an obligement to a neighbour, and the second is that in fact the goods were the property of the lorry owner between the points of collection and delivery.  I am suggesting very seriously to the Parliamentary Secretary that this is a weakness in the Act which needs to be remedied very quickly.  If it is not done, the position of the public transport undertakings and the position of the branch lines will become even more perilous than they are at the present time.  Surprisingly as it may seem, there is, I think, some connection between the Road Transport Act of 1933, which is being amended here, and the branch lines of the public transport undertaking.</P>
    <P>I would like to compliment the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary on their success in having C.I.E. make a second try at running the branch lines affected by this particular amending Bill.  The Parliamentary Secretary in the course of his speech made a reference to 20 branch lines of C.I.E., ten of which had already been closed and ten of which would have been closed except for this agreement to conduct an experiment with modern traction.  I would like if the Parliamentary Secretary would detail to us the branch lines, the ten remaining branch lines, which it is now proposed to hold over for the purpose of this experiment.  I think that the decision to run these branch lines with diesel traction is to be welcomed very much.</P>
    <P>In regard to Senator Kissane's suggestion that turf could be used as a fuel, I am sure he will be glad to know that at the present time the major <Col N="576" /> transport undertaking here, C.I.E., is in fact carrying out experiments with a view to substituting turf for imported coal in a certain number of locomotives. I do not know whether that experiment will prove a success.  I do hope it will.  I read recently in a transport journal of a somewhat similar experiment being made in the United States where soft coal, not very much different from our own turf, is being used on much the same principle as jet engines, I suppose.  It is not being burnt to heat water to produce steam; it is being milled in the first instance and then fed in and the hot air is being used to provide the motive power.  I am not too well up in the technical ways of doing it but it does seem that here is an experiment in the United States which might be followed, if it is successful, here.  The journal certainly thought it was an outstanding success both in regard to the power provided and the cost of the fuel.</P>
    <P>I want to suggest very seriously to the Senator that the decision to provide modern diesel light locomotives for these branch lines will not in itself be sufficient to save the remaining branch lines in this country.  Something else is needed and this something else has been pointed out on numerous occasions.  It is that they require more traffic, diversion of more of the heavy traffic from the roads in the Republic to the remaining railway lines.  This has been drawn to the Minister's and our own attention on quite a few occasions.  For example, the second annual report of C.I.E. for the year ending 31st March, 1952, refers in paragraphs 108, 109 and 110 to illegal haulage.  It pointed out that the Board of C.I.E., which was appointed by the Minister, was satisfied that illegal haulage of merchandise and live stock by privately owned vehicles was widespread in the country and that that practice was developing and constituted a grave threat to public transport.  It also drew attention to the fact that the number of prosecutions was small in relation to the number of offences and the penalties, when the court convicted, were relatively light.</P>
    <P>The board in that report suggested <Col N="577" /> that serious consideration should be given to the steps which might be taken to discourage these unlawful practices before they became a real menace to the public transport industry.  We know that certain proposals were made by the public transport undertaking appointed by the Minister in regard to the possible diversion of heavy road traffic to the railways.  In the most recent report of C.I.E., that for the year ending 31st March, 1954&mdash;they are not very quick, as you will notice, with their reports&mdash; the concluding paragraph says very firmly: &ldquo;The board is still firmly of the opinion that whatever steps may be necessary should be taken to transfer to the board's rail services the heavy long distance loads at present being carried by road.&rdquo;  This is not alone the opinion of the committee of management but the Department has in this regard the recommendation and findings of the committee of trade unions with employees in C.I.E.  That committee in its report to the Minister made certain recommendations.  There was also, I think, an addendum to that particular report, but the most recent and, I suggest, rather alarming incidence of this disquiet in public transport from the effect of illegal haulage is in the recently published report of the G.N.R. Board, which is even slower than C.I.E. to publish its accounts.  That report is for the year ended 31st September, 1954.  The board of that undertaking points to illegal haulage and the difficulty of dealing with it.  It refers to the loss of traffic, the cream of the traffic being taken away, and it said: &ldquo;There is little prospect of any substantial improvement in the situation unless the law is amended so that the public transport undertakings are given adequate powers for dealing with it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I do suggest in all seriousness to the Seanad that the success in persuading or in directing C.I.E. to keep open some ten branch lines for this further experiment carries with it an obligation to see that this experiment should be a success.  The other thing necessary to make it a success is more traffic. If that is not done, the diverting of more and more road traffic to the railways, I am firmly of the opinion that <Col N="578" /> all this postponement means is simply a postponement for a couple of years of the inevitable fate of the branch lines, that they definitely will be closed.  Modern equipment, new diesel traction, alone cannot keep the branch lines open.  There must be also extra traffic.</P>
    <P>If the experiment fails, the community will have to meet the cost. Eventually the community will have to meet the cost of the losses on these experiments.  They will have to meet it by way of taxation as taxpayers or they will have to meet it as ordinary fare-paying passengers in higher fares which otherwise would not be necessary.  Therefore, I suggest the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary have a duty to amend this fault which has become apparent in the Road Transport Act and seriously to consider what steps can be taken to help these experiments towards keeping open the branch lines.  I hope that in his reply the Parliamentary Secretary will give us details of the branch lines on which it is proposed to carry out these experiments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Gorman</NameTxt>
      <P>I was very glad to hear from the Parliamentary Secretary the Government view of the experiment of reopening some of our branch lines by diesel trains.  There are one or two in my county to which I would like to see attention paid and about which a very strong protest was made when they were closed down.  There is one in particular, the Fermoy-Mitchelstown line which also serves the villages of Glanworth and Ballindangan. On numerous occasions on which I have been in Mitchelstown during election times and at other times, I realised what a huge fair means to a town.  I think the Mitchelstown fair must be one of the biggest in the County Cork.  Linked as it is &mdash;or was then&mdash;with Fermoy, the closing down of that branch line was a very retrograde step for all who worked for farmers or cattle dealers or who make a living attending fairs.  I would like to see the experiment tried out there.  I would like to hear from the Parliamentary Secretary that the Government has decided to give that line a trial.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="579" /> All of us who are living in towns realise that if the railways do not pay, they eventually must go.  That would be a very serious matter for the economic life of the country and for the people living in the towns and cities. It must be quite apparent to all of us that since the inception of the diesel trains&mdash;and I can only speak for C.I.E.&mdash;a vast number of people who frequently came to Dublin by car and by other means are again patronising the railways.  C.I.E. at one time incurred the displeasure of many people by not being a paying concern, but nowadays I am glad, as one with some slight monetary interest in it, to see this change-over to the railways.  We must realise that the railway is part and parcel of our very life.  It is one of the life strings of every section of the community and the prospect would be too horrible to contemplate if the railways were not the paying concern they are now&mdash;they are about to pay their way, I am informed&mdash;and if they had to close down with only the main lines kept open.</P>
    <P>I realise that in the world in which we live nowadays, with one out of every three or four people running a motor car, it is very hard for those who wish to make short journeys of 20 or 30 miles to refrain from using their cars.  Every one of us should set an example.  This applies particularly to members of both Houses of the Oireachtas, if I may say so, coming from our towns throughout the country.  Instead of motoring up to Dublin, we who are the legislators should come by train and set a headline ourselves.</P>
    <P>I want to pay my little tribute to the dieselisation of trains.  We are living in a world of speed but no one wants to travel much more quickly than I did this morning, coming from Cork to Dublin in three hours.  I believe there is a great future in dieselisation.  We are living in a world of speed and everyone wants to get from one place to another in the shortest possible time.  As Senator Murphy said a few moments ago, unless you have a jet plane it would be very hard to travel the 167 miles from <Col N="580" /> Cork to Dublin in less than that three hours.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kissane said earlier to-night that the railways are not a paying concern.  Unfortunately too many people have unhappy recollections of the G.S.R.  Some 30 or 40 years ago, many of those who went before us invested part of their life savings in the G.S.W.R., as it was then.  I remember as a young fellow enjoying a free ticket and thought I was owner of a railway myself on that account.  If the railways are to pay, the people must patronise them; if they do not, the railways must go.  I would like to pay a little tribute to the chairman and directors of C.I.E., that there is some hope now for the future, that they will not have to lean any longer on the already overburdened taxpayer.  One does not want to go into this too deeply, but we all to our bitter regret realise what the railways have cost over the past few years.</P>
    <P>I understand the dieselisation of trains on all lines would mean a fourth or a fifth of the cost of running by coal, so I visualise the day when every line in the country will be run by diesel oil instead of steam coal.  I sincerely hope that the proposals mentioned this afternoon will prove a success.  That is up to the people themselves&mdash;if they want the railways to pay, they must use them. It is up to the people coming to Dublin &mdash;and it is up to members of the Oireachtas in particular, to use the trains and set a headline for the people to follow.  If we set the example, the people will follow it.  I repeat my appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary to consider, in experimenting with branch lines, the towns with big fairs and markets and to remember Mitchelstown, with one of the biggest fairs in County Cork, and the town of Fermoy.</P>
    <P>In my own home town of Youghal we have diesel trains in the summer months, bringing about 8,000 people every day.  I think the Government is on the right lines and I wish them every success.</P>
    <P>There is much more we could say but time is passing on and I have intervened briefly to follow on the lines <Col N="581" /> which Senator Murphy was able to put before the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a non-controversial Bill and naturally will, I presume, be accepted unanimously by the House.  There are only three sections that matter in the Bill.  In No. 2 there is provision for the exemption of vehicles carrying milk to creameries.  I am wondering whether that exemption should not also apply to vehicles carrying liquid milk to Dublin or any of our cities.  As I understand it many of the big wholesale companies in the milk trade have their own lorries which collect the milk, but in so far as hired lorries are required they are provided by C.I.E., who sublet the contract to private people, who actually collect the milk and do the work, but nevertheless, have to pay a certain rake-off to C.I.E. I do not think it is either necessary or desirable for those carrying on a business such as C.I.E. to undertake this work.  It is not suitable to them and they should leave it to private enterprise.</P>
      <P>There was a concession in the last Budget in regard to tractors conveying milk to the creameries.  It was rather a mistake that this concession did not apply also to tractors owned by the co-operative societies.  It was understood at first that it would be applied but it was afterwards ruled that the concession applied only to farmers using their tractors for the conveyance of milk.</P>
      <P>In Section 3 the Government take power to provide transport of goods in case of emergency.  I presume an emergency would be something which would hold up the public transport company, such as a strike or a lock-out, or perhaps something else of that nature.  It might be a disaster of some kind which would involve an obstruction of the line or means of transport. I am surprised that this section does not provide for the conveyance of passengers.  One would imagine that it would be equally important to provide for the movement of passengers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In so far as the Bill offers some hope of reprieve to branch lines that have <Col N="582" /> been more or less doomed, that particular section will be very much welcomed.  Everyone would have liked to see some effort made to reopen lines that have been closed.  I understand that this section does refer to lines which are not in operation at present, but have not been officially closed.  I am referring, in particular, to the line from Sallins to Tullow.  It is a very long and important line serving a number of towns, and while alternative transport has been provided on a fairly generous scale, at the same time it would be a pity to see such an important railway link scrapped.  On that line there is no rail service except when catering for fairs and an occasional special train.  The introduction of diesel services would be very much welcomed and I hope would be supported.</P>
    <P>I am entirely in disagreement with Senator Murphy when he suggests more restrictive measures on the community in general in regard to the means by which they should travel or have their goods conveyed.  We have nearly too much dictation on matters of this kind.  Our aim should be, as is implied in this Bill, that C.I.E. by progressive measures and by exploiting every opportunity provided by science and invention should endeavour to lure additional traffic to their lines rather than to coerce citizens into using the service.  Coercion is bad in any walk of life, particularly in business. If greater flexibility were provided in regard to the services on the railway, if more convenient methods were provided for the handling of goods and even live stock from road vehicles to rail vehicles, a good deal of long-distance traffic would be carried in that way.  The advantage of road services is that they extend from door to door, or from the farm upon which cattle are raised to the farm of the buyer.  If some convenient method were provided by which live stock could be transferred from road vehicles to a rail vehicle, and at the other end of the journey from the railway vehicle to a road vehicle, it would help to promote increased traffic.  The same should apply, of course, in regard to passenger services.  A greater effort should be <Col N="583" /> made to ensure that buses would operate as feeders for the railways rather than in competition with them.  I know that this has been suggested many times before and that there are difficulties in regard to the question. Nevertheless, as has happened in regard to the adoption of the diesel system, those ideas are worthy of being pursued further and considered in all aspects.  They should be adopted in preference to an attempt to dragoon the citizens into utilising C.I.E. services.</P>

      <P>I only just want to make an inquiry about the Kanturk-Newmarket line.  An inquiry was held down there about a year and a half ago, or two years ago.  Its findings appear to have been favourable to the opening of the line, but nothing has been heard about it lately and the people are anxious and are expecting an announcement.  They are ready to give the line, when it is open, their support.  Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary would tell us what the position is in regard to it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make one or two comments in support of the complimentary remarks that have been made about C.I.E.  I would like to ask them now to give every consideration to the lines which feed the main line, because it will not be of much advantage to the company unless the arms which supply it are made to act as feeders to the railway.  Doubtless those directing railway policy will see to that when the rolling stock becomes available, and ensure as much despatch as possible, because they have captured the imagination of the travelling public.  The thousands of new motorcars going on the roads every day are, in my opinion, playing into the hands of an enterprising railway line because, as every Deputy or Senator who has to travel a distance to Dublin knows, it is much more convenient to-day to come by train from Cork or some other provincial centre.  The traveller can leave his car in one of the provincial stations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The railway company are getting those facilities.  I think the important terminal stations and branch lines <Col N="584" /> ought to run quick trains to Dublin to give the facilities, and that they should widely publicise these facilities. I believe also that the railway company should consider closing redundant stations.  There is nothing so exasperating as having to stop at railway stations where a passenger never gets on or gets off.  It slows down the whole schedule.  There must be dozens of stations on branch lines in this country that could well be closed to the advantage of the service and to the economy of the whole system.  I know one or two stations and I doubt if I have ever seen a passenger either get on or get off at them.  It takes two minutes to stop and two minutes to get going again and about five minutes are lost by reason of the stop, to the great annoyance of the travelling public.</P>
    <P>Another matter that ought to be considered with regard to branch lines is the fact that there ought to be an arrangement whereby the guards would collect the tickets on the train.  I know that on main line trains you must have a checker and, on busy trains, two checkers and, if it is exceptionally busy, as in Britain and on the Continent, three checkers.  On a branch line, where there are only a small number of passengers on the train, you pull up at some station and the local station master holds up the train while he is checking tickets.  Surely that is not enlightened railway operations? Surely that system ought to be changed and made to conform with modern conditions?  There are always corridor carriages in these trains and it would not be difficult for the guard to check the tickets of the passengers over a few miles.  I often feel that, in that way, probably ten minutes could be cut off a distance of 25 or 30 miles &mdash;and that would apply in both directions. That would mean a considerable saving of time and give the railways the advantage which they are now beginning to gain over the private motor-car.</P>
    <P>The services offered by the railway company are becoming so apparent to everyone that I believe that, a few years hence, anyone who has occasion to travel further than 50 miles to Dublin will, certainly in the winter, always be inclined to use the railway.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="585" /> I am glad the enterprise of our own staffs here that caused them to plan this new system is meeting with such success.  I have travelled a lot by rail in most countries in Europe.  With the possible exception of France, I think no country in Europe gives as good and clean a service as C.I.E.  The French railway system is the pride of the world for speed and punctuality. Although our services are excellent, we have not reached anything like the booked speeds of French railways.  The speed from Dublin to Cork, non-stop, is about 56 m.p.h., while 70 m.p.h. is quite common on the best French lines. However, it is well that we have something in hand and that, even with the improvement of our roads, we shall be able to demonstrate that we can still beat the motor-car.  It is well to show that to business people and others.</P>
    <P>I suppose it is also a cause of national gratification to us that we are able to run a service of this type in such an efficient manner.  I would thank the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary for incorporating in the Bill those sections which provide that our agricultural and other produce which cannot be carried economically by our efficient railway service may be carried by other means.  It shows that no complete monopolistic tendency is developing in our Departments. It shows we are prepared to look at these matters in a realistic and business-like manner.  It shows we have every reason to be proud of our service.  We commend the efforts of those who have been responsible for giving us such a good service.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>I intend to be brief. I want to point out that, as far as I know, the first railway in this country to adopt diesel traction was the independent <Col N="586" /> railway company known as the Sligo/Leitrim and Northern Counties' Railway.  Despite the fact that that railway is in a very doubtful position at the moment, in my opinion they have a diesel train which is better than any diesel train C.I.E. have.  People may not agree with me on that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFirmullaghOReilly" hpid="Mr. O'Reilly Mr. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the many people who suggest that branch lines should be kept in operation.  I agree that if all our trains are dieselised it should go a long way towards making our branch lines economic.  I know the Minister is very sympathetic but, as we are talking about railways and the desire to keep branch lines in operation, I hope the Minister will do whatever he can, under very difficult circumstances, to keep the Sligo/ Leitrim and Northern Counties' Railway working.  I am craving the indulgence of the Chair when I say that. I am sure I will be forgiven by the Chair; it does come under the heading of branch lines.</P>
      <P>Unless our transport undertakings ensure that their services are good enough and complete enough and comprehensive enough&mdash;unless they ensure that they will give the service to attract business&mdash;then, no matter what traction they may have, they will not be successful.  If their service is better than any other in this country then they will get the business.  That should be the approach.  Human nature being what it is, no amount of legislation will divert sufficient traffic to C.I.E. unless it is, of itself, efficient. Methods will be employed to divert some of the traffic.  We know that such methods exist and that nothing can be done about the matter.  We cannot have a policeman to protect that aspect at every crossing.  A more realistic approach would be to ensure a better type of traction and complete and comprehensive services.  That is the only way in which the railways can be made to pay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I add my voice to the many others in expressing the hope that the branch <Col N="587" /> lines can be kept going.  I agree that we cannot have trains running like clockwork.  We all like to see trains but it is a fact that we who give voice to that sentiment do not use trains, even for passenger purposes, as much as we might.  We cannot afford to have clockwork trains running without passengers or goods.  I have always held&mdash; and when I said it here on another occasion it caused a certain amount of merriment&mdash;that passenger transport was the most economic type of transport for a transport undertaking by reason of the fact that it loaded and unloaded itself.  It is a fact that passenger transport should be the most economic because of the fact that the loads will unload themselves.  With the development of diesel trains in the country there is the hope that more people will use the trains for travelling. If we are to have such an increase in traffic as will enable the railway undertaking to pay its way we can only do that, in my opinion, by giving the service necessary.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I again repeat my wish that the branch lines be kept open.  We are at a cross-roads in our affairs and there may be a swing back towards railway transport.</P>

    <P>The section of the Bill dealing with branch railway lines is designed to give time to C.I.E. to experiment with light diesel railway units.

    <Speaker pid="PatrickCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That this House is of opinion that the policy of the Government should be actively and urgently directed towards securing the decentralisation of industry and administrative control generally throughout the country, and, towards securing as far as it is found practicable henceforth the diffusion of sites for new industries throughout the provinces.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The House will observe that the motion as it appears on the Order Paper proposes to do two specific things.  First, that we would urge that the policy of <Col N="590" /> the Government be directed towards securing the decentralisation of industry and administrative control as it exists at the moment, and, secondly, that the same policy should be directed towards securing the diffusion of sites for new industries in future throughout the provinces.</P>
    <P>Since I put down this motion, it occurred to me that it might perhaps be more easily dealt with, be more easily discussed, by reversing the order of those two points and if the House has no objection I would propose to deal with them in that reversed order.</P>
    <P>In moving the motion I would like to begin by making it perfectly clear, and, in fact, by emphasising that I am not attributing either blame or responsibility to the present Government or to any Government in the past for the fact that we have here in Ireland, in common with most other countries in Europe, if not throughout the rest of the world, for that matter, a very serious and ever enlarging problem, something that, to my mind, is nothing less than a social evil, a phenonemon that seems to challenge the best intentions and the best brains that we can bring to bear in, so to speak, planning our country's future development and its continuing prosperity.</P>
    <P>I am referring to the paradox that while all Parties represented in this House&mdash;and those like myself not represented by any Party at all&mdash;are genuinely concerned with the drift of so many of our young people from rural centres to the emigrant ship, to unskilled work in our towns and cities and even in towns and cities beyond our own, it seems extraordinary that at the same time we are presented here on the very steps of Leinster House with the spectacle of our capital city bursting at the seams.  It is almost like an octopus, grabbing apparently with ever increasing vigour more and more of the little amount of land that is now left for residential building within the last remnants of the green belt that should really surround our capital city. It is estimated&mdash;I think reliably&mdash;that already almost 600,000 people, over one-fifth of the entire population of the <Col N="591" /> unoccupied counties of our Republic, are now residing within a five-mile radius or at most within a ten-mile radius of O'Connell Bridge.  Probably 90 per cent. of all our manufacturing industries are all sited within the same area, according to the most accurate estimates I can get.  We seem to have been more deliberate than wise in the past in confining most of the static of Government Departments at executive or administrative level, as well as most if not all of our semi-State or Government controlled services, inside the confined limits of that same radius.</P>
    <P>What concerns me&mdash;and I hope concerns thinking men of all shades of opinion in this House and beyond it&mdash; is the fact that apparently we are quite content to sit back and watch this particular phenomenon assuming proportions year after year that become really frightening if you stop to consider them.  We do not seem to realise that the problem is crying out for some check or some attention before it grows entirely beyond our capacity to deal with it at all.  You will find everyone in complete agreement that something ought to be done.  My concern is that we are all content to talk about it and do nothing.  It has been emphasised here more than once recently that we are witnessing a continuing decline in our rural population, a decay of our rural areas and rural towns.  You can see that quite plainly&mdash; someone suggested to me that you can almost smell the evidence of it&mdash;in some of our towns and villages already. Here in our capital city&mdash;a city that could be as fair and as healthy to look upon as any capital in the world today&mdash;we witness more and more overpopulation. We are incapable of solving our housing problems, our sanitation problems, our traffic and other problems.</P>
    <P>I am only too well aware that other countries have similar problems to worry about, but elsewhere people seem more alive to the urgency and seriousness of the problem.  As an example I would like to quote a news item which appeared in a prominent English newspaper some weeks ago and which gives <Col N="592" /> a side light on how people think about this in England.  The report which appeared on Sunday, 9th October, is headed: &ldquo;Spend more to get industry dispersed&rdquo; and it reads:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Sir Howard Roberts, retiring clerk to London County Council, said at Rothesay yesterday that unless something was done to increase the Government's 50 per cent. grant towards the dispersal of industries in large cities there was grave danger that most of the money now spent on dispersal would be wasted.  It was not socially desirable, economically sound or good defence strategy to have a quarter of the popuation of England and Wales concentrated in Greater London.</P>
    <P>Ultimately, said Sir Howard, the only sure way of reducing the amount of employment in London was to acquire employers' premises&mdash; a very costly business.  The Minister for Housing and Local Government had urged the London County Council to pursue this policy.  The Council had recently allotted funds to acquire non-conforming industry, the amount at present being £250,000 per year.  I would not be surprised to see this amount increased, but, he concludes, whatever amount is voted it is likely to be inadequate in face of the vast problem&rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>The <i>Observer</i> of Sunday, 9th October.  I do not suggest that we should or could undertake measures as costly or as far-reaching as that.  Indeed, our English neighbours seem to doubt the usefulness or the efficacy even of their own remedy for dealing with it.  I do suggest, however, that even if we have to accept the facts as they are we ought at least to be thinking of and looking to the future.  I feel that there are certain steps that we could and should take to ensure that the problem as it is will be limited and controlled as far as it proves practicable for us to control it, at least from here on.  I hope that the House will be satisfied from what I have said that I am not quarrelling with the decisions of any Government <Col N="593" /> or any Minister in the past who when faced, as I know some of them were faced, with Hobson's choice as the only alternative to approving a decision to site industries in or near Dublin quite rightly took the decision to secure at any rate the industries that we needed so badly.  I am even prepared to say that some such decision may have to be made again either to-morrow or in the immediate future. I hope that such decisions have to be made, but I would like to feel satisfied that they would only be made if and when it could be shown that the only alternative available to us was to lose the benefit of some of the new industries we are still very much in need of.  I submit, however, that ways and means can and ought to be found to encourage and secure wherever possible the siting of new industries at any rate throughout the provinces.  I feel that in fact it must be made the policy of the present and any future Government to take upon itself deliberately and quite definitely the responsibility for securing and persuading, even to the extent of subsidisation by way of taxation relief or similar concessions where necessary, that industrialists contemplating development here inside the country go to the provinces.</P>
      <P>I believe the motion is timely and that it is opportune at the moment to suggest that this ought to be constant Government policy, in view of the present Government's drive towards attracting more and more new industries which we badly need to the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Turning to the second point that is posed in the motion, I would like to urge that the Government can, and should, very seriously consider the practicability of decentralising some of the Government Departments and offices which we know contribute very substantially to the problem of overcrowding in Dublin already, and that if they are not prepared to deal with this directly, at least the Government should direct that some of the semi-State bodies should be moved.  We have Bord na Móna and the E.S.B., and I suggest even certain departments or sections of C.I.E., many of which, I have not the slightest doubt, <Col N="594" /> could be just as efficiently run from any one of a number of provincial centres as they are from Dublin.  Certainly an early and very drastic reorientation of policy or of outlook&mdash; which would, perhaps, be the better word to use&mdash;and an overhaul of plans that we hear are either contemplated or in process of development for an even further expansion of this complex which, for want of a better word, I call Dublinitis, is essential.</P>
    <P>That type of reorientation of outlook and overhaul of policy ought to be undertaken immediately.  I am alluding, for instance, to the fact that we hear that the E.S.B., having already occupied the greater part of one side, at any rate, of one of our most important residential squares in the heart of the city, is now contemplating building a big block of central administrative offices either within the city or on its immediate outskirts.  I submit that quite a lot of useful decentralisation could be undertaken in projects of that kind.</P>
    <P>Again we hear and, in fact, have seen it stated that in order to cure the problem of overcrowding of the National University plans are even now in an advanced stage of preparation to the extent that at any rate a site has been purchased or earmarked for the erection of new university buildings on the outskirts of the city, at a cost which I have read somewhere, &mdash;I believe in one of the Dáil Debates&mdash;would run to something like £4,000,000 or £5,000,000.  The Estimate is already a couple of years old, and probably the cost will be a great deal more than that before those plans are, in fact, completed.  The point I want to make is that it is to my mind tantamount almost to a crime to contemplate the projection of such a huge plan on such a scale while the country is faced with such a problem as that to which this motion refers.  I believe, and I think that a lot of people will hold with me, that the expenditure of one half or one quarter of such a sum as I have alluded to in the case of the university, would be far better spent in the erection of a new constituent college at some place such as Waterford, Limerick or some other centre, or even in the extension of the existing <Col N="595" /> constituent colleges at Cork or Galway.  I believe that the money would be far better spent in proportion on a project of that kind than in adding still more fuel to the fire as far as this problem is concerned here in Dublin.  I would like to point out that not alone would we be keeping more students at home but we would, in fact, be providing them with education at a lower cost and, if I may put it this way, we would not be exposing one generation of students after the next to this very highly infectious and dangerous virus which I have already described as Dublinitis.</P>
    <P>To sum up, my point is that we all seem to agree that there is a serious problem there and that something ought to be done about it, but that we are doing nothing about it, and this House might seriously consider this motion and in adopting it direct the Government's attention specifically to the problem in the hope that we can see something practical done about it at this stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a problem, as suggested by the mover, of the concentration of population and industry in Dublin as against the rest of the Republic.  It seems to me that there are two aspects of this problem, one social and the other economic.  In regard to the social effect, in Dublin we witness every day the fact that distances between home and work are increasing; time is being lost in making for transport and more time is being lost while the buses jerk their way throught the traffic.  All this is, I suggest, very costly and wasteful from the social sense and we have the continuous drive of the population from the country into Dublin.  We cannot overlook, however, the advantages to industries of having their factories in Dublin.  I would list these as four: (1) the availability of a plentiful <Col N="596" /> supply of semi-skilled labour which is not similarly available to the same extent in some of the smaller towns; (2) it is a convenient port to Britain for the importation of raw materials and for any export trade there may be; (3) it is a convenient centre for distribution to the home market, and (4) Dublin itself is, of course, a concentrated home market.</P>
      <P>These are some of the advantages which I think encourage industries to set up in Dublin or convenient to it. The effect on the rest of the country is that we have a drift of population into Dublin and eventually to Britain.  As Senator Crowley has suggested, a lot of the towns are decaying and there is a need&mdash;which we all readily accept, I think&mdash;for more industries in the rest of the country.</P>
      <P>I think it would be somewhat impertinent of me to speak to this motion if I could not do anything but criticise the lack of action in the past and I want to suggest some courses which I think could help to reverse the present trend.  First of all, action has already been taken in the advantages made available for industry to set up business in the under-developed areas. You have all got the document published by the Industrial Development Authority and there are detailed the advantages and the encouragement to set up industry in those under-developed areas.  The advantages are, first of all, grants up to a maximum of the full cost of sites and premises and, secondly, up to half the cost for plant, machinery and the training of workers. Another inducement is referred to and that is the remission of local rates of two-thirds for the first seven years. That last, however, is not a selected inducement: it applies to all new factories whether they are sited in Dublin or elsewhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is need for the setting up of industries in those under-developed areas but I also think there is need in other counties not prescribed as under-developed areas: I refer particularly to the Border Counties of Monaghan and Cavan and, I might stress, Donegal, which is an under-developed area.  There is a very great need there for industry.  What can we do to encourage any industries that <Col N="597" /> may be set up to site their factories in those areas?  I have said what advantages are already offered.  I think we might usefully look at what has been done in Northern Ireland.  If there is something we can learn from what has happened there, we would be wise to take a note of it.  The help that is given there for new industries is somewhat similar to our own in regard to grants and loans but they do something which we do not at present do here.  The Government is empowered by legislation to provide industrial premises or sites and modern factory accommodation.  I know very well that, because of the fact that we have a strong Opposition here and that we are more of a political entity than Northern Ireland, this is probably not a very welcome alternative.  It certainly would not be as easily applied as it is in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>If the Government here were to take power not alone to give assistance, to give grants, but actually to build factories, to build premises, and make them available to industrialists who want to set up a business&mdash;it saves time, first of all, and it is an inducement to those industrialists: they can either be handed over factories or factories can be rented to them&mdash;I could imagine, if that were done and if, in fact, by the next general election such premises were not occupied you might have references to some of &ldquo;Norton's White Elephants&rdquo; and such like things. However, in spite of the political risks, I think the Government here should look at what is being done in that connection in Northern Ireland. They would be better able to judge the advantages than I.  All I can suggest is that is something which we do not do but which is done in Northern Ireland and is considered an inducement there to industrialists, something which is thought worth while.  I think it should be seriously considered here and it might help to induce industrialists to set up factories in the under-developed areas, in the towns outside Dublin City.</P>
    <P>There is something else, which is done in Northern Ireland, of which we have not an exact counterpart here. The local rating authorities may, if <Col N="598" /> they so wish, exempt new industrial premises, for up to ten years, of full rates due.  We here, as I said, exempt all round, whether in Dublin or anywhere else, two-thirds of the rates for the first seven years.  I think the local authorities outside Dublin should be empowered to give a somewhat similar remission of rates to industries which are set up in their areas.  It would be useless having the same concession in Dublin and the rest of the Republic. The need is to induce in some way industrialists to set up outside Dublin. They cannot be compelled to do so and nobody would really ask that they should be compelled.  The idea is to give the inducements to them to overcome these obvious economic preferences that are there for Dublin because of its convenience.</P>
    <P>I should like to go a little further in regard to this desire for setting up factories outside Dublin.  I think it would be unwise to try to get a factory set up in every town or village if that were possible.  I think it would be wiser if certain towns in these various areas were chosen for industrial development and that you would not have a situation whereby a town or village would have one industry, because that is dangerous politically and is certainly dangerous from the workers' point of view.  Where you have an industry in a town, you can readily appreciate that that town is probably totally dependent on that industry and the workers engaged there are totally dependent on it.  They have no real alternative employment.  Too often we have witnessed the political power that can be wielded in such circumstances.  Too often we have seen that such industries, because of the utter dependence of the town on their continued existence, can tell the Government what they need in regard to quotas or import duties.</P>
    <P>I would really prefer to see certain towns chosen for industrial development, and not one but three, four or six factories, if possible, established. Then you would have generally available skilled and semi-skilled labourers. Then no one factory could hold a gun to those towns.  Those towns and cities throughout the provinces chosen <Col N="599" /> for that industrial development would not alone benefit themselves with their inhabitants but would also benefit the surrounding agricultural area by providing a convenient and ready market for agricultural produce and suitable employment for the surplus agricultural population.</P>
    <P>I notice that people who are better qualified to deal with this subject than I have been busy writing notes.  I do not want to delay the House further except to make just one more point. I think that very little can be done by any Government to shift Government Departments or semi-State Departments out of Dublin.  However, I suggest that the problem should not be made any worse and that, where another Department or new offices are set up, they should not be centred in Dublin.</P>
    <P>I know it is convenient to have them all in Dublin.  But in these days of speedy and convenient transport and an efficient telephone system all round the country the disadvantages of siting Departments outside Dublin are more obvious than real.  I would suggest that while very little can be done to shift those already, there&mdash;they are notoriously hard to shift&mdash;new offices should not be opened in Dublin but opened elsewhere.</P>

    <P>I think I can assure the mover of this motion that he is knocking at an open door as far as we on this side of the House are concerned.  Also, it must be conceded that the previous Government were alive to the importance of this proposal and the desirability of decentralising industries.  The former Minister for Industry and Commerce brought in the Undeveloped Areas Bill for the purpose of encouraging intending industrialists to establish industries in more remote parts of the country. That measure found agreement happily among all members here and in the other House and the measure was put into operation.  Although the provisions of that Act of 1952 were generous and held out strong inducement to would-be industrialists, I fear the results we all desired were not achieved.  That is not to say that certain results were not achieved. Under that Act a statutory body was set up called An Foras Tionscal and funds amounting to £2,000,000 were put at its disposal.  The Act provided that grants for sites and premises up to a maximum of the full amount of the cost were to be available to those industrialists prepared to face the disadvantage of starting industries in the more remote parts of the country.  We all knew the great disadvantages to be surmounted and it was to offset them that this generous inducement was held out.  In addition, the Act provided for grants for plant and machinery and for technical training for the workers to make them useful in these factories, amounting to a maximum of 50 per cent. of the cost.  There was also, as has been mentioned, a certain remission of rates.  Senators will agree that these are fairly generous provisions.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="601" /> The question for us to resolve this evening is what further and better inducements we are to offer, that will offset the disadvantage of setting up industries in isolated areas far removed from the big centres of population. I am fully in agreement with the proposer and seconder of this motion, that it is most desirable to decentralise industry.  It is not enough to say that, it is not enough to give a pious send-off to this motion; it is also necessary for someone in a responsible position to point out the ways and means of achieving what we have in mind this evening.  For instance, will it be necessary to amend the 1952 Act? If we come to the conclusion that that is necessary, we must decide in what way and to what extent we shall do it. I would like to know if the Government, the Minister for Industry and Commerce or the Parliamentary Secretary have given thought to that&mdash; whether it is necessary to amend the Act to bring about the results we wish in regard to the decentralisation of industry.  The time has come when this question should be reviewed.  I have seen no evidence yet of any review of the position by the present Government.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether they have in contemplation an amending Bill to make more generous provision for the starting of these industries in the remoter parts of the country or for affording better inducements than have been offered under the measure to which I have referred.  That is a question for the Government to examine and there is no use in our discussing the matter here.  All we can do is to make certain suggestions.  We can talk about the desirability and the advisability of it.  We can also, of course, refer to the practical difficulties that are in the way; but it is up to the Minister and the Government to point out the way of doing it&mdash;whether they think it is necessary, as I have said, to introduce an amending Bill whose provisions will excel those of the Undeveloped Areas Act of 1952.</P>
    <P>The Senator who has just sat down referred to the Six Counties and what is being done there.  It is always the <Col N="602" /> case, of course, that distant fields are green in these matters, but I agree with the Senator that there is something we can learn about industrialisation from those people up there.  They have been very much alive, for instance, to the desirability of bringing in that business magnate, Mr. Ferguson, into the area and of having established there an industry for the manufacture of a people's car.  I do not know to what extent they have succeeded in inducing Mr. Ferguson to come in there, but I read a report in to-day's Press of a statement by a certain member up there that it was the opinion that the area was not big enough to support such an industry. The area down here is a much bigger one, and I would like to know if the Government here or anybody acting on its behalf has made any approach to Mr. Ferguson to see if there would be a possibility of having the industry established down here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kissane</NameTxt>
      <P>That is another question. As regards this decentralisation of industry, I submit that there is one great industry in this country that has been decentralised, and that is the turf industry.  I further submit that it can be even more decentralised if we pay more attention to the hand-won turf industry, which has been neglected, I am sorry to say.  I always notice that when anybody refers to the hand-won turf industry there is a certain amount of hostility to it, or if not hostility, scepticism.  That should not be the case.  I do not see why it should be the case.  It will be pointed out to us, of course, that because of the experience that people got during the emergency of a certain inferior kind of turf put on the market during those years that should prevent us from paying any more attention to the subject. I do not think we should take up that defeatist attitude in connection with this hand-won turf industry.  Remember that the price of coal in Britain is soaring from year to year, or I should nearly say from month to month, and there is nothing we can do here about <Col N="603" /> it except to try and supplant it as much as possible by our own turf.  I am not one of those who will say that we can depend upon turf entirely, but our aim and ambition should be to lessen our dependence on British coal to as great an extent as we possibly can.  I am certain that if the position were reversed, if it were Britain that was dealing with this problem and we were sending coal to Britain, the British would take steps to lessen their dependence on our supplies of fuel.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>We have, of course, other industries here which were established by the Fianna Fáil Government, and they are decentralised industries.  One is the cement industry, of which we have two branches&mdash;one in Drogheda and another in Limerick.  I would say, indeed, that if the establishment or even the extension of that cement industry were depending on the Coalition Government it would never be done.  We have also, of course, the beet industry, and have four beet factories in operation.  That is in itself a decentralisation of industry.  But, these things would not absolve us from our duty to try to establish more industries here and there throughout the country.  I do not know if the ambitious aim of the last Senator who spoke can be realised&mdash;that we can have an industry in every town and village.  But it would be a great thing if we had an industry or a couple of industries in the larger towns, and it would be a wonderful thing entirely if under some amending legislation, if they think it necessary, the present <Col N="604" /> Government would try to establish industries in the remote and undeveloped parts of the country.</P>
    <P>There was one industry established in a certain remote part of the country, namely, in Mayo, on which we had a debate a short time ago.  I am not going to worry the House with any further reference to it except to say that I think it was a mistake in policy on the part of the present Government to do away with that industry.  That surely was a genuine attempt&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I do not propose to say any more at the present time except to repeat one thing I have said already&mdash;that if the present Government think it necessary to introduce amending legislation making further and better provisions than are to be found in the Undeveloped Areas Act of 1952, they should do it and they would get the support of this side of the House in doing so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeOBrien" hpid="Professor O'Brien Professor O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish either to support or to oppose the present motion.  My reason for rising is to try to bring into perspective, I hope, some of the issues involved without throwing my own opinion on either side.  This motion, I think, is connected with the debate we had this afternoon when we discussed protection in a general way.  This evening we are debating another question which I might call local protection rather than national protection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Every country seems to go through these two stages in its protective movement. In the first stage, the politicians, the leaders of public opinion, want to get industries established somewhere inside the national frontiers not caring greatly where they are located. So long as they get them inside the national frontier they feel that they have added to the industrial potential of the country.  They regard every <Col N="605" /> area of the country as equally likely to benefit from the industry.  In that case, industry will always tend to settle down at the optimum point, that is, the new industries will tend to concentrate in or around the cities where the demand for goods is largest.  This usually creates a certain concentration of industry in the big cities and towns owing to the advantages of concentration which arise.</P>
    <P>The second stage in the protective history of a country always is that local politicians tend to like to see industries being established in their own constituencies, and a clamour arises for a local protection of industries in particular counties or cities.  That is the second stage&mdash;local rather than national protection.  I think I am correct in putting it this way&mdash;that whereas the arguments in favour of national protection are mainly economic&mdash;though I do not say that the arguments are always purely economic&mdash;the arguments in favour of the localisation of industry are mainly not strictly economic.  They are sometimes sentimental&mdash;such things as the desire to prevent the depopulation of a particular area, to prevent people from drifting into the cities, where they would be liable to the various temptations and allurements of the city, to keep people in the happy innocent frame of mind in which the rural population of this country continues to dwell.</P>
    <P>Another reason is to provide local employment, to have people settle in employment evenly over the country, in the belief that the drift to the cities and towns is only one degree less desirable than emigration itself.</P>
    <P>Another reason, and a perfectly good reason, of a non-economic character for the dispersal of industry is one we have had here&mdash;to try to keep employment up in the native speaking areas, to keep the Gaeltacht prosperous and in that way to keep the language alive.</P>
    <P>In other countries, more aware of the risks of war under modern conditions than we are, the defence argument is a very important one&mdash;the necessity of the dispersal of industry and of population in the event of war. <Col N="606" /> It is a formidable argument for the decentralisation of industries in England to-day.</P>
    <P>The point I want to make is that both types of protection&mdash;national protection and local protection&mdash;are really distortions of the natural pattern of localisation, in which industry would be directed into the area where it would naturally be directed because the cost of production in the area is below what it would be somewhere else.  The argument in favour of national protection is simply that, in certain cases, it is worth the country's while to outweigh the cheapness of the international market, but it involves a distortion of the structure of localisation.</P>
    <P>When you have an artificial localisation of pattern inside the country, such as is suggested in the motion, when you have a second type of localisation of that kind, you introduce a second distortion.  When you introduce that, you tend to raise the cost of production a second time.  Why should costs of production be raised a second time when the industries are spread out over the country instead of being allowed to settle down to the point of optimum advantage from the point of view of the businessman running these industries?  The advantages of localisation in a big city, in settling down in a concentrated area, have been mentioned already by Senator Murphy. I will refer shortly, just to remind the House, to what he said.</P>
    <P>The first great advantage is the large supply of labour of all sorts of degrees of skill and also educational establishments.  The first factor of production, labour, is obtained in large quantities in a big city&mdash;which is not available in a country town. Another obvious advantage is transport. Take Dublin as an example.  It is a big port and raw materials can be imported at the lowest possible price.  There is a very large market in which things can be sold and then again the question of transport costs is relevant.  In a big city, there is the presence of technical services and technical advice.  There is also the availability of repairs to machinery. Many things can be repaired quickly and cheaply in Dublin, let us say, in a <Col N="607" /> way they cannot be in a small country town.</P>
    <P>There are other advantages perhaps even more important than those&mdash;a good water supply, good drainage and sewerage, good supplies of power and light.  It is curious that this very evening, just within the past two hours, I was reading to-day's <i>Times.</i> I found there a perfect example of the importance of some of these physical factors in determining the localisation of industry and the way in which they can become limiting factors of distortion, the way in which an industry was held up by a shortage of water and sewerage facilities.  I quote now from to-day's <i>Times,</i> page 5:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;There are many areas where local planners still welcome newcomers; but concentration on the employment aspect may distract attention from other factors which, it is argued, are becoming more vital.  Water supply is one; strangely enough, even housing may be.  The rapid growth of industry in the Luton and Dunstable area has outrun the local housing, partly through difficulties over sewage disposal which hark back to water supplies. Labour is therefore brought in to the area daily from considerable distances, which seems like permanent poaching.</P>
    <P>Often major industrial development in the chemical, steel, and atomic energy fields, requires main water supply developments and effluent disposal.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is an example of how certain areas possess certain advantages over others and of how, if business people are left to settle down at the point of maximum advantage they will, generally speaking, settle down where all these advantages are to be found, namely, supply of labour, good transport, technical services, water power, drainage and other advantages which, of course, all tend to low costs of production. Senator Kissane gave examples of decentralisation such as turf production, which must be located on the bogs.  You might just as well say that agriculture is a decentralised <Col N="608" /> industry because production of agriculture has to take place in the country, spread over the land, and not in the town.</P>
    <P>Where, however, there are industries such as the ordinary typical industry that imports its raw materials and does not depend on local circumstances such as the turf industry, the advantages of settling down in the big cities are very great.  What is proposed in the motion is that something should be done to neutralise these advantages and prevent industry inside the country, where it has been attracted by protection, from settling down at the point of optimum advantage, at low production costs and, therefore, a lower price to the consumer&mdash;in other words, that the distortion involved in national protection should be followed up by a second distortion in the interests, real or imaginary, of some particular locality.</P>
    <P>The question we have to consider this evening is what price is worth paying for these advantages.  To my mind, some of them are nebulous but, at the same time, I do not say they are not real in certain cases.  The question really is what price should be paid.  Senator Kissane has mentioned the large inducements already existing under the 1952 Act in favour of undeveloped areas&mdash;taxation relief, rate relief, subsidies, grants for building and machinery&mdash;yet all these advantages do not seem enough to do the trick.  Now, in 1955, we have a debate here asking for more and saying that the inducements to move out of Dublin and big cities are not enough.</P>
    <P>The real trouble is that the price for this move may be partially or wholly concealed.  We can see what taxation costs and also subsidies and grants. Everybody knows what they cost but the price may be high prices of the commodity.  Of course, it is very difficult to say that the article is dearer than it would be if it were produced in another part of the country.  There is always room for certain disagreement there.  An even more difficult case to argue is the quality of the article.  That article, the physical commodity, may be produced quite satisfactorily in the small country factory but, by the time all these obstacles to efficiency are overcome, the quality <Col N="609" /> of the product may not be as high as it would otherwise be.  In a protected industry, it may be that the consuming public would have to pay more for the article.  Probably there is the cost of getting it to big centres of consumption such as Dublin, and, by the time the article has been consumed, the country may have been involved in a large number of costs, some tangible, others less measurable but no less real. High prices, bad quality and the disadvantage of being at the mercy of a monopolist who may be an even less efficient monopolist than he would be if he were in a big town, these are some of the considerations that seem to me to arise in this debate.</P>
    <P>I am not speaking for or against the motion.  I am putting some of the considerations which I think are relevant before a decision can be taken. All I ask is that, before a decision of this kind is taken, people should be quite clear that every gain involves a certain cost and that the Minister, the Government, the Legislature and the community should all be satisfied that the gain is at least equal to the cost.</P>
    <P>Two final observations of mine on the subject are, firstly, that we must not allow business decisions to be swayed by purely sentimental reasons and, secondly, that decentralisation and dispersion of industry over the country is not in itself a self-evident aim of policy.</P>
    <P>There was one matter referred to by the mover of the motion to which I think I should refer.  That was the desirability of University College being &ldquo;decentralised&rdquo;.  By that I understand that it is considered desirable that the college should be moved out of Dublin to a country site. This is a matter which has been debated ever since the beginning of the days of the college.  Oxford and Cambridge were always pointed out as examples of universities, not situated in the great cities of England, which derived considerable advantages from being in secluded university centres.</P>
    <P>The position in regard to University College is entirely different.  I, as one of the representatives of the National University, voice, I think, not only my own personal opinion when I say that the moving of University College to <Col N="610" /> anywhere outside Dublin is quite out of the question.  The cost would be considerable and it would be an unpardonable mistake of policy.  A large number of people are prepared to criticise University College on many grounds.  One complaint which one hears constantly voiced is that going to Stillorgan Road is going too far from the centre of the city.  That is a matter of opinion.  It is the old eternal question whether it is better to house people in flats in the middle of a city or to go out to rural housing areas, whether we should have a skyscraper building in the city or a beautiful estate in the country.  Whatever may be said about going to the proposed new site, there is nothing to be said in favour of going to Athlone, Kells or the various other places suggested by friends of ours as places of exile or purgatories.</P>
    <P>Before this matter is allowed to go any further I want to put it to the Seanad that our college is a great centre of professional education.  You just cannot move 3,000 or 4,000 students quite as easily as is suggested.  It must be remembered that the housing problem is such that it is difficult for students to get accommodation and lodgings in Dublin.  At least half our students come from Dublin homes and, if the college were to be moved to a rural centre or a country town, it would simply mean that you would have the same number of people looking for lodging accommodation as before.  The only difference would be that, whereas now they are looking for lodging accommodation in a city where it exists, they would then be seeking it in places where is does not exist.</P>
    <P>From the point of view of the medical students a good medical school necessitates the proximity of hospitals. You must have clinical teaching in regard to medicine.  The relation between the university and the hospital is getting closer and closer every day. The suggestion that, while great hospitals are being planned for Dublin, University College medical school should be moved is one which shows a complete ignorance of the realities of the situation.</P>

      <P>The position in regard to the law school is similar to that of the medical school.  Students must attend professional lectures either at the Incorporated Law Society or in the King's Inns.  We could not possibly keep our law school going if the college was away from these two centres of professional education.  Students require libraries and museums.  They also require access to technical institutions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many students go on for professions such as accountancy and engineering. They require to be near places where they can have professional education. I feel very strongly, indeed, on this matter.  Whatever may be said for the costs and gains in regard to the decentralisation <Col N="612" /> of industry&mdash;and I think I have dealt fairly with that matter without bias on either side&mdash;there is nothing to be said about the decentralisation of University College.</P>
    <P>Finally, before sitting down&mdash;I hope I will not be misinterpreted or misunderstood&mdash;may I, as one of the representatives of the National University, say I would consider it highly undesirable to leave another institution with a monopoly of university education in the capital city of Ireland?</P>

To those of us who come from the country the movement of industry to the capital city over the past ten years is quite apparent.  We must realise that Dublin is overburdened and has become top-heavy. It is also quite apparent to us that the housing accommodation in the City of Dublin is not now able to absorb all those who have come to the city from the country during the past six or eight years.</P>
      <P>If we want to keep Ireland as we all would wish we must decentralise and start new factories in towns and villages which are prepared to provide the amenities to which Senator O'Brien referred&mdash;amenities such as sewerage, electric light and all that is necessary for the establishment of a factory.</P>
      <P>It is a difficult problem.  We must have confidence in the promoters of industry.  No firm or company will start a factory in a town or village unless they are assured of manpower which will be required as the factory grows.  People will also have to possess the courage to part with some of the cash essential for the establishment of such industries.</P>
      <P>I regret to say that Senator Kissane on the two occasions he spoke this evening brought in politics.  We in this House ought to be big enough to realise that Ireland belongs to us all whether we sit on the Opposition or Government side of the House.  Let us be big enough to pay tribute to all Governments who did anything, be it big or small, to provide employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="613" /> Senator Kissane paid tribute to Fianna Fáil for starting two cement factories, one at Mungret, Limerick, and the other at Drogheda.  All credit to them.  He talked about four beet factories, but he did not pay tribute to Cumann na nGaedheal for starting them, before Fianna Fáil came into power.  Let us be big enough to realise that Ireland belongs to us all.  In asking people to start industries down the country, there are many things you have to offer.  The people of the locality must show good faith by investing their capital.  In my constituency, thanks be to God and to the pioneers of industry and particularly to Youghal, my own town, where I was able to give some little help to secure a factory eight years ago, we now have two factories, giving employment to over 600 people.  A tribute for that is due to the pioneers of industry, to the directors and men of these factories. I dread to think of the fate of my own town and many like it if we had not men of such calibre.</P>
    <P>Dublin is top heavy.  We profess to show deep affection for our Irish men and women, but I would pay tribute to those who had the courage, the foresight and the business acumen and who were prepared to invest capital in Irish concerns to provide remunerative employment and a decent livelihood for Irish men and women.  Wishful thinking or talking here will not get us anywhere.  Politicians on all sides will not get us anywhere in the starting of factories.  It devolves on men of ability with a genuine love and affection for the people, prepared to invest their hard-earned money, big or small, over the years to give employment to our boys and girls.  Some tribute must be paid to all Governments&mdash;and to this Government for the 120 new factories established in the last 18 months.</P>
    <P>There is a problem which has been neglected by Governments&mdash;the getting of factories into towns that were formerly garrison towns in the south of Ireland, towns such as Fermoy. Fermoy enjoyed a very affluent trade and a lot of money was made and spent there during the British occupation. Since the coming into operation <Col N="614" /> of our own State, Fermoy has not seen those days.  I realise that Governments cannot start factories, but I know all Governments are prepared to lend their aid when a concrete proposal is put before them.  We realise that Senator Crowley's motion is an excellent one.  We shed crocodile tears here about the dwindling population in many parts of Ireland.  We must do something.  When any body of men combine to start a factory with £2,500,000, these industrialists should have put before them towns that have been hard hit.  I am referring to one town now where I was within the past week or two.  They have a little factory&mdash;all credit to those who started it &mdash;but they have nothing in the nature of a heavy industry.</P>
    <P>It seems tragic to see the life blood of the town ebbing away, when men and women take the Rosslare boat to England.  Something must be done to stop that.  I realise no one will invest capital in a company unless assured of a sufficient return.  As Senator O'Brien has said, you cannot start factories everywhere in little villages and remote parts of the country, as transport costs would be prohibitive.  However, if a town can provide the amenities, a railway close at hand, good roads to transport the products to Dublin, Cork or elsewhere, that town should be borne in mind.  The Parliamentary Secretary himself is a businessman who understands that if people want to live in business nowadays they must be successful in business.  I feel the Government will explore every avenue and do its best to secure factories for towns that need them.  I am in complete agreement with Senator Crowley and those who have supported him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I heartily congratulate Senator Crowley on bringing this motion.  It is a very proper one and one worthy of adequate consideration here.  Professor O'Brien appears to have that Dublinitis to which Senator Crowley referred and if he regards living in the country districts as being an exile and a purgatory, it is indicative of the mentality of many people residing in this city.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A couple of days ago I noted that of <Col N="615" /> the 120,000 motor vehicles in the country, 40,000 were in Dublin.  On page 3 of the Census of Population Report, 1951, we find that the population in the Provinces of Munster, Connaught and Ulster was reduced by 198,883 from 1926.  In Leinster the population was 1,149,092 in 1926 and 1,336,576 in 1951, an increase of 187,484.  Practically the whole of that increase is in the County and City Borough of Dublin, where there is an increase of 187,368, which is only a difference of 116.  The only other counties in Leinster to show an increase in that period are those converging on Dublin, viz., Kildare, Louth, Meath and Wicklow.  In a quarter of a century from 1926 workers in agriculture decreased by 23 per cent.  while those in the productive industries increased by 67 per cent.</P>
    <P>The drain from the small farms along the western seaboard is of course greatest and there is now an unbalanced economy when we consider that agriculture is the basis of our economy and that the production in that industry is somewhat static, despite modern labour saving agricultural machinery, availability of a cheap supply of lime, reduction in the incidences of disease among live stock and improved agricultural instructions and the demand for that produce. These small farms were all down the years the backbone of the country and it was from these holdings much of the best of our people came.  From these healthy stocks the lives of the cities and towns are being constantly replenished.</P>
    <P>If a really strong and populous nation is to be built up our policy should, I believe, be directed towards covering as much of the country as is reasonably possible with holdings sufficiently small to be worked by the farmers and their families with the minimum of hired labour.  The implementation of such a policy would require the creation of conditions favouring the smallholder and much greater instruction in rural science, demonstration plots and pilot farms.  A great effort should be made to encourage the organisation of the co-operative movement <Col N="616" /> amongst the farming community to market their products and purchase to the best advantage.  Our agricultural instructors should be trained and encouraged to develop the co-operative movement for the sale of the farmers' produce, the purchase of their fertilizers and feeding stuffs and the hire of machinery.</P>
    <P>Farmers are now being exploited to a considerable extent by all the other organised sections of our people. Industrialists and industrial workers producing behind a high tariff wall are highly organised.  The professions, civil servants and trade interests are also organised and each of these classes are extracting a considerable amount of income derived from the primary producer.  The small mixed farmer has to be content to a large extent with prices ruling in world markets, which prices fluctuate considerably, and he has also to contend with serious losses through bad weather and disease in live stock and crops.  The small farmer does not, of course, pay income-tax: he has not sufficient income to make him liable. He has, however, to pay Land Commission annuities which go into the Exchequer.  The land on the small holdings is not being worked as it should be because the smaller farmer obtains a better return for his labour in any other class of employment and he is forced to take it in consequence of the present high cost of living.  The cost of feeding stuff has made egg production unremunerative.  Hence the present scarcity.  The present cost of the egg is indicative of the fact that there is a tremendous scarcity of poultry now in the country.  Pigs have not been seen in West Donegal for many years.</P>
    <P>We should see that industry, monopolies, organisations and local and Central Government expenditure do not impose too heavy a burden on our main industry&mdash;agriculture.</P>
    <P>Irish boys and girls do not go to the cities, Great Britain or the United States of America just because they are incurably adventurous.  They go because they believe no proper living is to be made out of the small holdings and because they think, not without reason, that the small farmer, <Col N="617" /> his wife and family are socially despised.  This can be cured by securing for the agriculturists something like a fair share of the national wealth, by teaching them to make the most of their resources and opportunities and by giving them in primary schools a rural, rather than an urban bias.</P>
    <P>In the steady drift towards the big dominating capital city, the vitality is drained from the life in the provinces. Is this State being turned into a country with an oversized head&mdash; Dublin and its adjoining areas&mdash;and an undernourished body?  It is unfortunate that, when the State was established, a new administrative capital was not set up, in Athlone or some other central provincial town, just as Canberra and Washington were set up.  It is undesirable to have the administrative and industrial capital situated in one city.  It tends towards too much city politics.  As the city grows, so will the urban bias develop and dominate future policy.</P>
    <P>Even now, if certain Government Departments and semi-State organisations were decentralised, they might provide better service because possibly the officials would then be more subject to public opinion than they are in the city.  There is, I think, a considerable waste of time in city Government Departments.  If the Departments were situated in provincial towns, where everyone knows everyone else, we would not then have such wastefulness.  I consider that the officials of local authorities work harder than do civil servants in Dublin, Belfast or London.</P>
    <P>It would not appear to be impracticable to decentralise, to a greater extent, the administration of the E.S.B.  I remember that the day on which the first return of the 1951 Census appeared in the Press&mdash;on that very same day&mdash;it was announced that the E.S.B. were building further offices to accommodate an additional 1,500 employees in the City of Dublin.  Surely some of that staff could be distributed in the various district headquarters, at least?</P>
    <P>I read my meter rent every two <Col N="618" /> months.  That reading is sent to Fitzwilliam Street, Dublin, and it is from that office that I get my account in West Donegal.  I cannot see why that could not be sent out from the district headquarters in Sligo.  Similarly, I believe it would be better for the officials and all those interested in the administration of Bord na Móna if the headquarters were situated in Portarlington or some other town convenient to the machine bogs.</P>
    <P>Like Senator Crowley, I believe that university life should be decentralised. As already mentioned, the residential Universities of Oxford and Cambridge are much preferable to a university situated in the centre of an industrial capital where students can wander around of their own free will.  Until we get a residential university in Ireland, we will not have proper university life and culture.</P>
    <P>I did not interpret Senator Crowley's remarks to mean that University College, Dublin, should be transferred to the country.  I thought he suggested that the accommodation at the constituent colleges of Galway and Cork should be increased in order to attract more students.  In view of the very fine hospital building erected in Galway City at a cost of £1,750,000&mdash;it is one of the finest hospitals in Europe&mdash;the university there would be one where you would have a good medical school.  As regards lawyers, their education would require to be in Dublin.</P>

      <P>Senator Hayes knows perfectly well that the Law Courts are situated in Dublin and that the number of law students in comparison with the number of students in the university is pretty small and would not affect the matter.</P>

      <P>If the rural population declines below a certain point there appears to be no future for the Irish nation and rural Ireland must, therefore, be saved or the nation will perish. An oversized capital city, where many are living in unproductive occupations, is too expensive an institution for an agricultural community to maintain. For that reason, I suggest that future industries would require to be decentralised to augment the income of the small-holdings and thus enable more of our people to remain in the countryside. It is particularly important that the industries processing raw materials from the land should be situated in the countryside rather than in an urban area.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think most Senators will agree with the principle of this motion.  As a matter of fact, I think the majority of those who spoke agreed with the motion in its entirety with, perhaps, the exception of Senator O'Brien.  Senator O'Brien is in the happy position of being what one might describe as a non-political politician who can approach all these questions in a very detached way and express a profound opinion upon them.</P>
      <P>I do not think the views expressed by Senator George O'Brien would commend themselves to any very substantial section of our people.  On reflection, he will see there is something illogical in his suggestion that this proposal to decentralise industry and administration represents distortion of the natural trends of population. The enormous growth of the City of Dublin shows great evidence of real distortion.  Let it be clearly understood that this distortion, through the enlargement of Dublin at the expense of the rest of the country, has had to a large extent its source in political influences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator O'Brien is, perhaps, one of the few survivors of the great liberal school of thought which used to believe that natural trends should be allowed to develop in their own natural way. The population should flow in whatever direction circumstances influence it but political influences have always had a very large part in shaping the <Col N="620" /> size of towns and the distribution of population just as they have a very large part in shaping many other economic factors.</P>
    <P>Dublin is a large city because for centuries it was the centre of government. In the early days it was a place of refuge for the Danes and the Normans who feared the depredations of the &ldquo;wild natives&rdquo;.  They clung close to the coast and reasonably good harbours and sources of supply.  It became, therefore, the centre of government over a long period and, as a result, maintained a substantial and increasing population.  It was not any natural phenomenon that brought the population to Dublin.  It was not the presence of mineral ores or any natural advantages.  It was simply political influences or the influences of history. Down through the years Dublin, being the centre of government, has attracted a substantial section of the population.</P>
    <P>Therefore, if we now by governmental action seek to reverse that trend and distribute the population of this country more widely over the entire State, we are not doing anything that is illogical or unnatural.  I think we are doing something that is reasonable and desirable.  I do not think we are distorting the picture in any way as Senator O'Brien has suggested.  I think that at the moment the presence of nearly 250,000 of the people of this State within a short distance of Nelson Pillar is an entirely unhealthy situation and is something which we ought to strive vigorously to remedy.</P>
    <P>Let it be clearly understood that the remedy is not easy.  The fact that there is a concentration of people here around the mouth of the Liffey is an inducement in itself to that concentration to grow.  Just as a magnet attracts various metals, so the presence of a huge population in one centre tends to attract still greater numbers.  That has happened in other countries and there is nothing unusual about it.  We can regret that it is a little more pronounced here than in other States, as Dublin is somewhat larger in proportion to the rest of the State than the capitals of most other countries.  It is with a view to arresting that trend <Col N="621" /> that I think this motion has been tabled.</P>
    <P>The forces making for this concentration of industry and population here are almost irresistible.  In one Dublin daily paper last week, in one column, in a space of five or six inches, I found advertisements for no less than five factory sites.  There was a stipulation in every one of those advertisements that the site should be located in the City of Dublin&mdash;one was for a site of 20,000 square feet within the city boundary, another for 4,000 square feet within the city boundary, another for 10,000 square feet within four miles of the city, another for 30,000 square feet near to the centre and a fifth for premises near the centre about 6,000 square feet.  That is from only one issue of one particular paper.  It shows how anxious our potential industrialists are to concentrate these industries within Dublin City.</P>
    <P>When you have that drive to establish businesses in Dublin and only in Dublin, it would take a tremendous effort by the State and others to <Col N="622" /> divert them to smaller towns and villages.  The advantages of widely dispersed industry will be accepted by everyone.  Instead of one large capital city there is an advantage in having a substantial number of fair-sized towns. A good progressive provincial town is a happy centre for people to live in.  It is a better location for our population than a large and crowded city.</P>
    <P>I think I have established that there is no distortion, as Senator O'Brien indicated, in the effort to distribute our population over the country.  There was a suggestion in Senator O'Brien's statement to-night that this is another form of subsidisation, that national protection is a subsidisation of industries to encourage their establishment in our own country and that then this additional subsidy is given in an endeavour to bring these industries into particular localities.  I move the adjournment of the debate.</P>
