      <P>No. 1 is a Money Bill and, therefore, appears first on the Order Paper.  In fact, it concerns the Minister for Industry and Commerce and we propose, therefore, to take No. 2, the Local Government Bill; then No. 3; and then No. 1 and No. 4 consecutively.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce will be here for the Factories Bill.  Therefore, the order will be Nos. 2, 3, 1 and 4.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 2 I consider out of order under Standing Order No. 83, as it does not arise out of proceedings in Committee, and therefore it may not be moved.  It was agreed at the last sitting that the Bill would be recommitted in respect of amendments Nos. 4 and 5 (Section 61).</P>

      <P>In page 13, to delete lines 14 to 41 inclusive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 30 enables the Appointments Commission to set up panels.  I do not want to go over the history of the Appointments Commission, but the majority of Senators will be aware of the difficulties under which this institution was appointed and the suggestions that were made then as to what would occur as a result of their appointments. On the Committee Stage here, the Minister suggested that this proposal was to accommodate the applicants.  I suggest that is not so, that the proposal is more to accommodate those whom it would be desired to have on the boards of the Appointments Commission. <Col N="1268" /> That is as one would expect, because if it is a question of appointing a medical officer you must get the best medical people in the country to sit on a particular board.  The time those people can give to a function of this kind is very limited.  In order to facilitate them and to ensure that they would give of their best services, the Minister has been prompted to make these provisions to meet their requirements.</P>
    <P>There is a suggestion that it would be a saving for the applicants.  The procedure at the moment is that when a position is advertised&mdash;whether of a medical officer in Inisbofin or in some other part of the country&mdash;the applicant knows exactly the position for which he applies.  If he is not successful in that application, he has to make other applications and it is a question of cost on his part.  The Minister suggests that it is in order to make this cost less on persons of that kind that these panels are being instituted.  I am very wary about the setting up of panels, for many reasons. I would like Senators to cast their minds back to the institution of this procedure of appointments by the Appointments Commission, having regard to the approach of local authorities to the setting up of this body and having regard to the approach of the applicants for the various positions.  It took a long time to make this procedure acceptable. Now we have got to the stage, I think, when it is generally accepted by the various local authorities as one of the best and most effective ways of making appointments.  We suggest a new departure now, whereby we empower the Local Appointments Commission to set up a panel.</P>
    <P>It is only fair to say that, when this matter was brought to the Minister's attention on the Committee Stage, he did give an indication that he was prepared to consider, sympathetically, the views expressed on that occasion. We have had no concrete proposal from the Minister to assure us that the difficulties which we saw or felt, and which might arise through the implementation of this section, would be attended to.  It was for that reason <Col N="1269" /> that I felt I should put down this amendment to delete the section.</P>
    <P>Let us examine, for a moment, what the section means.  We are giving power to the Local Appointments Commission, a body which is known to us, and in which the majority of us have complete confidence.  We are giving to this body the privilege of setting up a panel, but the Minister has not given us any assurance as to the length of time this panel is going to operate.  That is a very important matter, because injustices can be done. If the panel is going to operate, say, for six months, then to my mind the formation of a panel would not be justified.  On the other hand, if it is going to operate over a period of two years or over, then it is going to react very unfairly against new applicants. During the discussion in this House on the Committee Stage, the Minister, to my mind, introduced something that was not at all compatible with the proposal.</P>
    <P>A question was put to the Minister by a Senator as to whether, when the panel would be in existence, positions would be advertised in the ordinary way.  I think the Minister answered that positions would be readvertised. If that is the case, then the formation of a panel does not serve any purpose. If we are going to have a panel, it must be one for a particular group, dispensary doctors or engineers of a particular classification.  That panel must be limited in its lifetime, otherwise we are not going to give to our young people a fair opportunity of applying for the various jobs.</P>
    <P>I said, during the debate on the Second Stage of the Bill&mdash;and I want to repeat it&mdash;that while I was not one of the people, or a member of the Party, who introduced this question of the Local Appointments Commission, I supported it at the time.  I supported it against great local opposition when the very existence of this institution, to my mind, was at state.  I supported it then, because I felt and was convinced, that here was an opportunity for the best people to get the best jobs, and that we were going to give to the local authorities an opportunity <Col N="1270" /> of making their appointments accordingly.</P>
    <P>If we are going to set up this panel, the Minister should be in a position to give us an assurance as to its lifetime. We may find that the person who is placed thirteenth on the list is going to be appointed whereas if there had been an advertisement issued, and applicants invited for a particular position that person would probably. find himself third on the list, because he would have better qualifications.  I think that is a very serious matter, particularly when the local authority&mdash; whether it is the appointment of a dispensary doctor or an engineer that is in question&mdash;is bound to ensure that the best qualified person is appointed. These positions should be open to all and sundry, and not restricted to a number of persons who will be put on a panel at a particular date.  I want to say this particularly, when we have no assurance for what period the panel is going to exist.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamOBuachalla" hpid="Liam Ó Buachalla Liam Ó Buachalla">
      <NameTxt>Liam Ó Buachalla</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say that I am disappointed that the Minister has not seen fit to introduce an amendment designed to meet the views which were expressed in this House on the last occasion.  The Minister listened to us very attentively, and I think it was agreed that he realised we were very sincere in our objections to the section as it stood, that he felt these objections required examination, and that they should be met by an amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the first instance, I should like to say that we should do everything we possibly can to inspire confidence in the Local Appointments Commission and in the Civil Service Commission. There is no use in saying that there is not some uneasiness.  That uneasiness exists, and responsible people will offer various objections to the Local Appointments Commissioners. I shall not go into these objections but it is as well for us to realise that there is a considerable amount of uneasiness with regard to the commission, and to the method by which it makes appointments.  However, I think we cannot devote half <Col N="1271" /> enough attention to this section and to the proposals inherent in it.</P>
    <P>From my experience as an examiner, both publicly and in the university, I have a great deal of sympathy with the commissioners and with the Minister in this matter.  It is something that needs to be overhauled, but just precisely how to do it to satisfy everybody, I do not know.  I would not have data at my disposal which would enable me to make what I would consider a satisfactory proposition, but I think the Minister was in a position to get all the facts.  I think that, having been able to do that, it should have been possible for him to have introduced an amendment which would have met our wishes in connection with this section. What we are concerned with is that at all times the best candidates should get the jobs and what I am afraid of is that under this panel system the best men may be ruled out.  I want to have this point clarified and I want to have it very definite, and I do not know how I am going to get it very definite, unless it is provided for in the law we are about to make.  The Minister's assurance will be valuable, but, valuable as it is, it is not fully satisfying.</P>
    <P>We want the best man for a job. Supposing there are three people, A, B and C, going on this panel.  They will have already been interviewed by the commissioners.  They would not have been appointed but somewhere on the files of the commissioners will be mark sheets.  A will have been awarded 80 marks; B will have been awarded 79; and C 78.  There are men then anxious to go for this job if they have the right to enter.  One of them is perhaps a distinguished candidate or a distinguished graduate and if he came before the commissioners he would have every chance of getting 90 or 95 per cent.  It is hard on the men who have been already interviewed that none of them get the job, but still our concern is that the best man should get the job, and consequently I want to be assured that every job will be open to all qualified candidates, whether they have been interviewed by the commissioners or not already.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1272" /> There is another point on which I want clarification.  We are concerned very much at the moment with appointments to medical and surgical staffs.  I think we are not doing sufficient to state precisely what qualifications are required for these various positions and I think it is time the Minister made up his mind and made it known whether he accepts that practice in Great Britain is essential for appointments.  The panel idea is devised mainly to cater for applicants who are living away from Ireland&mdash;certainly living away from Dublin but mainly for candidates who will be in practice, say, in Great Britain.  I am speaking now mainly of medical applicants, but it is also applicable to graduates in, say, engineering. I think this experience abroad is of very great importance.  It is a fact that you just cannot get as wide experience in Ireland, in view of all our circumstances, as can be obtained in Great Britain.</P>
    <P>I want to draw the Minister's attention, when he is thinking of his panels, and the attention of the commissioners to the fact that there are in this country a number of very distinguished graduates&mdash;I know some of them myself&mdash;graduates in medicine and surgery who obtained first class honours in every examination during their courses, who, when the war broke out and when they were requested by the Government of the country, volunteered for the Irish Army and gave all their time to the Army during the emergency.  Some of them married during the period they were in the Army, but by the time the emergency was over, it was rather late for these people to go to Great Britain to get that experience which the Minister and the commissioners think so essential.  It is very hard on these people that, because of this perhaps unwritten law, that they should have experience in Great Britain, they cannot get a public appointment in this State.</P>

      <NameTxt>Liam Ó Buachalla</NameTxt>
      <P>I have indicated that there seems to be not a law but an unwritten law.  There is a very strong belief abroad that nobody, or scarcely anybody, can get an appointment under our services here unless he will have had experience in Great Britain.  I should like, if I were free, to give the names of very distinguished graduates of National University who feel very much aggrieved because of this.  Indeed, if the Minister wishes, I could ask the permission of these people to submit their names to him, but I think it is a matter which the House should be made aware of.  It is something which I think should indicate to us a certain danger with regard to these panels&mdash;the type of person who will go on them and the type of person who is likely to be cut out from the right to apply for certain positions.</P>
      <P>I feel that it is inherent in all this section, and if I can get no more than an assurance from the Minister I should be glad to get it, but I think it is a pity that provision is not made definitely in the section with regard to this question of who shall have the right to apply for these jobs.  Has the Minister made up his mind that, whenever an appointment is to be made, an advertisement will be issued?  If an advertisement is to be issued, there would be no point in issuing it unless all and sundry who are qualified will have the right to apply.  If he does that, I will be satisfied to some extent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the duration of a panel, I pointed out the previous day that if the panels are to be changed often, it would defeat the intention. They would become more of a nuisance than anything else and if they were to continue for too long.  I think they would be a danger.  I do not know what the ideal period would be.  In a rough and ready way, I think I would be satisfied if the panel were to <Col N="1274" /> continue for 12 months, for not longer than 12 months.  Whether the Minister could give an assurance that would bind the commissioners that the panel would not last for any longer than that, I do not know, but we ought to have some indication of the Minister's mind in regard to it.  That is all I have to say about the matter and indeed all I can say, seeing that we are now on the Report Stage, but I want to say again that I regret very much that the Minister did not see his way to introduce an amendment that would meet the wishes of people on all sides of the House with regard to this very delicate matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFirmullaghOReilly" hpid="Mr. O'Reilly Mr. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>I happen to be a member of a certain local authority which, prior to the coming into force of the Management Act, did operate a panel system in regard to the recruitment of staff.  This local authority did recruit quite a substantial number of staff&mdash;filling vacancies arising from marriage and so on.  I became a member of the local authority&mdash;I came in on the same day as the managers came into local administration&mdash;and I saw that system die out.  That local authority had a panel and a subsidiary panel and a supplementary panel.</P>
      <P>It worked in practice like this, although I could never completely understand it.  Certain people were moved from one panel to another and when people were coming near the age limit they were moved from one panel to another if they were too low on their existing panel, and so forth.  As a result of seeing it in practice for a very short time, I came to the conclusion that the best thing to do was to eliminate the panel and get away from it as soon as possible.  I think we did succeed in getting away from it.  If any authority or institution, whether it be the local authority or the Local Appointments Commission, adopts a system like that then I do not think it will tend towards good administration.  I have had that experience some years ago.  Having regard to the views expressed by Senator Ó Buachalla, I think the Minister should try to meet the viewpoint that has been put forward.</P>

    <Col N="1275" />
    <Speaker pid="RogerMcHugh" hpid="Dr. McHugh Dr. McHugh">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McHugh</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like clarification on two points and perhaps the Minister will explain the position when he is replying.  The first concerns the point made by Senator Hawkins about the advertising of vacancies.  Is there a statutory obligation on local government bodies to advertise vacancies or is it the usual practice?  If it is the usual practice or if there is any statutory obligation to that effect, then there does not seem to be much point in having a panel system because people from outside may apply and their applications must be considered.</P>
      <P>The second point that arises is how this will affect the graduate abroad. Senator Ó Buachalla thinks that the section would operate against the graduate at home and in favour of the graduate abroad.  I am not so sure. The graduate at home is more in touch with things at home and will be quicker off the mark than the graduate abroad who must, for instance, suffer the inconvenience of delay in obtaining the advertisement.  I fear the section may operate too much against the graduate abroad.  Due to our circumstances, since we obtained the measure of freedom we have, our graduates have mainly been exported in certain fields.  I feel it would be a mistake to penalise the graduate abroad.  Therefore, I should like the Minister to give some consideration to the question of how far the panel system would, in fact, operate against the graduate abroad who, through no fault of his own, is earning his living in some other country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>I have had complaints about the Local Appointments Commission, but I am not worrying about that because when people do not succeed they complain.  However, it is felt that preference is given to the man who has practised in England for, say, 12 or 18 months as against the man in Ireland who applies for the job.  I have heard that view expressed by people. I think the panel should not last for longer than 12 months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. P. O'Donnell Mr. P. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Senator agree to it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not object to it. <Col N="1276" /> Some time ago, a man went forward for the fourth time for a certain job. He thought it was very hard on him that he had to go forward four times because certain expenses were involved each time.  If he had been placed second or third at the previous examination, he could have been put on the panel for the next time a vacancy arose.</P>
      <P>I am inclined to agree with Senator Ó Buachalla that there are people who feel that advantage is given to the young man, whether he be an engineer or a doctor, who has practised in England for, say, six or 12 months.  I do not object to the panel but it should not be for longer than 12 months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamStanford" hpid="Professor Stanford Professor Stanford">
      <NameTxt>Professor Stanford</NameTxt>
      <P>Is this panel intended simply as a means of not reexamining candidates in the field?  If so, it is a good thing.  However, if it is going to be used as a means of closing the field for, say, six months of the year, and of preventing other candidates from coming in during those six months of the year, it is clearly bad.  When such a panel is drawn up, can other names be added when a job becomes vacant or will this comprise the whole field for the job so long as the panel is valid?  If it can be used as a means of closing the field for six, 12, 18 or 24 months, it may be very much open to abuse.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonKissane" hpid="Mr. Kissane Mr. Kissane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kissane</NameTxt>
      <P>The point that has been mentioned now by Senator Stanford and Senator O'Sullivan is the main point of the discussion.  I am sure that the last day we were discussing this section we were discussing it in the dark.  Nobody seemed to know how its provisions would operate.  I was not opposed to the principle of the panel system, as such.  In fact, personally, I would rather welcome it &mdash;provided I would be assured that the establishment of such a system would not open the door to other and worse injustices or inconveniences than we <Col N="1277" /> were trying to eliminate.  The difficulty in life about many things is that when we try to eliminate injustices in one direction we may create injustices in another.  That is what I am afraid of. That is what we may do if we accept this section in its entirety.  I am with the Minister inasmuch as he is making provision whereby it will not be necessary to call people for interview over and over again, at very much inconvenience to themselves and sometimes, too, at a good deal of expense.  However, while trying to facilitate people belonging to that category, we must make sure we do not create an injustice for another section.</P>
      <P>Senator McHugh said we should not penalise would be applicants from abroad but, at the same time, I submit we should do nothing to penalise would be applicants living at home.  It is because we should like to avoid those difficulties that we want this section amended.  I understood from the Minister the last day we were discussing this section or, at least, I was hoping that he would find some means of reconciling the idea of obviating the necessity for repeated interviews on the part of applicants for certain posts in this country with the idea of making sure that the best applicants would get the jobs that would be vacant here from time to time.  The question is, as somebody mentioned here, are we doing something now that will establish the position here under which the best brains in the country will not get the jobs?  Could not that be the case? With all due respect, I think that it is not beyond the wit of man to devise a method by which the two things I mentioned could be reconciled.  I do not know whether anything can be done now.  This is the Report Stage of the Bill.  Unless the Minister is himself prepared to take the remedy into his hands, I am afraid that we can do nothing about the matter at this stage. I would appeal to him though to reconsider it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are approaching this matter with open minds.  This is not a political matter.  We are approaching it honestly and sincerely for the sole purpose of doing the best we can with <Col N="1278" /> the section and making the measure worth while and workable as a whole.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardCommons" hpid="Mr. Commons Mr. Commons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Commons</NameTxt>
      <P>The Appointments Commissioners are beyond political influence.  When they select somebody for a certain position, they naturally pick the person who is highest in order of merit in their minds.  That is only fair and just.  If we create a panel system whereby, the applicants who have been interviewed are placed on the panel and if there can be no further interviews until that panel is cleared off, then we will be denying people the right to make application for appointments.  Certain speakers, who are more conversant with these matters than I am, said that every year there is thrown up a number of graduates who by all the laws and rights of citizenship, and in accordance with the Constitution, are entitled to make application for any position. A graduate may be interviewed and the commissioners may find that somebody else has a year's or two years' more experience.  Young graduates can still be denied preference for the post. That is where the trouble lies.</P>
      <P>Are we going to rule out the young men who are just as much entitled to posts and jobs in this country as anybody else?  That is the danger I see in the panel system.  I agree that there is a hardship on the people who apply time and time again.  I know a man in my own constituency who applied for a job six times and who was called for interview six times without succeeding in being placed in a position at any time.  The reason was that he was not fit to be appointed as he did not have the qualifications.  These people are beginning to recognise their limitations and if they apply for a position and go for interview they should know whether or not they have improved themselves, so as to be competent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I find myself in agreement with Senator Stanford.  If the panel system is kept for longer than six months it is certainly going to be unjust.  If it is not kept for longer than six months it is hardly any use forming a panel at all.  I would like if the Minister would let us know how long the panel system <Col N="1279" /> will be in operation.  Will it be in existence for six months, 12 months or until it exhausts itself and all the applicants thereon have found positions?</P>
    <Speaker pid="ArthurCox" hpid="Mr. Cox Mr. Cox">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>Listening to the discussion, it occurred to me that possibly the very real difficulties raised on both sides might be met by the rules the Minister would make.  I take it that in the first place there must also be an advertisement.  In other words, the people must know that there is a vacancy.  If the rules then provided that a person who had already been examined could ask the commissioners to act on their previous note without his attending again, the commissioners could so act.  On the other hand, any one who applied to be seen could be seen again.  I think some rule of that kind might get over the objections on the one hand to a fixed panel which must have the dangers that people will drift up to the top or on the other hand that possibly the Appointments Commissioners may be accused of doing things in the dark.  If the arrangement were that a person already examined and noted could say: &ldquo;Please work on my record,&rdquo; that might meet the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment is to delete the whole of Section 30. Nobody has suggested how this particular section could be amended so as to meet the difficulties in the situation. The truth is that the section itself endeavours, I think, to provide for the difficulties.  The Local Appointments Commission is an old Sinn Féin idea.  It was, I think, an idea of Arthur Griffith that there should be what he called a local Civil Service.  It was put into operation by the first Government. Like everything else you start to do, when it had been done and was being administered under Act of Parliament, it turned out that there were all kinds of difficulties.  Senator Commons alluded to the difficulties of local bodies.  The Roscommon County Council, for instance, would prefer a Roscommon man.  There were difficulties with regard to where a man came from.  It was also found that this <Col N="1280" /> applied to an immense variety of posts.  There was talk about dispensary doctors but there is an immense number of posts apart from these and apart from posts for which graduates might apply or under which the Local Appointments Commissioners have jurisdiction.</P>
      <P>I agree at once that the system is a good system.  I agree at once that, not only must the Appointments Commissioners do the right thing, but they must have every appearance before the public of doing it.  That is what some Senators were concerned about.  This particular section is entirely permissive. That has not been adverted to at all.  Sub-section (2) says that the Local Appointments Commissioners, if they so think fit, may, in accordance with rules under sub-section (4) of this section, arrange from time to time for examination, etc.  In other words, the Local Appointments Commissioners, having an experience of nearly 30 years of this system, may, if they think fit, arrange for panels for certain posts, and if they do think fit, then, under sub-section (4), they may, with the consent of the appropriate Minister, make rules for the purpose under sub-section (2) applying either generally to all panels or classifications or to any particular classification. What the section, in effect, says is that the Local Appointments Commissioners, using their experience, may adopt a different system from the present one with regard to certain posts and may make rules with the consent of the appropriate Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that the discussion to-day has rather indicated that this is not so easy as it appears.  The Local Appointments Commissioners must be aware of these difficulties.  Perhaps the simplest thing would be to see that the rules are made and how the whole thing works out.  I know that there are difficulties.  I was told, for example, by a number of people here one day, people of different political persuasions from a particular town, what was happening there when we were discussing the work of the Local Appointments Commissioners. The town they said was not very big and it was not very small, but it resulted in young men with certain qualifications <Col N="1281" /> coming in all the time to fill the position of town clerk.  The man who was actually the assistant could never get the top job because he had not the qualifications required.  No one ever stayed in the place because the position was not a big one.  A good young man got the job.  The older man, a native, taught him all about the work and after about three years the man who had the top job went somewhere else.  In a period, I think, of about 18 years they said that they had about seven appointees, none of whom stayed.</P>
    <P>It is a case of appointing the best person.  It is not so simple to devise these rules.  Sometimes, they are difficult to apply justly and properly.  It seems to me that you can do nothing with the section that would make it right.  I have met a great many people who say that they are sick and tired of applying, of paying fees and travelling from the country and appearing before boards.  Even people resident in Dublin object to losing half a day appearing before a board.  If these people could be put on a panel, I think a great improvement would be effected, but I do not think it is fair to the Appointments Commissioners, whoever they may be, to suggest that they will adopt the line of least resistance&mdash;that is to say, to gather people on a panel and say &ldquo;that is all right now, we have a panel; no more advertisements and we will wait until the panel is exhausted&rdquo;.  I do not think they would do that.  I think they would advertise again.  It would appear to me that for certain kinds of posts it would at once appear to the Appointments Commissioners that new advertisements should be issued.  That, I think, would not apply to all posts.  It might, but I doubt if it would.  I have not sufficient experience to say.  I feel that the section makes provision for allowing the Appointments Commissioners to have a panel, and for allowing them to make rules under this section.  I think that should be let work.  When you had experience of that, questions could always be asked about this matter.</P>
    <P>With regard to the point about graduates who have British experience, I have met a great variety of graduates <Col N="1282" /> myself and I have never heard that complaint made.  It is said that certain medical experience in Britain is of great importance.  It would seem to me, speaking as one without any expert knowledge on medical matters, that certain experience in Dublin or outside of it, or any place within the State, would also be very good indeed. I do not think there is any such rule&mdash; that is to say that British experience is regarded as better than comparable Irish experience.  We have at our disposal&mdash;and this has happened from the very beginning of the State&mdash;for our specially difficult jobs Irishmen who have had experience outside the State. If they are selected and desire to come home, I am afraid it is to be regarded as a good thing rather than a bad thing, but that they should be preferred in particular cases, and particularly in routine cases, to people with Irish experience only, is bad.  What I suggest is that we should accept this as a well meant and honest effort to overcome a difficulty which has arisen in the working of this Act with regard to the Local Appointments Commissioners, and see in what cases it will be applied and how it will work.</P>
    <P>The phrase was used by some Senators that the Minister should meet their wishes.  Is it not clear that the Minister could not meet their wishes because they have not been clearly expressed?  It is not possible to ascertain what they want done. What is clear is that we are all agreed that we want the best people to be appointed.  We are also agreed that we do not want to have people having to apply continually for posts.  We want to give the Appointments Commissioners more elbow room, but no one has been able to devise an amendment to ensure that.  I do not think it is desirable that we should sit down and try to restrict the Local Appointments Commissioners in doing this particular kind of business, or that the Minister himself could do it.  I suggest that we should see how this thing works and if it will lead to any improvement from the point of view of the workability of the scheme.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LouisWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator Cox that it is desirable in all cases <Col N="1283" /> that these advertisements for appointments should appear even though the panel is there.  Otherwise, a number of good and able men may be excluded for a long period.  Say, for an example, that an appointment is to be made in the month of May.  The examinations in the universities may not take place until June or October.  If the post to be filled is that of medical officer of health in a dispensary district, the successful applicant will need to have his D.Ph.  A number of the applicants may not have that degree by the date that the applications are to be in.  Therefore, if this panel system is to operate it is quite possible that a number of applicants would be excluded for possibly 12 months.</P>
      <P>The regulations made by the Appointments Commissioners, with the consent of the Minister, may prescribe a period of 12 months.  In that event a number of applicants may be excluded.  The Minister stated previously that he intended to apply this principally to dispensary medical officers of health and assistant engineers.  There may be quite a number of appointments as assistant engineers to be made within the period.  If there is a panel, the person who is No. 20 on it may be appointed, although in the meantime quite a number of brilliant young men who had qualified would be excluded. I suggest to the Minister that, as regards the regulations to be made by the Appointments Commissioners, the period specified should be as short as possible, not more than six months.</P>

      <P>I am afraid that Senator Hawkins has attributed very selfish motives both to myself and the Appointments Commissioners, motives which do not exist&mdash;motives of convenience. When the Bill was before the House in Committee, I said that I welcomed amendments to it, and that I would treat them with the respect which they deserved.  I knew that there was no political bias in the discussion, and I was prepared to accept amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is quite evident to me, from the discussion to which we have listened, that the panel system is desirable.  If there is anything wrong with it, no one <Col N="1284" /> has given me any suggestions by way of amendment.  The only one amendment I have got is one on the Committee Stage by Senator Kissane to delete the section and there is one on the Report Stage now from Senator Hawkins to delete the section.  I have got no constructive amendments from the House.</P>
    <P>I clearly indicated to the House, following the Committee Stage debate, that I would consult the Local Appointments Commissioners.  I want to tell the House now that I did consult them, with a view to examining and meeting as far as possible the various points of view made.  The commissioners propose to proceed cautiously and to experiment with the procedure &mdash;which is an accurate development of their existing practices.  One would think that this setting up of a panel system is an innovation.  It is not. Down through the years the commissioners have set up a panel system, but that panel system applies only to individual local authorities.  For instance, supposing for a second it is a case of an appointment of an assistant county engineer for Donegal.  When the original vacancy occurs, a panel is set up for future vacancies in that county. That has been the practice down through the years, but unfortunaeely if a vacancy occurs in a neighbouring county, in Sligo or Leitrim, that particular panel for Donegal will not operate.  I am anxious that it should operate for such counties.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. P. O'Donnell Mr. P. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, if you wish to make a regulation, if such a vacancy should occur, it might be possible to do that.  A panel for about a year's duration may exist for the county engineer or his assistant in Donegal, but that is not sufficient at present for the neighbouring counties, and that is one of the drawbacks which I have tried to amend.  The panel system which we envisage would operate under rules made under sub-section (4) by the commissioners with the consent of the Minister.  Those rules will vary according to the type of competition and in <Col N="1285" /> the light of experience.  I propose to give a general outline of how the system may be expected to work.</P>
      <P>First of all, care will be taken to advertise panel competitions and they will be advertised much more extensively than at present.  They will be advertised as panel competitions and the advertisement will specify not only existing but prospective vacancies to be filled from the panel.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. P. O'Donnell Mr. P. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>We are dealing with the panel position.  Supposing there is a vacancy for an engineer, in addition to advertising a particular appointment for that engineer&mdash;say, in Galway &mdash;we will insert in the advertisement that a panel is going to be set up not only for that particular vacancy but for vacancies which may be created within, say, six, ten or 12 months in, say, Galway, Mayo, Longford or Roscommon; and the area will be set out.  Any applicant who applies for that vacancy in Galway knows that he is also an applicant for prospective vacancies within six, ten or 12 months and he knows the area for which he is applying.  For example, an advertisement may state that a panel is to be set up to fill vacancies for two health inspectors in Cork and Kerry and for any further vacancies for health inspectors which may arise in Limerick or Waterford.  The advertisement covers the two vacancies in Cork and Kerry which exist, but the panel will cover any vacancies which may be created in Waterford or some neighbouring county.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. P. O'Donnell Mr. P. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, fully qualified. I want to repeat the assurance I gave on the Committee Stage that no person who has not passed the competition <Col N="1286" /> specially held for the panel will be placed on that panel.  He must qualify, as Deputy Hickey has just said; otherwise, he will not get on the panel.  If a candidate accepts or refuses a panel post&mdash;this point was put to me on the last day here&mdash;and another more attractive post is to be filled from the panel later, the candidate's chances of the second post will not be prejudiced by the fact that he accepted or refused the first post.  Some doubt was expressed in the House on Committee Stage on that particular point.  The fact that he refused or accepted a prior post will not prejudice him in any way in applying for some other post of a similar nature which is on the panel.</P>
      <P>The classes of posts that it is proposed to fill from a panel system will depend on the experience gained in the operation of the system by the Local Appointments Commissioners.  The classes that are in mind at the moment are classes where there is a substantial number of applicants each year&mdash;such as health inspectors, assistant county engineers, district medical officers, dentists, town clerks and agricultural instructors.  There is no mention of county medical officer of health or county surgeon&mdash;posts where vacancies rarely occur.  The posts we have in mind are those in which there is a number of vacancies annually and which we are anxious to fill and the filling of which has been held up for many months and even for years in some cases not through the inability to procure suitable candidates but through the refusal of selected candidates to take up the positions, in which case another competition has had to be arranged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All of these posts will not necessarily be filled by the panel system and there may be others from time to time where there will be substantial recruitment. It is not the intention to apply the panel system to posts in which there are only occasional vacancies.  That is not the purpose of the system at all. The life of the panel will depend on experience and normally a duration of a year might not be unreasonable.  I can assure the House that, in so far as I am the appropriate Minister, I <Col N="1287" /> certainly would be very loath indeed to sanction a panel which would last for longer than 12 months.  I can assure the House that, in so far as I am the appropriate Minister, I certainly will not sanction a panel for a longer period than 12 months.  I have given a fair amount of thought to the points raised by Senators in Committee.  There is no desire on the part of the commissioners or on my part to take any step which would undermine public confidence in the filling of these appointments.</P>
    <P>I realise that Senator Ó Buachalla made a point which did worry me in the beginning, that is, the point that additional applicants may turn up. The Senator wants to allow anyone who wishes to compete, even after the panel has been formed.  There is a difficulty there.  The interview board, even if it were composed of the very same gentlemen&mdash;as it very seldom is &mdash;who set up the original panel, might not have the same standard of recommendation as the original panel.  One can easily visualise the different views that different boards may take of different candidates.  Sometimes a candidate may create a different impression on a board on different days. Once the panel is set up it would be unfair to add to it.  It is a panel for the filling of vacancies which occur regularly, not the occasional one.</P>
    <P>We hope to gain by experience and may add to or subtract from the vacancies which we propose filling from the panel system.  We do not wish that the public should have any less confidence in the Local Appointments Commissioners than they have at the moment.  Some person has suggested that persons with experience abroad are given preference to persons with comparable experience in this country.  That is not so, and I hope it will never happen.  There is no rule or regulation governing that, and I sincerely hope there never will be.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>If I were called upon to make a serious defence for my amendment to this section, I think I would be very satisfied with the Minister's statement.  Senator Hayes, and the Minister, questioned us as to why we, on this side of the House, who did not see eye to eye with this amendment, did not put down a very definite amendment.  The reasons for that are easily given.  I do not wish to hold the House very long, except to quote the Minister's own statement on the Committee Stage of the Bill.  On this section, when Senator ffrench O'Carroll had made some remarks, the Minister made this statement:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;However, I would be prepared to consult with the Appointments Commissioners and put before them the various suggestions which have been made here by this House&mdash;I must say, most constructive suggestions indeed&mdash;and see if I can bring in any amendment on Report.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>It was because of that statement that I waited so long to find, and was disappointed that I did not find, that the Minister had proposed to out an amendment to this section.  He has given us reasons for the setting up of this panel, but he has certainly not answered the questions which should, and must, be answered, before this House, or any responsible body constructed as this body must be, would give this power to the Local Appointments Commission.  I would assure the Minister, and those people on the other side of the House, that we on this side are as much concerned, as they are, if not more, with the good working of this particular authority.</P>

      <P>Any contribution or suggestions which we make are solely directed so that the people to whom this section particularly applies would be satisfied that, in so far as they were concerned, justice was done.  The Minister made a vague reference and said that, as far as he is concerned, the time limit he would put on this panel would be no longer than 12 months. When the Bill passes through this House, the Minister's statements are just as valuable as any statement made by any other member of the House. What really counts is what is incorporated in the Bill.  The Minister has failed to incorporate that the panel system should exist for a period of 12 months.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. P. O'Donnell Mr. P. O'Donnell">

    <Speaker pid="FrederickHawkins" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>To my mind, if we are to give this section to the House, the Minister must answer very definitely what the time limit of the panel is. Personally I am opposed to the setting up of a panel for any length of time, be it long or short.  Seeing that we must have a panel, I would be prepared to support its setting up for as short or long a period as it would be possible to have it.  Again, the Minister is very vague.  He suggests that every position will be advertised.  If that is so, if every position, say, in County Galway or County Kerry is going to be advertised, what is the purpose of the panel?  It serves no purpose at all.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrederickHawkins" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>Now we are coming down to something very definite.  The only thing we can forecast is the number of local dispensary doctors who will, say, on the 15th December, reach 65 years of age, and that, therefore, they are going out, and they do not even have to resign.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. P. O'Donnell Mr. P. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Donnell</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrederickHawkins" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>Two-thirds of the dispensary doctors in this country are not compelled to retire, when they reach the age of 65, so we cannot even forecast when such vacancies will occur. We may be in a position to forecast when some vacancies might occur in the engineering department.  When we contribute a certain amount to the education of our doctors and engineers, we would like to see as many of them as possible going before an appointment board, confident that the only thing which will count is their ability to pass whatever examination is set. Let us suppose there are 23 vacancies in the engineering departments throughout the country, that the Local Appointments Commission advertise that they are going to consider applications for these positions&mdash;that 60, 40, 50 or 80 people appear before this board, and out of that number you select a panel.  Will the persons who are placed on the panel be so informed and will they be informed as to the position they occupy in relation to appointment?  If not, an injustice is immediately done to these people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Applicants pay a fee of, I think, a guinea at the moment and sit for the examination.  They wait then for a time, expecting every day that the postman will come with good or bad news, with news that they have been successful or unsuccessful.  The sooner they know the bad news, the better for themselves, because they can set <Col N="1291" /> about doing something else.  It is our duty here to ensure that persons who are successful will be so informed, and not alone informed that they have been successful, but informed as to the place they secured, whether fourth, twenty-fifth or twenty-sixth, so that if other positions offer in the meantime they will not be in the position of having to say: &ldquo;I hope to get a letter appointing me as engineer in Galway&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. P. O'Donnell Mr. P. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Donnell</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrederickHawkins" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not my point. We are passing a very definite section which is going to affect quite a number of our young people.  We set up an institution to ensure that the best possible persons would be appointed to various public posts and what I want to ensure is that, if we have to have a panel, there will be no doubt created in the minds of applicants with regard to the element of justice which will operate in making selections from that panel.  I do not wish to go any further than that, although I could, if I wished to do so.  The system is there and it is a system of which every side of the House approves, with a view to ensuring that not alone is a local authority going to be satisfied that they will get the best applicant but that every applicant will be satisfied that he or she has received justice.</P>
      <P>A question has been put to the Minister and has not been answered in any satisfactory manner with regard to the panel.  The suggestion has been made that the panel of itself is a good idea in that it saves applicants from the necessity of paying a guinea on making further applications.  One dispensary doctor told me that a particular application was his twenty-fifth.</P>

Therefore, if we pass this proposal and set up this panel, we are giving an opportunity to the Appointments Commissioners to appoint a <Col N="1294" /> person to a position even if it is the important position of dispensary doctor, which, to my mind, is the most important position in the country, who may be fifteenth, sixteenth or seventeenth on that panel, whereas, if the position were advertised at the time it became vacant, there might be a new applicant with more definite qualifications who would be a greater asset to the local authority and to the people who pay him for the services he renders.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 3:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 21, line 7, to delete &ldquo;and&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;, cultural or&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment is put down for the purpose of clarifying a point that was raised in Committee and of seeing what the precise intentions of these sections are.  Perhaps the House will allow me, before dealing with the matter of the amendment, to say that Sections 51, 52 and 57 all appear to aim at the same objects.  They make provision for assistance to be given by a local authority to a committee of local persons, whether a parish committee or otherwise, interested in social and economic matters.  Section 52 provides for halls and Section 57 provides for a museum so that, taken together, these three sections are a considerable advantage on what one might call the social and cultural front.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I thought on the Committee Stage that the word &ldquo;social&rdquo; would include &ldquo;cultural&rdquo; but, as I have some doubts on the matter now, I would like to have them clarified.  I know, of course, that the word <Col N="1295" />&ldquo;social&rdquo;, as interpreted by the courts, is possibly much wider than the word &ldquo;social&rdquo; used in ordinary conversation. What does seem to be difficult is the use of the words &ldquo;social and economic&rdquo; because it would appear that no help could be given by a local authority to any object.  The object would require to be not only of social but also of economic value.  Quite clearly, a great many cultural activities could not by any immediate argument be proved to be of economic value.</P>
    <P>I take it that the intention of Section 51 and the other sections is to give local authorities the power, where they think fit, to help a local committee engaged in certain social activities.  I take it that the provisions of Sections 51, 52 and 57 need ministerial sanction before any local body can spend any money.  I also take it that before assistance is given to any committee which is dealing with these matters the committee would have had to make good.  If local people had gone into a matter, made a certain amount of progress and had shown they were anxious and competent to do a particular job of work, then they would get assistance.</P>
    <P>Briefly, the section is very narrowly drawn.  For example, I cannot see how a dramatic society would qualify by having to be social and also economic. I can understand that the word &ldquo;social&rdquo; might be regarded as including cultural activities.  A dramatic society, an operatic society or any such society would brighten up rural life or the life of our country towns and, therefore, could have indirect economic effects.  I am not sure that that particular argument would be accepted by a Minister or by the courts.  I would like to get information on that.  I could make a case that cultural activities would have economic effects, but, as I say, I doubt whether that would be accepted.</P>
    <P>I should like to say also that, in putting down the word &ldquo;cultural&rdquo;, I do not mean something highbrow or mysterious, or confined to a small group of people.  Local history, for example, is cultural.  The study of archaeology and antiquities could be made interesting to a great number of people.  Pride in <Col N="1296" /> one's own locality would promote genuine nationalism, the kind of love for Ireland which sustained our people through a great many centuries and difficulties.</P>
    <P>I find difficulty in putting these sections together and interpreting the words &ldquo;social&rdquo; and &ldquo;economic&rdquo; in them.  For example, in Section 52 a local body is empowered to provide a building for lectures.  If I were studying Section 51 by itself, I would assume that a lecture on the archaeology or the antiquities of a district, for example, would not come within the purview of Section 51 but if the word &ldquo;lecture&rdquo; in Section 52 is to be taken in a general sense, then I am not right.  It is for the purpose of clarifying that I put down the amendment. It seems to me, therefore, in a nutshell, that the intentions of these sections are extremely good.  They are a great step forward.  I think they come from an Act of 1941.  The interpretation of Section 51 might be too narrow.  If it is drawn too narrowly, then it will prevent the intentions of the Act from being carried out.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamStanford" hpid="Professor Standford Professor Standford">
      <NameTxt>Professor Standford</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this amendment.  As Senator Hayes pointed out, it seems that the courts interpret the word &ldquo;social&rdquo; in a wider sense than, perhaps, some of us would.  It seems to me that in a Bill of this kind it is desirable to have pointers for the ordinary person as to what is intended. I am sure that the Minister will agree with me when I say that what is intended by this particular section is a general enrichment of life in the country.  If we make that clear by including the word &ldquo;cultural&rdquo;&mdash;I think it would be a help&mdash;we would be doing a good day's work.</P>
      <P>It seems absolutely certain that the word &ldquo;or&rdquo; is needed.  We have had the opinion of a learned lawyer in this House on the Committee Stage that the word &ldquo;and&rdquo; is restrictive, whereas the word &ldquo;or&rdquo; would give the section wider scope.  I hope the Minister will realise&mdash;I am sure he does&mdash;that in asking for this amendment we simply want to clear the way for the widest possible use of this clause.  We feel that, as it stands, it is restrictive.  We want to open the door a little wider.  That is all.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>It is hardly necessary for me to remark that I am very much in favour of this amendment because it seeks to clarify the wording of the section. When we were dealing with the section on the Committee Stage, there was a doubt as to whether the words &ldquo;social and economic&rdquo; would embrace &ldquo;cultural&rdquo;. From my reading of the section then I had hardly any doubt at all that the words &ldquo;social and economic&rdquo; were used expressly to exclude any other.  I am glad that the Seanad now sees its way to accept the amendment. It would be as well, too, that it should go forth from this House that <Col N="1298" /> it is our desire that the section, as amended, would be fully availed of.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, under the old Act of 1941, there was not a single instance of where a hall had been erected in any part of the country, the reason being, of course, that the local authority would be of opinion that it would be too much of a commitment for them. This will not be so much of a commitment because it will only mean the giving of grants towards the erection of a hall and the maintenance of it as a centre of recreation, this to be the responsibility of the local committee.</P>
    <P>I am very anxious, as I have said, that this should be availed of for the purpose of reviving the Irish language and for the advancement of our native culture, a thing which is very badly wanted in the country.  It is true, unfortunately, that in many respects our native culture is being neglected. The young people do not seem to realise fully its importance.  That is why I am anxious that publicity would be given to the passing of this amendment so that the local authorities will be made fully aware of the powers which are being given to them under the amended section.</P>

      <P>I am at a loss to know, in view of what has been said by Senator Hayes and Senator Kissane, why this section applies only to county boroughs.  In my opinion, there is a greater need for a social, economic and cultural revival in the boroughs than there is in the county boroughs.  I should like if the Minister would tell us why he has not made provision for the boroughs.  I think that life ought to start in the country so that it will, if you like, reflect itself in the larger cities.  My reading of this is that it only applies to the four county boroughs and that the five other boroughs, plus the new boroughs of Dún Laoghaire and Galway, are excluded as well as the large urban districts.  It may be that the Minister has more comprehensive legislation in hands to deal with that problem, but in my opinion this is only touching the fringe of it.  I think that the putting in of this amendment means really starting at the top rather than building up from the bottom.</P>

      <P>Under this Bill they may give a free grant or give an interest free loan to local committees. I have a lot of sympathy with what Senators have said, but I am afraid that the amendment would only restrict the scope of the Bill.  I said on the Committee Stage that I was satisfied and convinced that in the contest of &ldquo;general social and economic interests&rdquo; the word &ldquo;social&rdquo; included the word &ldquo;cultural&rdquo;.  While I was satisfied of that, I wanted to put it beyond yea or nay, and therefore I sought legal opinion on the matter.  My original opinion was confirmed by the legal opinion which I obtained.  I am only afraid that, if accepted, this amendment would, in fact, restrict the scope of the section by increasing the number of qualifications which a group would have to possess before it could procure a loan. If the amendment were accepted a number of bodies with very limited interests indeed would be entitled to get grants.  We should not forget that when a local authority decides to give a grant it may make certain stipulations. It is in the hands of the local authority to decide what bodies of people may apply for grants such as are envisaged.</P>

      <P>According to the legal interpretation of the section the words &ldquo;general, social and economic interests&rdquo; include &ldquo;cultural&rdquo;.  That being so, in my opinion the acceptance <Col N="1300" /> of the amendment would only restrict the scope of the Bill.</P>
      <P>I am in full agreement with what Senator Hawkins said when speaking on the Second Stage of this Bill.  He said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I would not be disposed to encourage the giving of grants and loans to any other type of persons for the erection of parish halls except the halls were really going to be parish halls....&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The quotation is from column 1078 of the Seanad reports for Wednesday, the 30th March, last.  If economic, social or cultural interests were the only qualifications necessary, one can imagine the number of applicants there would be for grants such as are envisaged in the Bill.  I am satisfied that when the local authority goes about the making of conditions, regulations and stipulations for the giving of grants they can confine the grants to parish councils or to, according to the actual wording of the section, &ldquo;approved local councils&rdquo;.  On the legal interpretation of the section as it stands, I am satisfied that what Senators want is included.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 4:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 25 to delete lines 28 to 37 and substitute the following:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1) (a) The Minister may by regulations make provision in relation to all or any local authorities with respect to all or any of the following matters:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i) making of contracts,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1301" /> (ii) accounts,</P>
    <P>(iii) audit of accounts.</P>
    <P>(b) The Minister may by regulations make provision in relation to all or any local authorities except a county or other borough with respect to any of the following matters:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i) summoning of meetings,</P>
    <P>(ii) procedure.</P>
    <P>In speaking on this section a fortnight ago, I said I was interested in safeguarding the time-honoured procedures that take place at our corporation meetings.  I also said that we had only four county boroughs and five borough councils.  An enormous amount of tradition has grown up since these councils have been manned well over 100 years ago in a democratic manner by the people of this country.  The tradition of service to the local community is very high.  I would hate that any powers should be taken now which would allow a Minister to remove or take from these local authorities any of the powers they have.  We in this country have not had much time for ceremonial and it would be in our interest if we had a little more of it.  Some of these bodies provide the only ceremonial that is left in many parts of Ireland outside the principal cities.  It is in an effort to try and safeguard things of this nature that I have put down this amendment.</P>
    <P>I know it is true that there is no provision to remove these things I have mentioned, but on the other hand the regulations which can be made could, in my opinion, have an undesirable consequence.  They could tend to reduce the status of the mayor of these boroughs and to increase the status of a county manager, if a Minister should so desire.  I believe that the rights, privileges and prerogatives of our boroughs ought to be above the Minister. I sincerely believe it is the present Minister's wish that that should be so.  The powers they have have not been abused.  They have encouraged good types of public representatives to come in and follow up the traditions of these councils.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1302" /> I have been a member of a corporate borough for almost 23 years and as regards many people who sit on that borough with me their fathers have been members before them.  The same applies to many of the other nine cities and towns of Ireland that have such institutions.  They are now our institutions: we have taken them over and we are working them, and to continue on the great traditions of service that they have is very important.  I do not like to see that the Minister can take power to set aside some of the rights of the mayor, certainly reducing his status.  The Repeal of Enactments Act, 1952, repealed the section of the Municipal Corporations Act which appoints that the mayor shall have precedence over all other persons in a borough.  I would hate to think that a county manager&mdash;or anyone else, for that matter&mdash;should have precedence over the first citizen.  If we give the county managers power that would rob him of the trappings of office, we will be inclined to build up the non-elected permanent officials as against the elected representatives; and that is not the sort of safeguard in democracy I would like to see.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I would ask the Minister to consent to the small amendment, that the Minister may by regulations make provision in relation to all local authorities, except a county or other borough, with respect to the summoning of meetings and to procedure.  I want to safeguard those two small matters even from regulation may be it is not the Minister's intention, but, as someone has pointed out, in 20 years' time it might be someone's inclination to remove some of these powers.  There is a tendency towards the secularisation of everything and I think it is a bad tendency.  Many of the members of corporations that I have spoken to have been 25 or 30 years in office and do not consider there is any real reason for the removal of these powers.  Therefore, I would ask the Minister to refrain from taking power to remove these rights and privileges which have been so long in the custody of the nine county boroughs and borough councils in this State.</P>

      <P>Or any of the others in Ireland.  I have no intention of unfrocking them or of replacing their garb with the county manager's hat.  The aim of these regulations under Section 61 will be to embody, in easily accessible form, provisions at present scattered over more than 20 Acts and regulations.  That is the purpose of the regulations to be made under this section.  There will be no interference whatsoever with the ceremonial or dignity of the local authorities in any way, in the regulations which it is anticipated we will make under the section.</P>
      <P>Examples of matters which it is hoped to tidy up in the new regulations are as follows.  First, there is the proving of the minutes.  As you know, in the case of county borough councils, county councils, urban district councils and towns with town commissioners, it is provided that the minutes of meetings may be received in evidence of what took place at the meetings.  This is provided in Article 36 (8) of the Schedule to the Local Government (Application of Enactments) Order, 1898, and Section 55 of the Commissioners Clauses Act, 1847, as applied by Section 28 of the Towns Improvement (Ireland) Act, 1854.  No similar provision exists for borough councils. It is to enable us to have some uniformity about the method of proving minutes for all classes of local authorities, including the borough councils, that I require these regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again, in Section 92 of the Municipal Corporations (Ireland) Act, 1840, it is provided that the minutes shall be open to the inspection of any burgess or voter at any reasonable time on payment of a fee of 1/-, and any burgess or voter shall be at liberty at all reasonable times to make any copy or take any extract from such book. This provision in regard to the payment of 1/- is peculiar to county and <Col N="1304" /> other boroughs.  No fee could be demanded in the case of other local authorities.</P>
    <P>It is to have uniformity that I require these regulations.  I am not going to unfrock any mayor or alderman of any town in this country.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(1) The Minister may by regulations make provision in relation to all or any local authorities with respect to all or any of the following matters:&mdash;</P>

      <P>(f)  matters which are subsidiary or ancillary to any of the foregoing matters.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary, in introducing the Bill to this House, gave us to understand that its purpose was to give back to local authorities powers of which they were deprived by previous legislation.  We now come to this section, and find that the Minister is taking unto himself the power of making regulations as to the summoning of meetings of local authorities.  I think this is a matter which should be left to the local authorities to decide.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proposal in my amendment is that the making of regulations governing such matters should only be made after consultation with the local authority.  The Minister might reply: &ldquo;I am prepared to enter into consultation with the local authority on all these matters&rdquo;.  The summoning of meetings seems to be very unimportant, but for a particular local <Col N="1305" /> authority, or members of it, it is a very important matter.  It is a question which can only be decided by themselves. I do not think that the Minister should enter into it at all.  If sanction must be given to make these meetings valid, then it should be in accordance with the wishes of the local authorities.  If we pass the section as it stands, we are giving power to the Minister to make regulations as to the time and place local authorities may meet, and the procedure which they may adopt in relation to the many matters in this section.</P>
    <P>I put it to the House and to the Minister that such decisions should the taken only after consultation with the local authorities, and that the Minister be then given the powers he asks for under this section.  If he is not prepared to accept this proposal, I would like to hear from him the grounds on which he suggests it is essential to give him these powers. Why should the Minister be given the power of deciding when a particular local authority should hold its meetings? The elected representatives of an urban council, corporation, or county council give their time voluntarily, and if it comes to deciding when to hold their meetings, it should be a question for themselves to decide.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question of contracts, while it might be desirable that we should have a uniform system for local authorities, they should be taken into the confidence of the Minister, and he should not ask this House, or the other House, to give him powers to make regulations without at least having consulted the local authorities as to the procedure they should adopt.</P>

      <P>Let me explain that any regulation which would be made under this section would contain very little, if anything, which is not <Col N="1306" /> referred to the summoning of meetings. Regulations governing the summoning of meetings, at the moment, are regulated by law.  As I pointed out, when dealing with Senator Burke's amendment, the purpose of the section is to tidy up sections and enactments which are scattered over Acts of the old British Parliament and our Oireachtas.  It is for that purpose, to give us some uniformity, and for the purpose of consultation, that I ask for power to make these regulations.  As I said, there will be very little, if anything, in the regulations which is not statute law at the moment.  One can appreciate that, under one section of a very old Act, a local authority may adopt a certain procedure to call a meeting, whereas and her local authority, of a different status, would have an entirely different procedure. It is for the purpose of consolidation and uniformity that I want regulations to gather up these scattered Acts down through the years.</P>

These are dealt with under sub-sections (a), (b), (c) and (d) of Section 61.

With that I am in agreement, but we know from experience that sometimes these permissive sections can open the door to untold and unexpected abuses.  I must come back to the panel system again.  The Minister <Col N="1308" /> gave us to understand that the panel system would not operate in such a manner as to deprive oncoming people with degrees of the opportunity of getting posts in their own country.  In that connection, I should like to refer to a panel system which is already in operation in this country, namely, the panel system governing the appointment of teachers in national schools.

      <P>This Bill and the regulations to be made thereunder are intended to replace the existing law governing the sale and manufacture for sale of fertilisers, feeding stuffs and mineral mixtures, which is embodied in one statute and six Statutory Orders, namely:&mdash;</P>
      <P>1.  The Fertilisers and Feeding Stuffs Act, 1906.</P>

      <P>6.  Emergency Powers (Feeding Stuffs) Order, 1944 (Amendment) Order, 1953 [S.I. No. 130 of 1953]</P>

      <P>7.  Emergency Powers (Feeding Stuffs) Order, 1944 (Revocation of Article 6) Order, 1954 [S.I. No. 260 of 1954].</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Repeal of the Fertilisers and Feeding Stuffs Act, 1906, is provided for in Section 15 of the Bill.  On the bringing of the Bill into operation as an Act, <Col N="1310" /> the several Emergency Powers Orders which apply at present to the manufacture and sale of fertilisers, feeding stuffs and mineral mixtures will be revoked and replaced by regulations under the new Act.</P>
    <P>In so far as the Bill replaces the Fertilisers and Feeding Stuffs Act, 1906, it largely follows the main lines of that Act, the chief features of which were, briefly, as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>1.  On the sale of any artificially prepared article as a fertiliser or a feeding stuff, the seller was required to give to the purchaser a written statement containing specified particulars of the composition of the article.</P>
    <P>2.  The written statement given by the seller of the article was to have effect as a warranty by the seller.</P>
    <P>3.  The purchaser of such an article was entitled, on payment of the required fee, to have a sample of the article taken, within a specified period, by an official sampler and analysed by an agricultural analyst, who would send to the purchaser of the article a certificate of analysis indicating, <i>inter alia</i>, whether and, if so, in what respects and to what extent the article was found to differ, to the prejudice of the purchaser, from the particulars thereof given in the seller's written statement.</P>
    <P>4.  Every county council was required to appoint one or more official samplers and an agricultural analyst for the purposes of taking and analysing samples under the Act.</P>
    <P>That Act provided for the fixing of fees by the county councils for the sampling and analysis of articles taken under the Act at the request of purchasers. The fees were fixed at the levels necessary to cover the analyst's fee for carrying out the analysis in each case and were so high that purchasers ceased to make use of the service of sampling and analysis provided under the Act.  Eventually, the lack of demand for that service resulted in the discontinuance of the local machinery for the sampling and analysis of articles to which the Act applied.  The present Bill is designed to remedy that <Col N="1311" /> situation by providing a State service whereby any farmer who has doubts about the quality of a fertiliser or feeding stuff which he has bought may have the article sampled and analysed on payment of a moderate fee fixed by the Minister for Agriculture with the sanction of the Minister for Finance.  If, on analysis, the article is found not to be of the quality and composition warranted by the seller, the purchaser may claim redress from the seller by means of an action for damages.</P>
    <P>The Emergency Powers Orders which now apply to the manufacture and sale of fertilisers, feeding stuffs and mineral mixtures are due to expire next year.  In view of the importance of securing that all articles which are manufactured for sale as fertilisers and feeding stuffs are of suitable composition, of satisfactory quality and conform to the descriptions under which they are offered for sale, it is necessary to give permanent effect to the powers of supervision and control now vested in the Minister for Agriculture by the Emergency Powers Orders cited.  The Bill accordingly invests the Minister with the following powers, being powers similar to those now exercised by him under the several Emergency Powers Orders to be revoked when the Bill comes into operation as an Act:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(1)  Power to prohibit the sale or manufacture for sale of a specified fertiliser or feeding stuff (including a mineral mixture) or of a specified class of fertilisers or feeding stuffs.</P>
    <P>(2)  Power to restrict manufacture to persons licensed by the Minister and to attach conditions to licences granted to such persons.</P>
    <P>(3)  Power to prohibit, limit or regulate the use of any specified article in the manufacture for sale of a fertiliser or feeding stuff.</P>
    <P>(4)  Power to require the production of books, etc.</P>
    <P>(5)  Powers of entry, inspection and taking of samples by an authorised officer.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamStanford" hpid="Professor Stanford Professor Stanford">
      <NameTxt>Professor Stanford</NameTxt>
      <P>In connection with this Bill I would like very briefly to raise a matter of general policy. There has been some correspondence in the newspapers recently about the new scheme for the sewerage of Dublin. Now it is a well-known fact that sewage of this kind has a most valuable fertilising quality.  If the House will permit me, I will illustrate that by a story I believe to be true.  A representative of a firm of artificial fertiliser manufacturers was sent to China to sell his particular product.  He came back after six months very despondent, with no orders.  He was a very good salesman.  They asked him why he had failed.  He said that he could not compete with 400,000,000 competitors in daily production, manufacturers, shall we say, by private enterprise.  I hope the House will not deem that to be a frivolous story.  It is a fact that every day vast quantities of valuable fertiliser are being poured into the sea, and the sea around our coasts, especially near Dublin, is being very seriously polluted.  I am not going to press this point, but I could speak with considerable fervour on it because I enjoy bathing in the district of Dalkey and Killiney and I value the fertility of our country.  I will only speak for another single minute.  I would like an assurance from the Minister.  Has he given serious consideration to the possibilities of converting town and city sewage into agricultural fertiliser?  It has been done in England.  It has been done elsewhere.  In some cases it has saved the towns and cities in question a great deal of money and they have made profits by it.  I know that there are difficulties, but I would urge the matter upon the Minister.  Probably he has considered it before.  I would <Col N="1313" /> be very much interested to hear his views on the matter.  There are two things involved&mdash;the pollution of the seas and the continual waste of valuable fertilising material from our country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>As Senator Hawkins has indicated, the fact that this Bill merely seeks to remedy some defects in the original Act and to give permanence to very necessary emergency powers regulations ensures that it will not be opposed.  It is essential, however, to consider a few aspects of this very important question.  Senator Stanford has referred to one.  There are, however, two matters of very great importance which are covered by this particular Bill, that is to say, fertilisers and feeding stuffs.  Both relate to the raw materials of the agricultural industry.  Agriculture might in one way be compared with industry.  It might be an over simplification to say that there are two main processes in agriculture&mdash;the manufacture of our soil or a portion of it into vegetable matter, and the manufacture of vegetable matter into animal products.  These are the main activities of the agricultural community.  In the first place they take the raw material, which is the land of Ireland, and seek by their labour and efforts to convert it first into vegetation and then in another process they seek to convert vegetation produced here and also that imported from abroad into animal products.  In this Bill we are seeking to regulate and improve the raw materials applied in the production of crops, that is artificial fertilisers, and we are also seeking to regulate and control the raw material for the production of animal produce, that is, feeding stuffs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Looking at it from this aspect it will be seen that the Bill has a very important impact on the agricultural industry.  If the farmer allows himself to be cheated or defrauded in any way in the fertilisers which he accepts for his land or in the feeding stuffs he purchases for his live stock his efficiency is thereby very seriously decreased.  Any legislation which aims at safeguarding the farmer in respect <Col N="1314" /> of purchased fertilisers or purchased feeding stuffs is therefore of immense importance to both the farmer and the country.  It is not so easy as it looks to distinguish between an inferior feeding stuff and one that is of real value, or to find out the defects which may exist in the feeding stuff.</P>
    <P>It is equally difficult for the ordinary farmer to be sure that a fertiliser, particularly a compound fertiliser, is of the quality it purports to be.  There was in the original Act&mdash;I assume it is being continued&mdash;provision for a written guarantee with the sale of fertiliser and feeding stuffs but as far as I know very few farmers have either asked for or are being supplied with such a written guarantee.  There is on the sacks or containers of both feeding stuffs and fertilisers certain very limited and very vague information in regard to the contents.</P>
    <P>Let me say that I have for a considerable time been influenced by the view that there is a lot to be said against compound fertilisers and against compound feeding stuffs.  A compound fertiliser or a compound feeding stuff is like a coalition or a composite Government.  It affords very great scope or cover for dishonesty and deception.  For example, it is very easy in regard to a straight forward product such as barley meal, oatmeal or any other meal derived from one cereal for the purchaser to know whether it is good or bad by simply opening the sack.  By the appearance, smell and taste, if you like, you will know if it is inferior.  But if that barley meal, maize, or whatever it may be, is blended with meat meal or, perhaps, worse still, with fish meal a red herring is drawn across the trail and it is very, very difficult for the ordinary purchaser to know whether there is some inferior ingredient in the compound.</P>
    <P>It would, therefore, be much better if, as a result of the superior and increasing agricultural advisory services which we have at the present time, farmers were all sufficiently well informed as to be able to balance their rations of feeding stuffs and blend their own compound fertilisers.  I think it <Col N="1315" /> would be much better for the agricultural industry as a whole.</P>
    <P>I am suggesting in a way that it might be a good thing if, through this Bill, the Minister and his Department were to lend their influence and weight in favour of selling feeding stuffs and fertilisers in their simple form.  It will be remembered that in regard to fertilisers practically every farm differs in the make-up of its soil.  It will be remembered that nearly every field on each farm differs in regard to the make-up of its soil.  A compound fertiliser, which might have some general merit, will not be the best for each particular field or for each particular farm.</P>
    <P>The prejudice in favour of the compound is that it contains a number of ingredients and that if there is something lacking in the soil it will be provided but against that there may be a certain surplus of one particular mineral in the soil and by applying a compound you may be merely adding to the surplus.  Accordingly, the application of that compound is uneconomic.</P>
    <P>The position in most counties at the moment is that there is one agricultural adviser to 800, 900 or 1,000 farmers.  It is possible for these agricultural advisers to reach almost every farm in their areas at frequent intervals and to discuss with them the problems of soil fertility.  We have an efficient soil analysis service which enables the farmer to ascertain in what particular respect his soil is deficient.  I think it would be far better if, with the aid of the local agricultural adviser, the farmer, having tested his soil, were to apply the particular fertiliser in the exact proportions in which it is required on each field, rather than adopt the rather lazy method of using a compound which by nature of its all-embracing contents will meet any possible deficiency in the soil.</P>
    <P>I would like to make a case on this Bill against compound fertilisers and compound feeding stuffs.  In regard to feeding stuffs, a substantial case can be made against compound mixtures.  It is this: The man who feeds live stock <Col N="1316" /> is usually, if not almost invariably, the owner of the land.  It is highly desirable that the farmer should use the produce of his land as far as possible in the feeding of live stock.  If you purchase a completely balanced ration, it is rather difficult to add anything to it.  For example, if a ration for pigs is completely balanced the adding to it of home grown barley or home-grown potatoes would unbalance it.  It would be much better, I think, if the farmer were to purchase whatever feeding stuffs he requires unmixed and in the simple form.  There, again, with the help of the agricultural adviser he would discover the exact proportions in which to blend these feeding stuffs with his own home-produced foodstuffs.</P>
    <P>There is also the more important point that it is much easier to discover the deficiencies or faults in a straight simple cereal meal than it is in a compound. These are considerations which I think should make us inclined to ensure, as far as possible through this Bill, that the purchase by farmers of compound fertilisers and feeding stuffs is discouraged, and that the farmer is given every incentive to use his own intelligence, and he has plenty of it, in the mixing and blending of fertilisers and of the feeding stuffs that are best adapted to his own particular needs.</P>
    <P>There is one other matter which I think arises in regard to this Bill.  It is, if you like, a very simple and practical matter.  Is there not power in the Bill to enable the Minister to compel the manufacturers of fertilisers to sell them in a form that is easily used by the farmer?  Fertilisers are sold at the present time in a two cwt. sack to a great extent.  We all know what it means to lift a two cwt. sack, and these sacks require to be lifted at frequent intervals on the farm to be loaded on trailers or on carts or, perhaps, if they are being blended with other mixtures, to be emptied out and refilled.</P>
    <P>I do not know how this idea of packing fertilisers in two cwt. sacks originated. It seems to have originated, not in the minds of farmers but probably <Col N="1317" /> in the minds of the gentlemen in the offices which control the manufacture of these commodities.  If these people had to lift these sacks they would probably see to it that they were packed in one cwt. sacks.  I want to suggest that, through this Bill, the Minister should see that all fertilisers offered for sale are made up in sacks or bags weighing not more than one cwt.</P>
    <P>I think that it might even be desirable to ensure that they should be made up in paper bags rather than in jute sacks.  We have been how convenient for builders the present method is of packing cement in paper bags.  I am not making this suggestion on behalf of farmers only.  I have in mind the manual workers in the country, in our factories and in transport as well as our agricultural workers on the farms.  Why should these men be treated as if they were beasts of burden?  I suggest that one cwt. of any packed commodity is quite sufficient for anyone to lift, and that it is utterly inefficient and a waste of time to have fertilisers packed in larger sacks.</P>
    <P>The same, of course, applies to grain.  We have at the present time a barrel of wheat which weighs 20 stone and a barrel of potatoes which weighs 24 stone.  Now, there may have been men of great physical strength in this country in years gone by, but I rather suspect that these measures were conceived by people who had no interest whatever in the ordinary manual worker.  I think it is time that an attempt were made to see the viewpoint of the manual worker, and I think that this House should be vigilant in that respect.</P>
    <P>There is also another point in regard to which there is a great waste of fertiliser, a great waste of time and a great deal of inconvenience caused, and that is by the sale of fertiliser in powdered form.  It should be compulsory on manufacturers to offer their fertilisers for sale, whether they be phosphates, potassic manures or nitrogenous manures, in a form so that they can be mixed with more fertilisers and be sown by mechanical means.  We <Col N="1318" /> all know how the manure distributor will clog up when endeavouring to distribute powdered manures.</P>
    <P>In regard to the regulation which compels the manufacturer or seller of those feeding stuffs and fertilisers to give a guarantee in regard to their analysis, I think that guarantee should be in the simplest form, and that, wherever possible, non-technical terms should be used.  I think the Minister indicated in the Dáil that he was sympathetic to that viewpoint.  It is of course, essential in regard to feeding stuffs that not only should that simple form be used, but that there should be a guarantee for the quality of the particular ingredient used.  For example, it is not sufficient to say that a certain compound contains 20 or 40 per cent. of oats; there should also be some indication as to the quality of that particular grain.  There is such a thing as oats and oats.  You can have oats of a quality that is almost useless for feeding stuffs, or you can have oats of first-class quality.</P>
    <P>In regard to oats offered for sale on the market, the quality is ascertained by a number of tests, one of which is bushel weight, but where oats, barley or maize are used in a compound, I think there should be some guarantee given as to the quality.  There is also, as we all know, the question of whether it is whole grain or not.  The offals of oats when put through a hammer mill, particularly if they are blended with meat meal or fish meal or some other ingredient in a compound feeding stuff, may have the appearance of good quality meal, even though they are altogether inferior.  I think it is to safeguard us against those deceptions that this Bill is intended. I therefore commend it and would ask the Minister to give some attention to the suggestions which have been made by me as well as to those made in the discussion of the Bill in Dáil Eireann.  It is a simple measure, but it is nevertheless an important one from the agricultural and national point of view.  It is one in which we would all like, as far as possible, to co-operate with the Minister and with the Department in making it as effective as possible.</P>

      <P>This seems to be eminently a Bill to be welcomed. It is practical and clear, a thing which it is not always possible to say about every Bill.  Its import and intent are quite obvious to the reader, and it seems to be an admirable example of the placing of the community strength and protection at the disposal of the individual.</P>
      <P>Section 2, which gives the gist of the Bill&mdash;the ensuring that the seller of a fertiliser or feeding stuff shall say, according to the specification, what is in it and how much of each element&mdash; is an excellent thing and affords excellent protection.  The same thing applies to fertilisers and feeding stuffs, and it will be particularly valuable in relation to poultry feeding stuffs, upon which, in a certain measure at least, depends the price of eggs.</P>
      <P>I was interested in Senator Cogan's reference to fish meal and to the introduction of red herrings.  It seemed to me that a new principle and a dangerous one might be introduced, if one applied this principle in other fields, in the principle of speech analysis, for instance, the guaranteeing in a Senator's or a Deputy's speech of the red-herring-content percentage, which would have to be marked on the outside.</P>
      <P>But seriously, I should like to say that there is another section which seems to be very useful and which has been carefully framed, Section 10, in relation to the necessity for an authorised officer&mdash;who is given certain powers under this Bill&mdash;to produce his certificate of authorisation before he exercises those powers.</P>
      <P>There is one question I should like to put to the Minister, so as to obtain clarification.  What is the purpose&mdash;it may be a technical one&mdash;of Section 14, the saver for flour milling offals?  In conclusion, I would like to say that this is a Bill to be welcomed and to be put through as expeditiously as possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamOCallaghan" hpid="Mr. O'Callaghan Mr. O'Callaghan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Callaghan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill and any few remarks I have to make <Col N="1320" /> are intended to be helpful.  I agree with Senator Cogan, who advocated putting up manures in one cwt. bags. It is a very important thing and a thing the country would be very pleased to have.  At present manures are put up in two cwt. bags and it involves a good deal of slave labour in handling them.  If they were put up in one cwt. bags the work would be much more pleasant.  The same argument applies to meal and pollard and bran. It would be a step in the right direction if the Minister could do something to help to have manures put up in one cwt. bags and to have feeding stuffs put up also in one cwt. bags or ten stone bags.</P>
      <P>With regard to compound manures, agricultural experts tell us that the manufacturer charges £4 for making up the compound manure and that the farmer, if he bought the elements, could make up the manure at a cost of £1.  I do not understand the pros and cons of this matter&mdash;possibly the Minister understands them better&mdash;and I would be glad to hear if there is any explanation.  It seems to me that £4 for making up a ton weight of manure is excessive.  It may be that I am wrong and that there are good reasons why the price is so high.  There is no doubt at all but the farmer can make it up himself at a cost of about £1. I would be glad to hear the Minister's explanation of the matter and what he thinks of it.</P>
      <P>The producer who supplies milk to a factory is statute bound to supply milk of a certain standard.  Is there anything which compels the creamery to supply him with separated milk or whey of a certain standard?  I am unaware of it and I think there should be some protection in that case.  We have many cases where people grumble when separated milk mixed with a good deal of water is given out to the suppliers or sold to other people.  If that is happening&mdash;and I know it is happening in certain places&mdash;I do not think it should happen, but I doubt if there is any statute or law which compels the producer of creamery milk to have a certain standard.  That is a matter which the Minister should investigate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1321" /> With regard to feeding stuffs, at the present time many people are going out of pig feeding.  They are finding that by feeding pigs on the ration&mdash;the ration which is made up by the manufacturer and sold at a specific price&mdash; they cannot make pigs pay by feeding animals on that ration.  It should be possible for pig feeders to make up a home ration properly balanced at a lesser price, at a price which might leave a profit and thereby save the pig industry.  I would urge the Minister to do a little more publicity than is being done.  Perhaps he could do more in the daily Press and his Department might put up samples of home-made rations for the benefit of the pig producers.</P>
    <P>Calf rearing experiments were carried on in West Limerick in the last few years.  As a result of those experiments, it would not be any exaggeration to say that we could add an extra 50,000 or 100,000 animals to our cattle population.  I have personal experience of rearing calves.  Nobody need lose a calf suffering from white scour at the moment.  I suggest to the Minister that that is not a matter of general knowledge.  I had to look for the results of those experiments and find them out for myself.  It would be a good thing if they got more publicity and if the daily Press were used to publish what is undoubtedly one of the greatest discoveries made in our generation. I leave that to the Minister. I know he is as interested in the livestock population as any other person. I make the suggestion to him and leave it in his hands.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister ought to see that these regulations are so framed that as much information as possible is given to the purchasers of compound fertilisers.  There may be difficulties.  For example, proteins will therefore be specified as one of the ingredients, what type of protein. whether it is fish meal or meat meal. I should like to see that the remainder is composed of maize or barley, or whatever else it is.  Let us put down the carbohydrate content, etc., after it. There will be additions of lime and other items.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another reason why I would like full information to be given is that we have a considerable amount of skimmed milk in the country.  Many people are wont to feed pigs on a balanced ration.  It is a pure waste of money to use proteins when they have adequate skim milk.  I believe that very large numbers, particularly small farmers, feed their pigs on a balanced ration, even when skim milk is available.  That is due to the fact that they have no knowledge.  In the framing of these regulations there is a very wide scope for doing enormous benefit.  It will be one of the objects of the regulations to educate as large a number of people <Col N="1323" /> as possible.  That will be one of the duties, also, of the local committees of agriculture, and the many other organisations.</P>
    <P>Finally, let me say, with regard to the cwt. bags, that I think it would be of great advantage if they were manufactured from paper, because everything could be very legibly printed on them.  Contamination is another evil which the use of paper bags would avoid.  I wish to congratulate the Minister, because I think this Bill will be a step forward.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the Seanad for the reception they have given to this Bill, and I would like to deal, as succinctly as possible, with the specific points raised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the conversion of urban sewage to fertilisers, I find myself in the difficulty that if I hurry forth to do something in the country, a great many of my critics are inclined to say that I want to centralise everything in the Department of Agriculture, and interfere with the discretion of local authorities.  If I sit back and say: &ldquo;I want the municipality of Dublin or Cork to proceed, and the full resources of my Department will be placed at their disposal&rdquo;, my critics will answer: &ldquo;Here you are.  You are doing nothing about it.&rdquo;  What course am I to pursue with safety?  If the Cork or the Dublin municipality comes to the Department of Agriculture and says: &ldquo;Here is a product which we can produce from the sewage of our respective municipalities&rdquo; and gives a reference of its constituents from the Birmingham experience, we will gladly advise them as to what we think of the value of that product as a fertiliser, and how it may be used, and how far we would be prepared to recommend it.  I think that, if nothing other than money is standing between the realisation of such a project and its failure, money could be found.  I should be glad if Senator Hickey could get responsible authorities of the Cork municipality to come forward with a proposal on their behalf so that we might collaborate with them in bringing it to a successful issue, if that is possible.  I <Col N="1324" /> do not want to throw cold water on it, or anything like that, but one does get a little cynical about their high hopes.  There are a great many municipalities in England.  If there is something in the sewage in every one of these municipalties for the relief of the ratepayer, if there is an almost unlimited demand for fertiliser in Great Britain, why does every municipality not batter away at it?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>There is only one municipal bank in England too, and that is in Birmingham.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>If the thing is feasible, I would like to see it fully developed. Certainly, if the municipality of Dublin, or Cork, or any other city, approaches the Department of Agriculture, with concrete proposals which do not put trouble on their inadequate staff and their financial resources, the Department will be most happy to examine them, and to supply any technical advice they can.  The Minister for Agriculture will be prepared to go further, to give advice and to make money available to finance such enterprise, provided its soundness and feasibility are firmly established.</P>
      <P>This Bill makes no provision for the control of the size of bags to be used. Senators will be glad to know that under another Act, which is at present in the process of enactment, if it has not already been enacted, the Tánaiste will have power to make regulations in that regard.  I have already made representations to him that, subject to reasonable precautions as to cost and the like, the maximum size of containers normally used should not exceed 112 lb.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Senator Burke that paper containers have a very obvious advantage.  They are non-returnable and, as he said, any formula which it is desirable to print on them would be very legible.  They are very secure against contamination: they avoid contamination of railway wagons, and other places, because of the fact that they are so strong, secure and are not porous.  But we have always to have regard, in these matters, to their cost. There are certain amenity values which <Col N="1325" /> we can afford, and others which we must forbear.  If the cost will materially add to the cost of the raw materials of the agricultural industry &mdash;because, as I have often submitted to the Seanad before, the farmer's profit consists in a difference between what he gets for his finished product and what he has to pay for the raw materials of his industry&mdash;if you raise the cost of his raw material unduly, not accompanied by a corresponding rise in prices, you may extinguish his profit, with the result that he will cease to produce.</P>
    <P>Senator Sheehy Skeffington asked me what was the purpose of Section 14. The provision is made at the request of the Department of Industry and Commerce.  That Department has asked that the control and manufacture of feeding stuffs by my Department shall not extend to affect the operations of flour mills, or the production of such commodities as bran and pollard.  That provision is made to meet that request, but it leaves intact the powers of the Minister for Agriculture under the Bill to control the use and sale of flour-milling offals as feeding stuffs and their use as ingredients of compound feeding stuffs.</P>
    <P>This provides me with an opportunity of reminding Senators of what is the purpose of the Bill.  The purpose of the Bill is limited.  It is designed to give the Minister power to make regulations to ensure that a farmer will get what he pays for.  If he is in doubt that he is getting less than he paid for in quality or quantity, there are means made available to him readily to have what is delivered to him analysed and tested, so that he can recover from the vendor any short-fall in the quality or quantity of the delivery made to him. It is limited to that scope.</P>
    <P>I have carefully noted the matter referred to by Senator O'Callaghan in regard to the quality of skimmed milk returned by creameries to their suppliers. He asks me if there is any power to control that under this or any other Bill.  It is a bold Minister who will confess freely to a legislative assembly that he does not know.  I do not know, but I rather suspect that, if <Col N="1326" /> such a power were to be made available to the Minister, it would more probably be made available under the Creamery Act, 1924, or one of its amending Acts, rather than under a Bill of this kind, dealing primarily with compound feeding stuffs and fertilisers. I am obliged to the Seanad for their reception of the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Norton) William Norton">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Norton)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill, as set out in the explanatory memorandum which I have circulated, is to confirm ten Orders made by the Government under the Emergency Imposition of Duties Act, 1932.  The commodities covered by the Orders are as follows:&mdash; Welts and welting for footwear; malt extract preparations; quilts and quilt covers; vulcanised rubber for footwear; iron and steel files; artificial silk and union piece goods; rubber solution; buttons and button blanks; woven labels; and electrical accessories.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The customs duties imposed on welts and welting, vulcanised rubber for footwear and electrical accessories are new protective duties.  The firm engaged in the production of welts and welting was unable to develop fully owing to heavy imports.  Welts and welting are used by the footwear industry as strengthening agents in the manufacture of boots and shoes.  In the case of vulcanised rubber for footwear there is a general world tendency to use substitutes for sole leather in the manufacture of footwear.  One group of these substitutes consists of vulcanised rubber including synthetic <Col N="1327" /> rubber and imitations thereof and a limited range of these materials is at present being produced here.  It is expected that the production of a wide range will be undertaken at Cork. With regard to electrical accessories, the production of these goods was commenced some months ago at Carrick-on-Shannon. The particular goods being produced consist of certain types of non-metal tumbler switches, switch-plates, fixing rings, outlet-sockets, outlet-plugs, ceiling roses and bayonet lampholders.</P>
    <P>The Order dealing with malt extract preparations extended the scope of the existing customs duty on malt extract and preparations of malt extract and fish liver oil so as to include other preparations or mixtures which contain malt extract, but excluding any such preparations or mixtures imported in containers containing not more than 16 ounces.  The position in regard to the existing duty was that it did not apply to malt extract or preparations of malt extract and fish liver oil to which any other substance or substances had been added.  The result was that the duty was being evaded by the addition to the imported products of small quantities of other substances such as calcium, iron, etc., and it became necessary to extend the scope of the duty in order to give effective protection to the home industry. Preparations or mixtures containing malt extract imported in containers containing not more than 16 ounces were excluded from the scope of the extended duty in order to permit the free entry of genuine preparations of malt and other medicinal or vitamin substances which are made up in containers of 16 ounces or less.</P>
    <P>A customs duty of 75 per cent., full rate, 50 per cent., preferential rate, <i>ad valorem</i> which was imposed in 1933 on filled quilts and unfilled quilt covers was suspended in 1943 owing to the general scarcity of supplies.  It was decided in October last to restore protection to the home industry, but at a reduced rate of 50 per cent., full, 33? per cent, preferential, <i>ad valorem</i> which, it was considered, should afford adequate protection for the industry.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1328" /> The manufacture of iron and steel hand files was commenced some years ago at Droichead Nua, County Kildare, and the industry was protected by an <i>ad valorem</i> customs duty on competing imported products.  Last year, however, the continued existence of the industry was seriously threatened by intensive competition from strong external interests and it was necessary to increase the degree of protection afforded to the industry.  This was done by the imposition of an additional specific duty on files.</P>
    <P>The Order dealing with artificial silk woven piece goods and union piece goods amalgamated into one duty two separate duties on artificial silk and union piece goods, and at the same time remedied certain defects in the duties which had worked to the detriment of the home manufacturers of damask ticken, interlinings and moquette.  The Order also revoked the suspended customs duties on certain cotton piece goods which have been subject to import quota control for some years past.</P>
    <P>A customs duty which was imposed on rubber solution in 1937 was suspended in 1942 owing to the general scarcity of supplies.  It was decided in November, last, to restore protection to the home industry, but it was necessary to extend the scope of the duty because, in addition to making adhesive solutions from natural rubber, it is now the practice to use also synthetic rubber and latex and the restored duty covers solutions made from these substances as well as from natural rubber.</P>
    <P>When the customs duty on buttons and button blanks was originally imposed in 1936, imitation mother-of-pearl buttons were excluded from the scope of the duty to permit free importation of shell buttons used mainly by the shirt manufacturers. These buttons were not then, and are not now, made here.  In recent years, however, there have been considerable developments in the manufacture of buttons from plastic materials with the result that plastic buttons made to resemble mother-of-pearl were escaping payment of customs duty by qualifying <Col N="1329" /> for the description of &ldquo;imitation mother-of-pearl&rdquo;.  These buttons were being imported in substantial quantities to the serious detriment of the Irish button manufacturers who are in a position to produce all types of plastic buttons.  Consequently it became necessary to recast the exclusion from the duty to ensure that only the shell buttons would be admitted free of duty.</P>
    <P>The Order dealing with woven labels increased the customs duty on these goods from 33? per cent. <i>ad valorem</i> (flat rate) to 60 per cent. (full rate), 40 per cent. (preferential rate&mdash;United Kingdom and Canada) <i>ad valorem.</i> Woven garment labels are being manufactured at Miltown-Malbay, County Clare.  The industry is a new one and the promoters found that no progress could be made towards developing, the industry on a sound basis in the face of severe competition from large scale continental manufacturers.  It was, accordingly, necessary to afford the industry a measure of increased protection. This Bill follows the customary pattern of giving legislative effect to the Orders made from time to time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill, as the Minister pointed out, gives legislative effect to many of the Orders made, but I think the Minister glossed over one or two very important aspects of the proposals in this Bill in relation to their effect on the leather wear industry in this country.  For the past few months a number of employees in the boot and shoe industry have been laid off in our local factories.  We are now making provision for the importation of substitutes for leather materials.  I would like to get an assurance from the Minister that the Orders we are now confirming are not going to seriously affect the employment of people in these industries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The difficulty about these Orders is that they were made over a period and are presented to this House at a very late stage when, in effect, nothing very substantial can be done about them. This is a serious question so far as the employees of the boot and shoe industry <Col N="1330" /> are concerned and I think we should have a more definite statement from the Minister as to whether the number of people he suggests would be employed in the manufacture of the articles mentioned here would be greater than that employed on the raw materials for the boot and shoe industry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OwenSkeffington" hpid="Dr. Sheehy Skeffington Dr. Sheehy Skeffington">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>In speaking on this Bill, I should like to ask certain questions.  I think we all accept the view that a certain amount of State interference on behalf of the manufacturers of this country is legitimate and necessary.  I do not think any of the manufacturers resent that type of State interference.  I personally support it.  I do think, however, that the acceptance by the manufacturers of such State help, assistance, or protection, at the expense of the home consumer, carries with it certain duties. I think the Minister himself will agree that it is his duty and the duty of the Government to see to it that real value is given by manufacturers benefiting by the imposition of these prohibitive duties on imported goods.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister a few questions.  Am I right in assuming that he has the power yearly, or in respect of any interval he likes, to vary these rates of duty; or is it true that, once he has imposed this duty of 50 per cent., 75 per cent. or whatever it may be, he requires new amending legislation to vary it?  While I should like there to be at least two periods, or more, of fairly strong protection for new industries, in order to give them a chance to get started, I would not like to feel that that strong protection which is necessary in the opening years would be frozen, as it were, at that high level.  This might, perhaps, engender a spirit of laziness in the manufacturers who would genuinely require that high level to start with. But they ought not, if they are doing their job, require such high protection in the following years.  I should like to put the question in those terms to the Minister.  Has he got the power to vary these gradually or diminish them after a period of years?  If he has that power &mdash;and I assume he has&mdash;has he thought, in fact, of using it, and of reducing <Col N="1331" /> now, for instance, the high rate of duty which was felt necessary in relation to certain goods when first they came to be manufactured in this country, but which are presumably being so efficiently manufactured to-day in Ireland that they could do with less protection now than when they first started?</P>
    <P>There is another point I should like to mention also in regard to the last item, relating to electrical goods. There is a long list of the type of goods to which this 75 per cent. duty applies.  The last words are &ldquo;and on component parts&rdquo;.  Component parts of what?  Does it mean anything that could be called an electrical component part or does it simply mean component parts of the articles here mentioned?</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Otherwise they will be broken down, come in and be reassembled, thus getting behind the duty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OwenSkeffington" hpid="Dr. Sheehy Skeffington Dr. Sheehy Skeffington">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quite satisfied with that.  As it refers only to component parts of the articles specifically mentioned, it is quite a restricted power.  In relation to that, I should like to ask whether the Minister has power in any of these circumstances to limit the duty on the articles which, perhaps, he thought might some day be manufactured, but are not, in fact, being manufactured, or the manufacture of which has ceased?  Has he the power to ensure that the duty on certain of these articles shall be limited, or, alternatively, has he the power to allow the duty-free import of certain articles under licence by certain people, in the event of the home production not proving adequate?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to some commodities not here mentioned&mdash;I am thinking in particular of the component parts of wireless sets&mdash;I understand that there are component parts of wireless sets which are not manufactured here, and which can only be imported with a high duty on them, or else be acquired by certain licensees who have the right, apparently, to bring them in at a reduced rate or duty free, and to <Col N="1332" /> put them on the market in that way. I was just wondering whether the Minister has this power to allow duty-free import under licence or to reduce the duty in certain circumstances, and, if so, I would like to know how such power is used.</P>
    <P>In relation to the fifth item before us, I notice that the duty is expressed not in terms of a percentage, but as ? full and 1/- preferential rate per article.  There probably is some reason for that.  I would like to know, however, approximately what kind of percentage that represents.  The chances are that it does not represent a very high percentage, but still I should feel happier in judging this document, if I knew approximately what order of magnitude the percentage represents.</P>
    <P>There is another phrase in the same paragraph which says: &ldquo;On certain iron or steel hand files.&rdquo;  I take it that these certain hand files are somewhere defined or specified.  They are not defined in the document before us. but I take it that someone knows.  I do not know of any ordinary member of the public who, on seeing this, would know what particular files had got 1/- or 1/6 duty on them.  I should like to have some clarification of what is meant by that phrase: &ldquo;On certain iron or steel hand files.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I would urge the Minister again to give us some statement about the question I put in the beginning as to whether it is the Government's policy to reduce, gradually, the amount of protection given to home industry, as that home industry visibly gets on its feet and becomes established, and is enabled, behind these protective barriers, to produce more and more economically, and, consequently, is in a position to require less and less protection.</P>

      <P>On this Bill, I would like to take the opportunity of commending the recent action by the Minister along the lines indicated in this Bill.  The House may remember that a certain firm, some months ago, was deprived by Irish manufacturers of essential supplies, and the Minister, unless I am misinformed, remitted the <Col N="1333" /> high tariff on that particular commodity in order to ensure that this firm would receive its supplies.  I do not intend to elaborate on that, but I should like to put it on record that that particular action won very widespread approval.  I should like to take this opportunity of saying so.  It must have taken a good deal of courage to do that, but it is the kind of courage which the ordinary citizen admires in the Minister, and I think we ought to voice our feelings on such a problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Hawkins raised a question as to the effect of one of these duties on leather wear. I take it the Senator had in mind the position which was recently revealed arising out of discussions in the Dáil, and outside, and which centred on the position of the Portlaw tannery I do not know that a discussion in public of the position of the Portlaw tannery would be good from the point of view of that industry, and so I would prefer not to be tempted into a battle of words with the Senator or anybody else, because I still think it is possible to help the industry, once it gets over the present difficulties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But, as the matter has been raised, may I say, in the most remote way possible, what the precise difficulties are?  There was a time when that particular industry had a substantial export market for its leather.  It no longer has that export market for its leather because of the fact that the countries to which it exported leather have now found that the same change in public taste is taking place.  Not only do they not need imported leather but they have found it unnecessary to use the quantity of leather which they could use from their own sources of supply.  That situation has been brought about by the use of synthetic soling.  There has been in almost every country in the world an increase in the use of synthetic soling material. There has been an enormous change in public taste in that respect in England. It is stated that now approximately 37 per cent. of the footwear which is used there to-day is soled with synthetic material, and it is believed that the figure here in respect of synthetic <Col N="1334" /> soled footwear is not far short of that percentage of the total footwear used by our people.</P>
    <P>It has been stated that, in the United States, over 70 per cent. of the footwear is soled with synthetic soling material, and, unfortunately for the leather manufacturers, it has been stated by the footwear manufacturers that the synthetic soling material gives a longer life than the natural leather. The result is that not only have you a change in public taste, so far as synthetic soling is concerned, but, if what is stated is true, you have a footwear which is going to last longer if soled with this synthetic material.</P>
    <P>That is the situation which any alert firm should notice.  I do not think it has been noticed with the same alacrity and alertness here as one would expect.  If these indications, which have been on the horizon for quite a while, had been noticed in time, it might have been possible for that particular industry to have avoided the worst aspects of this impact of change in the public taste.</P>
    <P>In other countries, where it was recognised that this change in public taste was taking place, the leather manufacturers and tanners generally set out to find new uses for leather, set out to make a leather not of the heavy bend type which is not now as popular as it originally was, but set out to split hides and set out to put leather to other and diversified uses. In fact, in Great Britain the leather manufacturers were so alert as to the dangers which threatened them, that they ran leather exhibitions and sent out mobile exhibitions into the cities and towns, in order to popularise the use of leather and to show the uses to which leather could be put.</P>
    <P>The difficulty about the Portlaw tannery&mdash;or the main difficulty, for there are others&mdash;is that it has got in stock a 12 months' supply of heavy bend leather and, until it can liquidate those stocks, it is going to have a pretty rough time.  But when the stocks are liquidated and when they survey the market in the light of the change in public taste and when they begin to think of the alternative uses <Col N="1335" /> to which leather can be put, I feel sure they can rehabilitate themselves and perhaps rehabilitate themselves on a steadier market than that which has been available to them in the recent past.</P>
    <P>What you have to remember in this matter is that it is true that synthetic soling is coming in, that substitute soling is coming in.  First, some of it is coming in by arrangement with the boot and shoe manufacturers free of duty.  In so far as they want to import synthetic soling material over and above the quota which they get in duty free, they have to pay duty on it.  It may be argued that we should not give any duty-free licences at all.  Supposing I take that stand and say: &ldquo;You will get no duty-free licences at all&rdquo;, that will not help Portlaw or any other tannery here.  What will happen is that the boot and shoe manufacturers will pay the duty and having paid the duty they will then proceed to show that the raw material of the boot or shoe is now costing more and they will increase the price of the boot or shoe. If I say to them that they cannot import this substitute material free of duty, all I am asking them to do is to pay an Exchequer tax, as the duty will go into the Exchequer.  If anyone gets satisfaction out of that, they are welcome to it&mdash;but because the duty goes into the Exchequer the person who buys boots and shoes will have to pay more for them.  I see no reason why, in a case like this, I should compel them to pay a rate of duty on all their imports, when the only effect of doing that is not to provide additional employment but to put money into the Exchequer and once they have to pay that money into the Exchequer they will increase the price of boots and shoes.</P>
    <P>I think it is desirable that I should take steps to prevent the price of boots and shoes rising, but that cannot be done by requiring the importers of synthetic soling material to pay duties on these commodities.  In this country, we supply not merely 99 per cent. of our own boot and shoe requirements but we have an export trade which is <Col N="1336" /> worth approximately £500,000 a year. A considerable amount of that export trade is profitable only because the footwear which is imported is soled with this synthetic material and if you keep out this synthetic material then you will lose that export trade valued at £500,000.  Or, if you let in the synthetic soling material by requiring the boot and shoe manufacturers here to pay a duty on it, then you will send up the price of boots and shoes for export and you will cut the Irish boot and shoe factories off from their external markets, as you will price them out of those markets where they have to try to hold on by being extremely competitive in price.</P>
    <P>This is a matter which has to be very delicately balanced.  I am trying to handle it without any doctrinaire approach to the problem.  It is a problem which has to be balanced by weighing the demands of one particular type of industry as against the demands of another and the consumer has to be protected as the overall consideration.</P>
    <P>I do not want to discuss the affairs of Portlaw here.  They have been in difficulty but their difficulties are not insurmountable.  As far as I am concerned, I would be glad to give them every possible assistance to overcome the difficulties which have recently engulfed them, but which I hope have only temporarily engulfed them.</P>
    <P>Senator Sheehy Skeffington raised a point relating to the review of tariffs and certain other related matters. Last year I took the view that we now had tariffs in operation for a sufficiently long period to justify a review of the operation of those tariffs.  I approached the problem, not from the standpoint of desiring to abolish the tariffs but in order to see whether the manufacturer was using those tariffs for the extension of his industry, whether he was aiming at supplying the home market, whether he was endeavouring to build up an export business, whether he was providing the optimum employment, whether he was relying on the tariff to justify the use of outmoded methods of production and out of date machinery.  I asked the Industrial Development Authority to <Col N="1337" /> examine the operation of tariffs in approximately 20 industries.  They are doing that at the moment; some reports have reached me and other reports are on the way and the Industrial Development Authority is continuing that review.</P>
    <P>I have asked them to make that review a searching review, but at the same time to make it in an understanding context, so that the aim will be rather to step up production, to supply a wider market, to try to get markets abroad, to modernise the industry as much as possible, to get in new machinery and generally to take the view that the firm should be told that it should approach this whole problem with a view to regarding tariffs not as a permanent crutch on which they must rest for the rest of their lives, but as something to aid the industry for a reasonable period, in the hope that it will so organise itself that it will not have to depend on adventitious aids of this kind and that the overall consideration will be maximum production, the widest possible measure of employment and a reasonable service to the community, at prices within the ability of the consumers to pay.  The Industrial Development Authority is engaged on that task at the moment and its reports reach me from time to time.</P>
    <P>I would like to mention, however, to Senator Sheehy Skeffington&mdash;and perhaps other Senators would be interested in the matter as well&mdash;that, while it is true that we impose tariffs of 50 or 75 per cent., that does not mean at all that the Irish manufacturer finds it necessary to charge these percentages over the imported article.  Manufacturers of articles which are made here find it necessary to charge perhaps 2, 3, 5 or 7½ per cent. over the imported article and that imported article may come from a highly mechanised industry which has a long tradition of that particular class of goods.  The fact that these tariffs of 50 and 75 per cent. are imposed is not to give the Irish manufacturer the right to charge these percentages on top of the British landed cost here.  In the main, it is for the purpose of giving <Col N="1338" /> the Irish manufacturer the market, as many of the exporters to this country could not compete here against these high tariffs because the import price plus the tariff could not possibly compete with the cost of production of the Irish manufacturer.</P>
    <P>In many cases it is necessary to impose a very high tariff to give the Irish manufacturer the market.  That is particularly so in the case of files, which are manufactured by Sandersons at Droichead Nua.  Various efforts were made over a number of years to assist that firm against what might be described as the insidious attempts by substantial interests outside to undermine the firm's position here.</P>
    <P>It is the only industry in this country which makes files and nobody would attempt to deny that we ought to have one file factory in Ireland. This firm was assisted in the first instance by a tariff.  The tariff was put on files so many inches long, but the moment you put on a tariff like that, an outside industry can come along and make a file shorter by about 1/16th of an inch and get the file in free of duty, as the firm is able to produce a file of 1/16th of an inch shorter in order to get over the tariff.  The cross-Channel interests also proceeded to allow substantial discounts to importers here, which they did not allow to their customers on their own market.  That was done for the purpose of appealing to the understandable cupidity of traders who said: &ldquo;Here is an Irish file on which the profit will be 15 per cent.  I have got an English file which will provide a profit of 25 per cent.  The Irish firm will require cash in one month and the cross-Channel firm will say: &lsquo;You can have three months.&rdquo;  It is hard to blame a trader while he gets 25 per cent. profit instead of 15 per cent. and three months&rsquo; credit instead of one month.</P>
    <P>Of course, you could not possibly sell Irish produced files against competition of this kind.  In getting over that difficulty it was found necessary to impose these substantial duties on particular files.  I agree that in relation to the low-priced Irish file this represented <Col N="1339" /> a very substantial tariff, but it had the effect of giving Sandersons of Newbridge virtually the entire market. In fact, I think they have the entire market at the moment.  Although they got these tariffs, we got from them, as we endeavour to do in other cases, an assurance that they would not increase the price of the Irish files if the tariff was increased.  We have always made it clear to these firms, particularly when we impose a tariff, that we expect them, when they get the market, not only not to increase their prices, but to bring their prices down in consideration of the fact that by getting the market, they have accordingly reduced their overhead expenses.</P>
    <P>In reply to Senator Sheehy Skeffington, the granting of duty-free licences occurs where the industries, assisted by tariffs, cannot produce the commodities which are required or where they are not yet in production to produce the commodities which it was originally intended to protect by the imposition of tariffs.  So far as my Department is concerned, I have personally seen cases in my experience where it is clear that the Irish firm is not making a commodity which the customer requires and that no satisfactory substitute is available, and duty-free licences to import the commodities have been freely given.  That is the only sensible way in which you can approach a problem of that kind. It has got to be dealt with on its merits but there is no inflexibility so far as my Department is concerned.  I think that I have now answered all the points which Senators raised in the course of the discussion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OwenSkeffington" hpid="Dr. Sheehy Skeffington Dr. Sheehy Skeffington">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>What percentage of turnover does ? on a file represent?  The Minister stated that it was substantial.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a varying percentage. If the file is imported, say, a 4&rdquo; file without a handle&mdash;that is the usual case&mdash;the price of that file might be 9d. on importation.  In a case like this, where the minimum duty is ?, it is easy to see that the duty in that case is nearly 200 per cent.  But at the <Col N="1340" /> same time, when this ? duty was imposed we got from Sandersons an assurance that the prices at which they were manufacturing and which were protected by an <i>ad valorem</i> tariff would not be increased if we gave them a substantial tariff on the files.  If the files were imported at l/-, a minimum duty of ? would give 150 per cent.  If the files were imported at ? and the minimum duty was ? it would give 100 per cent.  If the files were imported at 3/- a duty of ? would represent 50 per cent.  It depends on the size of the file and the price.</P>
      <P>Senator Sheehy Skeffington asked one question which I do not think I answered and that was the type of files covered by this.  Duties which have been imposed do not apply to files such as nail files, horse rasps, shoemakers' rasps, or wood rasps, or a whole bundle of files used for complicated technical processes, such as magneto files, dental files, woodworkers' files, cabinet files, and pitsaw or framed files.  These are not the types of files covered by this and consequently they are excluded from the scope of the duty or if they have been accidentally caught they are covered by duty-free licences freely given.</P>

      <P>In relation to one of the answers given by the Minister regarding the licences granted to some people to introduce certain of these commodities duty free, for the reason of their not being available in sufficient quantities or not being, in fact, manufactured despite the Minister's hopes, would it not be better, in cases like that, simply to abolish the duty?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator is pushing an open door there.  I have come across cases where the duty was imposed in the first instance in the belief that this was going to lead to a substantial measure of employment and production here, but the early hopes of the promoters of the industry, for one reason or another, were not realised with the result that perhaps a high tariff was in operation in respect of an industry which was employing a very small number of people.  In cases like this, already we have abolished <Col N="1341" /> the tariff entirely because the volume of employment did not justify the continuance of the tariff having regard to the amount of duty that the consumer here had to pay.</P>

    <Title>Factories Bill, 1954&mdash;Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Norton) William Norton">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Norton)</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Second Reading of this Bill in the Dáil I stated that the text of the Bill as introduced was identical with the text of the Bill which was introduced in 1953 by my predecessor in office and which had received a Second Reading before the Dáil was dissolved.  I explained that I had kept to the same text as being the best way of making progress towards the speedy enactment of this Bill.  Members of the last Oireachtas had studied the earlier text; they had made themselves familiar with its various provisions and they were ready to air their views on the merits and shortcomings of the Bill as it then stood.  There were obvious advantages to all concerned in taking as the starting point for this Bill, the point at which the discussion of the 1953 Bill was abandoned.  These advantages extended also to those organisations of workers and employers who had made themselves familiar with the 1953 proposals.</P>
      <P>When circulating the text of the Bill I had certain amendments in mind and these I put before the Special Committee to which the Bill was referred by the Dáil.  The Dáil approved the amendments proposed by the Special Committee.  Some further amendments were made on the Report Stage.</P>
      <P>I think that I should refer here to two of those amendments as they introduce something new to factory laws in these islands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first of these is the provision for <Col N="1342" /> the establishment of safety committees within factories.  If Senators examine Section 73 of the text before them, they will see that there is little or no element of compulsion in what is provided.  All the law is doing is to give that necessary bit of status to what will, I hope, be freely formed and smoothly functioning bodies.  The other amendment to which I refer is the insertion in the Bill of Section 127 which provides for the establishment of an advisory council.  In a sense this provision is the complement of the provision about safety committees. The safety committee gives the worker in the factory a certain voice in safety matters at factory level; the advisory council gives organisations of employers and workers a voice in the general administration of safety laws at national level.</P>
    <P>I think that it would be helpful to our discussion if I were to devote a little time to giving a general explanation of the purposes and aims of the Bill.  Among the enactments taken over by the Irish Government from the British administration was a large body of legislation dealing with the health, safety and welfare of industrial workers.  This body of legislation is known commonly by the general name, &ldquo;The Factories Acts&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Ideas of what were healthy and comfortable working conditions are gradually changing, and as a consequence different portions of the Factories Acts have become out-of-date.  The Conditions of Employment Act, 1936, repealed and re-enacted with extensive modifications those parts of the Factories Acts which settled the hours which workers might be employed.  It left undisturbed those provisions which dealt with working conditions in factories. These latter provisions are those which will be amended by this Bill.</P>
    <P>The main enactment dealing with working conditions in factories at present is the Factory and Workshop Act, 1901.  That Act has been amended and extended by a number of Acts, which are listed in Schedule 1 of the Bill.  Part of the purpose of the Bill is to consolidate in one measure all <Col N="1343" /> that the law has to say on the subject of working conditions in factories. An adequate summary of the law, as it now stands, is contained in the explanatory memorandum which was circulated with the Bill as introduced.</P>
    <P>I think the best way of giving a picture of how the law would stand after the passage of the Bill is for me to take the Bill part by part and highlight the changes which the Bill introduces. Part I contains the normal sections relating to commencement, definitions, expenses, etc.  &ldquo;Factory&rdquo; is defined in Section 3.  Existing law makes a distinction between textile factory, non-textile factory, workshop and men's workshop.  This distinction had a certain relevance to the control of working hours of women and young persons-a control now transferred to the Conditions of Employment Act&mdash; and also led to different treatment for different classes of workplaces.  The distinction is gone in this Bill.</P>
    <P>It is to be noted that the definition of &ldquo;factory&rdquo; in Section 3 is not relied upon in applying the law to such places as docks, building works, etc.  These places are given separate treatment in Part VIII.  I will come to them later.</P>
    <P>Part II contains the precautions to be taken as standard at all factories for safeguarding the health of workers. Extra precautions for certain places are prescribed elsewhere in the Bill. As compared with the existing law, the provisions as to cleanliness are made more precise and are written in greater detail; the space requirements for each worker is increased from 250 to 400 cubic feet; a figure for temperature of work-rooms is mentioned, and an obligation to provide proper lighting is added.  Special mention may be made of the new provision in Section 20 giving power to the Minister to require the medical supervision of a factory.</P>
    <P>It is to be noted in relation to this part that one effect of the Bill will be to transfer from the local authority to the Minister the duty of enforcing the health provisions in workshops.</P>
    <P>Part III of the Bill deals with the safety of machinery and premises.  The <Col N="1344" /> earlier sections in this part relate to the important subjects of the fencing of machinery.  Here the law will be tightened up and extended somewhat. For instance, not only must the dangerous parts of a machine be fenced but articles being processed on a machine must also be fenced, if their motion constitutes a danger to the worker.</P>
    <P>In this Part of the Bill in particular will be noted considerable extensions of existing law.  Some of the provisions are completely new, as, for example, the sections requiring the proper training and supervision of persons working dangerous machines, requiring precautions to be taken against explosive atmospheres, requiring for air and for steam receivers safeguards comparable with those required for steam boilers and requiring the institution of special safety arrangements in factories where the accident history is bad.  Other sections in this Part have the effect of extending to factories generally provisions at present applying only, under regulations, to limited classes of factories. In this category would be Sections 34 and 35, dealing with lifting apparatus of all kinds.  Yet other sections in this Part cover the same ground as existing law but incorporate extensions of one kind or another. The sections dealing with fire precautions are applied to factories with fewer workers than before.</P>
    <P>The main effect of Part IV of the Bill is to make universal the duty of providing drinking water, washing facilities, etc.  At present this duty rests only on the occupiers of certain types of factories mentioned in regulations.</P>
    <P>Part V treats of special additional precautions to be taken in factories of certain kinds.  Many of the sections are taken from existing law, including the power to make special regulations requiring occupiers of premises where trades are carried on which are particularly dangerous to the health or safety of the workers to take such additional precautions for their safety and welfare as may be prescribed.  The sections about protection against injury to eyes, about lifting weights and about taking samples are new. <Col N="1345" /> New also is the control which can be exercised over underground or basement factories.  Underground bake-houses have been tolerated for a long time, but they must go within three years of the start of the new law.  This part contains the section about safety committees to which I have already referred.</P>
    <P>There is no great change made by Part VI which relates to the notification and investigation of accidents and occurrences of industrial diseases. The existing title of &ldquo;certifying surgeon&rdquo; becomes &ldquo;certifying doctor.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Part VII introduces a noteworthy change in the protection of youth in industry.  After the Bill becomes law no young person under 18 can take up industrial employment unless he has been certified fit for his employment by the official doctor.  After his entry he must be re-examined by a doctor each year until he reaches 18 years.  At present only those under 16 need be examined on entry and there is no provision about annual re-examination.</P>
    <P>The provisions contained in Part VIII appear to be very elaborate but they deal with two difficult subjects, viz: (a) premises where there is more than one factory, or premises where only part is used as a factory, and (b) places where industrial activity is carried on but which not being factories in the ordinary sense and not having defined and limited premises cannot be expected to conform to all the rules applicable to factories proper. Sections 81 and 82 deal with the first subject by setting out which of the Bill's obligations fall to be discharged by the occupier of the factory premises and which by the owner of the building in which the factory is located.  In remaining sections is set out the extent to which the various provisions of the Bill will apply to electrical stations, institution docks, wharves, quays, warehouses, ships in dock, building operation and works of engineering construction.  The application of any factory law to works of engineering construction is entirely new.  The application to the other activities represents a considerable extension of the present scope of <Col N="1346" /> application, particularly in the case of the building industry.</P>
    <P>Part IX repeats with some slight modifications the existing controls on outwork.  An existing ban on giving out work to places where there is infectious disease is not repeated in the Bill as it is no longer necessary here in view of other provisions in modern public health law.</P>
    <P>Part X contains the necessary provision about the appointment and powers of inspectors and of certifying doctors and the powers and expenses of officers of the sanitary authority.  In relation to the sanitary authority I should mention that it will have the direct duty of enforcing the provisions in the Bill relating to sanitary conveniences and fire precautions, but the Minister for Industry and Commerce can step in to ensure enforcement should the sanitary authority fail to discharge its obligations.  The same duty of enforcement rests on the sanitary authority at present, but a duty which they had in relation to the cleanliness, etc., of workshops will be taken over by the Minister.  I have mentioned already that basement bakehouses must cease to exist after three years.  At present they can carry on with the approval of the sanitary authority.</P>
    <P>I do not think that Part XI calls for comment beyond mentioning that prosecutions will be taken at the suit of the Minister.  Under existing law they can be taken at the suit of an inspector, but it is more in keeping with Irish practice to have all these things done in the name of a Minister of State rather than in the name of an official.  In any event it represents no change from the current administrative practice.</P>
    <P>Part XII confirms that the Factories Acts will apply to factories belonging to the State as well as to factories in private ownership.</P>
    <P>The last Part&mdash;Part XIII&mdash;repeats from existing law the obligation which rests on factory occupiers of giving notice of their occupation of premises, of posting up an extract of the law, etc.  Section 125 is interesting in that it imposes on employed persons a legal <Col N="1347" /> duty of using, and not abusing, the safety and health arrangements which their employers are compelled to make for them.  The Factory Acts will no longer have any application to quarries.  A separate measure is being prepared to provide for the safety, health and welfare of quarry workers, but in case there should be any hitch in enacting such law power is taken in Section 128 of applying to quarries the protective measures of existing mining Acts.</P>
    <P>In preparing the Bill a close examination was made of relevant conventions and recommendations adopted by the International Labour Office and of recommendations contained in the report of the Commission on Youth Unemployment.  I am hopeful that the passage of the Bill will enable Ireland to make a still better showing in the international field by enabling her to show compliance with some further chapters of the international code of regulations promulgated by the International Labour Office.  With regard to the Commission on Youth Unemployment I find that with the enactment of the Bill we will have gone a long way towards adopting the recommendations made by that commission on such matters relating to working conditions as are relevant to a Bill of this kind.</P>
    <P>Senators will be aware that, after the Second Reading, the Dáil referred this Bill to a Special Committee representative of all Parties in the House. The Bill received a very close examination by the Special Committee, and during the course of their meetings the Committee considered a large number of amendments submitted by different members.  The Bill which emerged from the Committee reflected the extent of the detailed study given to it and incorporated various amendments which had commended themselves to the Committee as a whole.  During the discussions in the Committee many fresh viewpoints were put forward and following consideration of these I moved some further amendments on the Report Stage.  All these amendments are incorporated in the Bill now before the Seanad.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1348" /> I should perhaps mention that as a result of further points raised on the concluding Stages of the Bill in the Dáil I will have one or two further minor amendments to move on the Committee Stage in this House.  The amendments which I propose to table relate to:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(1)  The precautions to be taken against fire hazards in a factory which is accommodated in premises which are used also as a dwelling-house;</P>
    <P>(2)  a revised provision regarding the type of building operation or work of engineering construction which must be notified to the Minister; and</P>
    <P>(3)  provision for prior consultation with the Minister for Health (because he administers the Food Hygiene Regulations) before a certificate is issued exempting a basement bakehouse from the provisions of Section 65 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>I am hopeful that after the thorough examination to which the Bill has already been subjected, and the number of amendments already adopted, Senators may find that little or no further amendment will be necessary and that there will emerge from the Oireachtas an Act which will go a long way towards satisfying all interests.</P>
    <P>There is just one other point to which I should refer.  I know that many feel that something should be done to give protection to office workers in the matter of the cleanliness, temperature, lighting and general safety of places where they work, and it has been urged that this protection could be given them by a simple extension of the Factories Bill to office premises.  I have gone into the matter very thoroughly and I am satisfied that this Bill is not the appropriate vehicle for legislating for office workers.  I am, however, convinced that the time for remedial action in this respect is long overdue and I have directed that a speedy examination be made as to the type of protection which should be afforded to office workers and as to the statutory provisions which would be <Col N="1349" /> necessary to give that protection.  I shall, of course, welcome and undertake to consider carefully any suggestions under this heading which Senators or other interested parties may wish to submit to my Department. I would suggest, therefore, that our present discussion should be limited strictly to matters affecting the welfare and protection of factory workers and I am satisfied that this is the best way of making solid progress towards a rapid solution of both problems</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Firstly, I should like to welcome this measure because I see in it a determined attempt to bring factory legislation in this country up to the standard at which it is in progressive countries to-day.  I wish to congratulate the Minister on the statement he made and on the work he put into this measure.  Also, I think it is our duty to congratulate the former Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy Lemass, for the comprehensive way <Col N="1350" /> in which he tackled this problem of factory legislation.</P>
    <P>As the Minister stated in the House, this Bill has been in progress since 1953.  It had to be reintroduced because of the change of Government.  During all that period no doubt the measure got a very detailed examination.  It was deemed advisable to refer the Bill to a Special Committee of the Dáil and I must say that that Special Committee of the Dáil did very commendable work.  The reports they issued from time to time, as they made progress with the consideration of the provisions of the measure, were very enlightening and very constructive indeed.</P>
    <P>I think the new amendment that the Minister referred to, namely provision for the establishment of safety committees in factories under section 73, is a very advisable one.  No doubt those committees will be on the spot to watch developments, to anticipate the requirements of the factories and to make an on-the-spot report of accidents as they may occur from time to time and to report, I suppose, on the various alterations that may be necessary in the working of the particular factories to which these special safety committees will be assigned.</P>
    <P>Although that is an innovation in this country, it is not such in other countries.  I understand that in countries such as Britain and America committees like these have been functioning. No doubt it is a good and useful thing for us to take stock of what they have been doing in those countries and if we think it advisable to pattern our legislation on what they have been doing.  Of course, America and Britain have a long tradition of industrialisation behind them and there are many useful things that we can learn from those countries in the matter of factory legislation.</P>
    <P>We in this country are comparatively young in regard to the industrialisation of our country, and I suppose we yet have many things to learn.  At the same time, it can be truthfully said that we have made great strides over the past 20 or 25 years.  We have made strides, not only in turning out industrial <Col N="1351" /> products in this country but also in providing industrial buildings here that can compare favourably with those in other countries.  So well have many of these factories been equipped to cope with the requirements of modern times that the provisions enshrined in this measure will not be found irksome or burdensome to the people who control those factories.  I would even go so far as to say that in some cases it would hardly be necessary at all to make any regulations to control the conduct of their business.</P>
    <P>There is one thing that we have to bear in mind and that is the satisfaction of our people who are employed in factories.  It is important that healthy conditions should obtain for the workers employed in our factories because to my mind the healthier the conditions are in the factories, the better the operatives will be able to cope with their work and the more work they will be able to turn out. Satisfaction and contentment of mind in these cases are always better than to have people dissatisfied or discontented. The operation of a measure of this kind will, as I have said, be of economic advantage to the country as a whole by reason of the fact that, when the workers employed in our factories find that we are taking such an interest in other welfare by providing good hygienic conditions of working for them, they will be likely to turn out better work.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see that steps are being taken to ensure that no person under the age of 18 will be taken on for industrial work without a certificate.  If That is, I think, as it should be, because there might be a tendency in some cases to employ young people, maybe at a rate of wages that would not be commensurate with the importance of the work they were doing.</P>
    <P>This is a very comprehensive measure.  It contains, I thing, 128 sections.  It is a highly technical measure, and I do not think it would be useful, as the Minister has Suggested, to make anything like a long speech on it.  It is more of a Committee measure.  No doubt, we will require <Col N="1352" /> some little time to consider possible amendments, that is if, after the very careful and detailed consideration which was given to the Bill in the other House, there will be any room for new amendments.  I would venture to say, comprehensive though the measure may be, that in the light of experience, and with the further development of our industrial arm, it will be found, with the passage of time, that amending legislation will have to be brought in to suit the changing conditions in this modern world.  Of courses all we can do at present is to meet the situation which presents itself to us as best we can.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to office workers.  There is no provision in this measure to cope with their position, although I think that if it had been considered in time there would be nothing to prevent having their position examined in this Bill.  The Minister has given us to understand that further legislation will be necessary.  The difficulty about that of course is that there is so much legislation nowadays that one has to wait before an undertaking of that kind can be fulfilled.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would say that it will be gratifying for the people engaged in industrial employment in our cities and towns to know and realise that the people of the country are taking an interest in their welfare, and that it is to be expected in future there will be co-operation between the cities and the country in matters of this kind. There is nothing like co-operation.  It brings about good results.  We hope that if it is necessary to promote legislation for the people living in the rural parts of Ireland, legislation say that would be in keeping with this as regards their welfare, the people living in the towns and cities will have no hesitation in coming to their rescue.</P>
    <P>Again, I welcome this measure.  A good deal of thought has been given to it and a good deal of hard work has been put in to it, and I hope that the provisions enshrined in it will be found to work satisfactorily and well.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the view of Senator Kissane in that I welcome this <Col N="1353" /> Bill.  I agree with the Minister that the consolidation of factory regulations was long overdue.  I am glad that the Minister in introducing the Bill in the Dáil more or less confined himself to the text of the 1953 Bill which had been introduced by the previous Government.</P>
      <P>The Minister mentioned that the Bill had been considered by a Special Comimittee of Dáil Éireann, and that a full report of the deliberations of that Special Committee has been available to the members of this House for some considerable time.  I do not think it would be desirable or necessary for this House, in its consideration of this Bill, to set up another Special Committee to examine it, but I do feel that when a Special Committee of that kind is set up by Dáil Éireann, opportunities should be provided for members of the Seanad to attend it and, where they have expert knowledge, to put it before the Committee.  I feel also that in the case of the proceedings of Special Committees, when they are dealing with specialised Bills such as this, members of the outside public should have an opportunity of seeing the deliberations and of making recommendations or submissions before the Special Committee reports back to the Dáil.</P>
      <P>The Bill as introduced was available to outside organisations, both of labour and manufacturers, but the amendments as proposed in the Dáil, and the reports of the Special Committee, do not in many cases reach these bodies until it is too late for them to put their submissions to the Minister.  The amendments which were introduced on the Report Stage in the Dáil did not, in fact, reach the organisations of manufacturers, at least two organisations of which I know, until the Bill had, in fact, passed through the Dáil.  I feel that is a rather unsatisfactory method of legislating.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Generally speaking, as a manufacturer I very much welcome this Bill. As I said earlier, it was long overdue. I have tried to examine it in the light of what I believe is its major principle, that is to secure an improvement in the conditions of work and in the safety and health of these employed in <Col N="1354" /> our factories.  In the course of the comments which I propose to make, I am going to ask the Minister to consider whether the particular sections of the Bill with which I wish to deal do, in fact, achieve the objects which I think are the basis of the Bill.</P>
    <P>In the Dáil, in referring to the definitions and general interpretations of the Bill the Minister dealt with the definition of a tenement factory. I do not like the word &ldquo;tenement&rdquo; in this particular sense and would far sooner see the substitution of the words &ldquo;multiple factory&rdquo;.  In the speech in the Dáil he said he did not like the word &ldquo;tenement&rdquo; either and would look into the section to see whether the word in this and subsequent sections could be amended to read &ldquo;multiple factory&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The word &ldquo;tenement&rdquo; has a completely different meaning in the eyes of the general public from what it has in fact in this Bill and that is one of the reasons why I would like the Minister to consider again the possibility of changing that word.  Apparently, the definition &ldquo;tenement&rdquo; has been in use in factory legislation for over 50 years and it has a legal significance, but that is no reason why the Minister could not in this particular Bill change that definition and the meaning of the word &ldquo;tenement&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In Section 14 of the Bill, the section which deals with lighting, in the original Bill the Minister had a sub-section which provided:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(3) Nothing in sub-section (1) or (2) of this section or in any regulations made under sub-section (2) of this section shall be construed as enabling directions to be prescribed or otherwise given as to whether any artificial lighting is to be produced by any particular illuminant.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In the special Committee the feeling was expressed that there were certain types of lighting, in particular neon lighting, which could be injurious to health and it was felt that the Minister should have power to prescribe the particular form of lighting.  I accept the arguments put before the Special <Col N="1355" /> Committee, but at the same time I feel that the Minister should not be placed in the position that he could prescribe the particular form of lighting or a particular manufacturer's article to be used in lighting a factory or other building.</P>
    <P>I certainly would; welcome a section of a Bill which would enable the Minister, to have some alteration made in the lighting of this House, because certainly since I have come in here I have found it exceedingly trying on the eyes.  If anything to alter that could be put into the Factories Bill, I would welcome it.  I would suggest to the Minister that he should find an alternative to that original sub-section which would get over the difficulty expressed by the Special Committee but, at the same time, put the Minister in a position where he would not have to specify any particular form of illuminant.</P>
    <P>Sections 15 and 16 deal with the drainage of floors.  I have no criticism of these sections as such, but there is a difficulty in the case of bleach houses or dye houses where water can be drained off the floor without difficulty but it is almost impossible to prevent the floors from remaining wet and damp.  In a number of bleach houses and dye houses I know of, clogs are provided for the workers and I think that is adequate protection.  I would like an assurance from the Minister that this clause on drainage would enable exceptions to be made in the case of bleach houses and dye houses or other factories where similar conditions may exist.</P>
    <P>A slippery floor is mentioned in Section 16 and it is not very clear.  The section says:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Where any process is carried on which renders the floor liable to cause persons employed to slip, effective means shall be provided and maintained for protecting the persons employed from slipping.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I do not know which comes first, the slipping or the prevention of the slipping, but that is only a matter of the wording of the section.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1356" /> On page 18 of the Bill, under the construction of machinery, I am not entirely clear what Section 28 is meant to provide.  In the case of textile factories it might be very difficult to carry out what I believe is the meaning of this section in relation to looms and particularly to looms of the old type. It has been pointed out to me that with the high-speed shuttle, it is quite a impossible to provide complete protection for either the worker or anyone else who might be passing a loom.  I think some part of this section should provide that the Minister could vary the regulations in exceptional circumstances. Possibly the Minister would consider adding an additional paragraph to Section 28 to give him that power, if in fact it is not provided elsewhere in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 32, which deals with the training and supervision of persons working on dangerous machines, is a section which I do not understand: but I have been asked by a number of interested outside persons to ask the Minister if he would clarify the exact meaning of sub-section (3) (b) and (c), in which he says that any reference to a working machine shall</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(b)  in the case of a steam receiver, be construed as including a reference to working in connection with the use of steam in that receiver, and</P>
    <P>(c)  in the case of an air receiver, be construed as including a reference to working in connection with the use of compressed air in that receiver.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Certain manufacturers are not quite clear as to what is meant to be conveyed by the words &ldquo;in connection with the use of&rdquo;.  Perhaps the Minister would clarify this on the Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>On page 36, which deals with the supply of drinking water, sub-section (5)  of Section 52 says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Except where the water is delivered in an upward jet from which the employed persons can conveniently drink, one or more suitable cups or drinking vessels shall be provided at each point of supply with facilities for rinsing them in drinking water.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1357" /> In theory that sounds a good section and as far as factories are concerned I think it is most desirable that a container which provides water with an upward jet should be provided where-ever possible, but there are occasions in factories where there may not be sufficient pressure of water available or there may be other circumstances where that cannot be provided.  I have found in practice that, where two or more drinking vessels are made available for the workers, they are not inclined to rinse them out afterwards. From a health point of view it is not desirable to keep that section in the Bill as at present worded.  If it is not possible to provide water delivered by an upward jet, the workers themselves should provide their own drinking vessels.  On page 37, Section 56 deals with first aid.  In general this is a very desirable section, but in sub-section (6) It states:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;If an ambulance room is provided at the factory and such arrangements are made as to ensure the immediate treatment there of all injuries occurring in the factory, the Minister may by certificate exempt the factory from the requirements. of this section to such extent and subject to such conditions as he may specify in the certificate.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In many factories to-day there are first-aid rooms available where there is in practically every case a welfare officer in continuous attendance.  I feel that the use of the word &ldquo;ambulance&rdquo; there is a restriction on the value of the whole section and I suggest to the Minister that sub-section (6) might be worded so as to describe it as a first-aid room rather than an ambulance room.</P>
    <P>I think that where a welfare officer or other trained personnel are continuously in attendance at a first-aid room, or health room, it should completely comply with the requirements of that particular section.</P>
    <P>On page 39, Section 61, there is a section which deals with shuttlethreading by mouth suction.  This is a most desirable section, and is merely following the British regulations in that regard.  New types of shuttles are now, I think, generally available to all <Col N="1358" /> manufacturers.  I presume that, in this section, the Minister intends to allow adequate time for the change over to the new type of shuttles.  I would like to go even further than the Minister, and ask him whether he would consider consulting with the textile manufacturers to see whether or not he should put an actual time limit on the period before this new type of shuttle is put on I agree that the section is most desirable, and that this unplearsant method of threading shuttles by mouth suction should be abolished as soon as possible.  Section 61 also, provides that of such regulations may impose duties on persons employed as well as on occupiers.&rdquo;  It seems to me that this is the spirit which should prevail through the whole Bill, which I said earlier is designed to make better provision for the safety and welfare of industrial workers.</P>
    <P>In Section 73, page 44, to which the Minister referred in the course of his opening remarks, I feel that he has departed from the spirit which is so well expressed in Section 61.  As I see it, he is providing for the establishment of a committee which is supposed to be more effective, but which could, if I may use the words which the Minister used in the Dáil, turn out to be &ldquo;a nagging, knocking committee, if I may so describe it, and more a source of irritation than of the promotion of better health and safety.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I am quite satisfied that, as long as the present Minister is in office, he will endeavour to see that the committee set up under the proposed section will be a co-operative committee.  We are legislating, not just for the present, but for the future, and I can well visualise a situation such as arose in Czechoslovakia or Italy, where a safety committee such as the one proposed by the present section, could become a sabotage committee, pure and simple.  It was, I think, to guard against such eventualities which might arise under some other form of government, that Deputies Dockrell and Belton tabled their amendments, under this section, on the Report Stage, in the Dáil.  I think the purpose of each of the amendments was that they would give the safety committee quite <Col N="1359" /> a different line of approach to the whole problem, and from an angle which was thought was rather onesided. I think the section as it stands, is far more one sided than it would be if a number of Deputy Dockrell amendments had been added.</P>
    <P>I think that the following amendments, as tabled by Deputies Dockrell and Belton on the Report Stage would bring this section into line with the spirit of the whole Bill.  I would ask the Minister to reconsider the following amendments, which were proposed in the Dáil on the Report Stage by these Deputies:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;To delete lines 6 to 10, Paragraph (a) of Section 73, and substitute the following.</P>
    <P>(a)  It shall be the duty of the safety committee to assist the occupier of the factory in securing compliance by the persons employed therein with the provisions of this Act and of the Orders and regulations made under this Act.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I feel this paragraph is giving more power to the safety committee which, remember, is composed of workers.  It is giving them more power to see that not only the occupier of the factory, but their fellow workers, endeavour to comply with the safety and health regulations, as envisaged under this Bill.  I feel that, instead of weakening the safety Committee, we have given strength to these safety committee.</P>
    <P>The second amendment proposed in the Dáil which I would commend to the Minister is:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Before paragraph (b) of sub-section (1) of proposed new section to insert a new paragraph as follows&mdash;</P>
    <P>(b) The safety committee, or safety delegate, shall inform the occupier and the inspector of any failure of which they have become aware by workers employed in the factory, to comply with this Act, or with Orders and regulations made under this Act.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If we are to have a safety committee working under this Act in the average factory I would like to feel that they <Col N="1360" /> were taking the responsibility, along with the employer, of seeing that the regulations are, in fact, complied with. I feel that this sub-section would help that committee to carry out its duties.</P>
    <P>The third amendment proposed in the Dáil which I would again commend to the Minister is to amend paragraph (e) of sub-section (1) of Section 73:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The safety committee shall consider any representation made to it by the occupier on matters affecting the safety and health of the persons employed.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It was suggested in the Dáil that the word &ldquo;consider&rdquo; should be omitted and &ldquo;take all possible steps to secure compliance with&rdquo; substituted.  The paragraph would then read:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The safety committee shall take all possible steps to secure compliance with any representations made to it by the occupier to matters effecting the safety and health of the persons employed.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>As an employer one of the difficulties I have found in the past was getting my workers to comply with the safety regulations laid down by law to ensure their own safety on particular machines.  I often found that a guard had been removed from a pulley, because they said that it impeded their efficiency.  If the guard was going to ensure, the safety of the workers, it was essential that the work should be impeded.  It is not possible for an employer to be continually in one place, and I think it would be desirable for the safety committee to reprimand their fellow workers of and help the employer to see that the section was complied with.</P>

      <P>It is a matter for the Senator himself as to what course he should take.

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>My only difficulty, was that I would not have to put down amendments unless I felt they were acceptable to the Minister.  I hope to get his guidance this evening.  May I deal then with one other paragraph in this regard&mdash;paragraph (f)?  Once again, I would have preferred the amendment as suggested by Deputy Dockrell in the Dáil.  If the Minister, as he said a few moments ago, is absolutely satisfied that the safety committee is being giving this maximum account of power which he wishes, I must bow to his wishes, but, as an employer, I am anxious to see that the maximum co-operation is obtained from workers to ensure that there health and safety conditions are in fact carried out in our factories throughout the country.  It is for that reason that I have drawn particular attention to Section 73.</P>
      <P>There is only one other point I should like to raise at this stage.  In the Bill as introduced, there was a Section 124.  It was deletted in the Dáil Special Committee, but as far as I could see there was no comment ever made on any reason for its deletion the Special Committee report merely says: &ldquo;Section 124 was deleted.&rdquo;  That section provided for the inspection of certain premises and it read.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1362" />&ldquo;Where in any premises which are subject to inspection by or under the authority of any Minister of State (other than the Minister), any manual labour is exercised for the purposes of instruction, in or incidental to the making, altering, repairing, ornamenting, finishing, wash ing, cleaning or adapting for sale, of any article, and the premises do not constitute a factory, the Minister may arrange with such Minister of State that the premises shall, as respects matters dealt with by this Act be inspected by an inspector appointed under this Act, and where such an arrangement is made, in spector's appointed under this Act shall have, as respects matters dealt with by this Act, the like rights of entry and inspection of that premises as the inspectors and other officers of such Minister of State have.</P>
    <P>I am not very clear why it was necessary to delete that section, but it would appear to apply to factories which are under State control and possibly the Minister might enlighten us as to the reason for its deletion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>It related to vocational schools, which are not factories.  The new provision is in Section 85.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not find out exactly where it was.  In conclusion, may I ask the Minister a further question? I think I heard the Minister for Agriculture make the statement here this evening that the Minister for Industry and Commerce would have power under this Bill to regulate the size of bags and containers for fertilisers or such commodities.  I was not very clear where that power was given &mdash;I did not have an opportunity of going through the Bill since&mdash;and should like to know under what section he will have that power.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Once again, as an employer, I very much welcome the Bill and am particularly glad to have the assurance from the Minister that he is at present preparing legislation to deal with office offers.  I do not propose to coments on that except to say that, while factory workers have been taken care of in the past, absolutely nothing has been done for office workers, and quite <Col N="1363" /> often you find small offices with a large number of typists and clerks packed in together in deplorable conditions.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is to be congratulated on this very detailed Bill which deals with a subject which I know has been worrying the Irish Trade Union Congress for some years past.  The Bill provides for better, healthier and safer working conditions for certain workers, namely manual workers.  It does nothing at all how ever, in regard to officer workers and I am very disappointed that this very good Bill should not have made provision for these office workers.  The Minister in the course of his speech said that he had looked at that aspect of the matter and he thought that this Bill was not the appropriate measure in which to legislate for office workers.</P>
      <P>The needs of office workers in regard to working conditions can be very clearly and briefly defined.  First of all, cleanliness and that is dealt with for manual workers in Section 10; secondly the matter of overcrowding and that is dealt with by Section 11 for manual workers; thirdly, temperature and here again that is dealt with for manual workers in Section 12.  The matter of ventilation is dealt with in Section 17, lighting in Section 14 and sanitary conveniences in Section 17. Part IV of the Bill, dealing with welfare, could be applied <i>in toto</i> to office workers.</P>
      <P>It may be said that the detailed information as to the required conditions for office workers has not yet been established, but I notice that in this Bill provision is made in a lot of the sections for the making of Orders by the Minister, in consultation with the Minister for Health, determining sufficient and suitable provisions, and it seems to me that the necessary power could be taken in the Bill and that the laying down of proper regulations could be dealt with by the Minister, just as he is taking power in the Bill to lay down proper conditions for manual workers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The standard required for office workers is not so vague and a certain amount of work has already been done in the matter.  I refer to the report of the Gowers Committee in Britain which has recommended standards in regard to these items I have mentioned <Col N="1365" /> and I think that these standards could and should be applied here.</P>
    <P>I share the desire of all sides of the House and of the Minister to get through this Stage of the Bill as quickly as possible but I would urge on the Minister the importance of dealing with the question of legislating for proper conditions for office workers as quickly as possible.  Quite frankly, I think that the answer he has given, that this is not the appropriate vehicle, is a Civil Service answer.  There is a suspicious in a lot of people's minds that one of the reasons why the Government has not yet dealt with office conditions is that it has difficulty in putting its own house in order and that the first and greatest trangressor against any such new legislation would be the Government itself.  The Minister is probably quite aware that Departments other than his own and Social Welfare have not as favourable office conditions as Industry and Commerce and Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>Too often I have had experience of office workers in certain places risking T.B., and.  I have often wondered whether it is a fact that office workers are more prone to this disease that other workers.  It seems to me that such is the case, and I think it is the duty of the Government and the particular duty of the Minister to have the necessary legislation dealing with offices introduced as quickly as possible. I would appeal to him most strongly to have it introduced.  I know too well the delays which can occur in a Department in getting information and work together, but certain organisations of clerical workers, notably the Irish Conference of Professional and Service Associations have already done some work in this respect and that association is most anxious to lay its recommendations before the Department. Not only Government offices could be said to be lacking in the proper facilities for office workers, but indeed other concerns some of which are the responsibility of the Minister have not proper office accommodation.</P>
    <P>I have had experience of dealing with this matter and the trouble is <Col N="1366" /> that there are no laid down conditions, no regulations.  Whilst I might express an opinion that an office is overcrowded, unhealthy and a risk to the employees working there that can only be a matter of opinion and the answer of the employer is simply &ldquo;that is your opinion and mine is that the office accommodation is suitable.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There is a great need for dealing with this matter of office accommodation and I hope that we will eventually get away from the position that conditions are strictly laid down and applied for factory workers but office workers are simply tagged on to the factory with no proper accommodation and have no protection at all from the Department.  With those words, as brief as I can make them, I would again urge the Minister to see that this legislation is introduced as quickly as possible.  It would be helpful if he could tell us in his reply when he expects to be in a position to promote the necessary legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamFearon" hpid="Professor Fearon Professor Fearon">
      <NameTxt>Professor Fearon</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is so good and contains so many good I features and has been so clearly summarised by the Minister and given rise to such an important debate in the other House that we would probably be failing in our duties if we did not expose it to as hard an examination as we could.  I am not in a position to submit it to a very hard examination, and I speak chiefly from my experience as a member of the committees set up for the examination of Statutory Orders and delegated legislation.  I would like to touch on two features of this measure to which the Minister referred in submitting it, namely, the advisory council and the safety committee.  I think that the establishment of the advisory council is an excellent and most welcome departure from the bureaucratic tendencies growing so strongly elsewhere. It is a type of legislation which.  I hope will be extended, and I refer especially to the procedure with regard to special regulations which is very portant and a great innovation.  It provides a check of undesirable use of ministerial power to make, statutory Regulations and Orders, and I think <Col N="1367" /> it is a feature that should be copied in other important measures.  Even were the Bill not notable for other things, it is notable for this.  There are other features about which I should like to see the Minister going a little bit further.  The points I have noted down are, first of all, for example, the advisory council.  I feel that some independent statutory tribunal should be entrusted with the duty of making the inquiries under Schedule 3 just in case some people distrust appointments made by a Minister <i>ad hoc.</i></P>
      <P>Another thing I noted down is that Section 20 seems to offer the Minister for the time being an escape from the special regulations procedure in the Schedule in certain cases.  I wonder why this escape clause is considered necessary.</P>
      <P>I note Section 93 which provides for the appointment of the inspectors. Hitherto I believe appointments of inspectors were made under the Factory or Railway Act from a special corps.  It appears that under this section the Minister may, if he chooses, appoint any civil servant from his Department to be an inspector, and may take him away again as he pleases.  That could easily give rise to complications in factory administration.</P>
      <P>I think that Sections 50 and 51 are very unusual in character.  They seem to imply that the District Court can be used as an instrument of factory administration.  It seems to me that if the inspector examining the conditions in a factory is not satisfied and condemns the conditions he could, subject to ministerial sanction, have that particular part of the factory closed down, and then any person aggrieved could have the right to appeal to the District Court for an order quashing what has been done.  By that means we would not have the district justice in the position of both administering and judging at the same time.</P>
      <P>I think, the welfare regulations are excellent and very commendable.  I am naturally interested in Section 57 from the medical standpoint.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding the safety delegates and <Col N="1368" /> the safety committee in Section 73, the first thing that worries me a bit&mdash;and my worry has intensified by hearing Senator Douglas's analysis&mdash;is the possibility of a safety delegate having power to approach the inspector directly.  He could easily make himself a nuisance.  Supposing a crank or a person with some peculiarity of judgment got himself appointed safety delegate.  You will perhaps say that no wise committee will appoint such a person as safety delegate, but I have the feeling that on various committees often a troublesome person is put into an important job to get him out of the way and make him do work which other people are not willing to do. Supposing you have a safety delegate who is troublesome and will continually come direct to the inspector with various complaints and representations. I suggest to the Minister, through you, Sir, the safety delegate should first make representations to the occupier or the management and then if he does not get satisfaction from him he could go to the inspector. Otherwise I fear that you will have the safety delegate directly dealing with the inspector from time to time, without the knowledge of the employer. That, I think, is a matter which certainly requires consideration.</P>
    <P>Another matter I would like to mention has already been raised by Senator Douglas.  I do not want to encroach on Committee work but I do not think a safety committee should have the power to meet indefinitely as often as it wants to.  There should be a time limit on the number of meetings it can have during working time&mdash; something like one a month or so.  I could imagine a factory where half the time is taken up by the safety committee assembling and the rest of the time by it dissolving.</P>
    <P>There is one other consideration.  I do not know whether I have got hold of the right end of the stick or not. Under Section 99 it seems to me that ministerial Orders of an autocratic nature are not reviewable by the courts.  I will quote from paragraph 3 of Section 99:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Any regulations or Order made by the Minister under this Act may <Col N="1369" /> be made for a limited period or without limit of period and may be made subject to such conditions as he thinks fit...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is not clear whether the conditions are to be incorporated in the Order or regulations.  Let me quote further:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;and may contain such supplemental and consequential provisions as he considers necessary...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I have the impression that, according to a judicial decision, such terminology gives to the Minister an arbitrary discretion that cannot be challenged in the courts.  Unless the Oireachtas wishes to confer an absolute and unchallengeable discretion on the Minister, those words should be avoided. Apart from that, I have nothing but good to say about the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OwenSkeffington" hpid="Dr. Sheehy Skeffington Dr. Sheehy Skeffington">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to add my need of praise to what has already been said by other Senators for the Minister and those who worked with him in Committee in the Dáil and, indeed, for his predecessor in the production of this Bill.  A great deal of very solid work has been done.  I should like to praise the care with which it has been done, and praise the concern felt by all those involved on behalf of the workers of all types and ages in factories.  I agree with what some Senators said, that this is possibly mainly a Committee Bill.  I do not propose to speak at length but I should like to make three main points.</P>
      <P>The first is that I do not share the despondency and dismay that has been expressed by one or two Senators at the prospect of the nefarious doings of the safety committee.  I do not really think they will turn out to be quite such a bunch of cranks and saboteurs as was suggested.  It seems to me that the regulations are eminently reasonable. I think that in practice&mdash; although there may be some defects&mdash; they will work out well.  The point I want to make is in relation to Section 76, which deals with the notification of industrial diseases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I notice that the diseases mentioned are four types of poisoning, and anthrax infection.  The question I <Col N="1370" /> would like to put is whether there will be the possibility of adding to this list?  I take it that there will be some machinery whereby other infections or diseases might be added if it be discovered in years to come that certain diseases are attributable to working conditions in certain trades.  To mention one example that I can think of&mdash; the possibility that it may be established that there is some connection between lung cancer and spray painting.</P>
    <P>I understand that the connection between the two has not been scientifically established, although there is among the workers in that particular trade a strong feeling that the work itself has an effect upon certain lung conditions.  Therefore, I would like to ask the Minister just what is the process whereby other conditions, diseases and infections might also be included in that section at a future date, whether he has thought of the possible amending mechanism or what exactly is the position there?</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Senator look at sub-section (6) of the same section?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OwenSkeffington" hpid="Dr. Sheehy Skeffington Dr. Sheehy Skeffington">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, that entirely answers my question.  I am glad to see that the possibility of adding fresh conditions is met there.  I might, since the Minister has answered me so completely, ask him whether he is aware of any particular investigations on this line being conducted by the Minister for Health, or whether, in fact, there is active concern in regard to this question of industrial diseases and the possibility of there being other diseases attributable to factory conditions than those mentioned here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The next point I want to raise is in relation to Section 84 which seems to me to be, on the face of it, at any rate, not justified.  I notice that Section 84 refers to institutions where certain work is carried on for charitable or reformatory purposes, and where these premises do not constitute a factory the Act will apply, except for certain conditions.  It is the exceptions that concern me.  I would like the Minister to develop his reasons for desiring exceptions in these conditions.  The <Col N="1371" /> workers in such institutions, be they charitable institutions or reformatories, already suffer from one disability. They have not got trade union protection. Factory workers have a union to speak for them, but workers in semi-factories or laundries or whatever they may be, as mentioned in Section 84, have not got that protection.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that this section is going to remove from them some of the protections that are extended to ordinary factory workers outside, who already have got trade union protection. Why is this exclusion felt to be necessary?  I notice that in sub-section (2) if the managers of such institutions can &ldquo;satisfy the Minister&rdquo; that the only persons working therein are persons who are inmates of or are supported by the institution, then certain provisions of this whole Factory Act will not apply to them. Why not?  Do not these inmates need precisely the same degree of protection as the ordinary worker outside?</P>
    <P>There is nothing unjust about the general framework, the general conditions and provisions of the Bill.  That being so, why should it appear normal to the Minister to say: &ldquo;We will not apply this to people if we are satisfied that the only persons working in such conditions are inmates.&rdquo;  The section does not quite say &ldquo;mere inmates&rdquo;, but the suggestion as I see it is that these people are not to have all the protection afforded by this Act which I think will be a good Act when it becomes law.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, the phrase occurs in sub-section (2) that if &ldquo;such work... is carried on in good faith for the purposes of the support, education, training or reformation of the persons engaged in it, then the Minister may, by Order, direct,&rdquo; and so on.  Now, all of these institutions, I would say, carry on such work in good faith, but I would say that there are also many factory owners outside who are going to be controlled by this Bill and who in all good faith are running factories and are doing the best they can for their workers.</P>
    <P>We are told that the road to hell is <Col N="1372" /> paved with good intentions.  I find it disturbing that it is considered necessary by the Minister to exempt semi-factories of this kind from the protection afforded by the Act.  I notice again that in paragraph (a) of sub-section (2) it is provided:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The medical officer of the institution (if any) may, on the application of the managers, be appointed to be the certifying doctor for the institution.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If some question about the medical and hygenic conditions comes up, the person to judge and to certify will be the inside medical officer.  The medical profession is one of high standards of honour, but I feel it is hardly fair to them to ask them in certain circumstances to do what amounts to inspecting themselves, to act as judge and jury in their own case.  Again, I find this paragraph surprising.</P>
    <P>I notice that in the following paragraph there is an even more surprising clause.  It says that an inspector shall not examine, without the consent of the managers, an inmate in the institution save in the presence of one of the managers.  I can imagine circumstances where such a person on being examined by an inspector would be extremely loath to speak freely to the inspector in the presence of people who might be coming under criticism from him.  I think that this is an extraordinary clause.  I do not see the purpose of it and I should like to hear from the Minister why it is felt that this kind of normal protection of allowing an inspector to speak in private to a person whom he is examining is to be removed from these people who have the misfortune to be inmates in a reformatory or in some such institution.</P>
    <P>Finally, in the same section, I find that sub-section (3) provides:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;This Act shall not, except in so far as the Minister may by Order direct, apply to any premises which do not constitute a factory if the premises are subject to inspection by or under the authority of any Minister of State.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1373" /> That seems to me to be a mistaken clause because it is quite conceivable that the premises might be subject to inspection by some other Department for reasons totally different from the reasons with which we are concerned in the Factories Act.  These might be premises subject to inspection by someone from the Department of Education, but that inspection would have nothing to do with safety and health and so on.  Therefore, I want to ask the Minister what is the purpose of saying that such places will be exempt if they are apparently being inspected by any other Department for any other reason whatever.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to say any more at this juncture, but these are the preoccupations which would be mine in reading this otherwise excellent Bill, and these are the sorts of things which I should like to see cleared up on the Committee Stage or by the Minister when he is winding up on this Stage of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to ask the Minister a question on Section 76. Sub-section (6) of this section provides:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Minister may, as respects all factories or any class or description of factory, by regulations, made after consultation with the Minister for Health, apply this section to any disease other than those mentioned in this section.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I have in mind a disease that is very prevalent amongst miners.  It is known as pneumoconiosis.  It is not a scheduled industrial disease.  I am anxious to know what is the position in regard to it under this Bill, or whether it is certified as an industrial disease under this Bill or under the Workmen's Compensation Act.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>As I am not a factory employee or an employer, I would not have intervened in this debate but for the fact that I should like to refer to a matter that was mentioned earlier to-day when another Bill was under consideration.  On that Bill, I referred <Col N="1374" /> to the heavy weight of fertiliser sacks and of grain sacks which agricultural workers and farmers are called upon to lift.  The Minister for Agriculture said that that particular matter would be dealt with under the Factories Bill. On reading the Factories Bill, I noted that there is a provision in Section 67 which protects workers in factories from being called upon to lift excessive weights.  I am just wondering if that protection extends beyond the walls of a factory because it is conceivable that artificial manures could be packed in factories by mechanical means and loaded by mechanical means.  Bags could be filled to the extent of 2 cwt. weight and, nevertheless, no worker in the factory would be called upon to lift them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>They are being filled in 2cwt. weight bags at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Assuming that they are filled by mechanical means, no worker in the factory is called upon to lift them.  They may also be loaded by mechanical means, but the unfortunate agricultural worker and farmer at the other end of the assembly line would be called upon to unload these 2 cwt. weight sacks.  I think that is a matter to which the Minister might give some attention.  I think the Minister for Agriculture was under a slight misapprehension. The same thing could apply in regard to wheat.  For example, the grain would be filled into 20 stone sacks, and these might be handled, possibly, in some warehouses or mills by mechanical means.  In that case Section 67 of this Bill would be complied with.  Nevertheless, the agricultural workers and the farmer would still be penalised.  I know that the Minister will give this matter his attention either in this legislation or later.</P>
      <P>I want to compliment the Minister's predecessor on having drafted this Bill.  I want to compliment the Minister on having replaced it, so to speak, on the assembly line and on having secured such improvements as he thought necessary in it, in passing it through the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As one working on the land&mdash;and <Col N="1375" /> this applies both to farmers and to agricultural workers&mdash;I know there is general sympathy with those who have to work in factories.  We expect from those who work in factories and offices some measure of sympathy for those who work on the land.  I do not want to say anything about the general body of this Bill, since to a great extent it is outside my general experience; but as the Bill reaches out towards rural Ireland, in the sense that it deals with the quarrying of stone and the raising of gravel in gravel pits and protects the workers therein, I would like to stress the urgency of this particular section.  At the present time, having regard to the increased mechanisation of excavation work, excavation is carried out more rapidly than in the past and thereby there is a greater danger to workers employed, particularly in gravel pits.  We know that in recent years there has been a large number of distressing fatal accidents to workers in gravel pits.  I do not know how protection will be provided for these people, but I assume that the Bill gives the legal power to provide that protection.</P>
    <P>I would be interested to know&mdash;and I am raising the matter more as a matter of curiosity than anything else, as I do not know the position thoroughly&mdash;if this Bill extends or can be extended to cover persons engaged in the building industry.  They are exposed to very considerable risk. Persons engaged in timber felling, persons engaged in turf production or where excavation work is carried on on a big scale, are exposed to danger. In modern times we have large scale excavation work and large scale reclamation work.  All of this is heavy mechanical work and I would imagine that it exposes the workers employed in it to risks as great as those in any factory.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Like other Senators, I welcome this Bill.  It is a very timely one and many of the provisions in it show the considerable thought that has been given to it, not alone by those who drafted the Bill but by the technical officers of the Department who have made many of the suggestions. <Col N="1376" /> The suggestions regarding safety devices interested me considerably.  Great progress is being made in that respect with regard to machinery for many years past and I was pleased to see that in details like that alone this is a most comprehensive measure and shows that adequate and sufficient thought has been given to it.</P>
      <P>One of the parts of the Bill in which I was very interested was the welfare section.  It has a great bearing on the hygiene of our factories.  Very many of them are food factories producing for the home market and for export and it is necessary that high standards would become the order of the day.  I notice that the Minister has also taken power to provide for appliances for the welfare and the improvement of the hygiene of the workers in the factory, and to ensure that it would be the duty of the management to provide the appliances and that it would be the duty of those for whose use they were provided to see that they were properly used and not abused.</P>
      <P>I would suggest to the Minister that probably there are other Departments, such as the Department of Agriculture, who also visit these factories and that if there is any overlapping, while the Bill is going through this House, he may be able to remove it.  I would also like to suggest that some officers be appointed to give talks on welfare, hygiene, sanitation and other matters to the workers.  Most of the causes of contamination of food are certainly not visual.  I would hate to think our factories looked clean and were not clean. It is quite possible in food manufacture to have things clean bacteriologically and maybe not to look clean. This problem must be understood and it is difficult for managements to put it across, but suitable lectures are very desirable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the emergency period, I happened to have a position as supply officer in a district staff and I got a series of lectures through attending courses given by Army medical officers on hygiene and sanitation; and I found out later, as managing director of a food factory, that a lot of this information proved invaluable to me. <Col N="1377" /> Our Army authorities&mdash;and for that matter the army medical authorities in other countries&mdash;during the last war were able to protect their armies from any outbreaks of what were the traditional fevers that became an aftermath of war.  That was done through an understanding of a problem and through putting the knowledge across to the ordinary rank and file soldier. I believe that those who are engaged in the processing of food should be properly instructed as to the scientific requirements of hygiene and sanitation. Good competent officers can explain the most technical things in the proper language.  They are able to explain them at the proper level in non-technical language and I think that is very desirable.</P>
    <P>The Minister has done a wonderful job on this Bill and I feel that in the administration of the Bill he will find opportunities to do far more.  This is primarily a Committee Bill and he will afford us an opportunity in a week or two of dealing with the sections.  However, the matters to which I have referred to-night are those which I was not able to relate to a particular section and I wanted to deal with them more in a general sense.  I recommend the points I have made to the Minister as worthy of consideration.  Perhaps he can apply them under certain sections or under the regulations or perhaps he could do something in consulting his colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, who also has a very important function in this respect.</P>

      <P>I thoroughly approve of the Bill and compliment the Tánaiste on its introduction.  It has been considered already by a Committee selected from different sections, and from the explanatory memorandum circulated I am of the opinion that the Bill should have a swift passage.  I know that already, in several factories, vigorous measures to ensure the safety and health of the workers were taken before this Bill was introduced.  I also know that factories in which conditions were not so good are in competition with other factories, and I think it is not altogether just that factories, in which the safety and health of the <Col N="1378" /> workers were a matter for consideration and concern, should be in competition with other factories in which the conditions for employees were not so good.  As far as this Bill is concerned, every avenue has been explored, conducive to the safety, health and comfort of the workers.</P>
      <P>I am glad that the Tánaiste has given us an assurance that he has also contemplated the introduction of a Bill providing for black coat or office workers.  That is essential to the community. I hope this Bill will get a swift passage through the House, and that the co-operation between employers and workers in the factories will be very much improved as a result.</P>

      <P>In many cases, all these excellent ideas have already been put into effect in many factories of which I know. I should like to say that I welcome all the improvements which will now be necessary, especially for the handling and production of food, the safety of the workers, the necessary sanitary arrangements, and proper conditions for taking their food.  But there is a feeling that the employer is a big bad man who is forced into doing these things for the welfare of the workers. In many cases all these things have been done in the past.</P>
      <P>I agree with the suggestion made by Senator Burke that lectures on hygiene and the proper use of those things, which will now be provided, will be most essential, otherwise I would suggest to the Minister that, in many cases, the workers will look on them as new rules being inflicted by the officer in the factory, whose business it is to see these things are carried out, by the boss and by the Government. These improvements are not accepted at their proper value, often because of lack of knowledge of their usefulness. I think that Senator Burke's suggestion that lectures, even pre-employment lectures on hygiene, which are not given at the moment, are most essential.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From my knowledge of some of the factories in my town I can say they <Col N="1379" /> maintain a very high standard.  Some young people have not been accustomed to such a high standard of cleanliness, and if they are made wash their hands at regular intervals, and use clean towels, they look upon this as another thing imposed on them by the boss.  I am not making personal complaints in this matters but I have been told that there has been difficulty in getting the workers to use clean towels, hang them back in the place provided, and keep those parts of the factory set aside for them in a proper condition.  I repeat that the officer whose duty it is to see these things are carried out is looked upon as an enemy.  I would suggest to the as Minister, as Senator Burke has suggested, that a system of lectures for potential factory workers be considered. I congratulate the Minister on the Bill.</P>

      <P>I should like to compliment the Seanad on the understanding manner in which they have approached the Second Reading of this Bill.  It is a matter for gratification that they have endorsed the general idea of bringing what is described as factory legislation into line with modern thought in this very important problem. This Bill is, in the main, a Committee Stage or machinery Bill.  Therefore, I think that Senators are at a disadvantage in endeavouring to discuss its general principles when it is so widespread, so diversified and technical, that the principles are really an amalgamation of the variety of detail with which this Bill abounds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope this Bill will be welcomed by <Col N="1380" /> every good employer in this country. It is something for which good and progressive employers have been waiting, not in the sense of waiting to do these things, because many good employers have already done them.  In many factories, there will be no need for this Bill in order to enable them to attain to the standard which the Bill sets for every factory.  If an employer is good and progressive, he can look on this Bill as something which he has already done for himself, and, in so far as he has not already done all the things, this Bill will present no difficulty to him, and he will have only a modicum to do which will be necessary to ensure compliance with it.  If there are employers whose standard is not up to that of the progressive employer, then this Bill is necessary to compel those employers to set their sights higher and provide better standards for their employees.  Everybody will wish that there should be a compulsive approach to that kind of employer in order to get him to attain to standards which have been already arrived at by good and progressive employers.</P>
    <P>Many points were raised which are really more proper to the Committee Stage, and I could not, in the time available to me, attempt to deal with them all, nor would it be fair to the Seanad.  I will deal with some of the main matters raised, and I hope that it might give Senators an informed view as to how we wish the Bill to follow the directions we are endeavouring to follow, as far as the provisions of the Bill are concerned.</P>
    <P>Senator Douglas referred to the description of factories as tenement factories. A tenement factory is like a tenement house.  It is a building where there is more than one tenant.  A building where there is more than one factory is described as a tenement factory. It has stood the test of more than 50 years of legislation, and the description in this Bill is the same description as was in the 1901 Factories Act.  I do not like it myself, but it was in the Act that I inherited.  As I say, it has stood the test of more than 50 years' legislation, and it is possible that, when this Bill is passed very few people will ever refer to this <Col N="1381" /> particular section, which describes certain multiple factories in one building as tenement factories.</P>
    <P>If my attention had been directed to this section in detail, in the first instance, I think I would have knocked out &ldquo;tenement factories&rdquo; and put in &ldquo;multiple factories&rdquo;.  I have no better defence for the phrase than that to change it now would involve amendments to six or seven sections.  However, I still dislike it and I do not like my name being associated with it.  If Senator Douglas and the House are in favour of deleting &ldquo;tenement factory&rdquo; and substituting &ldquo;multiple factory&rdquo;, even though it involves amending six, seven or eight sections, I am willing to do that between now and Committee Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I will do it so. Section 14 deals with lighting.  This section was amended by the Committee which dealt with the Bill.  In the section as originally drawn, there was provision whereby the Minister could prescribe certain types of lighting, but could not specify the particular type of illuminant.  In other words, the general intention of the section was to ensure that, while the Minister might prescribe ordinary electric light, fluorescent lighting or, if necessary, candle light, he could not come down and say that it could only be candlelight or it must be gas lighting.  The Committee felt that perhaps the Minister was being needlessly democratic by disarming himself of that power and consequently it was deleted, leaving the Bill as it now stands.</P>
      <P>I call attention to the fact that sub-section (2) of Section 14 sets out:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Minister, after consultation with the Minister for Health, may, by regulations, prescribe a standard of sufficient and suitable lighting for factories or for any class or description of factory or parts thereof, or for any process.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I visualise that, before these regulations are made, there will be consultation <Col N="1382" /> with all the persons and interests concerned and that whatever regulations are finally made will represent a distillation of the wisdom of all those who are interested and that the final decision as to the particular type of lighting in a particular set of circumstances will reflect the will of those who have to work in that lighting and those who have to provide it. I should not think that we will have any difficulty on that section.</P>
    <P>The question of weights was raised by Senators Douglas and Cogan.  In Section 67, provision is made that a person shall not be employed to lift, carry or move any load so heavy as to be likely to cause injury to him and it goes on to say:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Minister may, after consultation with the Minister for Health, make regulations prescribing the maximum weights which may be lifted, carried or moved by persons employed in factories...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This is a Factories Bill dealing with factories in their broadest sense and power is being taken here to prescribe the limits of weight which a person may be asked to lift, carry or move. So far as the Bill is concerned, it will do that in respect of persons employed in factories.  In so far as one can therefore condition a person to a state of affairs in which he cannot be asked to move more than stone weight and so long as he has to handle such a container, nobody outside can handle a greater weight than is in that container because a limit has been fixed as to the weight of the container; but a case could arise in which a particular commodity would be loaded mechanically, and, having been loaded mechanically, nobody would carry it, lift it or move it.</P>
    <P>If an object of that kind leaves a factory, there is nothing one can do in the Bill about it, and the problem then is one which is extra-territorial so far as the factory is concerned because no factory regulation would be broken if it were loaded mechanically. I do not think we can deal with that in this Bill, but I am in favour of the point of view expressed by Senator Cogan and I have already suggested <Col N="1383" /> to some Members of the other House that they could usefully employ their time in drafting a Private Members' Bill to provide some machinery whereby some maximum weights would be fixed by somebody.</P>

      <P>I know, but the point is that we can legislate only for the weights to be carried by the factory worker.  I cannot be asked to legislate in this Bill for people outside, because conceivably a farmer might load a bag of anything you like weighing 2 cwts. and ask his employee to deliver it to another farmer a mile away, in which case the agricultural worker would have to do the loading.  If you are going to deal with this question of loading, you have to cover that man, as well as the fellow who takes goods which have been filled and loaded mechanically from the factory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Murphy raised a question about office workers and I think unfairly suggested that there was some occult motive behind the exclusion of office workers from this Bill.  That is not true and not so.  When this Bill was first introduced in the Dáil by my predecessor, I urged that, if at all possible, we should endeavour to bring office workers within its scope.  I was told at the time by my predecessor that it was not possible to do so, that it was better to wait for another Bill <Col N="1384" /> and that it was impossible to apply satisfactorily the provisions of this Bill to office workers.  The Bill got a Second Reading in the Dáil and when I went to Industry and Commerce, knowing that I would have to pilot the Bill through the Dáil and Seanad, I made microscopic inquiries to see in what way we could fit office workers into the Bill.</P>
    <P>I found that the first difficulty was that in fact no material had been compiled about the type of legislation required for office workers, that no research had been done in the matter and that in fact nobody had really started to think about the type of legislation needed.  That is not merely the situation as I found it, that no material had been assembled, but there has been no information assembled, I think, in any tangible way by a lot of the bodies which normally would be concerned with the well-being of office workers, nor was there any easy Geneva pattern to follow in respect of them, so that there was no brain to pick there.</P>
    <P>I have endeavoured in the past six or eight months to concentrate the I attention of the Department on the assembling of information and on undertaking research to procure material which would be the basis of an office worker's charter.  I am glad to say that the officers of the Department have applied themselves diligently to that task.  A considerable amount of material has now been assembled and in a reasonably short time I hope that we will be able to take decisions in principle on the form which an office worker's charter will take, but it is not because of any desire on my part to exclude them that they are excluded from this Bill and it is not because of any plea by civil servants. The officers of my Department dealing with this matter, being office workers themselves, are as anxious as anybody else to ensure that this Bill will be paralleled by a Bill dealing with office workers and it is not a desire to avoid the problem that has prompted their exclusion.  It is just because the necessary material was not available and is only now being assembled. When assembled, as I say, decisions in principle will be taken, and I hope it <Col N="1385" /> will be possible within a reasonably short period to get together the framework of an office worker's charter so far as the general provisions on these lines are concerned.</P>
    <P>The question of the safety committee and the position of the safety delegate were raised by a number of Senators. Let me say this.  The Special Committee set up by the Dáil which dealt with this matter had before it an amendment which I proposed, to introduce and set up the safety committee and the advisory committee.  There were other amendments submitted by other members of that Committee. When these amendments, and all other amendments, came before the Committee there was no question of trying to carry a particular amendment by a vote and no question of trying to resist an amendment by a vote.  There was not a single vote on any issue before the Special Committee.  The Special Committee proceeded on the basis of the impact of reason on reason, and I took the view at the Special Committee that my only concern was to get the best possible Bill and make it work in the most useful manner.  Although I could have commanded a majority in that Special Committee, I never once tried to use it and never let a single issue go to a vote.  If the Deputies on the Committee had a strong point of view and felt keenly&mdash;and often there was a substantial volume of opinion in favour of something&mdash;I said to the Committee: &ldquo;This is a deliberative Committee and I do not feel that all the wisdom is in one head, and if it is the feeling of the Committee to take a certain line I will meet their point of view.&rdquo;  That is the way I approached all amendments.</P>
    <P>I had suggested an amendment for the safety committee and the advisory committee.  There were others with a different line of approach.  All these were thrown into the forum and discussed at considerable length.  Finally in the light of the views expressed by the Committee at that time I took all the amendments out&mdash;those for which I was responsible myself and those for which the Deputies were responsible-and I studied how to bring back an amendment which I hoped would meet <Col N="1386" /> all the points of view expressed on the Committee.  I brought back two amendments, one providing for the establishment of the safety committee and the other which is down here in Section 73.  That was an agreed amendment so far as the Special Committee was concerned.  Not only was there an agreed amendment in the sense that all Parties represented on the Committee agreed to it unanimously, but the Committee was representative of employers and workers.</P>
    <P>Later in the Dáil an effort was made to put in an amendment to Section 73 and to give the section an entirely different meaning.  I felt that that was a mistake.  If I accepted the Dáil amendment submitted, I think, by Deputies Dockrell and Belton I would render this safety committee useless, because the main purpose of the amendment offered to the Dáil of the agreed Section 73 was calculated to make the safety committee a kind of policeman so far as the rest of the employees in the factory were concerned. The amendment sought to give the committee power to make sure that the fellow in the factory did what he was told by the safety committee.  I could not see a safety committee of that kind working, and I do not believe that even if I were to accept the amendment and give the section that slant it would work now.</P>
    <P>I think that is a reasonable approach to the whole problem.  I would emphasise this point firstly, that this is not a statutory committee.  The safety committee can be set up by the workers employed in the factory, and its functions are as set out in the lengthy section referred to here.  I would like to call attention to one function of the committee, that is under Section 73 (1) (a), which provides that it shall be a function of the safety committee &ldquo;to assist in securing the compliance by the occupier of the factory and by persons employed therein with the provisions of this Act and of the Orders and regulations made under this Act.&rdquo;  In other words the safety committee, which will be representative of the workers at factory level and of the employer or <Col N="1387" /> management at factory level, shall have as a task to assist in securing compliance by the occupier of the factory and the persons employed therein with the provisions of this Act and the Orders and regulations made under it.  I think that is a reasonable approach to the problem.</P>
    <P>As I said in the Dáil, if you get a committee which wants to nag at the employer and to interfere in matters not within its domain, or which wants to meet every day and a couple of times a day, a committee, perhaps, which wants to live in a fire brigade and crisis atmosphere, that committee will not work.  From the beginning the type of committee I visualised is a committee of responsible people selected by the workers, letting the employers put a representative on it. A complaint was made in the Dáil that there was provision for the employer to put a representative on the committee. So far as I am concerned, the employer can match his representation with that of the workers, but I think that is a mistake.  If you get the idea of equal strength, you get a position of the use of economic or numerical strength in coming to decisions.  I would sooner have the kind of position we had in the Special Committee, that this thing was argued on the basis alone of what is the best thing the committee can provide for greater safety or for extending and safeguarding health in the factory.  If these committees can be induced to work along these lines, and I feel sure that they can with a little guidance and lead, then I believe they will make a substantial contribution to the preservation of health and to the avoidance of accidents in factories.  To the extent that they do that, they will be actually dispensing dividends not alone to the workers but to the employers as well.</P>
    <P>As I say, I think that this thing will work except where you get the crank. Where you get him it will not work, and the committee will do nothing useful from the point of view of the workers.  Similarly, where you get an employer making up his mind &ldquo;I will not have this man and I will find the most convenient opportunity for insulting <Col N="1388" /> the committee&rdquo; that committee will not work either.  In cases like that you have that frustration to which I suppose human nature is prone.</P>
    <P>I am pleading for an understanding committee which will look at its problems broadly and will say to itself: &ldquo;Look, our destiny is cast in this factory.  We want to make it as comfortable, safe and healthy as we can make it.&rdquo;  If the committee approaches its problems in that way, it should be possible in the overwhelming majority of cases to find a committee that can work, and maybe their good example would in time eliminate the kind of committee which cannot approach its problems in that tolerant and understanding way.  In any case, I think that there is the value in the committee&mdash;and employers should recognise it&mdash;that the purpose of the committee is to make workers health conscious and safety conscious. From the employer's point of view there is much to be gained from that angle.  Anything that helps to propagate the notion of greater safety and the preservation of health in factories is something which has many advantages so far as both employers and workers are concerned.</P>
    <P>Senator Fearon raised a number of points, some of detail.  I think I have dealt with the question of the safety delegate.  He raised a question about the frequency of meetings.  Clearly it would be unwise to try to prescribe here how often the committee should meet, where they should meet and the days on which they should meet.  It has to be left to the good sense of the safety committee when appointed.  Let me say this.  In this Section 73 I provided, again at the request of the Special Committee, for a situation which exists at the moment in factories.  Many factories have works committees dealing with the question of production, the restoring of workers for particular schedules of duty, and welfare regulations.</P>
    <P>A very good employer who sets up a committee of that kind finds it is an immense aid to him in the general working of his business.  Where these committees function, they will serve as the safety committee so that in that <Col N="1389" /> case you will not have a safety committee superimposed on a works committee or a factories committee.  The works or factories committee already giving satisfaction can take over the prescribed functions of the safety committee provided for in this Bill and the employer has not a second committee drafted on to his first committee. If we can make, as we have made here, established committees work smoothly and efficiently there is no reason, making the same kind of approach to the safety committee problem, why we should not make that committee work equally satisfactorily.</P>
    <P>Senator Burke and Senator Mrs. Dowdall referred to the necessity for periodic talks on health and hygiene. The detailed functions, even in factories, are proper to the Minister for Health and I do not think that I, as Minister for Industry and Commerce, could be expected to deal with them. I would, however, call attention to the provisions of Section 127, which deals with the advisory council.  One of the functions of the council is to advise the Minister on the desirability of doing certain things, including &ldquo;the organisation or promotion of safety and welfare campaigns amongst employers and employers&rdquo;.  Another of their functions is &ldquo;the organisation of lectures, film shows or exhibitions, the publication of posters or pamphlets or any other measures, being lectures, film shows, exhibitions, posters, pamphlets or measures designed to educate employees and employers on questions of safety and welfare in factories and on methods of safeguarding and improving the health of workers&rdquo;. That is a pretty comprehensive function for this advisory council.  I hope that that committee at national level will undertake this work.  There is power to ensure that the work which it plans at national level can be carried down to local level.</P>
    <P>Senator Cogan raised the question of the position of quarries.  I explained in my Second Reading speech that a proper measure is being prepared to provide for the safety, health and welfare of quarry workers but in case there should be any hitch in enacting such law power is taken in Section 28 of this Bill to apply to quarries the <Col N="1390" /> protective measures of existing mining Acts.  In other words, the protection of existing Acts will be kept until such time as the existing Acts can be replaced by a more modern mining Act.</P>
    <P>Senator Sheehy Skeffington raised some questions relating to Section 84 of the Bill which deals with institutions. I think we must avoid the risk in this matter of going too far.  We must deal with what appears to be nonuniform and whether it is more practicable to adopt that attitude than to follow, the uniform, pattern which may run us into difficulties.</P>
    <P>When you are dealing with the question of Section 84, you have got to remember that the institutions referred to are those which are carried on for charitable or reformatory purposes. In so far as these are carried on for charitable or reformatory purposes and engage in doing certain things which might bring them within the scope of a factory, although they do not constitute a factory but an institution, the Minister has, nevertheless, power to apply the provisions of this Bill to them except in certain cases.</P>
    <P>One case is that the medical officer of an institution, if any, may, on the application of the managers, be appointed to be the certifying doctor for that institution.  It does not say he must be.  It says he may, on the application of the managers, be appointed the certifying doctor for the institution.  I suspect that Senator Sheehy Skeffington thinks that the doctor in that case might be more a policeman than a doctor.</P>
    <P>That just might be so although I would hope that the medical officer of an institution for quite a long time might be the best type of person to understand the mentality of the people with whom he would be dealing and that it would be better to leave him there.  With his long experience of the peculiar variety of truancy of the occupants such a medical officer might, in the long run, be better than an outside doctor with no such experience and who would not know the light and shade of the pattern of life which goes on inside the institution.  Therefore, I can assure the Senator that there is <Col N="1391" /> no sinister motive in this so far as I am concerned.</P>
    <P>On the question of examination, paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of the sub-section are all based on the approach to the problem from the angle that the institutions concerned are not factories in the ordinary sense; that they are reformatories and in some cases charitable institutions dealing with a variety of people and that the occupants are not the type of persons who go into an ordinary factory.</P>

      <P>It could apply to a Borstal or to places which are regarded as something in between.  They should be protected by all means.  A section does that by applying the provisions of the Bill to them although the place itself is not a factory.  Whether you should proceed on the basis that you can do, in an institution of that kind, a reformatory or a charitable institution, all the things it is legitimate enough to do in respect of a factory, where you have got trade unionists employed and where you have got people who have got a right to work or come out if they like, is another matter.  These other people may be detainees in so far as this Bill is concerned. I liked the liberal way in which Senator Sheehy Skeffington approached this question but you have got to weigh that against the wisdom of carrying outside factory practice into an institution of this kind.</P>

      <P>This is a case where the Senator might well take a chance.</P>

      <P>If the House met on Wednesday, 18th May, it could not meet on Thursday 19th, which is a holy day.  Perhaps Senators might agree to meet on Wednesday next and see what progress is made?  Would that be satisfactory?  We could take the Committee Stage on Wednesday next and the Report Stage a fortnight later.</P>

      <P>I could not answer that question.  Perhaps, if the Senator would use his influence with some people in the Dáil, we might get the County Management Bill before November.  That would be of great, assistance to us.</P>

      <P>It was going very well at about 7.30 p.m. this evening.  The Seanad might get it next week.</P>

      <P>I could not say what business we are going to get.  I think we ought to take the Committee Stage of this Bill on Wednesday, 11th May.  I also think that if the Senator wanted a fortnight for the Report Stage he could get it.  He would then have the advantage of hearing the Minister on all the sections.</P>
      <P>Committee Stage ordered for Wednesday, 11th May, 1955.</P>
      <P>The Seanad adjourned at 10.55 p.m. until 3 p.m. Wednesday, 11th May, 1955.</P>
