      <P>It is my sad duty to bring to the notice of the Seanad the unexpected death since our last meeting of Senator Andrew Clarkin.  At that meeting the late Senator was in attendance in his usual good health. He died early this morning.</P>
      <P>Senator Clarkin was elected to the Oireachtas Sub-Panel of the Industrial and Commercial Panel, and had been a member of this House continuously since 1944.  Of a courteous and kindly disposition, he was popular with members of the Oireachtas of all Parties.</P>
      <P>The late Senator entered wholeheartedly into all movements for the benefit of the country, whether national or local, giving of his best at all times. He joined the Sinn Féin Movement in 1911 and was a member of the Volunteers at an early age.  He took part in the Rising of 1916 and was throughout his career a prominent figure in the fight for independence.</P>
      <P>The late Senator was a Dublin man and took a leading part in furthering the development of his native city.  He was for many years Alderman of the County Borough and Lord Mayor of Dublin in 1951-52.  He took a keen interest in the business life of his native city and worked unsparingly on behalf of its citizens.  Senator Clarkin's death will be deeply mourned.</P>
      <P>To the widow and relatives of the late Senator I shall convey, with your assent, your sympathy and appreciation. Solas Dé len a anam.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="624" /> Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJCrotty" hpid="Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Crotty) Patrick J. Crotty">
      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Crotty)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is designed to regularise the position in regard to ownership and registry of Irish ships and will also deal with the duties and functions of registrars of shipping, transfer and transmission of ownership, mortgage of ships, national character and flag and survey and tonnage measurement.</P>
      <P>It has long been apparent that the law relating to merchant shipping in this country, which consists mainly of adapted British statutes, requires amendment and codification.  The law is contained in the Merchant Shipping Act, 1894, and some 20 other enactments amending and extending that Act which, although technically continued in force under Article 73 of the Constitution of 1922, are of imperfect application to the circumstances of this country.</P>
      <P>The main Merchant Shipping Act is the Act of 1894 which was intended to cater for the merchant shipping position in all parts of the British Empire as it was at that time.  It was enacted to apply to ships belonging to all parts of the then British Empire and applied throughout to &ldquo;British ships&rdquo; i.e. ships owned by British subjects and British registered companies and registered in some port in British territory. Under this Act, a ship, no matter in what part of British territory it was registered, remained a British ship from the time of registry until it became a total loss or was sold to non-British ownership and the law applicable to it was the same whenever it came within British jurisdiction.  In such a scheme there was no room for the concept of an independent Irish mercantile marine.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Although unsuited to the new status of, and the conditions in, this country on the establishment of the State in 1922, the Merchant Shipping Acts have remained almost unchanged on the Statute Book.  This was largely because there was no pressing need <Col N="625" /> for their replacement, as an oceangoing Irish merchant shipping navy had not come into existence before the war.  The whole problem assumes a fresh and new importance with the development of an Irish merchant shipping fleet, and with the change in political relations between this country and the former British Commonwealth which was brought about by the Republic of Ireland Act, 1948, and the Ireland Act, 1949.</P>
    <P>Many problems are involved in an amendment and codification of the law relating to merchant shipping, many phases of which have international as well as national implications.  The preparation and enactment of legislation to cover the whole field of merchant shipping will be a lengthy process.  There are over 1,000 sections in the existing code which, however, it is hoped to reduce substantially.</P>
    <P>As part of the general codification and amendment of maritime law to meet Irish requirements, the Bill makes provision for the class of ships to be known as Irish ships.  It prescribes that these Irish ships must fly national colours as laid down in the Bill and that only Irish ships may fly the colours or assume Irish national character; these provisions are already in Part I of the Merchant Shipping Act, 1894, as adapted and in the Merchant Shipping Act, 1947.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides, in Section 16, that the following classes of persons only shall be unconditionally entitled in law to own Irish ships:&mdash;(i) the Government; (ii) a Minister of State; (iii) Irish citizens; (iv) bodies corporate established under and subject to the law of the State and having their principal place of business in the State.  The Bill also provides, however, in Section 20, that any ships, whether owned by the foregoing classes of persons or not, which are registered at a port in the State on the date of introduction of the Bill, shall be deemed to be duly registered.  This provision is a saver for those persons or corporations which had, in exercise of a previously existing right, registered vessels at Irish ports.</P>
    <P>Provision is also made in the Bill, in Section 19, whereby the Government may make Orders granting rights <Col N="626" /> of registry at Irish ports to citizens or companies of other States in which Irish citizens and companies enjoy corresponding privileges, under the law of such States.  The making of such Orders will also be subject to the condition that it is in the national interest to do so.</P>
    <P>Apart from making specific provision for &ldquo;Irish ships&rdquo; as a special status, the main change involved in relation to ownership and registry is that citizens and companies of Britain and Commonwealth countries will not as heretofore automatically be qualified to own and register an Irish ship.  They will only be entitled to do so where a reciprocal Order is made by the Government in respect of the State concerned.  A new requirement as to registry is that a ship owned by persons qualified to own an Irish ship and acquired after the enactment of this Bill must be registered in the State unless consent is given to its registry outside the State.  This is a logical development of existing law which prohibits the transfer of an Irish ship to foreign registry without approval.  The inclusion of a provision whereby consent may be given to register outside the State is designed to permit persons qualified to own an Irish ship to acquire ships abroad, in circumstances where entry on or transfer to the Irish register is not practicable, for example, where ships in the registry of another country could not be acquired if transfer to the Irish register were insisted on.</P>
    <P>The provisions of Part I of the Merchant Shipping Act, 1894, in relation to transfers and transmissions of ownership in ships and to shares in a ship and in relation to mortgages will be re-enacted in the Bill without any significant change.</P>
    <P>The existing law governing the survey and tonnage measurement of ships is contained in Part I of the Merchant Shipping Act, 1894.  In that Act the procedure for survey and tonnage measurement is set out in considerable detail.  While no substantial departure from the existing provisions is contemplated this Bill will include only the main principles of survey and tonnage measurement.  Matters of <Col N="627" /> detail will be dealt with by directions to be made from time to time as required.  The object of this change is to ensure flexibility.  The survey and tonnage measurement of ships is a matter affected by international agreement.  The existing rules for survey and tonnage measurement are at present being studied on an international basis and it is likely that the outcome of this study will result in changes being made which will have to be followed by this country.  The inclusion of only the main principles of survey and tonnage measurement in the Bill will enable whatever changes are approved of internationally to be put into effect in this country without the necessity of having recourse to further legislation.</P>
    <P>This Bill will repeal the Merchant Shipping Act, 1907, Part I of the Merchant Shipping Act, 1894, together with certain sections of Part II of that Act and of the Merchant Shipping Acts, 1906 and 1947.  The repealed sections will be re-enacted with amendments and adaptations as required in this Bill, which represents the first stage of the codification of Irish merchant shipping law.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I consider this measure a necessary measure in the light of the developments that have taken place here over a number of years.  As the Parliamentary Secretary has stated, when the original Acts were passed long ago, especially the Act of 1894, to which reference has been made, there was no concept of an independent mercantile marine for this country.  I feel sure <Col N="628" /> that such a thing was never even present to the minds of the farmers of that legislation.  Now, however, that we have won independence, dearly-won independence, in this country, we will have from time to time to take what steps we may think necessary to consolidate the independent position we have won and this Bill, therefore, can be described as another link in the chain of the consolidation of our economic independent position here.</P>
    <P>The measure makes provision for such things as the registration of Irish ships at our Irish ports.  That, of course, is as it should be, from, as I said, the point of view of upholding our economic independence here.  There is also involved the transfer of ownership of ships, the execution of mortgages and so on.  These will be matters that will arise in the course of the operation of the measure.  It is a good thing to see our own Irish ships being registered at our ports and to see the Irish flag flying from those ships, but there is one point I should like to make clear, and it is that it is a pity we would not go the whole hog and have these Irish ships registered in our native language, for all those people who trade on the high seas to see so as to make known to them that we have a language of our own.  There would be no better way of doing that than by having the name of the ship emblazoned in Irish characters on the timbers of the vessel.  That is a point I should like to make <i>en passant.</i></P>
    <P>I may be regarded in some places as being too extreme in these matters, but we have sometimes to be extreme when it is a question of the recognition of our national position here.  We are taking steps to make sure that our independence as a nation will be recognised by people outside, in the matter of the registration of our ships and so on, and I think we should also take steps to ensure that our national language will also be recognised outside as well as at home.  It would be just as easy, I submit, to use the Irish equivalents of the names at present being used by Irish Shipping, Limited. I will go no further than that with that point.</P>
    <P>It would be appropriate in connection <Col N="629" /> with our consideration of this measure to inquire what progress we are making towards the development of our merchant fleet; the development of our own mercantile marine, which, as Senators may recall, was one of the fundamental aims of Sinn Fein&mdash;to make sure that we would have ships here capable of shipping merchandise between this country and countries abroad.  We have made some progress, and indeed very good progress within recent years but I think I would be right in saying that there is a certain amount of leeway yet to be made up, and it would be interesting and enlightening if the Parliamentary Secretary would give us an indication of the distance we have gone in providing ocean-going vessels, specialised ships, ships of a specialised nature, such as tankers and ships for the carrying of the various types of merchandise.  In that connection also, I should like to ask what now is the position with regard to the passenger service between this country and Britain.  That is very important for our tourist trade and has been referred to here already on more than one occasion.</P>
    <P>I am aware the Minister has had discussions with the authorities on the other side of the Channel and I would like to find out if he is satisfied now that all will be well with that passenger service, so that the complaints which have arisen in the past will not continue to operate as an impediment to the development of our tourist industry.  When we discussed this question the last time, I referred to the advisability of taking steps to get some part in the ownership of the passenger shipping services.  At present the whole thing is one-sided and it appears to me that the authorities across the water lay down whatever rules and regulations they like to suit themselves and ignore any complaints that we may make.  Because of that undesirable one-sided position, I would like the Government, when it thinks the time is appropriate, to consider this very important matter.</P>
    <P>This is not a controversial measure and it has been under consideration for a considerable length of time.  In conclusion, I wish to say that the provisions <Col N="630" /> in the measure are necessary and therefore they are welcome.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>In the Dáil, this measure was accepted, I think, as an agreed measure by Government and Opposition.  Like Senator Kissane, I have no intention of speaking at length.  I have found that, amongst some of the smaller shipowners, there is some concern in regard to the sections of this Bill which deal with ships which are registered in the Republic.  I do not understand the Bill sufficiently to be quite certain as to what restrictions are placed on the disposal of ships, but I am told that if smaller shipowners are restricted in their market to the Republic, it will be exceedingly difficult, if not impossible, for them to dispose of the older ships in their fleet and get new replacements.</P>
      <P>Section 18 deals with the obligation to register ships owned by Irish citizens and Irish bodies corporate and sub-section (3) would appear to make it possible for Irish nationals to have their ships registered outside this country, but, after they do so, they will not enjoy the protection they would be entitled to otherwise under the Act.  On the other hand, Section 19 states that the Government may, by Order, declare a particular State to be a reciprocating State, if they are of opinion that it would be in the national interest to do so.  The Bill does not appear to contain any clear definition of a reciprocating State, and I wonder if the Parliamentary Secretary would tell us what States are in mind under that section. For instance, does it mean that any of the former members of the British Commonwealth to which he referred in his opening remarks would be considered at present as reciprocating States?  Does it mean that an Irish owner could have a ship registered in the United Kingdom and still enjoy the full protection of this Bill?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important for the Minister to consider this problem of the replacement of the fleet, because it has been the problem which most of the smaller nations in Europe have had to face in recent years.  They found in practice <Col N="631" /> that, if there is great restriction on the transfer of the older units of the fleet, it becomes impossible to obtain up-to-date replacements.</P>
    <P>There is one other section of the Bill which deals with the transfer of ships. Possibly when the Parliamentary Secretary is replying, he would make clear what conditions will be imposed on Irish citizens, or on non-Irish citizens who are mentioned in Section 19, if they join with Irish citizens, or with non-Irish citizens, in owning ships registered here or registered in other ports.</P>
    <P>There is also the sale of ships. Would the Minister have the sole right to give permission or refuse it in the case of a ship being transferred outside the State?  I think this Bill has been welcomed generally by the shipowners in this country as it is long overdue.  We greatly needed an up-to-date Mercantile Marine Bill to deal with this State and I think both Houses welcome its introduction.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrederickHawkins" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>Like previous speakers, I welcome the Bill.  I am very pleased that Irish shipping has made such progress in recent years as to warrant the introduction of this Bill to bring about a codification of our marine laws.  While we are pleased with that progress, there are some aspects to which I would like to direct attention.  I would like to know exactly what progress has been made by Irish Shipping Limited and what the future plans are in relation to strengthening the fleet.  I would also like to know whether the existing policy is to be continued in the future. This is an important matter, particularly for areas other than the Port of Dublin.  I understand that up to the present the ships owned and controlled by Irish Shipping are confined to the use of the Dublin port.  That may be due to the facilities there for vessels of their tonnage or to other reasons. I would suggest&mdash;and I think I would have the feeling of the House with me &mdash;that the aim of an Irish shipping company should be to decentralise its activities so as to make use of the facilities available in other ports and <Col N="632" /> give employment there, rather than confine all the activities to Dublin.</P>
      <P>Senator Kissane mentioned the importance of Irish control of our passenger services.  This is a very serious matter.  This Parliament makes a very generous contribution to the development of our tourist industry.  We have seen year after year a total disregard in catering for those tourists at the particular time of the year when it should be most important that all facilities be made available to them. I refer to the passenger service at Dún Laoghaire.  Every year, despite the protests and representations by various Ministers for Industry and Commerce and the various promises made by the cross-Channel shipping companies, these things recur at the time when there is the greatest influx of visitors.</P>
      <P>People are not going to put up with that kind of treatment when they can be catered for much better by going to the Continent.  They will not travel to places where they are treated like cattle for export.  In fact, there are more regulations for the shipping of cattle than there are for the people who come in through this particular service.  The promises made and the representations made up to the present have been ineffective.  The time has arrived, now that we are spending so much on tourist development, when this particular service to Britain should be owned and controlled by an Irish company, if for no other reason than the interest of the tourist industry.</P>
      <P>In conclusion, I stress again the need to utilise other ports&mdash;Galway, Drogheda and so on.  The decentralisation would be very useful in times of emergency in the future and if they are not used now in peacetime, they cannot come into operation immediately some emergency occurs.  Apart from that, the distribution of goods would be less costly and employment would be given and maintained in those areas.  That should be carefully considered by Irish Shipping, Limited.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ArthurCox" hpid="Mr. Cox Mr. Cox">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>There are some small points that occur to me and it might be proper to state them for the Minister's <Col N="633" /> consideration.  The designation of an Irish body corporate might be open to question.  If it is a body corporate established under and subject to the law of the State and having a physical place of business in the State, it occurs to me that technically that definition might apply to a company which has complied with the provisions of the Companies Acts and established an office here and possibly uses that office as its principal place of business.  I am drawing attention to this merely to ask the Minister to consider it, if he has not already done so.</P>
      <P>In Section 11 it is provided that:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;No flag distinctive of nationality shall be hoisted on an Irish ship other than the proper national colours.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I understand it is a courtesy rule of the sea that a ship leaving for a foreign port hoists on her foremast the flag of the country to which it is proceeding and flies its own flag on the stern mast.  I am ignorant of such matters and I do not know whether that section could possibly interfere with that rule of courtesy.</P>
      <P>A more important point is contained in Section 16 which defines the persons qualified to own registered ships. It includes an Irish citizen and an Irish body corporate as defined in the Act, but it does not apply to a person who might be resident here for a long time but who is not an Irish citizen.  I quite understand that such a person would be covered possibly under the reciprocating section, but there might be a person who had been long resident here, say, for four or five years. Provision has been made for such matters in the Control of Manufactures Acts and similar Acts.  I do not know whether the Minister may think it wise to cover such persons in this Bill.  I take it that it is a desirable thing that, subject to proper safeguards, there should be as many ships as possible registered under the Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 26 contains provisions as to the marking of ships, which I think are the normal provisions that have always existed; but the marking of <Col N="634" /> the Plimsoll line is not mentioned.  I do not know whether that will be dealt with in the other Bill to which the Minister refers.  This Bill seems to have been carefully drawn and it has the great merit of making the law of this country master in its own shipping business.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I think this House should pay a tribute to the foresight of the then Minister and his civil servants during the war, who by their enterprise and activity were able to establish an Irish shipping company in the midst of the war.  It was an achievement for which this country should be very grateful to them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaureenOCarroll" hpid="Dr. ffrench O'Carroll Dr. ffrench O'Carroll">
      <NameTxt>Dr. ffrench O'Carroll</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill has been described as an agreed measure, so there is no necessity for a protracted discussion.  It codifies existing legislation.  It is a happy state of affairs to find that the expansion of our own Irish merchant shipping has been largely responsible for the necessity to introduce this Bill.  There is one question I have to ask&mdash;and perhaps if I had gone into the Bill more carefully, I would know the answer. Does the Minister consider that the position of Irish shipping, in the event of another war, would be not less favourable than it was during the last war, with the legislation as it was?  In other words, does our own Mercantile Bill in any way affect the position of our shipping in a future world war?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OwenSkeffington" hpid="Dr. Sheehy Skeffington Dr. Sheehy Skeffington">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>There are just two points I should like to raise, in the spirit of the last two speakers, for the purpose of clarification rather than for any other reason.  First, I rise very tentatively because, like Senator Cox, I can claim no knowledge of the language of the sea.  He referred, I noticed, to the showing of the national colours.  I notice that, in Sections 9 and 10 of the Bill, the phrase used is &ldquo;to wear the proper national colours&rdquo;. I should like a reassurance from the Parliamentary Secretary that this is, in fact, the usual term used at sea&mdash; that a ship wears a flag rather than shows or displays it.</P>
      <P>My other point is in relation to Section 3, which I confess I do not understand.  It reads as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="635" />&ldquo;This Act shall not apply to ships of the Naval Service of the Defence Forces which are wholly manned by personnel of that service.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I am not sure just what is meant by the last clause.  Does it mean that this Act shall not apply to ships of the Naval Service of the Defence Forces when they are wholly manned by the personnel of that service or does it mean since they are wholly manned? In other words, if somebody happens to be part of the personnel, temporarily, of one of these ships and does not happen to be in that service, does he by reason of that fact automatically and suddenly come within the competence of this Act?</P>
    <P>I suggest that there would be no ambiguity if the words after &ldquo;which&rdquo; in the third clause were omitted.  As I say, I am not sure of the purpose of the third clause and I am not quite satisfied that a court of law will be clear as to the exact intention of the clause beginning &ldquo;which are&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamStanford" hpid="Professor Stanford Professor Stanford">
      <NameTxt>Professor Stanford</NameTxt>
      <P>There are just three small points I should like to raise on this Bill.  In the first place, I should like to support Senator Cox in relation to his query about not hoisting other flags.  My impression is the same as his, namely, that ships usually, as a matter of courtesy, wear the flag of another country when they are entering a port in that country.  It is the practice of the B. &amp; I. ships entering the Port of Dublin to fly the Irish flag at the foremast.  I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will consider amending this clause, if it precludes that act of courtesy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My second point concerns Section 32 which deals with ports of registry.  I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to tell the House what is the principle of selection in regard to these ports of registry.  The names are given in the Second Schedule, and I notice the omission of three ports which one would think would deserve this privilege, namely, Arklow, Dungarvan and Kinsale.  The last mentioned port was once the greatest port in the South of Ireland and is still a good port. The Minister has powers to extend the <Col N="636" /> list of ports of registry, but would it not be desirable to add such ports at this stage, if only as an honour to those good ports?</P>
    <P>The third matter concerns Section 93, sub-section (4).  I should like to ask the Parliamentary Secretary why this curious line of demarcation is stated&mdash;&ldquo;the continent of Europe between the River Elbe and Brest&rdquo;. Is it simply for information?  It does seem a rather curious line to choose.</P>
    <P>May I add just one other small point?  I think this Bill should not pass without a tribute to the work of the Irish shipping companies within the past few years in building up a fine fleet of Irish ships.  Nothing, I think, adds more to the honour of our country abroad than that good looking ships, well manned, should come in under the Irish flag.  Apart from the advantages of having a mercantile navy which would give employment to the more adventurous and more migratory citizens of our country, I think this matter of national prestige should be kept in mind.  The Minister should see to it that ships wearing the Irish flag are worthy of that flag, because it would mean a good deal for the good name of the country.  We should offer to the Irish Shipping Company&mdash;it is a company with which I have no direct influence&mdash;a tribute which I think is in the minds of many of us who live on the sea coast and who see those ships sailing past wearing the Irish flag.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to refer principally to the question of the cross-Channel traffic already mentioned in the debate.  We had a tradition in this country in regard to cross-Channel traffic until the City of Dublin Steam Packet Company went out of business. I believe that company was one of the most efficient companies and provided a cross-Channel service second to none.  It was a Dublin-run company and then it passed into the hands of the old London North-Eastern Railway Company.  To-day, we do not possess any cross-Channel passenger service between Britain and Ireland and it would be desirable for us to have such a service.  If a service were run, I imagine there would be reciprocal <Col N="637" /> services such as are run between France and Britain.  They are competing services and they have one enormous advantage in that national prestige is kept on its mettle, so to speak.  Neither the British nor the French want to permit either side to do any better than the other.</P>
      <P>If we had a reciprocal service here, it would mean that the Irish and British would be put on their mettle, too, and the travelling public would be better served.  Earlier this year, when the Minister for Industry and Commerce was speaking on the Tourist Bill, I mentioned, as did Senator Hawkins to-day, difficulties with regard to the Dún Laoghaire service.  I spoke about the desirability of using the southern ports rather than using the bottle-neck through Dún Laoghaire.  With the Minister's good wishes, I took up the matter with the chairman of C.I.E. and also with the chief officer of the western region in Britain.  As a result, I have since had discussions with the British representative here.  He tells me that the services to Rosslare, Waterford and Cork will be speeded up in each direction by 1½ hours from next summer.</P>
      <P>During the war, we had only the one service and it became popular to pass through Dún Laoghaire, whereas there was an equally fine service, via the three southern ports of Rosslare, Waterford and Cork, but it was neglected.  The people on the other side are now apparently aware of that disability and we are going to get a competing service in the South with Dublin from this out.</P>
      <P>With regard to entering the cross-Channel service, you would meet great difficulties.  One such difficulty, I imagine, would be the provision of boats during the time others are under repair.  The British run such a large number of ships from Hull all around to the Clyde that they always have a reserve of ships available for any emergency. That is a difficulty, I believe, that we will experience here.  If we were running only two ships, we would be put in the position of having one or two in reserve and that might not be good for us from an economic point of view until Irish shipping has developed to a far greater extent than it has.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="638" /> I think it would not be right to let this opportunity pass without paying a tribute to the Minister and the officials of his Department for the wonderful work they did with regard to Irish shipping.  I think the good work that has been started will be carried on and that our Irish ships will be able to carry goods and services for us at competitive prices.  That is an all-important matter in our economy.  Everybody will welcome this Bill.  I think the Department has done a tremendous task in codifying a large body of mercantile laws. They must have expended a great deal of energy on carrying out such a job in a short measure such as this.  I am sure that all engaged in shipping in the present and in the future will be deeply grateful to the Minister for the work he has done.</P>

      <P>In my opinion, it is about time that we thought more seriously about this matter of shipping.  I did not like to hear the remark passed by Senator Burke when he spoke about the proposition being uneconomic.  We in Cork were anxious to get ships, but the answer we all received was that it was not an economic proposition.  When the war came, we saw the situation we had to face without ships.  Before the first world war, we had a very efficient fleet of ships doing cross-Channel trade and although we had people who had sufficient money, unfortunately, they had not the courage to purchase ships.  Had they purchased the ships then, we would have a cross-Channel service of our own now.</P>
      <P>As a matter of interest, the first ship to cross the Atlantic was built in Cork. Let us not worry about the difficulties we may have to face in the future in regard to having a cross-Channel service and let the problem of getting such a service not deter us from going ahead.  I am anxious to know the number of ships we have under construction at the moment.  I feel that we have not sufficient ships being built. When I consider the amount of employment a number of ships can give by way of servicing and so on, I like to estimate how many workers would be employed in the handling of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="639" /> I remember the late Mr. Thomas Dowdall and his brother, James.  They played their part in trying to provide an Irish merchant fleet.  During the last war, we were short of coke.  Some of our factories were on the point of being closed down.  Two gentlemen went to Scotland and I happened to meet them on their way back.  They told me that there were stocks of coke to be had, but that we had no ships.</P>
    <P>It is a pity that we have not a ship of our own to deal with the cattle trade.  I would also suggest that we should go in very much more for coasting vessels and I would like to hear from the Parliamentary Secretary what is being done in regard to the question of building tankers, especially in view of what may happen in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCrosbie" hpid="Mr. Crosbie Mr. Crosbie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crosbie</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with Senators Cox and Stanford in drawing the Parliamentary Secretary's attention to Section 11, the section dealing with the prohibition of hoisting colours other than national colours.  I believe, in common with those Senators, that it is the custom of the sea, out of courtesy, to hoist on the foremast the colours of the nation into whose port a ship is about to enter.  It is possible that this section would need to be slightly amended to cover such international conventions and courtesies.</P>
      <P>Like Senator Douglas, I, too, would like some information from the Parliamentary Secretary on the question of the sale of Irish registered ships to prospective vendors who are outside Ireland.  As Senator Douglas says, this is of prime importance in the case of smaller ships, including yachts.  I seem to remember that at one period after the war, if one wanted to dispose of even a sailing yacht, it was necessary to get a special permit from the Minister for Industry and Commerce that the vessel had been registered in Ireland.  I think, perhaps, the Parliamentary Secretary could give the House some information in regard to what the position would be under this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In conclusion, I would like to support the remarks of Senator Hickey <Col N="640" /> about the further expansion of our Irish owned fleet, whether owned by Irish Shipping or private enterprise. This is not the first time that I have referred to this matter in this House and advocated more ships and tankers.</P>
    <P>I might also point out to the House that a very small nation, no larger than our own, Norway, has for many years lived well on the proceeds of her mercantile fleet.  Before the first world war, the Norwegian mercantile fleet was second in size only to that of the United Kingdom.  She lives well with this enormous mercantile fleet, not because of the goods that Norway carries&mdash;she is a comparatively poor country&mdash;but because her fleet is very often chartered.  We are still in this country in the unhappy position that many of our Irish ships leave our Irish ports for ports on the other side of the world for the purpose of bringing back valuable cargoes to us, but, unfortunately, as we have not a two-way trade with these ports, our ships have to sail to the far side of the world empty or in ballast.  I feel that if there was a lot more flexibility and a little more commercial blood in the board and management of Irish Shipping, that difficulty might be got over, and we should be able in the world to-day to pick up charter cargoes for our outward ships.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LouisWalsh" hpid="Mr. L. Walsh Mr. L. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Cox has referred to the definition of an Irish corporate body and says it may limit the number of ships which could be registered in the State.  He was inclined to suggest that the definition should be amended in order to permit more ships to be registered in this State.  I should like to know if this Bill also relates to the fishing fleet.  At the moment, Scottish drifters have become registered in Dublin and are now fishing, ringing herring on the coast of Donegal, to the detriment of the inshore fishermen there.  If the definition is widened, I suggest it will encourage further fishing vessels to come in and exploit the fishing beds along our coast.</P>
      <P>I am not sure if this Bill affects this particular type of boat, but if it does, I ask the Minister to retain at least the definition set out in the Bill.</P>

      <P>The Bill is an agreed measure, but there are several points to be cleared up.  Senator Kissane asked about ships registered in Irish names.  It is open to any shipowner to register an Irish name and the only requirement is that the same name be not already in use on another ship.  He asked also about the cross-Channel services.  Good progress has been made and I believe that, during the past year, there was not such a hold up as we had up to that time.  There have been negotiations by the Minister during the past year to improve the services further during the coming season.  We are all very anxious that proper services should be provided between Dún Laoghaire and Holyhead. The Minister has had several conferences and negotiations on that point.  The Senator also inquired about Irish Shipping Limited acquiring further tonnage.  The Government decided to direct Irish Shipping&mdash;during the past couple of months&mdash;to acquire two further tankers; and Irish Shipping have placed orders for them.</P>
      <P>Senator Douglas asked about the transfer of ships.  This is the same as in the 1947 Act.  Provided a person cannot get sale in the home country for these ships, the Minister will not be unreasonable in withholding permission for sale in any other country.</P>
      <P>Senator Hawkins asked about definitions of bodies corporate.  This is a legal point.  I will have inquiries made into it and I will send Senator Hawkins my reply.  He also asked about the flying of the Irish flag.  This section is the same as in the 1947 Act. It means that, apart from other flags, Irish ships must fly the Irish flag.  It does not prohibit other flags.</P>
      <P>Senator ffrench O'Carroll asked if this Bill affected the position of our shipping in time of war.  It does not do so directly, but it does mean that the national status and rights will be clear beyond dispute.</P>
      <P>Senator Sheehy Skeffington asked about Section 3.  This Bill does not apply to the actual naval ships, but it does apply to ferry-boats and others which are owned by the Navy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="642" /> Senator Stanford inquired about increasing the number of ports in which Irish ships could be registered.  Increasing the number of ports would mean the employment of more permanent full-time customs officers.  We have at present Cork, Drogheda, Dublin, Dundalk, Galway, Limerick, Skibbereen, Sligo, Tralee, Waterford, Westport and Wexford.  I do not think it would be an easy matter to increase the number.</P>
    <P>Senator Stanford raised a question on Section 93 about the Brest and the Elbe.  Paragraph (a) there defines the home trade.  The Brest and the Elbe are always included traditionally as home trade ports and vessels plying between the home trade limits are subject to less stringent regulations as to safety equipment and certificated personnel.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Crotty)</NameTxt>
      <P>The main purpose of the Bill is to enable the Board of C.I.E. to raise the finance necessary for the rehabilitation of the railway system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The railway system which the board inherited in 1950 had, through years of neglect, fallen into a general state of disrepair, much of the operating equipment being obsolete and ill-fitted to meet modern transport needs; no locomotives had been built since 1937 and no coaches since 1939; the number of wagons built had been far short of requirements and the permanent way had been neglected.  In addition to these physical disabilities, the board were faced with the ever-growing competition from road transport which threatened the very existence of the <Col N="643" /> railways.  The task before the board of rebuilding the railway system to meet modern requirements was indeed an unenviable one which required a high degree of enterprise, foresight and courage for its accomplishment.</P>
    <P>The board applied themselves with vigour to the task before them.  Having carefully surveyed the overall position the board came to the conclusion that nothing less than a complete renewal of the rail operating equipment would save the undertaking from total collapse, and that the undertaking could only be put on an economic footing by an almost complete change over from steam to diesel traction.  The wisdom of the board in plumping for diesel traction has perhaps been nowhere more clearly illustrated than in the recent decision of the British Transport Commission to change over to diesel traction in the very home of coal.</P>
    <P>As a first step towards the rehabilitation of the undertaking the board prepared a programme of capital works in May, 1952, costing £2,500,000, which have already been largely carried out. Included in this programme were a number of diesel railcars which since their introduction have proved their worth both in their contribution towards the financial improvement of the board and in their appeal to the travelling public.</P>
    <P>In 1953, the former Government approved of a ten-year dieselisation and reorganisation programme drawn up by the board, which involved an almost complete change over to diesel traction, the renewal of a considerable proportion of the existing rolling-stock and the improvement of certain stations with a view to a more expeditious and economical handling of merchandise. The cost of this programme was estimated at £10,650,000.  At the same time C.I.E. were authorised to proceed with the development of a suitable type of locomotive capable of burning either turf of oil.  It was proposed that, when a suitable prototype had been developed, 50 of these locomotives should be constructed by C.I.E. at an estimated cost of £1,000,000.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="644" /> In addition to these capital programmes, expenditure of the order of about £250,000 per annum will arise on the provision of capital additions required for the normal development of the undertaking.</P>
    <P>Under the Transport Act of 1950, the capital borrowing power of C.I.E. is at present limited to £7,000,000.  A stock issue of £2,500,000 was made in 1953 to finance the programme of capital works drawn up in May, 1952.  A further issue of stock for £4,500,000 to finance part of the dieselisation and reorganisation programme was made in April, 1955, thus exhausting the board's existing borrowing power.  To enable the board to finance their capital development over the next three or four years it is proposed to increase their capital borrowing powers from £7,000,000 to £12,000,000, and provision is made to this effect in Section 2 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>As Senators are aware, the financial position of C.I.E. has already shown a considerable improvement due largely to the introduction of diesel rail cars to the system.  The board expect, as a result of the more complete change to diesel traction and the general reorganisation programme, to be in a position within a few years to meet all revenue charges other than interest on transport stock.  They hope to reach a position of complete solvency within a few further years.</P>
    <P>In view of the improvement expected in the board's finances, the payment of subsidy by the State, which had come to be regarded by many as an inevitable feature of our public transport system, has now been discontinued and it is proposed that any losses which the board might incur within the next few years should be met by short-term borrowing which may be guaranteed as necessary by the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>The existing statutory limit on temporary borrowing by the board is £1,000,000 and the amount which may be guaranteed by the Minister for Finance is limited to £500,000.  Section 2 of the Bill provides that the board may borrow up to a maximum of £1,500,000 on a short-term basis and Section 3 provides that the Minister <Col N="645" /> for Finance may guarantee such borrowing up to a limit of £1,000,000.</P>
    <P>The prospect of a modern, efficient and self-supporting transport undertaking will be welcomed by all sections of the community.  It will be particularly welcomed by the railway employees. Their position in the tottering organisation of C.I.E. in the past has not been an enviable one.  Over a number of years the collapse of the railway system had been averted only by the substantial contributions of the taxpayers.  The recurring deficits of the concern could only have meant for the railway worker growing insecurity and instability of employment.  The reorganisation of the system should in time bring about that secure and stable employment which can only be provided by a self-supporting concern.</P>
    <P>The main economy to be secured from diesel traction is in fuel costs, but there is also some reduction in staff requirements.  The Minister has had discussions with representatives of both sides of the industry in this matter and he has made it clear that the redundancy involved should be kept to a minimum and that the problem should be approached with the utmost humanity.  He has been assured by the board that everything possible will be done to minimise the problem and to provide redundant workers with alternative employment. The board expects that a number of the redundant employees will be absorbed on the construction of the turf/oil locomotives and on the carriage and wagon programme which are part of the reorganisation scheme.  I have every hope that between new work and normal wastage most of the redundant men can be absorbed.</P>
    <P>If, however, cases arise in which the board are unable to provide alternative employment provision is made in Section 4 of the Bill for the payment of compensation for loss of employment to the employee concerned. Provision is also made in Section 4 for the payment of compensation where an employee suffers a worsening of his conditions on transfer from one position to another on grounds of redundancy.  Compensation is, however, confined to permanent <Col N="646" /> employees and employees with three years' continuous service with the board as is the case under the Transport Act, 1950.</P>
    <P>On 30th November, 1949, the Dáil authorised the payment to C.I.E. (1945) of a repayable advance for capital expenditure amounting to £2,462,369.  In view of the financial difficulties which the present board have been obliged to meet since their establishment in 1950, there has been no repayment of principal or payment of interest on this advance.  While the efforts of the board have resulted in a substantial improvement in the financial position of the undertaking, there seems to be little prospect that they will be in a position to discharge this liability in the foreseeable future.  The Government have decided that in order to assist the board in their efforts to achieve solvency they should now be relieved of this burden of debt. Section 5 of the Bill provides that the advance in question should now be treated as a non-repayable grant.</P>
    <P>The provisions of Sections 6 to 8 of the Bill are of minor importance.  They are designed to remove some legal difficulties and anomalies which have emerged in the course of the operation of the existing legislation governing the abandonment of railway lines on which all services have been terminated. I do not propose to deal with them in detail now, but if there are any matters which Senators may wish to raise in regard to these sections they can be discussed on the Committee Stage of the Bill.</P>
    <P>In recommending this Bill to the House, I am sure that every Senator will wish to facilitate the recovery now being made by our national transport system.  As I have said, the primary function of the Bill is to enable C.I.E. to proceed with their capital programme which, I am confident, will lead to an efficient self-supporting public transport system so vital to our agricultural, industrial, commercial and tourist needs.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrederickHawkins" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>In his opening remarks, the Parliamentary Secretary suggested that the principal reason for <Col N="647" /> this Bill was that it was essential to spend a considerable sum of money to enable C.I.E. to give efficient services and that that was necessitated, in the main, by the lack of expenditure in the years 1939 to 1947. It is only fair that, when we are discussing a Bill of this kind, and particularly when the Parliamentary Secretary thought fit to refer to this particular purpose, we should have regard and appreciation for the fact that the services were maintained at all during the emergency years from 1939 to 1947 and that during that period the programme that is now being put into operation was drawn up.</P>
      <P>The late board&mdash;which was removed by a Bill passed through this House, and a new board established&mdash;had recommended to the then Minister&mdash; and the then Minister had approved&mdash; going over from steam, from turf or coal burning locomotives to diesel.  One of the first acts of the first Coalition Government was to issue an ultimatum to the board not to proceed on those lines.  The reasons given then were that the financial position would not warrant it.  The board's case at the time was that in order to give efficient services, in order to attract the people back to the rails, it was essential that sums of money be expended.  The previous Government had felt that it was their duty to maintain the rail system and to make provision for finding the moneys that would be necessary.  I would not have referred to this particular period were it not for the opening statement of the Parliamentary Secretary in introducing this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill is a very simple one, as has been pointed out to us.  It provides that C.I.E. borrowing powers be extended from £7,000,000 to £12,000,000 and the State naturally enough acts as guarantor for those moneys.  Not having the technical knowledge or the advice the Minister or the Parliamentary Secretary has, we are not, therefore, in a position to give any verdict on whether the amount should be greater or less.  I think we all agree it is essential, if the railways are to be maintained, that they must be put in <Col N="648" /> a position to give an efficient service and the purpose of the Bill is to authorise C.I.E. to raise this money.</P>
    <P>I should like to hear from the Parliamentary Secretary, and I am sure that Senator Hickey would also like to hear, what will be the rate of interest on this money.  Over a long number of years now, we have been listening to this matter of the high rate of interest. In recent weeks, the E.S.B., the Cork Corporation and the Dublin Corporation have borrowed money at the exorbitant rate of 5 per cent. and a rate of even 6 per cent. and 6½ per cent. was demanded.  We have had to pay for the subsidisation of tea over the past 12 months.  We have had all this high interest, in spite of the fact that we were promised cheap money.  As a matter of fact, I felt at one time that Senator Hickey must have converted not only the members of his own Party but all the Parties forming the Government to this idea of cheap money.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not even convert the Senator's Party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrederickHawkins" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be no harm at this stage if the Parliamentary Secretary would give us some idea as to how the moneys will be borrowed; whether they will be borrowed on short or long term; and the rate of interest we may be called upon to pay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The next matter I should like to refer to is the provision of £1,000,000 to build 50 locomotives capable of burning turf or oil.  I am not satisfied that the people responsible in C.I.E. are enthusiastic about this proposal, because, if they were, much greater progress should have been made since this authorisation was first given.  As has already been stated in the House, it is a form of insurance to ensure that, in the event of another emergency, we would be in a position to run our trains with turf burning locomotives. If that position should not arise, they are to build in such a way that they can normally use oil.  Apart from the insurance value, my interest in the question would be the amount of employment this work would give.  If I understand it correctly, the transfer <Col N="649" /> to the diesel system will result in a very serious position for a number of our workers here.  I feel that if the people responsible for this particular work in C.I.E. were a little more enthusiastic about this, much greater progress would have been made.</P>
    <P>With regard to the provision of the £12,000,000, the Parliamentary Secretary has already given us an outline of what the expenditure is to be on.  I should particularly like, through the Parliamentary Secretary, to draw the attention of the Board of C.I.E. to a situation which has continued all down the years.  As a matter of fact, it would be a miracle if one could influence the people who have been responsible for the direction of rail services in this country, particularly in connection with the treatment meted out to the West of Ireland down through the years.</P>
    <P>It has been the policy to pick up whatever scrap there may be in the form of wagons, carriages and engines and just throw them to the people of the West of Ireland, saying these are good enough for the people there.  We spend a lot of money on the tourist business and the West of Ireland is one of the greatest attractions, from the tourist point of view.  The people responsible in C.I.E. should be encouraged from what we say in this House to change their approach to the people in the West of Ireland and to ensure that the West will get its fair share of whatever new carriages and other amenities are to be made available in order to provide a better service.  I am not asking that special consideration be given to the West, but only that they get their fair share.  We should not search all the scrap-heaps up and down the country and throw their contents into the West of Ireland.</P>
    <P>The same remarks apply to the bus service and the transport service.  The idea seems to be that anything at all is good enough for the West of Ireland and I think that attitude should be changed.  Here again economy was put forward as the reason.  We were told that it was going to give more efficiency.  That has not proved to be the case.  The double line from Galway to Dublin was taken up some years ago and a promise was made that that line <Col N="650" /> would be relaid.  You cannot have an efficient service from here to the West of Ireland while you have only a single line to operate on.  I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary whether there would be any chance that some of the moneys we are providing now would be spent upon laying down this line.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it all single line?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrederickHawkins" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>Not all the way.  The other important aspect of this question is that the transfer from steam to deisel is going to result in a very large number of employees of C.I.E. being rendered redundant.  Of course, the Parliamentary Secretary naturally enough passes over this matter very briefly by referring to the fact that compensation will be paid in accordance with the Schedule of the 1950 Act.  It seems to suggest that he feels the numbers will be rather small and that alternative employment will be found.</P>
      <P>That statement does not seem to be exactly in accordance with what the Board of C.I.E. have estimated.  I think they estimate that about 40 per cent. of the employees in the operational service of C.I.E. will be redundant and about 20 per cent. in their workshops.  As regards this matter of redundant employees, we are dealing with human beings, people who, over a period of three years in their employment, may have settled down.  It will be a rather difficult problem to find alternative employment for them.  But what is more difficult still, you have so many different sections of the trade union organisations catering for these people.  We should induce the Board of C.I.E. to approach this question in a very humane way and not just take up the attitude that Parliament has embodied Section 3 in the Bill and that if they cannot offer alternative employment, they will give compensation in accordance with the provisions made in this particular Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are many approaches that could be made to them.  I expect that the representatives of the trade union organisation in this House will deal more fully with the matter than I wish to do at the moment.  I am merely drawing the attention of the Parliamentary <Col N="651" /> Secretary to the problem in an endeavour to strengthen his hand in the approach to both the trade union organisations and the employers in this case.  The offering of compensation to many of those people will be of very little use, because the sum will be so small.  I would suggest that one of the approaches could be that those people who are near the retiring age could be induced to retire by stepping up the years and giving them the pensions they would be entitled to.</P>
    <P>Such a step would be to the benefit of the younger people who have come in and who have greater responsibilities probably than those people who have spent a number of years in their employment.  In that way, we might be able to solve some small portion of this problem.  I feel, from past experience of organisations like C.I.E., that, once we pass this Bill and in spite of all the assurances the Parliamentary Secretary may give us, the attitude of C.I.E. will be that they cannot find alternative employment.  You will have them putting the case that they are fulfilling their obligations under an Act passed in Parliament by giving the workmen what they are entitled to under the particular section.</P>
    <P>You could offer employment to people that would be such that they could not reasonably accept that offer. Take the case of people, with their wives and families, who are employed in Dublin.  They could be offered employment in some remote part of the country, probably in Cork or Galway, and the remuneration they would receive from C.I.E. would not be sufficient to maintain themselves and their families.  I think we should impress on the Parliamentary Secretary and, through him the Board of C.I.E., that they must approach this question from a humane point of view.</P>
    <P>Of course, the whole responsibility does not rest with the Board of C.I.E. The various branches of the trade union organisations catering for these particular people will also have to play their part in a very humane way and deal with every case on its merits, as it arises, rather than lay down a hard <Col N="652" /> and fast set of rules by which one employee, because he belonged to one particular section of the organisation, cannot be transferred to another section.</P>
    <P>I should also like to ask the Parliamentary Secretary to give us some assurance in regard to the statements we have read in the paper in the last few days in connection with the Sligo/Leitrim railway and the proposal to continue that service for six months.  The Parliamentary Secretary should give us some assurance that every avenue will be explored to ensure that this very essential service &mdash;and every rail service in any part of the country is essential, but in this particular part of the country, it is more essential than in any other part &mdash;will be kept open, not for six months, but permanently, and that everything the Government can do will be done to ensure that that will be the position.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamFearon" hpid="Professor Fearon Professor Fearon">
      <NameTxt>Professor Fearon</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two factors in this Bill which are very excellent and desirable in themselves. First, when its enactment is completed, it will remove a very important aspect of our activity from what I regard as the insidious and dangerous zone of State subsidy.  The second thing is the limit now set on the borrowing. Though it may seem an enormous sum to the individual, it is a sum which will mean that an appeal will have to be made to the Oireachtas in the course of a few years' time.  That has to me at least the great advantage that it means that the railway situation will be brought before us and we will be given an opportunity of discussing it. As far as I see it, we will be given an opportunity to discuss this rail transport problem at intervals.  That is a very important thing indeed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was rather sorry that the Parliamentary Secretary did not say a little more about the railway problem in general, so that we could see it against its wider background and know exactly what shape the policy is taking.  For example, we have the railway competing against the steadily increasing danger of road transport and air transport, and sooner or later. some conditions of mutual survival <Col N="653" /> will presumably have to be agreed upon.</P>
    <P>Another thing is this question of the means of locomotion.  The introduction of the diesel transmission system has justified itself, but a very interesting feature of the proposal before us is the expenditure of quite a large sum of money on these experimental turf-oil locomotives.  I would like to know something more about that.  It is proposed, I believe, to construct 50 of them.  Is it the intention of the company to have the 50 running on oil fuel more or less continuously and then, if an emergency should arise, to switch over to turf; or are these oil-turf &ldquo;yokes&rdquo;&mdash;if I may be permitted to call this apparatus by its common name&mdash;simply to be kept experimental, and is the Minister satisfied that they are going to fulfil their function?</P>
    <P>It is extremely hard to imagine any type of machine that can deal with a very portable liquid fuel such as oil and, at the same time, be capable of being transformed into a machine that would be adapted to a very bulky fuel of much lower heating value, namely, turf.  I should be most interested indeed to see one of these combination locomotives, and I hope the Seanad will be given an opportunity to have a trip on one.  We ought to hear a bit more about them.</P>
    <P>If we are going to concentrate on the diesel traction, electric hydraulic and diesel power traction, we would like to know something about the stores of oil in the country.  We ought to have proper and really good oil reserves.  I would like an idea of how long the country could run on our oil stores, should, for some reason, the oil tap be turned off.  We are running a risk in fixing ourselves so firmly to a particular type of imported fuel for which we cannot find a ready substitute.  Adequate reserves of oil are a most important consideration in connection with that transport programme.  The oil should be stored, not in large containers in ports, where it could be bombed and destroyed by fire, but in properly selected sites, through safe parts of the country.  The question of oil is a very important one <Col N="654" /> indeed and this Transport Bill gives one the opportunity of mentioning it.</P>
    <P>Senator Hawkins warmed my heart by a couple of his references.  He referred to some of the old coaches that served the western part of our country.  I have seen some of those pathetically old locomotives and coaches dying on the road like a tinker's horse.  I think it is a very sad sight from every point of view.  Some of the resources of C.I.E. should be expended in trying to preserve the appearance of some of them.  They look like the last relics of old decency which, when it was flourishing, was a very decent decency indeed.</P>
    <P>As regards the new coaches they build, they are extremely comfortable and very well sprung, but I wonder if the Minister is satisfied as to their durability.  They are very much lighter than the old coaches.  That gives them a much greater acceleration power, but will they stand up to the knocking of the years?  Will the repair bill be rather steep?</P>
    <P>Another matter to which Senator Hawkins referred was the redundancy which will arise partly because the new diesel traction will require a different type of driver and partly because the machinery will be imported and not assembled in this country.  Surely it should not be beyond our resources, and those of C.I.E., to have technicians trained here to carry out this work.  Some years ago, discussing technical and scientific education in this Chamber, I expressed the hope that some time C.I.E., with its long established and inherited traditions, would divert some of its power, its actual money and its opportunities for employment, to helping to train technical students and such people for this particular work.</P>
    <P>These are the only things I wish to say.  I think the removal of the transport system from State subsidy is excellent, and that the opportunity of having a periodical review of the entire rail-road problem of the Republic and beyond it is another excellent thing. When that opportunity for review arises again, I hope that we will take better advantage of it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill provides, among other things, for a lifting of the limit of the borrowing powers of the board.  That is to provide for the re-equipment of the railway system.  I think that from all sides of the House we would welcome such progress and the guarantee it gives that here, in this part of the country, at any rate, the railway system is not going to be abandoned, but rather expanded. Good work has already been done by C.I.E. in improving its passenger working by way of introduction of the new diesel rail cars.  What is perhaps needed, I understand, under its new capital expansion programme is, as well as building coaches and diesel electric and diesel hydraulic engines, the building of extra wagons and the improvement of goods store working. By that, it is hoped to reduce the operating costs in running goods trains and shifting goods and, at the same time, I hope, to get more traffic to the merchandise section of the railway. Whilst we welcome the improvement in the passenger working, I am sure we all appreciate that that comprises only a small section of the railway undertaking as a whole and has a rather small effect on the financial working.  The most important factor is the goods working and I am glad to see that it is proposed to improve that.</P>
      <P>I hope the building of the extra wagons and improvement of goods store facilities will be completed quickly, because I would like to think that, with this cut in operating costs, there will be an effort to induce more traffic to the railways.  That can best be done by quickening the goods service by way of vacuum brake wagons rather than the present system of goods leaving Dublin and, maybe, getting to Cork 24 or 48 hours later. There is a definite need for a quickening of the goods service, and I hope that that will be put in hand pretty quickly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to inducing more traffic to the railways, the Minister, I am sure, will have regard to the important influence that the traffic of State and semi-State undertakings can have on the C.I.E. finances.  Reference was made to that in a report by the trade unions on the working of C.I.E. some <Col N="656" /> years ago.  I am sure that the Minister does not think that it is a bit of a contradiction that we should be promoting the expansion of C.I.E., in the hope that it will remove any need for future subsidies, while other semi-State undertakings should be putting C.I.E. back into semi-bankruptcy, by not availing of public transport facilities. I appreciate that it is not always convenient for those other semi-State undertakings to avail of public transport, but there have been some glaring examples of the complete lack of understanding by those semi-State undertakings of the need of supporting public transport.</P>
    <P>I remember that, some years ago, C.I.E. engaged on a rather expensive undertaking of converting certain wagons to facilitate the E.S.B. in their programme of rural electrification. The E.S.B. said that they wanted a certain number of wagons to take poles throughout the country. Those wagons were converted, at a great expense, I should imagine, and, as soon as they were converted, the E.S.B. promptly bought their own lorries to take those poles around the country and left the wagons sitting there.  That seems to me to have been an extraordinary happening, and it is, to my mind, indicative to some extent of the attitude of other semi-State undertakings to the nationally owned public undertaking here.</P>
    <P>As well as the help to C.I.E. finances which can be provided by the provision of more adequate and more welcome facilities, I do think that the employees as such can contribute something. I suggest to the Minister that they are willing and anxious to contribute. We all know the pride that a railway man has in his job, whether he worked for the G.S. and W.R., the D.S.E.R., the M.G.W.R., or works now for C.I.E.  There is, and has been all the time, a definite pride in the job and in the company, or the nationalised board, as it is now.  I notice, too, that the Minister in some recent speeches has been recommending to employers generally the need and desirability of an exchange of views between management and staff or unions representing the staff; in other words, what we generally know as consultation. Certain boards of management, <Col N="657" /> and C.I.E., I suspect, to some extent, regard consultation as another form of dictation.  Of course, this is a rather deliberate twisting of the whole thing.  If consultation is mentioned, the attitude is that what you are requiring is not consultation, but simply the right to dictate to the management how they should do their job of managing the concern.  The Minister, I know, has a more enlightened view in regard to consultation, and when he speaks to employers generally about the need for the development of industrial democracy, I wish he would also direct his remarks to undertakings such as C.I.E. and, indeed, the G.N.R.</P>
    <P>I say this because I find that, in the employees of public transport at the moment, there is a belief that the undertaking is within sight of standing on its own feet.  There is a pride in the development which has taken place in the past few years and they want to be regarded&mdash;and I think they have a right to be regarded&mdash;as something more than merely hired hands.  They want to contribute of their experience and understanding and goodwill.  Of course, they expect in return to get back increased satisfaction in the performance of their work and greater pride in the public transport service, and&mdash;more important than all&mdash;in-increased self-respect.  I will not labour that point any further but, as the Minister has mentioned the need for consultation, the desirability of it, when speaking to employers generally, I am sure he will not take it amiss that I should ask him to address similar remarks to semi-State undertakings, and particularly to C.I.E.</P>
    <P>The effect of the change-over from steam to diesel traction on Inchicore and the other workshops of C.I.E. is going to be rather serious, unless very determined efforts are made to provide other work there.  The position formerly, as the House knows, was that most of those steam engines were built, from the wheels up, at Inchicore.  It is not possible, I believe, to construct the new diesel electric engines in the same way.  Inchicore has been kept going for a long time by the need for recurring and persistent repairs on the steam locomotives.  There will be <Col N="658" /> a saving not alone in fuel costs by those new diesels, but also in regard to repairs for a long number of years. Consequently, it can be readily seen that there will be less work available in the workshops, arising out of locomotives. I notice that in the debate in the Dáil mention was made of this, and I think the Minister did point out to C.I.E. the need for trying to get other work, particularly from other semi-State undertakings.  The Minister may recall that this is a subject which has concerned the T.U.C. for some years.  They always felt it rather odd that although there is a heavy industry owned by the public transport undertaking in the Republic, other semi&mdash;State undertakings should get their work done in Britain, or else trying to set up inadequate workshops of their own.  The Minister should persist in his efforts to get C.I.E. to secure this work for itself</P>
    <P>Mention was also made of the expansion of the British Transport Commission at the present time and their need for facilities to carry out quickly their capital programme.  Here might be an opportunity for C.I.E. to get some of this work under contract and thereby have it done here at Inchicore. Certainly it would seem a reversal of the whole former situation, if Inchicore could be, to some extent, building railway equipment for Britain.  I mention this because I have for some time suspected, as have other trade union people, that the board of C.I.E. regard Inchicore as a bit of a headache and would thank God if the whole thing was gone from there altogether. That may be all right from their point of view, but Inchicore and the workshops and facilities there are important to the nation.  The continued employment of the workers there is a matter of vital importance.</P>
    <P>Another effect of the change&mdash;over to diesel traction is the redundancy which will be created.  This redundancy arises primarily from the fact that the old steam locomotives carried a driver and fireman, as well as a whole host of people engaged on fire dropping and work in the loco sheds.  These people will no longer be required, with the introduction of the diesel locomotives, <Col N="659" /> which will require only a driver and will not call for the present large staffs at the depots.  All that gives rise to redundancy.  Some of those rendered redundant will be absorbed to some extent, but they in turn must cause redundancy in other sections.  Some people have made the point that difficulties would be created by trade unions because of their disagreement with the absorption of these redundant workers in other parts of the C.I.E. undertaking.  That is not, however, the whole picture.  As I have stated, many of the workers being absorbed will, in their turn, be displacing other workers and making them redundant in turn.</P>
    <P>C.I.E. has, I think, foreseen this problem of redundancy for some time past and has been employing an unusually large number of people on a temporary basis, declining to appoint them on a permanent basis until the change-over came along.  Those people would, as a consequence, be made redundant at the bottom of the scale. I cannot really see any cure for this situation, unless there is an increase in the traffic and a considerable expansion in the traffic.  It was all right to say that the people rendered redundant would be absorbed elsewhere, but there are hundreds of workers in C.I.E. who, in the past few years, have been employed on a temporary basis, pending this change-over to diesel traction, and they will all be paid off. In those circumstances, it appears obvious that these people could only be absorbed if there was a rapid expansion in the traffic available to C.I.E.</P>
    <P>Whatever might be said about the desire and the need for a humane approach by the management and the trade unions, nobody can suggest that there will not be redundancy amongst the people at the bottom of the scale, unless there is a very big expansion of the work done by C.I.E.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary referred to the improvement in the finances of C.I.E., arising out of the introduction of the diesel rail cars.  I wonder could he be more exact, because we have no information as to what the financial <Col N="660" /> position of C.I.E. is.  We are discussing this Bill in a bit of a vacuum, because Senators will know that the last annual report we have had was for the year ended March 31st, 1954.  In other words, the last information we have about the finances of C.I.E. is 20 months old.  We have not yet got the accounts for the year ended March, 1955.  Perhaps the Minister would tell us if we can expect the annual report this year or early next year.  It certainly seems to me to be scandalous that our public transport system cannot give this statement of its accounts within a period of eight months after the close of the financial year.  Are we going to get the accounts for the previous year on the eve of Christmas when we might not be disposed to examine them as critically as we might otherwise do?  I suggest to the Minister that the British Transport Commission, which is a much larger concern, can give its accounts in a much shorter period, and surely then C.I.E. could publish its report much earlier than it has been doing.  The same thing applies, so far as the G.N.R. is concerned.</P>
    <P>That is all I wish to say on the Bill, but I would ask the Minister to give us some information about the finances of the company and the improved financial results which can be expected from the introduction of diesel cars.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Stanford</NameTxt>
      <P>In his opening remarks, the Parliamentary Secretary described Sections 6 to 9 of this Bill as being of minor importance.  I suppose, in regard to the larger picture of the whole organisation of C.I.E., that is so, but I wonder whether Section 6, which refers to the abandonment of certain transport lines, might not ring the death knell of a line of transport well known and looked upon by many Dublin citizens with great regard.  I refer to the Hill of Howth tramways. To my mind, and to that of many others, I believe it would be very regrettable if this last relic of the Dublin tramway system was to be destroyed.  It will, I am afraid, be judged by C.I.E. entirely as a matter of transport, pure and simple; but I would urge that it is not a matter of <Col N="661" /> transport pure and simple.  I think that C.I.E. should consider the tourist value of that tramway line.  Its scenic attractions are well known to anyone who has been in that part of the country.  It would seem to me to be very regrettable if such a fine tourist attraction were to be obliterated, simply in the interests of transport. Its importance is not so much for the few dwellers on the Hill of Howth, who could get other means of transport, but as a valuable tourist attraction and that should be considered before any steps are taken under this section to deal with the trams on the Hill of Howth.</P>
      <P>What I should like to say in general is that although C.I.E. is primarily interested in transport, it must be remembered the company is the servant of the Irish public, and they should not take too narrow a view of their duties to the public.</P>
      <P>Take another example.  When branch lines are closed, the local railway stations are closed as well.  I wonder if members of the House have given consideration to the value of these local railway stations, their social value, to the communities in which they serve.  I think that is something which ought not to be neglected.  I think it is a very severe loss to any local community when the local railway and the station are closed down.</P>
      <P>I have in mind my own town of Dalkey where there is a remarkably fine railway station.  If it was closed down and the stationmaster and staff were removed elsewhere, it would be a very distinct loss to the local community from the social point of view. Further, some of these stations are exceptionally well built and architecturally well designed, and some of them are spacious buildings.  I wonder has C.I.E. considered these premises from the point of view of how they should be used.  In the stations of Dalkey and Dundrum, County Tipperary, there are large waiting-rooms which are hardly used at all by the people.  They are well built and have plenty of room for shops or something of that kind, but instead they simply lie idle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="662" /> I want to urge in connection with premises and branch lines that their function is not purely and simply a matter of transport.  The welfare of the community is also involved, and the matter should be looked on in the terms of the social value of these centres.  I should like the Minister to say whether any consideration has been given to that matter.  I know that, in the larger picture, the Minister will be concerned primarily in terms of employment and transport; but there is something more.  I think that the disciplined communities of stationmasters and the other servants which C.I.E. employs in these branch stations, set an example to the local community and are an important part in the social life of that community.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFirmullaghOReilly" hpid="Mr. O'Reilly Mr. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is to be welcomed, in so far as it indicates a definite viewpoint in regard to the finances of public transport.  I do say, however, that I think that valuable time has been lost, and as a result public money has been lost, by not adopting and prosecuting this idea of the re-equipment of C.I.E. at an earlier date.  It is tragic that the idea of re-equipping C.I.E. in this way some years ago by the old board did not meet with agreement.  If it had met with that measure of agreement from public men, and if we had then the agreement that we have now in this matter, that time would not have been lost and the re-equipment of C.I.E. on modern lines would have been so well under way at this stage that we probably now would be looking for greater borrowing power for the Board of C.I.E.  If the re-equipment had been started then, the loss by way of subsidisation would not have had to be met by the taxpayers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Transport is a matter which has very many aspects, but it is not something which should be dealt with purely from the economic aspect.  If transport in this country is to be judged purely by the economic aspects at different stages, it might result in the closing down of many lines from time to time until we got back where we started, where there would be only one line running from Dublin to <Col N="663" /> Dalkey, and I am sure Senator Stanford would not like to see that happen.  The transport system has a social responsibility to the public in the giving of service and there is also the question of its social responsibilities to the people employed.  I would like to feel satisfied that the Board of C.I.E. have regard to that responsibility.  I would like to feel further, that being so, that they can envisage the maintenance of their services.  Certain units and certain services that might be judged on a purely economic basis to be uneconomic in themselves might not be uneconomic, if one looked on them as part of the whole network playing their part in the whole organisation. It could be that a section which might be considered uneconomic at the present time might, with development, prove to be economic.</P>
    <P>There is a tendency on the part of C.I.E. to centralise.  We have a motion before this House dealing with decentralisation. If the idea of decentralisation has any value, surely one would expect that an organisation like C.I.E. should be the people to start decentralisation. It was Senator Fearon, I think, who mentioned the necessity, as a precautionary measure, of having some decentralisation of oil supplies because we are now switching to diesel and the need for storing our supplies over the country in order to conserve them in the event of war.  The primary purpose of this Bill as indicated by the Parliamentary Secretary is to provide capital for the re-equipment of C.I.E. I do not think there will be many people in this House who will object to this and I, at any rate, do not.  My only regret is that valuable time has been lost in that regard.</P>
    <P>There is provision for redundancy.  It appears that redundancy will arise from the re-equipment and the development of more economical and more modern types of traction.  I am with the members of the House who hope that there will be as little redundancy as possible and as little hardship caused.  If the redundancy were to be serious, it would give rise to serious difficulty and hardship for the people <Col N="664" /> employed and their families.  None of us would like to see that happen.  C.I.E. being amongst the biggest employers in the country has its responsibilities, its social responsibilities.</P>
    <P>There are other centres where there are railway works, apart from Inchicore. Dundalk, I agree, is operated by the G.N.R., but the effect of transport on a centre of population like Limerick should be considered.  You have other small workshops throughout the country.  You have one in Ballinamore and you have one in Manorhamilton which deals with the Sligo, Leitrim and Northern Counties Railway. That is a different matter, and I may refer to it later.  An effort should be made by decentralisation to ensure that those workshops are maintained and that the skilled men there have not to seek alternative employment.  It is a pity that we should lose the value of men who have developed skill and technical knowledge by having to switch them to other work, because that skill is then lost.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that Inchicore could mean a problem and that it has been a headache to the Board of C.I.E. There is a tendency now for some of our State organisations to provide their own machine shops.  Because we are dieselising our transport and because we are all agreed, apparently, that the volume of work will not accrue in Inchicore, it may be possible to find a solution whereby the Inchicore undertaking could be taken over and managed by an independent board comprised of Bord na Móna and the E.S.B.  That joint management, and the amount of work that would accrue under it, might result in maintaining Inchicore as an economic concern.  At any rate, there would not be the redundancy which the previous speaker feared.</P>
    <P>In the process of dieselisation, as much as possible of the construction work should be done in this country. It may be stated by the board that it would not be possible to build the coaches or do the coachwork here.  I wonder has it been tried?  One cannot say one cannot do a thing without having tried and failed.  Surely it would be within the capacity of the <Col N="665" /> board to have some of the staff trained, even abroad, so as to equip them with the technical knowledge and skill to do as much of the maintenance and repair work here as possible.  The demand for repairs may not be very great for a number of years, since they are embarking on completely new equipment; but it will arise later.  It is only reasonable that the board should be asked by the Minister to take steps to ensure that the work will be done in this country.  If we proceed on that line, Inchicore might not be a headache at all to the board.  If it is going to be a headache, the only solution I can suggest is that of getting some major undertakings to join in its management.  Even if it had to be decentralised and transferred, lock, and barrel, to Portarlington or Portlaoighise, there would not be any harm in that.  It has been known on the Continent for complete factories, with their moulds and jigs and everything else, to be brought from one country to another&mdash;though, unfortunately, that was as a result of war.  It would not be impossible, I argue, to decentralise a works like Inchicore.</P>
    <P>There is a disquieting feature in this Bill.  While the Parliamentary Secretary indicates that the real purpose of the measure is to ensure that the board is in a position to borrow greater sums to do work we all agree with, there is the snag that they are making better provision for the abandonment of railways.  I feel sure that the Minister and the board have set their faces as far as possible against the abandonment of railways.  A public transport undertaking has a social responsibility apart from the pure economics of employment and of giving service.  We all know&mdash;and it is a matter of annoyance and concern to the Minister&mdash;about the proposed closing of the Sligo-Leitrim Railway.  I am sure the Chair will permit me to make a short reference to it.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the very serious position that exists and of the vital necessity to maintain a railway in the area I have mentioned. The impact of its proposed closing on the community I know best and that I have some responsibility to safeguard, as far as I can, makes me use any and every opportunity to give my opinion.  I say, first of all, that the Sligo-Leitrim railway should not be closed down.  I feel that the Minister is with me in that.  Secondly, I feel that we should set our faces against closing down railways.  Once you close down an undertaking, it is much harder to restart it.  I know that the position is difficult, but I still hope that, by having a united opinion on issues like that, we may ensure that the railways will be kept going&mdash;and that applies also to the Sligo-Leitrim Railway.</P>

      <P>Senator Fearon referred to the experiments carried on by C.I.E. in the production of steam from turf and suggested that the heat-producing qualities of turf were inferior to those of oil.  I am familiar with a number of industries in this country which are now using turf in the production of steam through &ldquo;Mona-jet&rdquo; which has been designed by Bord na Móna.  They find that it is much more economical to use &ldquo;Mona-jet&rdquo; than oil.  I am glad that C.I.E. is still experimenting and I am hopeful that the results of their experiments will eventually enable this country to be largely self-dependent as regards transport on the railways.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Murphy mentioned the Inchicore works and suggested that Inchicore was important to the nation. So, I suggest, are the border counties of Monaghan and Cavan, Sligo and Leitrim, as regards transport in those counties.  It is unfortunate that those areas which are served by a different line were not modernised and developed in the enlightened way in which the C.I.E. system has been developed for some time past.  I feel that counties which are deprived of a rail service will suffer very severely economically.  The agricultural industry there will not have a railway system to transport live stock, and live stock cannot be transported as cheaply <Col N="668" /> by road.  The distribution of industries in rural Ireland will be affected, since you cannot attract them to areas where there is no rail system.  The transport of heavy merchandise is much more expensive by road.</P>
    <P>The substitution of the railway permanent way by a road will eventually mean that the ratepayers in those counties will have to contribute more towards the maintenance of their roads.  In that way, an injustice will be created in those counties.  The infinitesimal loss that has been suffered by one railway, as against the much greater loss in a bigger concern, would justify, in my opinion, a smaller railway being carried on, because the loss per mile from working is so much less.  I feel that those areas should have the same chance of showing what they can do as a result of the development of diesel traction in that part of the country.  By the modernisation of the railway system solvency would be reached, as the Parliamentary Secretary has said, but it required a considerable amount of enterprise and courage to develop the C.I.E. system as it is being developed now.  It is very fortunate for the State that that enlightened programme was entered into at a time when many cynics suggested that railways were gone forever.  I feel, therefore, that the Minister should consider favourably a further Bill to provide funds for the improvement and development of the systems which are not now under C.I.E.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been much consideration of the redundant staffs on the railways and it is dealt with in a specific section in the Bill.  I am hoping that this clause will not be used as often as has been suggested this afternoon.  The process of diesel traction on our railways has gone on for the last seven or eight years and it will take probably the rest of the decade before it is completed.  I believe that the board&mdash;who are doing such good work&mdash;will have covered this question of redundancy in large measure and that it will prove more easy to grapple with that problem when it does arise than has been suggested here this afternoon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="669" /> Senator O'Reilly took the board and, through the board, the Minister and previous Ministers to task for looking at the railway company as a facet of our economic life.  I believe that we can look at the railway company in no other way.  This is in large measure a free economy and certainly, if the railway company is State-sponsored, most of its customers are free agents. They will be attracted to the railway company only by the economic aspect. If the railway company can transport goods and provide the necessary travel facilities on a par with the amenities provided by other methods people will use the railway company.  If they have to pay more and if the services provided are not good and efficient, then the people will not use them.</P>
    <P>It is a pity to over-stress the social aspect of the railway company.  The railway company has to pay and it will have to give good service.  I think it would be a pity were we to keep redundant lines that never pay and which were subject to baronial guarantee and all sorts of devices to keep them in operation.  We should not saddle a new railway board with a number of these railway lines, some of which, I believe, originally came into operation as a result of sustained agitation by certain local groups and were not a success economically.  They had to be subject to baronial guarantee.  It is not fair to hang such millstones around the necks of the new board and start them off with disadvantages.</P>
    <P>As a State-sponsored body, they are doing wonderful work.  The British Transport Commission was mentioned. Although this is, a small country&mdash;we have not the vast resources they have in Britain&mdash;we are doing ten times as good a job as they are doing in Britain. The trains run to time.  They are clean and the rolling-stock is modern.  In the past five years, I have rarely seen trains running to time or trains which were really a credit to the British Commission.  I should hate either in this Bill or any other Bill dealing with this matter to give the new railway board any of the disadvantages suggested to-night.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Reilly suggested that we should look at the social aspect of this <Col N="670" /> question, rather than the economic aspect, but he forgets that advantages will flow to the people who are employed by the railway company in secure and well paid positions.  That, in my opinion, is the best social advantage, particularly in a State which is a private enterprise country like ours.  If there was a planned State economy, we might look at it in some other way, but we cannot so look at it having regard to our type of economy. We cannot, as Senator O'Reilly suggests, use the railway company as a social beneficiary.</P>

      <P>In connection with Section 8, I should like the Minister to elucidate the position.  Is the sale of lands on abandoned lines confined exclusively to the owners of the adjoining lands?  If neither one nor the other of the owners of the adjoining lands agrees with C.I.E. in regard to the purchase of land, would the land be sold to some other person?  I think that would be highly undesirable, because, as we know, those old lines intersect bogs and if they were to be sold to some other person, it would create a problem which would be a source of annoyance.  I should like to ask the Minister if he would ensure that could not happen.  It may be that the Land Commission have taken steps to prevent such things happening.  If they did happen, it would be most undesirable.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite a number of points have been raised in the course of the debate and I will do my best to cover all, or most of them, in my reply. Senator Hawkins and, I think, some other Senator criticised the rolling stock at present in use by C.I.E. and particularly the rolling stock which served the West of Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is because the company's rolling <Col N="671" /> stock was deficient, that its carriages were out of date, many of them being in a decrepit condition, that it had not built a single locomotive since 1931, that it became necessary to introduce the reorganisation scheme which is now in operation.  I might mention to the House that the reorganisation programme provides for the expenditure of £5.3 million on diesel locomotives; £5,500,000 on the renewal of carriages and wagons; £350,000 on improvement of stations and approximately £1,000,000 for the provision of turf and oil locomotives, making a grand total of £12,150,000.  I do not think even that will see the end of the reorganisation programme and I will probably have to come to the House again to ask for more money to finance the programme of modernising and re-equipping C.I.E.  The only hope of making the company financially solvent is by re-equipping the line and reorganising the system.  The only hope we have of getting away from a deficit mentality with C.I.E. is by giving the company the necessary funds to reequip and modernise the lines to bring back the traffic it has lost.</P>
    <P>One of the features of C.I.E. activities in recent years has been that, because of its modern approach to problems, because of its 20th century approach to transport, it is now beginning to rehabilitate itself in the public mind.  Some of the services which C.I.E. now provides have been the subject of much favourable comment, not merely by our own people who were previously critical, but by visitors to this country as well.  Therefore, I hope the moneys which will be made available to C.I.E. in this Bill and the further moneys which may be made available when the present reorganisation programme reaches maturity will all help to ensure that C.I.E. will be a modern, well-equipped transport system.  In that way, and in that way only, I believe can the company be made solvent.</P>
    <P>A suggestion was made by Senator Hawkins about doubling the railway track from Dublin to Galway.  If there was an example of transport lunacy, it was the decision to single the line <Col N="672" /> from Dublin to Galway.  Now, of course, having taken up the whole track from Dublin to Galway, it is realised to-day that it is desirable to put the track back.  If digging holes and filling them in again is a barometer of economic wisdom, this is surely the highlight of all time in transport insanity.</P>
    <P>It would cost now approximately £500,000 to double the track for portion of the way.  I think, from recollection, that the cost of restoring the track in full would be over £1,000,000. When we tore up the track from Dublin to Galway, it was welcomed as transport wisdom of a high order.  Now we have only to reflect on the matter to see how futile and foolish were the minds that conceived as the solution of our railway company's difficulties the taking up of the track on which, if there had been good carriages, wagons and engines, it could have operated properly.  That is one of the matters that will have to be considered in connection with the re-equipment and reorganisation of C.I.E.  It may well be worth our while to do something in the way of doubling the track at some portions of the line, so as to avoid the inevitable delay which arises where you have got to have in and out working on a single track.</P>
    <P>The question of redundancy was raised by a number of Senators.  I dealt with this matter at length in the Dáil and I do not think it is necessary to go into detail about the matter now. The fact of the matter is that, as a result of the reorganisation of C.I.E., there will be considerable savings. Operating costs will be cheaper.  The carriages and the locomotives which will be provided will not need the persistent and regular care and maintenance which the present out-of-date carriages and locomotives must receive. An inordinate amount of time is being spent in maintaining the present out-of-date coaches.  If we are going to have modern disel locomotives, diesel rail cars, with their capacity, sturdiness and long service, it is obvious that considerable savings will be made in avoiding the servicing of the new vehicles as compared with the old vehicles.  There will be much cheaper operating costs generally.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="673" /> There will be less demand for staff than there is at present for operating the present locomotives.  All that is calculated to produce redundancy and this Bill provides compensation, if the redundancy takes place.  I have asked C.I.E. to deal with this problem of redundancy on a humane basis, not to look at this thing as if the people concerned were so many pieces on a draught board who must be got rid of. Instead, I told them to remember that every one of the people they will deal with is a human being who may have a wife and children; that they have given substantial service to C.I.E., and that they should deal with these people not as items on a balance sheet but as human beings and deal with them fairly.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, I told the trade unions I believed this redundancy could be virtually avoided if they faced up to this problem with some flexibility of mind and allowed no sense of protocol or punctilio to stand in the way of shifting a man from one job to another, if shifting involved keeping him in employment at a rate of wages which would not be unfavourable compared with the old rate of wages.  If the company approached this problem from the point of view that they are dealing with human beings and if the trade unions approach the problem with a mental flexibility, I believe we can get over the difficulty of redundancy. It may be that the paper redundancy will look startlingly big.  I do not think it will, in fact, but C.I.E. have an annual wastage of about 600. With a bit of patience, understanding and a desire to deal with the problem in accordance with their capacity to solve it at a particular time, I believe that the wastage can be utilised in the main to take the place of the redundancy which may occur as a result of the dieselisation policy.</P>
    <P>In any case, this policy will be spread over a period.  The redundancy will not manifest itself in full in any one day, month or even a year.  It is a problem which will arise from time to time.  If C.I.E. approach it sympathetically and understandingly and if the unions are equally co-operative in the fields in which they can render service and constructive work, I <Col N="674" /> believe we can get over the bulk of these difficulties, if not all.</P>
    <P>This reorganisation programme, totalling £12,000,000, will provide a substanial amount of work in C.I.E. workshops and provide a substantial amount of new work for people who might otherwise be redundant.  It may be necessary to have some interchange-ability of staff.  Let us not get bogged down in a web of technicalities as to whether a man in one particular grade should properly be employed in another grade.</P>
    <P>A Senator proceeded to assume that not only would all diesel locomotives come in, but everything connected with the new reorganisation was going to be imported.  That is not so.  There will be more work than ever in C.I.E. under this programme.  It is the additional work I am relying on to provide alternative employment for the people who will be rendered redundant as a result of dieselisation.  I think, between the work of providing carriages and wagons, it should be possible to provide a substantial volume of new work in these fields alone for the people who may be displaced as a result of dieselisation.</P>
    <P>Senator Hawkins raised the question as to what rate or interest would be charged to C.I.E. for moneys borrowed. The terms of the borrowing, including interest, are subject to approval by the Minister for Finance. I presume that the interest rates will depend on whatever the market quotations are.  If they are very favourable, it will be helpful to C.I.E.  If they are not, their experience is likely to be the experience of each and every one of us.  We have got to pay if the rate of interest runs against us.</P>
    <P>The question of the Sligo-Leitrim railway was raised and I presume I may reply to the points put.  The Sligo-Leitrim railway is a privately owned railway.  No part of the ownership resides in the hands of this Government or the Six County Government. It is a purely privately owned railway and is, therefore, outside the scope of this Bill.  The railway runs for a distance of about 40 miles. About 30 miles of the railway line is in our own territory and ten miles in the Six County area.  The railway has <Col N="675" /> been in operation for a very long time, giving employment to about 120 people. The railway company now finds itself in very serious difficulties.</P>
    <P>The Six County Government has indicated that not only will it not put up any additional money to keep the line going but will cut off its existing subsidy and that it has paid its last subsidy to the line.  The line has had a subsidy of approximately £6,500, £3,000 of which was from the Six County Government.  They said they could not operate unless they got at least £10,000.  We said we would put up £5,000 if the Six County Government would do the same, but the Six County Government would not.  In fact, they would not put the £3,000 in the kitty after this year.</P>
    <P>The Sligo-Leitrim railway is in a very difficult position at the moment. The strange part of it is that the line is of more economic benefit to the Six Counties than it is to the Twenty-Six Counties, because it is used in large measure for transporting cattle from the north-west area for shipment through the ports of Derry and Belfast.</P>
    <P>When the Sligo-Leitrim railway closes down, if it does close down, the G.N.R. will lose per annum £26,000, £10,000 of which will be lost to the G.N.R. through the port of Derry and £16,000 through Enniskillen and Belfast. The Six County Government will have to put that £26,000 into the G.N.R. kitty because of the loss on their side of the Border.  If they would continue their present subsidy of £3,000, and £5,000, they would avoid that £26,000 loss; but they have decided that they will not continue the present subsidy of £3,000 or the £5,000.  Consequently, the Sligo-Leitrim railway is now in a very difficult position. I have considerable sympathy with the viewpoint of those who want to keep it going.  I saw a deputation from Sligo and Leitrim recently which put their point of view over.</P>
    <P>The side of the thing that worries me most is the human problem attached to it, because it operates in a <Col N="676" /> rural area and I see very little prospect of the people getting alternative employment. I could very well see them in a very bad economic position.  There is some doubt as to whether the railway company, even if its assets were sold, would be in a position to give them even a penny compensation, because that is the financial position that may arise if the assets of the railway company are disposed of.  However, I am dealing with the matter at the moment.  I want to deal with it as sympathetically as I can and as realistically as I can, and I hope shortly to be able to indicate what the position is.  It is not going to be easy to take a favourable decision in this matter, but I think that, having regard to all the difficulties, we must make every effort to keep the line open.</P>
    <P>It may well be that we will have to do that unaided because the Six County Government will probably pay no more subsidy, even though the line is of considerable economic benefit to them.  There are human and other problems involved in this matter, and, for that reason, as I said, I would like to look at the matter with the utmost sympathy, tempering, of course, that sympathy with a realistic approach to all the difficulties involved, so far as subsidies from this side of the Border are concerned.</P>
    <P>Senator Stanford raised the question of utilising the railway stations and thought that they should not be allowed to deteriorate.  The position at the moment is that C.I.E. have provided storage facilities at a number of those stations.  For example, fertilisers have been stored there, and the company uses them as store places for goods which are in transit or have to be deposited somewhere.  I do not think that the stations are being wasted from the transport point of view, merely because they are not now used in the everyday purposes of C.I.E.</P>
    <P>Senator Stanford also raised the question of the Hill of Howth tramways. They were built under the Tramway Acts, and the provisions of this Bill do not apply to the Hill of Howth Tramways.  It is worth mentioning, however, that this tramway is operated by the G.N.R., and at a very <Col N="677" /> considerable loss.  The policy has been up to now, and probably will be continued, to keep the tramway going until such time as the roads are made wide enough and safe enough for the purpose of operating a bus service. Even if the bus service is operated, I do not think it could take away from the scenic attractions of the hill.</P>
    <P>The question of turf and oil locomotives was raised by Senator Fearon. The position is that C.I.E. propose to operate these locomotives on oil for seasonal traffics like beet and wheat, but in emergencies turf would be used in those locomotives, so we can have them for use in normal circumstances at periods of high traffic and in times of emergency, they would be available for conversion to use turf. The position is that at the moment C.I.E. are building prototype locomotives as an experiment and to see how this scheme will work.  They are endeavouring to produce these prototypes, and I have asked the board to keep me informed regularly as to the progress they are making.  I can assure the House&mdash;although some doubt has been expressed about C.I.E.'s affection for turf-fired locomotives&mdash;that the company have, notwithstanding that suspicion, assured me that every effort will be made to produce the prototype with the minimum of delay.</P>
    <P>Senator Murphy raised the question of State bodies utilising the workshops of C.I.E. for the purpose of carrying out work for those other bodies.  I spoke to the directors of C.I.E. some time ago on this particular matter and suggested to them that C.I.E. ought to regard themselves as the brother of an organisation like Bord na Móna, the E.S.B., Aer Lingus and other State-sponsored bodies, and if they could do work for any of those bodies which those bodies were compelled to get done outside this country, they should arrange to see the other State-sponsored body and invite them to place their order with C.I.E.</P>
    <P>I know that C.I.E. has made contact with those bodies and that it is anxious to co-operate in developing that line of policy.  I hope that it would result in the provision of more work at C.I.E. <Col N="678" /> workshops.  In addition to that, all these State-sponsored bodies have been communicated with and urged from the transport point of view to make as much use of public transport as possible with a view, again, to avoid loss or to cut loss, so far as C.I.E. is concerned.</P>
    <P>The question of C.I.E.'s finances was raised by Senator Murphy, and he was anxious to see the accounts of C.I.E. as soon as possible.  I hope that the accounts for this year will be released within the next week, and the Senator will therefore have an opportunity of examining the accounts.  I have no details of the accounts at the moment, but I have been informed by C.I.E. that they are very pleased with the direction in which the accounts are pointing at the moment, and so pleased are they with the introduction of the diesel railcars that they have decided not to close any more branch lines until such time as they get a chance of operating those branch lines with the new diesel railcars and the new diesel light locomotives.  These new types of transport are easier and cheaper to run than the types of transport which brought about the economic difficulties of those branch lines.  If we can operate the branch lines with this new type of transport, which can be operated more cheaply, and if the local people will travel by rail and send their goods by rail, there is no reason why we should not keep those branch lines open.</P>
    <P>I think there is something saddening and decadent about the closing of a branch line.  They were opened amidst public acclaim.  Everybody hoped that they were all the indications of moving into a more enlightened civilisation and a period of progress.  There is something saddening about closing the branch lines, and as they can be kept open quite easily by the local people patronising the branch line and sending their merchandise along the line, there is no reason why they should close, except through the indifference of the local people, who prefer to travel by bus, instead of keeping open the available railway service they have there.  The fact is that it is not unusual <Col N="679" /> for people to turn up at an inquiry as to whether a branch line should be closed, travelling in the bus&mdash;to protest against the railway being closed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>That is another problem. The fact is that we can keep the branch lines, if our people patronise them.  We will only lose them if our people prefer to travel by bus or by private car, and to send their merchandise by private haulier.  But if we can convince our people that the maintenance of the branch lines is essential, then a switch to support of the branch lines would enable them to be continued indefinitely.</P>
      <P>I have, I think, answered, as far as I can recollect, practically all the points raised on the Bill.  If there is any other point upon which a Senator wants further information, I hope I will be able to give it to him orally or in writing, if he raises the matter with me afterwards.</P>

    <Title>Statutory Instruments (Amendment) Bill, 1955&mdash;Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Sweetman) Gerard Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Sweetman)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill is designed to deal with certain procedural difficulties arising out of the operation of Section 3 of the Statutory Instruments Act, 1947, one of the objects of which was to ensure that reasonable publicity is given to the promulgation of statutory instruments.  To this end, Section 3 of the 1947 Act prescribes certain requirements which apply to every statutory instrument not excluded or exempted from the provisions of the Act.  Briefly, these requirements are as follows:&mdash; (i) each statutory instrument must be printed under the superintendence <Col N="680" /> of the Stationery Office; (ii) as soon as a statutory instrument is printed notice of the making thereof and of the place where copies may be obtained must be published in the <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i>; and (iii) as from the date of publication of the notice in the <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i>, copies of the instrument must be kept and made available at the place specified in the notice.</P>
      <P>In practice, difficulty has been experienced in securing the prompt gazetting of statutory instruments in the <i>Iris Oifigiúil.</i>  This difficulty arises from the order of procedure prescribed by Section 3 of the 1947 Act, which requires a statutory instrument to be printed before it can be gazetted. Despite the best endeavours of the Stationery Office, delays frequently occur between the time an instrument is made and the time that printed copies of it are available.  As a result, formal notice of the making of a statutory instrument cannot be given for some time after the instrument is made.  Such delay conflicts with the spirit of the 1947 Act and has been the subject of adverse comment by the Seanad Select Committee on Statutory Instruments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sub-section (4) of Section 3 of the 1947 Act also fails to some extent in its purpose.  That sub-section provides that a statutory instrument having printed on it the statement that&mdash;in the words of the Act&mdash;&ldquo;notice of the making of the said statutory instrument was published in a particular issue of the <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i>, shall in any proceedings be <i>prima facie</i> evidence that such notice was published in that issue of the <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i>&rdquo;.  The object of this provision was to simplify proof of the gazetting of an instrument. It so happens, however, that because of the order of procedure prescribed in the Act it is impossible to arrange that the first printed copies of a statutory instrument contain a statement as to the date of gazetting, since printed copies of the instrument must be available before gazetting can be effected.  This defect may be a source of inconvenience to private individuals who, in seeking the enforcement of rights conferred by statutory instruments, may be put to the trouble <Col N="681" /> of producing proof of the gazetting of such instruments.</P>
    <P>The Bill purports to deal with these defects by providing for the gazetting of statutory instruments in advance of printing.  Pending the production of prints, neostyled copies of statutory instruments will be made available to the public.  The Bill extends also the list of institutions to which copies of statutory instruments are required to be furnished by the addition of the King's Inns Library, Dublin, and the Southern Law Association, Cork.</P>

      <P>The House welcomes this Bill because of the purpose it proposes to serve.  The Minister has referred to the annoyance which has been caused to the Committee set up by this House.  That is a matter to which I should like once more to draw the Minister's attention and the attention of those Ministers and Departments responsible for the issuing of Orders from time to time.  The Minister is here taking a short cut to have Orders published and made available to various organisations.  While that is very desirable, it is also desirable that these Orders should be made available to members of the House as early as possible, and also that the purpose of the particular Order should be clearly stated on its face.  It has been the practice&mdash;I am glad to say there has been an improvement in this direction recently&mdash;to refer to these Orders by numbers, and one had great difficulty in finding out what really was the purpose of an Order.</P>
      <P>We agree that it is necessary that the public should be made aware of the purpose of the Orders as early as possible and because of that we welcome the Bill.  At the same time, I ask the Minister to bear in mind the few recommendations that I have made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is proposed to make these Orders available to a number of organisations, whose names are set out in the Bill&mdash; Chambers of Commerce and so on.  I see that already an amendment has been put down asking that they should also be made available to the library of Trinity College.  When considering that amendment, I would ask the Minister <Col N="682" /> to consider also including the constituent colleges of Cork and Galway.</P>

      <P>As a member of the Committee on Statutory Instruments, I also should like to welcome this Bill I might add that I also welcome it as a citizen, because in the past a lot of these statutory instruments were in existence and the public and many people interested in them were not aware of their existence.  I suppose that the Dáil and Seanad will get these Orders as early as the bodies mentioned in sub-section (a) of Section 1 of the Bill.</P>

      <P>Like Senator Hawkins and Senator McGuire, I welcome this Bill.  As a member of the Association of Chambers of Commerce, I notice that the association is not mentioned as one of the groups that will be given copies of statutory instruments.  The association consists of the chambers of the four cities that are mentioned and, in addition, Sligo, Athlone, Longford, Wexford, Drogheda, Dundalk, Clonmel, Kilkenny&mdash;all the principal towns &mdash;and if these instruments were in the hands of Mr. McDwyer, in Commercial Buildings, Dublin, the secretary of the association, he could, when sending out his report, mention that these have been received and if any association required further information, he could have them duplicated and sent to them.  I believe that this is a body, which, because of its comprehensive nature, ought to get copies of the Orders when they are printed.</P>

      <P>These statutory instruments are largely the result of emergency legislation and consequently it is desirable that the public should be made aware at the earliest possible date of the powers being conferred on Ministers and Departments, in consequence of statutory instruments which are issued.  As a member of the Statutory Instruments Committee, I should be anxious that the Minister should include in the Bill, if it is not already provided for, that statutory instruments should be laid before the House in the time specified in Section 1 of the Bill.  I also urge that the constituent colleges of the <Col N="683" /> National University should be sent copies of the Bill, as soon as it is published.  I presume that, under the Copyright Act, those colleges will be entitled to copies of the Bill, once they are printed.  I should like the Minister to consider that before the next stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the members of the House agree the Bill is desirable.  I think there is, perhaps, a little confusion in exactly understanding what is intended by this short amending Bill.  It is purely one that deals with statutory instruments as such and does not in any way deal with Bills, as mentioned by Senator Walsh.  The parent Act, under which the various instruments are made, provides in many cases that the instruments must lie on the table of the House for a certain number of days in some cases, and, in other cases, that they must lie there until there is a positive Order confirming them or they must lie there with power of annulment under the Parent Act.  It is under the parent Act that the provision is made, which means that this House and the other House obtain the appropriate notice of the position.</P>
      <P>In fact, of course, as Senators are aware, &ldquo;tabled&rdquo; means that the instrument in question is put in the Library and I think it is the practice that not merely those Orders which are bound under the parent Act to be tabled are put in the Library but also all other Orders of any importance at all.</P>
      <P>There has been considerable discussion over the years of the advisability of trying to devise some pattern by which Orders could be described as in the manner suggested by Senator Hawkins.  In certain cases where this is advisable, it could be done, but there is also, of course, the danger sometimes that, in the efforts to shorten the broad title for the convenience of the public, you might, in the synopsis, change the sense of what is involved. I think Senators may expect that whenever it is possible to deal with the problem in the manner Senator Hawkins suggests, it will be so dealt with by the Department concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="684" /> On the question which Senator Burke raised concerning the Association of Chambers of Commerce of Ireland, I understand that the Association of Chambers of Commerce operate from the rooms or the building of the Dublin Chamber of Commerce and the association will therefore get the instruments in question, when they are delivered to the Dublin Chamber.  They will then have an opportunity of inspecting them there and of seeing what instruments they wish to get specific copies of to send around to the members of their association.</P>

    <Title>Arterial Drainage (Amendment) Bill, 1955&mdash;Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Sweetman) Gerard Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Sweetman)</NameTxt>
      <P>The object of the Bill is to remove a doubt which has arisen in the interpretation of the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945.  Under that Act, the Commissioners of Public Works are responsible for undertaking both original construction work on arterial drainage schemes and subsequent maintenance works.  The Act provides that the initial capital cost of an arterial drainage scheme carried out by the commissioners shall be a State charge and that the cost of subsequent maintenance shall be borne by the county council or county councils concerned. Provision is made in Section 37 for repayment to the Commissioners of Public Works annually, by the appropriate county councils, of the amounts expended from year to year on maintenance. Efficient and economical maintenance of the large-scale catchment drainage schemes will require the employment of mechanical plant&mdash; excavators, vehicles, etc.&mdash;and of considerable quantities of small tools and supplies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In order to carry out the various arterial drainage schemes, the commissioners <Col N="685" /> have acquired a large number of excavators, machines, vehicles, tools and other equipment based at their central engineering workshop from which issues are made as required to the various works in progress.  The obvious and practical course is to draw on these existing resources for the purpose of the maintenance of drainage works, in the same way as for drainage construction works.  In order to arrive at the full cost of works, the normal practice is to add, to the direct outlay, charges in respect of the services rendered&mdash;the charge for tools and supplies being their recorded value and for machinery a weekly rate computed by reference to the original purchase price, the cost of servicing and overhauling the item concerned and to its estimated working life.</P>
    <P>For the maintenance of each completed drainage scheme a local depot, combining the functions of an office and a store will be needed, and in measuring the cost of maintenance for each year account must be taken of the annual value of the premises made available for this purpose.</P>
    <P>A doubt arises whether sub-section (3) of Section 37 of the 1945 Act in fact empowers the commissioners to include, in their statutory demands on county councils for recovery of the cost of maintenance, sums representing the value of the services rendered by engineering plant and machinery, stores or premises provided by the commissioners.  The purpose of the present Bill is to remove that legal doubt.</P>
    <P>By virtue of Section 37 as at present worded, the commissioners could buy specifically for the maintenance of each drainage scheme every item of plant, equipment or supplies required for that purpose and recover such outlay from the county council concerned.  The adoption of such a course would result in inordinately heavy charges against the county councils, particularly in the first year of maintenance when the heavy initial cost of plant would have to be recovered, and in an unequal distribution of the cost of maintenance as between one year and another.  The present Bill will enable the commissioners <Col N="686" /> to adopt the obvious and practical course of drawing on the available pool of plant and machinery, etc.</P>
    <P>The main provisions of the Bill are in Section 2.  Paragraph (a) (1) of sub-section (1) of Section 2 covers the question of machinery and engineering equipment and supplies and paragraph (a) (2) deals with the matter of premises.</P>
    <P>As I have stated, the purpose of the Bill is to ensure that the machinery available will be used to the best possible advantage and that it will not be necessary, as apparently it would have been&mdash;due to a mistake in the draft of the original Bill&mdash;that the councils would have to pay for the purchase of the new machinery for maintenance purposes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonKissane" hpid="Mr. Kissane Mr. Kissane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kissane</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister has stated, it is apparently necessary to introduce this amending Bill to resolve a doubt that has arisen as to the payment of maintenance costs in connection with arterial drainage schemes, because that no doubt was envisaged in the parent Act, 1945.  In any reference to that doubt, the question arises as to whether both Houses of the Oireachtas are taking notice of all these doubts that arise from time to time as to the interpretation of certain Acts passed by the Oireachtas. One could ask the question where is the doubt arising because, so far as I am aware, there has been no judicial or semi-judicial decision on this matter. The principle to examine is whether it is wise for the Houses of the Oireachtas to take undue notice of these contemplated difficulties which may from time to time arise in the mind of some legal luminary in some part of the country.  I should like to bring this principle to the Minister's notice, because it is a very dangerous thing, as Senators are aware, to take notice of hearsay in all these matters.  Senators are aware that hearsay evidence is regarded as no evidence in courts of justice, except in certain specified cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This whole question arises from financial considerations as between the central Government and the local authorities&mdash;the county councils.  The question is that no matter what interpretation we put on it and no <Col N="687" /> matter what changed circumstances might affect the payments, it seems that the county councils will have to bear the costs in any case, as they had to, I must admit, under the original Act.  Under the 1945 Act, whatever costs would be considered necessary to keep the scheme in working order would have to be borne by the county council involved.  There was, of course, also the difficulty as to who would determine what financial costs were necessary for the maintenance of the scheme, but I suppose that is within the province of the engineer or engineers representing the Commissioners of Public Works.</P>
    <P>As we are referring to this question of financial obligations, I wonder is it because of financial stringency that some of these arterial drainage schemes are not being carried out to their logical conclusion.  I would mention one&mdash;the Feale scheme.  I understand the intention of the Commissioners of Public Works is to draw a line at a certain point, leaving out the stretch of river as between Listowel and Abbeyfeale.  If that is the intention, I consider it is a very mistaken policy and I hope that the matter will be reconsidered.  I am afraid, Sir, that I will not be able to go into that matter within the framework of this little Bill.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardCommons" hpid="Mr. Commons Mr. Commons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Commons</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very sensible <Col N="688" /> Bill, as any member of a local authority knows and I compliment the Minister and his Department on introducing it. While a county council may consider it lucky to have an arterial drainage scheme passing through their county, and while there is a rush to see who will get schemes first, it is nevertheless embodied in the 1945 Act that the county council in question must maintain the river after the deepening and so on has been carried out by the Board of Works.  That is sensible.  Everyone knows there is little use in spending large sums on arterial drainage and then allowing ten years to pass by without giving it any attention, letting the river choke up again, especially where the waters are not moving quickly.  The sensible thing is to arrange for a scheme of maintenance and that is contained in the 1945 Act. However, in order to do this maintenance, for the cost of which the local authority is entirely responsible, the local authority would have to purchase excavators and other machinery or pay for those that would be purchased by the Board of Works.</P>
      <P>We all know that, as time goes on, by the time that maintenance will have to be done in the first river cleaned and deepened, the Brosna, there will be at least some machines idle.  These could be diverted to start the maintenance of the first rivers cleaned.  The sending of those machines, or even new machines which are idle, would be a definite saving to the local authority, which otherwise would have to buy machines or pay for those which the Commissioners of Public Works would buy.  That would be pretty expensive, in addition to the expense of carrying out the maintenance work.  Therefore, this Bill will be welcomed by all local authorities.  It will save us money.  We all know that the maintenance will be a burden of some sort on the local authority but&mdash;like the land project, which is a burden on the local authority and on ratepayers in general still&mdash;it is a burden that will be welcome, because for every penny spent, there will be a saving of hundreds of pounds to the authorities concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I may also allay Senator Kissane's fears.  I feel sure the Minister has had good legal opinion as to the necessity <Col N="689" /> for the Bill.  There are sufficient legal minds in the Department of Finance to convince him that this Bill is absolutely necessary.  Otherwise, we would not have it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Commons has tempted me to intervene by his suggestion that counties which have a drainage scheme are lucky.  That may be so, but I would say that counties which have not a scheme and do not need one are luckier still.  The burden on the local rates in some counties where big drainage schemes are undertaken will be fairly considerable.  One way of looking at the Bill&mdash;it may not be a fair way&mdash;is that if it were not enacted at all, it would be impossible for the central drainage authority to charge for the loan of their machinery. I assume that if they were precluded from charging, they would not utilise the machinery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>That would be a very unfair burden on the unfortunate ratepayer. Possibly the Minister could tell us what is to be the likely charge for maintenance.  I assume that very little such work has been done up to the present, but no doubt estimates have been prepared as to the charge, relative to the total cost of each scheme.  It would be a matter of interest to the ratepayers to know what the burden is likely to be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrederickHawkins" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel there is some misunderstanding about the purpose of the Bill.  It proposes to amend a section of the Arterial Drainage Act of 1950 which made exactly the same provision.  I am sure those who took part in the discussion then on that particular section never intended that an obligation would be placed on the Office of Public Works to purchase a set of new machinery for each maintenance area.  The obligation was put in the Office of Public Works to carry  the maintenance work, in the knowledge that that would be the best equipped body to do it.  Otherwise, I am sure the then Minister <Col N="690" /> would have placed the obligation on each county council, as it would be much more economical for the county council to purchase the machinery themselves and carry out the maintenance work than pay the Board of Works the money necessary to buy the machinery and leave in the hands of the Board of Works all decisions as to where, when and how the work would be carried out.  Therefore, the purpose of the Bill is not to bring about any big change or improvement in the original Act but only to make clear to those operating the Act the intentions of this House and the other House at the time that original Act was passed.</P>
      <P>An opportunity is taken to make it more definite that not alone will the local authority be responsible for the payment over a number of years for the machinery and maintenance costs as calculated by the Office of Public Works, but will also be responsible for contributing towards the erection and the maintenance of the offices in the various maintenance areas.</P>
      <P>When the Office of Public Works decides to carry out general maintenance work under this section of the Bill and eventually presents its bill to the local authority&mdash;the decision to carry out the work was made by the Office of Public Works, the doing of the work was an obligation placed on the Office of Public Works and at the end of the period I assume that at some stage the bill will be presented to the local authority&mdash;I can well see the position arising where the local authority or their local engineer will not be quite satisfied that the work should cost so much.  In the event of a dispute arising, I wonder if there is any machinery by which the Bill and the views of the local authority can be reconciled, or must the local authority accept the account presented and pay up, even though they may be dissatisfied with the way in which the work was carried out?  These questions will arise at some stage.  What I want to make clear now is that the Bill before us is just a clarification of the intentions of the House when passing the original Arterial Drainage Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I also should like to get some information.  I understand that <Col N="691" /> this Bill is brought in for the purpose of clarification.  There is one development taking place in this country, that is, the widespread use of machinery by county councils.  There is a tendency to do road works during the summer period, during the long dry days. Could they use that machinery&mdash; bucket excavators, soil-moving equipment and so on, which is now the stock-in-trade of a county council&mdash;in order to do the work themselves, if they thought it cheaper?  Or could they let the work out on contract to some efficient contractors in the county who bought machinery and spent a great deal of money on it?  Certainly in Waterford, Tipperary and Kilkenny, many of those men have done an excellent job.  It might be a more efficient and more effective way to use the labour than to employ additional staff.  Good labour is always scarce and it could be used in the summer on the roads and on drainage in the autumn and winter, thus giving permanency. That is a matter of policy, but it might be very important for a county council to know if they could employ men in that way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the members of the House for the manner in which they have received this Bill. As Senator Hawkins has made clear, it is an endeavour to clarify in wording now what I believe was the intention at the time of the 1945 Act.  On that subject, I find it rather difficult to follow the reasoning of Senator Kissane.  Perhaps I misinterpret the Senator.  I thought I saw at the back of his remarks a certain criticism of legal luminaries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonKissane" hpid="Mr. Kissane Mr. Kissane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kissane</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought it was employed somewhat in that respect.  I would suggest to the House that the adoption of the method that was put forward by Senator Kissane would mean that there would be more litigation, instead of less litigation, that adoption of his method would mean that no Bill of this nature would be introduced until the matter had been tested in the courts.  Where, on examination by the Department concerned or by anyone else, it appears <Col N="692" /> there is a doubt in the actual wording of an Act, and everybody believes that the intention of the Oireachtas was clear enough, surely, it is better to put the matter beyond question by an amending Bill of this sort in this way rather than put everybody concerned to the expense of a court action?  It is precisely to obviate any such expense that amending legislation of this kind comes before the House at one time or another.  I must differ from Senator Kissane on that point.</P>
      <P>Apart from that, the various Departments operate, and are bound to operate, within the law as they are advised.  If they are advised&mdash;by the Attorney-General in the last instance &mdash;that there is a doubt, Senators will agree with me that it is not for them or for me to overrule that doubt, but rather to be advised by people competent to give that advice and to avoid unnecessary legal proceedings.  That is what is done in this case.</P>
      <P>The Senator mentioned the Feale drainage scheme.  I trust that you, Sir, will not consider that I am diverging too far in making a passing reference to the point raised by Senator Kissane, a very passing reference.  The principle of the arterial drainage plan is that a river will be surveyed and examined; that a scheme will be prepared; and that then the scheme will be exhibited, so that all local people interested can see what is proposed to be done and what is not proposed to be done.  That procedure was followed in respect of the Feale.  The work which the Senator had in mind, although he was not able fully to develop his point because of the limited scope of this Bill, was never included in that scheme.</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding the fact it never was so included, I had the matter examined within the past six months. I am afraid the position is that the upper reaches of the Feale are so torrential in character and the nature of the terrain is such that it is not feasible to produce a practicable scheme within the framework of the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945, or any extension of the work under the existing scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="693" /> The original Act gives the commissioners power to make certain minor variations and deviations such as may become necessary in implementing on the spot what was on paper beforehand, but the work there would be of such a major nature that it would hardly come under the heading of minor variations.  In any event, from an engineering point of view, because of the torrential character of the upper reaches, it would be most difficult, if not impossible, to operate the scheme within the framework of the Act as visualised.</P>
    <P>The Senator need not have any doubts or worry that any similar work is being cut off for reasons of economy. If he looks at the Estimates he will see that this year a sum of £416,000 is provided, compared with the sum of £377,000 last year.  In addition, I have provided out of the National Development Fund a substantial sum for other arterial drainage work which could not be done under the ordinary Estimate.</P>
    <P>Senator Hickey asked me for details about machinery and so forth.  I am afraid that, without notice, I could not give him the details of the number of machines available.  I would ask him and other members to realise that, in respect of any arterial drainage scheme, it is necessary to have very large machines to do certain heavy types of work.  You require large machines and, at the next step, medium-sized machines, then smaller ones and so on. The whole lot have to be utilised as a unit.  If you have not the very large machines, you cannot do the job that requires a very big span or depth, as is the case in places on the Corrib. While you must have those big machines for that sort of work, it would be entirely uneconomic, when you have done the heavy work that may be necessary, to utilise those machines for work for which the smaller ones are better fitted.</P>
    <P>It is inevitable, therefore, that there will be periods during which certain types of machines will not be actually working on a job because the work being done is not of a type for which they are best fitted.  Nevertheless, if <Col N="694" /> they were not in the general picture and pattern, the work as a whole could not be done.</P>
    <P>Senator Commons and Senator Burke dealt in slightly different ways with the question of maintenance. Senator Burke made the suggestion that individual county councils should do the maintenance, but members of the House will appreciate that the major arterial drainage schemes affect more than one county council.  It is essential that there should be an overall uniform pattern of maintenance or else work that was being done by one county council in one way might not be done so satisfactorily by another and the whole scheme might fall down on that account.  I am quite satisfied that uniformity of pattern is necessary. That was one of the reasons why the parent Act of 1945 was framed so that the Commissioners of Public Works would do the job.</P>

      <P>In this Bill we propose to amend and consolidate the ancient laws in force, dating from 1698 to 1892, which prohibit gaming and lotteries.</P>
      <P>The general principle which has guided us in our approach to the problems is that gaming is not wrong in itself, that when carried on privately it does not call for State intervention, but when promoted with the object of enriching the promoter, it requires to be supervised and kept within moderate dimensions so as to safeguard the public from fraud and from being induced to play to excess.  These remarks also apply to the promotion of lotteries.</P>
      <P>I am happy to say that the Government's proposals embodied in the Bill were well received in the Dáil and, indeed, by the professional showmen and amusement caterers, and the general public.  On the section-to-section details there was a remarkable degree of unanimity as to what should be done.  Sometimes there were differences of opinion which disappeared as the debate proceeded and, on the whole, the criticism was constructive. It would be too much to hope, I suppose that at this, our first attempt, at dealing with this long-outstanding difficult problem, we will prove to be 100 per cent. successful, but, anyway, this Bill is a beginning and I am satisfied that we are establishing sound foundations in case further legislation is required later on to tidy up any looseness that may be revealed through actual working conditions.</P>
      <P>The Bill is in five parts, the first of which is concerned merely with definitions and repeals.  Parts II and III deal with gaming, Part IV with lotteries and Part V with enforcement, evidence and penalties.</P>
      <P>Under Part II of the Bill, gaming is defined in Section 2 as:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;... playing a game of skill or chance or partly of skill and partly of chance for stakes hazarded by the players.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Section 4 gaming which is unlawful is defined.  At this point I want to make it clear that it is the person who promotes or assists in promoting, or provides facilities for unlawful gaming <Col N="696" /> who is prosecuted.  The actual players. are not punishable.  Section 4 also provides in its third sub-section that gaming, otherwise unlawful, is not to be unlawful when carried on in the circumstances specified.  I feel that I should emphasise that the definition of unlawful gaming in Section 4 is very important.  The existing law was aimed at the promotion of games of chance and it was a good defence to police proceedings to show that the element of chance did not predominate over the element of skill in playing a game.  In consequence, promoters introduced variations of gambling games which ostensibly required an element of skill in the playing and the courts had difficulty in deciding whether particular games were games of chance.  And different courts gave contrary decisions in relation to a particular game.  With the new definitions of gaming in Section 2 and of unlawful gaming in Section 4 we hope to make it hot for any person who promotes or provides facilities for gaming outside the limits permitted in this Bill.</P>
    <P>I do not think that I need go into any detail on this Reading about Section 6 which deals with the conditions under which gaming may be carried on at circuses or travelling shows or about Section 7 which deals with gaming at carnivals and such events.  The purpose of Section 6 is to let the circuses and shows which travel about the country, never stopping more than a couple of days in any one place, to operate slot machines for small prizes in kind, to promote pongo or roulette or such like games for small stakes and small prizes.  Similarly Section 7 allows moderate gaming for one month, for what might be described as worthy purposes, where the organising group get no personal profit.</P>
    <P>I would also direct your particular attention to Section 8: this section was not in the Bill when first circulated and it was inserted as a result of fears that unless the proprietors, etc., of equipment used in gambling games were living here we might very well see a situation developing in which unscrupulous foreign promoters might pay us flying visits, operate with <Col N="697" /> rigged machines, etc., and be gone again before the police could catch up on them.  While recognising the useful part which the circus, travelling show and carnivals, etc., play in brightening up life in villages and small towns, we do not want to establish an El Dorado for showmen and amusement caterers where they can look for gold at every turn of the wheel.</P>
    <P>Section 9 deals with gaming on licensed premises and in sub-sections (1) and (2) simply restates the existing law: sub-section (3) is new and it provides that the playing of cards at whist or bridge drives in licensed hotels, or games such as darts or rings in ordinary public-houses, when conducted for sociable purposes and where the promoter or licensee providing facilities does not take a personal profit from the game, is not unlawful. What we are doing in sub-section (3) is changing the statute law to correspond with the law of common sense so that these harmless, sociable types of gaming may be played in licensed premises in future without any fear of police proceedings.</P>
    <P>Section 10 is another important section.  It prohibits absolutely the type of slot machine which, on the insertion of a coin or token, automatically delivers, when successfully operated, a cash prize in excess of the value of the stake.  These machines commonly referred to as &ldquo;one-armed bandits&rdquo; are gold-mines for the owners: their mechanism is always adjusted to give the owner a profit which may vary from a penny in threepence to tenpence in the shilling.  They are, in effect, devices for transferring money from the pockets of the public into the pockets of the owners and their particular harm lies in the rapidity with which they may be operated.  There are, of course, other types of slot-machines which are gaming machines in that they are coin operated but deliver prizes in kind when successfully operated.  These are the kind referred to in sub-section (2) of Section 4 and they can only be operated in the circumstances set out in Sections 6, 7 and 14 of this Bill.</P>
    <P>I come now to Part III of the Bill which provides for the establishment <Col N="698" /> of licensed amusement halls and funfairs at which gaming may be promoted all the year round.  Originally our intention was that these premises would only be allowed to operate at tourist resorts and only during the holiday season&mdash;in other words where there was a public demand for that kind of amusement&mdash;and in order to bring that about we provided in the Bill, as introduced, what we considered were necessary safeguards.  We provided, first of all, that such a premises could be established in a town or village, etc., only where the appropriate local authority&mdash;the urban council, town commissioners, county councils, etc., as the case might be&mdash;as the representatives of the local people&mdash; formally passed a resolution approving the whole or a specified part of their administrative area as proper for the establishment of such amusement halls; then we went on to limit the period, during which gaming could be carried on from Easter Sunday to 30th September; and we put in provisions so that only a fit and proper person could get a licence for suitable premises.  In the Dáil, however, I was persuaded&mdash;somewhat reluctantly, I will admit&mdash;to allow the court, when granting a certificate in a particular year which would authorise the Revenue Commissioners to issue a licence permitting gaming at an amusement hall or funfair, to fix the period in that year, during which gaming might be carried on.  I have no doubt, however, that if the local authority of a particular place indicates by way of resolution, its view that licences should be issued only for the holiday season or a specified period of a year the District Court concerned, when hearing applications would take cognisance of such a view.</P>
    <P>Part IV of the Bill is concerned with lotteries.  We are allowing office sweeps, raffles at dances, etc., which are in the nature of minor private ventures, to be promoted without formality. We provide for lotteries at circuses, carnivals and licensed amusement halls within the limitations of stakes and prizes and the conditions already provided in respect of gaming at these places under the earlier parts of the Bill.  Then we recognise that <Col N="699" /> there is a certain public demand for lotteries of a more ambitious type which are promoted for the benefit of some charity or for some worthy purpose and we provide for these by way of police permit for a lottery with a £300 prize limit and a District Court licence where a periodical lottery is being promoted with prizes not exceeding £500 per week and in which not more than 40 per cent. of the gross proceeds goes to the expenses of promotion. My personal view is that the public would be better served if prizes were limited to £300 at most, and the expenses of promotion to 25 per cent. at most of the gross proceeds, but there was a body of opinion in the Dáil against me and with some reluctance I agreed to raise the limits originally set out in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Part V of the Bill relates to enforcement, evidence and penalties.  It will be observed that we are re-enacting the law contained in the statute of 1845 which declares gaming and wagering contracts void.  I was under some pressure in the Dáil to change the law in this respect or to give way to the extent that proceedings against a defaulting punter could be heard in court.  Balancing all the arguments for and against, I felt that the law should remain unchanged and that was the general feeling of the House.</P>
    <P>The remaining provisions are of a routine nature: some of them correspond to provisions in statutes named in the Schedule to the Bill which are now being repealed, and others correspond to provisions of the law in force.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I feel that I should mention, as I did in the Dáil, that this Bill has been framed after many years' consideration of the problems and that while it has been my lot to promote the Bill, more than one of my predecessors in office, as Minister for Justice, has had a hand in its shaping.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrederickHawkins" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has given us a very brief outline only of the proposals in this Bill.  No matter how we look at this Bill, we find it is taking away from and curtailing the activities of quite a large section of <Col N="700" /> our people.  The Minister informed us that he had the goodwill of the people engaged in this business.  One might take that and look at it in two ways. If the Minister has their goodwill and these people are as enthusiastic as the Minister would wish us to believe about this Bill, then there must be very little in it that will curtail the activities that he is setting out to curtail. We are all very reluctant to give our approval to any proposals that will deprive any section or sections of our people of any of the freedoms and privileges they now enjoy.  The show business, and those people engaged in it, have played a very important part in the life of the country and they have been the means of providing a very cheap form of entertainment for our people.  Once we set out to place restrictions on activities of this kind, from experience we know that we go from one restriction to another, and we have always found eventually that, instead of removing the evil we set out to remove, we have created a greater evil.</P>
      <P>I am sure many members of the House remember the time when there was a great outcry in the country against the dance in the country house.  We went so far with that that we prohibited the holding of dances in the country house.  By doing that, we removed one great form of amusement and entertainment, the intermixing of our people in rural areas, and we set up what might very rightly be referred to as one of the greatest evils that could be set up in this country.</P>
      <P>I refer to the type of dance hall that we, by Act of the Oireachtas, set up by the issuing of licences.  I have a feeling that many of the people who advocated the abolition of the country house dance and who sponsored the setting up of these halls, would, if they had foreseen the results, be the first to support legislation to end the present system.  It is for that reason that I look on this Bill with very grave doubts as to whether the end justifies the means we are proposing to adopt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill differs very much from that which the Minister first introduced. It has been amended.  Whether these amendments are an improvement <Col N="701" /> is a matter of opinion.  They are improvements in certain sections of the Bill; in others, I would not think they are.  However, that is a matter for another day on the Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The Bill deals with games.  Many of these games are harmless.  Many of them have been encouraged, particularly in our tourist districts, as an entertainment for those people who are holidaying, particularly our own people who are holidaying at home. We have had, down the years, complaints that our seaside resorts are rather drab, that we are not prepared to encourage entertainments that might attract our young people and that might give an opportunity for whiling away the time, particularly in seasons that are not as good as the last season we had.  The majority of these are harmless entertainments.  I will admit that, in a number of cases, particularly in our large centres, a great evil had grown up in the establishment of places of amusement where there are all kinds of games which induced people, particularly women, to spend more money than is good for them; but I do not know whether it is a good thing to have to pass regulations to protect those people from themselves, because, if they are that way inclined, some other avenue will be opened up which will be probably more dangerous and have worse effects than the mere playing of a game of pongo in one of these entertainment, or amusement palaces, as they call them.</P>
    <P>We are taking away a tremendous amount of freedom from the people. We are taking away the right to entertainment that is, of itself, enjoyable to them, and we are doing this in spite of the fact that we have legalised another form of gaming. There is not a village where we have not one, two or three official revenue collecting betting shops legalised by this House.  To my mind, the thing does not exactly make sense, and, while I said at the outset that, if there is an evil there, we should do what we can to remove it, we should make sure that the means we intend to adopt will not create a greater evil I am afraid that is what can follow from this Bill.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="702" /> We are passing the buck, as the Yank would say, over to the local authorities.  We are passing a Bill setting out certain regulations, but we are saying to urban councils, or corporations, or whatever local authority there is: &ldquo;You must do this and you may do that&rdquo; in the matter of licences and just as we have had in the past a very different approach by district justices where cases were brought up before them, so we may expect different approaches from local authorities in regard to this Bill.  One district justice will say pongo is harmless and quite legal; another will impose a fine of £100.  We will have the same approach by many members of local authorities.  Some will want as many registered places of amusement as possible; others will, possibly for various reasons, be anxious to curtail them.</P>
    <P>While we are legalising the whole business and providing for registration and licensing, we are creating a situation where there will be annual, and perhaps monthly, discussions at these local bodies, according as applications for licensing come forward. I would prefer to see a provision in the Bill whereby a person would apply to the Revenue Commissioners, or whatever authority we may decide, for permission for the opening of such premises, that is, if we approve of opening them at all, rather than that we should leave it to the local authorities and have a different outlook in every different local authority district, even within the one county.</P>
    <P>Examining the Bill on general principles, I am not over-enthusiastic about its acceptance, but I am not prepared, on the Second Reading, to vote against it.  That has not been the procedure in this House.  It is a Bill that affects the lives of many of our people, because it curtails the activities of a great section of the people.</P>
    <P>There are 51 sections in the Bill.  It has been in the Dáil for quite a long time.  That fact and the discussion in the Dáil should not influence us so much here in our approach to it.  When saying that, I should say that it is entirely a Committee Bill, one that can be better dealt with in Committee, <Col N="703" /> and which I hope before it leaves this House will be very much improved.  I think I would have quite a number of members on both sides with me in saying that if something is to be done about this, we should examine it very carefully to make sure that whatever legislation we pass will be effective, will be given effect to and recognised, and will not be something that we will just pass and say is there, and that any busybody of a Guard in any part of the country may put it into operation, if he so desires.  It will depend then on the view of the district justice also.</P>
    <P>If the evils to which the Minister made some slight references to-day should, in the national interests, be removed, then, let us seriously consider what we are doing and, on Committee Stage, see if we can possibly improve the Bill so that it will go at least part of the way to remove the evils that exist while allowing the people as much freedom as possible.</P>

In deference to the Minister and to the Seanad, I notify you now, Sir, that I am putting down five amendments and I hope that they will be fully discussed on the Committee Stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LouisWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>It is only right that, in this more liberal age, when there is a much greater levelling up of the resources of the community and a higher standard of living, the inadequate laws of the Lotteries Act, 1845, should be repealed and substituted by more enlightened legislation.  It is obvious that there is a public demand for at least a limited form of gambling, and it is only right that cognisance should be taken of that demand in this Bill. I think it is undesirable to have on the Statute Book legislation which is not being enforced because public opinion is not behind it.  Such law is unrealistic and bad in principle.  It adversely affects the respect and prestige <Col N="704" /> of the enforcing authority.  I believe, for instance, that Section 34 is not capable of being properly enforced when we advert to the long meandering land frontier.  I also think that Section 50 is too drastic.  It is a very serious matter that any postal packet may be detained in transit and forwarded to a superintendent of the Garda Síochána who may open it, without any time limit as to when it shall be forwarded to the addressee if no document relating to a lottery is found therein.</P>
      <P>For instance, assuming that a solicitor in a country district has to send important papers to his town agent, or even to a stockbroker, and those papers should be delivered the following day, a postal official would be entitled under this Bill to forward a postal packet, which is suspected of containing documents in connection with a lottery, to the Garda Síochána and the superintendent can detain those documents without any time limit as to when they should be returned.</P>
      <P>It seems also unrealistic that a young boy or girl who may be earning, but who is under 16 years of age, is precluded from wagering sixpence or threepence, or even a penny in a game of pongo, particularly if they are accompanied by their parents or some other relative, at a parochial carnival. That is the position under two sections of this Bill, namely Section 7 and Section 14.</P>
      <P>I also think that the definition of a public place is much too wide.  For instance, a private dwelling-house may be regarded as a public place because of the fact that the public have access by permission.</P>
      <P>There are quite a number of other sections of the Bill to which I would like to refer on the Committee Stage more fully.  It is not appropriate that they should be dealt with at this stage. For instance, there is the question of the definition in connection with past events.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like particularly to refer to Section 8.  In that section there is a reference to a qualified person, and a qualified person is a person who, during <Col N="705" /> the 12 months, has been ordinarily resident in the State.  There are a number of parishes along the Border where the greater proportion of the parish is in Northern Ireland, and the parish priest or rector, or Presbyterian minister or the other people responsible for the running of the carnival live in Northern Ireland.  Apparently they will not be entitled to run that carnival, except in the portion of the State which is in their particular parish.</P>
    <P>I also think that, in connection with licensed premises, the Bill can be criticised.  It seems to me that a lodger or a member of the family, such as a child, can play ludo or a game of snakes and ladders for a penny in that licensed premises only once, because it is only once in the night that such a game is permitted under that section.  Those are a few of the sections to which I wish again to refer on the Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>In connection with the licensing under Part III of the Bill, I cannot see what advantage there is in bringing the local authority into it.  The local authority will not be the licensing authority.  The licensing authority will be the District Court, and the local authority, once they have adopted the Act, have no further function as far as licensing of the place where the game is to take place is concerned.  The procedure is cumbersome.  First of all, two notices at different times have to be published in the newspapers.  The local authority may be called specially, and, as already referred to in the other House, it may cost up to £70 to bring the members of that local authority together, to decide whether or not the section should be brought into force. The Minister has already stated that the District Court would probably accept the views of the local authority, but it is not mandatory on it to do so, and the District Court will have full discretion as to whether or not it will issue the certificate which will permit the revenue authorities to issue the licence at a subsequent date.</P>
    <P>The local authority will be a notice authority, and that notice has to be served within 28 days, but it does not <Col N="706" /> set out in the Bill whether or not the local authority as such, or the county manager, will be the person who will consider the application.  There may not, for instance, be a meeting of the local authority.  In some counties, meetings take place every three months.  Consequently, from the time the notice is served on the county council until the date of the District Court, there may not be a meeting of that council.  Consequently, I assume that the county manager would be the person who would decide whether or not he should instruct his solicitor to oppose the application or the conditions under which the certificate should be granted by the District Court.  I would suggest, therefore, to the Minister that this is too expensive and cumbersome.  The court is the final authority in the matter, and as in the dance hall licence, where the county council or the urban council, as the case may be, are the notice authority, that is sufficient.  They can come in, as any individual is entitled to come in, on any application and oppose the application, or suggest that for public health reasons the premises are not suitable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise with some diffidence to say something about this Bill, because I am peculiarly ignorant of gaming or gambling of any kind.  I feel inclined to recall the occasion on which a predecessor of the Minister, introducing an amendment of the licensing law, said that he was completely ignorant of public-houses.  I happened to be Leader of the Opposition at that particular moment and I knew the Minister from our childhood and I said that I knew that he was not any more ignorant than I was.  A third Senator got up and said that he had ample experience of public-houses from both sides of the counter.  I am now in the position that all I know about gaming is that, on one very wet day, I spent an afternoon in one of those places.  But I do think that there is an improvement in this Bill in so far as it ends, as the Minister said, certain legal uncertainty.  I gather that a great many people who have been in charge of establishments in Dublin and other cities and towns <Col N="707" /> have actually been doing something for which there was no legal authority. Whatever its merits, this Bill is giving legal authority to those places, and to travelling shows and circuses.</P>
      <P>There is something in what Senator Hawkins has said, that this is another piece of legislation to save people from themselves.  The curious thing is that every time we take on this kind of measure we, of course, at a certain expense to the State, increase the responsibility of the Civil Service and travel further on the road to giving the State more power.  For every particular instance, there is ample argument, but when we add them all up, the sum is enormous.</P>
      <P>Without dealing with the general principle of the Bill, I should like to ask a question which will offer some trouble on the Committee Stage, with regard to Part III.  I know nothing about the business to which this Part refers, but I understand from Part III that, in order that this gaming business may be carried on in a given area, the local authority must pass a resolution adopting Part III of this Bill when it becomes an Act.  Does that mean that if a person has been operating a gaming establishment without coming under police notice and so on, in a reasonable way, for a number of years&mdash;say, ten or 15 or 20 years&mdash;he may find himself, when this Bill becomes an Act, in this position, that the local authority in his area does not adopt a resolution putting this part of the Act into operation, and by that simple fact may find himself put out of business?  In that case, not only is he put out of business himself, but there are his dependents and his employees who are affected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That, in itself, as far as I can read Section 13, is a departure from the usual practice of legislation and will certainly do injustice.  It could do a lot of damage to the people concerned who have been running a business for a number of years and who have invested in it, and, to put it in the mildest form, it would be very unfair to put them out of business because the provisions of this section say that a local <Col N="708" /> authority must pass a resolution.  I do not know if anything can be done in the matter.  It does seem unfair, however, that people who have been conducting their business reasonably and lawfully over a number of years, who have invested capital in it and who have employees, should now be in the position that they can be put out of business, while others in a neighbouring county or area might be able to continue.  I would agree with Senator Hawkins that it is an undesirable provision in the Bill and perhaps the Minister could tell us how he proposes to deal with that matter on the Committee Stage.  The Bill is preeminently a Committee Bill and I should like to have more information on it at that Stage.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The matters concerned in the Bill are many and this is a very involved piece of legislation.  Its provisions are either desirable or necessary, but I am afraid it would be difficult to enforce it in certain respects.  As somebody has already stated, if not here then in the other House, it is not a good thing to pass legislation when there is no certainty that it will be enforced, because the tendency in that case is that, in practice, the measure in question falls into disrespect.  Sometimes, of course, as we know and as I have referred to already in Irish, when we proceed to remove evils or alleged evils of the nature we seek to grapple with here in this measure, we may do a certain amount of damage in other directions. There is a danger always of that arising in interfering with the <Col N="709" /> freedom of the subject.  I am not one of those who holds that it is not necessary to curtail at times the freedom of the individual, even for his own sake, but it is a very difficult matter to determine to what lengths one should go for a remedy.</P>
    <P>It is very difficult in a matter of this kind to ensure that in trying to remedy certain social evils or alleged social evils, that we have left the position no worse than it was already and that certain anomalies do not arise that were not there before.  It is very difficult, for instance, to distinguish between legitimate and illegitimate amusements.  Fundamentally, I suppose it is a moral question and one to be resolved by people's own conscience, but I do not know.  I have certain doubts about some of the provisions of this measure and whether they will bring about desired results.  I have also some misgivings as to whether the position in relation to gaming and lotteries in this country is going to be fundamentally altered.  We have to take many things into consideration when dealing with this matter.  We have to take public organisations for charitable purposes and there is always entwined with that the question of profit for those who engage in the carrying out of these amusements, whether they be shows, bazaars or carnivals as they are often called.</P>
    <P>The Minister has stated that it was his own personal view that a limitation of £300 should be adhered to in connection with the organisation of these functions.  Now the figure has been increased to £500, I think, in the Bill, and one question I would like to ask is whether that will apply to carnivals organised for charitable purposes generally, because I am aware that in the past some of these functions were so well organised and carried out that they realised a much higher figure than that.  I would like the Minister to give us some indication as to whether this limitation is to be imposed in the case of carnivals or bazaars.  The system in this connection, as Senators are aware, is that there are certain companies who run carnivals and travel from place to place at the invitation of the local organisations to help these organisations <Col N="710" /> to collect funds for their charitable objects.  The arrangement is that 50 per cent. of the takings is retained by the owners of the carnival machinery, if I might put it that way, and 50 per cent. retained by the local people who are promoting the charity in question.  There is also the question of the deduction of expenses which is referred to in this measure.</P>
    <P>I am entirely in agreement with those who have referred to this, what I would describe as cumbersome procedure, whereby promoters of these carnivals, or the promoters of whatever amusements are involved for the organisation, have to deal with the local authority.  I am concerned as to whether it is right to bring in the local authority at all; whether it is advisable to compel these people to make application to the local authority before they can go to the District Court.  That appears to me to be a roundabout way of doing business and I am at one with the views expressed here that the pattern adopted in connection with application for licences for dance-halls would be quite sufficient for this purpose also.  This is a matter that should be given further consideration by the Minister between now and the Committee Stage.  In any case, having examined it more closely, we will see whether the section relating to it can be amended.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to common sense.  No doubt common sense is a wonderful ingredient in all these matters. If it could prevail in the organisation of these amusements and gaming, there would be no need for this legislation.  Unfortunately, common sense is not always present.  The Bill is predominantly a Committee Stage Bill and I am glad to say that the Minister himself has an open mind on some of these matters.  It is only right that he should.  Here in this country we have not yet had sufficient experience as to the extent to which the habits and proclivities of the people who make up the social order can be curbed.</P>
    <P>For instance, it is very difficult to deal with what is described in the Bill as gaming in licensed premises. According to one section here, even a <Col N="711" /> game of cards in licensed premises will be lawful, only if the licensee gives permission to those participating in the game to sit in a room away from the licensed premises.  As far as I can gather from the Bill, if there is a question of refreshments for those taking part in the game, the proprietor himself would have to put up the refreshments, and those engaged in the game cannot be permitted lawfully to purchase any refreshments.  That would be a grand arrangement for those who would come into such a place for such a game; but I doubt if in any part of the country such a game were possible under those conditions. I should like to hear the Minister on that point again when he is replying, stating to what extent an innocent game of cards would be proscribed by this measure, a game such as we have had experience of in an ordinary private room in a licensed premises where people are permitted to gather to pass a few hours on a winter's night.  It is the common practice up and down the country in towns and villages. That is one aspect of the matter that we should have explained to us very fully.</P>
    <P>I do not think it would be advisable on the Second Reading to go into the Bill in any more detail.  It is a very involved piece of legislation, and necessarily so, because of the difficult problems which it seeks to solve.  Because of its involved nature, I think it would be necessary to get a fairly long interval before the Committee Stage, so as to have these very important matters fully examined.</P>

All the same, I think there is general agreement in both Houses and throughout the country that some effort should be made to control gaming and lotteries. I have the greatest sympathy for any Government or Minister tackling this problem, as it is a tremendous task. The Minister said that while the Bill may not be 100 per cent. successful, it will remove certain legal uncertainties. I doubt very much if the Bill will be even 20 per cent. successful and <Col N="712" /> I am almost certain it will create far more legal uncertainties than there are at present.  I do not think that should prevent the introduction of the Bill, possibly with amendments.</P>
      <P>The Minister was worried about an El Dorado for certain foreigners coming into this country for gaming and lotteries.  I think the El Dorado will be for the legal profession and that the courts will see more of it than anyone else.  To be fair, we can only do the best we can in setting down a fundamental framework effecting some sort of control.  It must necessarily be largely a matter of trial and error. There are many things we would all like to discuss, but we can discuss them more easily on the Committee Stage. I support the suggestion that we should be given a little more time for amendments.</P>
      <P>There is one part of the Bill on which I should like to get some information now.  Part IV deals with lotteries and begins by saying that no person shall promote or assist in promoting lotteries.  Then Sections 22, 23, 24 and 25 continue, saying that a lottery shall be lawful in various special circumstances.  Finally, Section 26 says that a lottery shall not be unlawful if it is promoted and conducted wholly within the State in accordance with a permit or licence. May I ask the Minister what was the purpose of putting in Sections 21, 22, 23, 24 and 25, if the whole thing comes down to whether the Minister will give a licence or not?  I do not wish to cast any reflection on the Minister personally, or on any other Minister associated with the formation of this Bill&mdash;I think this Bill has been sponsored by two Governments, so to speak&mdash;but it is an impossible position to put a Minister in, that he is given a blanket section on the completely wide open issue of a permit.  It must be an appalling position for a Minister to be in.  I can see no advantage whatsoever in all the previous sections if it comes down to a question of whether the Minister will give a permit for a lottery.  I would like a little more information on that before we come to discuss the amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As we have agreed, it is not a Bill <Col N="713" /> which we should discuss at length on this Stage, but we can look forward to the Committee Stage, when we will do everything we can to make the Bill as workable as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ArthurCox" hpid="Mr. Cox Mr. Cox">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>Like the other speakers, I frankly feel very doubtful whether this Bill is really necessary at all or, if it is necessary, whether it is the best way to go about securing the ends that it seeks.  I also agree completely with what everyone else has said up to now, that it is obviously a Bill for Committee because everything has to be discussed in detail.</P>
      <P>At the same time, one does realise that it will be very difficult to discuss each little bit in Committee, if we have only a very vague idea as to the general pattern of the mosaic which we are seeking to construct.  I think it is quite clear that members of the Dáil must have felt that very much.  They made so many amendments in the Bill originally presented that it really needs a great deal of reconsideration all through.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are very many sections to which I would certainly like to have set down amendments to raise points for discussion, but there is one particular point which I ought to mention now because it is a point on which I would seek to bring forward amendments.  One of the principles which the Bill lays down is that a lottery will be unlawful if it is in any way conducted outside the State.  I think we all know that the Mater Hospital in Belfast&mdash;which is one of the principal hospitals in Belfast&mdash;has been denied by the authorities there the financial assistance, help and support that has been given to all other hospitals there and, as a result, the authorities who administer that hospital have sought funds to provide for its maintenance and endowment by a pool.  Under this Bill, that pool would be held, I think, to be illegal&mdash; although as the law has stood hitherto, it was within the law.  As the Bill stands, it would present the very greatest difficulties in tickets being sold in the Twenty-Six Counties to assist a charity, however deserving and <Col N="714" /> however close it may be to the hearts of the majority of the people in the Twenty-Six Counties, if it were in the Six Counties.  That is a major aspect of the Bill to which I would like to refer particularly now, as it would be my intention to move amendments to rectify what I think would be a most unfortunate result of the Bill, if it were passed in its present form.  Having said that, I am not going to speak in detail on the Bill.</P>
    <P>There is scarcely a section which does not need a great deal of discussion. Reference was made by one Senator to-night to the definition of the word &ldquo;lottery&rdquo;.  Apart altogether from the fact that it is rather difficult to understand why one refers to a &ldquo;forecast of the past&rdquo;, the definition as now introduced obviously has been devised to meet the evasion which was practised by introducing some small element of skill into competitions which the ordinary common-sense person would say were competitions of chance; but, as now drafted, the effect of this Bill would apparently be to prevent in a great many cases prizes being given for real competitions of skill.  In other words, it seems to me that the Bill in this legislation goes to the other extreme and produces an even worse effect.  I am not going to go into any further details, but this point is of very great importance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardMcGuire" hpid="Mr. McGuire Mr. McGuire">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGuire</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is entirely a Committee Bill.  I agree with Senator Cox when he refers to the mosaic nature of the sections in the Bill.  It is very difficult to get a clear picture as to whether this Bill is, in fact, a loosening or a tightening up of the laws in connection with gaming and lotteries.</P>
      <P>We should think a bit about this matter before we get down to work on the sections, so that we can make up our minds as to what way the Bill can be improved and arrive at a general picture in the end which will improve the whole position in connection with lotteries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is something to be said for the Bill.  I do not know enough about legal matters to be a judge in this particular instance, but from a mere <Col N="715" /> perusal of the Bill, we see that there is quite a number of repeals of enactments in Section 3 of Part I and, again, in Parts I and II of the Schedule to the Bill.  There seems to be a large number of repeals of enactments made over long periods of years.</P>
    <P>The merit of this piece of legislation would seem to reside in the fact that at least in the 52 sections, we have what there is to be known about gaming and lotteries.  That, in itself, is an achievement.  At least, we will have in one Bill the law as it stands in connection with such matters as gaming and lotteries.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeOBrien" hpid="Professor O'Brien Professor O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with all the other speakers that this Bill will require very detailed examination in Committee.  It is essentially a lawyer's Bill.  I am rather inclined to agree with Senator ffrench O'Carroll that the lawyers will probably do very well out of it when it is passed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one section of the Bill, Section 22, which calls for comment. Merely reading that section without any expert advice, it seems to me that it imposes a very heavy burden, indeed, on the periodical Press in this country.  I may be wrong, but the matter is of sufficient public importance to raise it here.  There is a distinction in the other sections between lotteries which are legal and illegal because they are permitted by the Minister or by the superintendent of the Garda Síochána but, in Section 22, we seems to have come to something absolutely prohibitive, that is to say, that no lottery is to be advertised in the Press.  Nothing is to appear regarding a lottery, except the results of a lottery which are declared not to be unlawful.  Does that mean that the ordinary football pool is ruled out completely in all circumstances?  It seems to me that, read in that way, the distinction in the rest of the Bill between what is lawful and what is unlawful disappears in Section 22. Under that section, it seems to me that the periodical Press would be greatly impeded in connection with what I would have regarded as a legitimate part of their ordinary business.  I agree <Col N="716" /> with Senator Cox that this Bill has been so much amended in the Dáil and is such a patchwork now that possibly my interpretation may be unintentional and may be corrected at a later stage.  I suggest that the freedom of the Press should not be limited more than is absolutely necessary.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DominickMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I for one have no doubt whatever as to the need for legislation dealing with games and lotteries.  We are aware of the very bad position existing in Dublin and other places in connection with these funfairs and it could be, because of the imminence of legislation, that these places may have become a little more respectable. Nevertheless, I compliment the Minister on bringing in this legislation and I hope that any amendments the Seanad may agree to will not in any way weaken the intentions of the Bill.</P>
      <P>There is just one matter on which I have some doubt.  I wonder if the Minister would tell us whether consideration was given, in dealing with the sections about lotteries, to the practicability of making it unlawful for children to engage in the sale of lottery tickets in public places.  It seems to me that in certain lotteries which are permitted, the sale of tickets cannot take place in public places, but then when we come to lotteries for which a licence has been issued, there is no bar to the sale of these tickets in public places. What I am concerned with is not the sale in public places, but the sale by children.  I do not know whether other Senators entertain the same doubts about this matter, but I think it is both unfortunate and undesirable that children should be given tickets and urged by the promoters of worthy lotteries, I am sure, to hawk these tickets around the streets and from door to door, at night usually.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We know that children are given tickets at school.  They may be for church buildings or some other worthy object, but I, for one, strongly object to my children being urged to go around the streets and sell these tickets.  I think it is wrong that children should be urged to do that.  I should like the Minister to tell us whether consideration was given to the <Col N="717" /> practicability of stopping that practice. I think all of us will agree that it is wrong.  There may not be the same unanimity of opinion with regard to children going round from neighbour to neighbour selling tickets, but I think we would all agree in deploring the situation which obtains, say, in O'Connell Street and other streets, where you have young people going from persons to persons asking them to buy tickets.  I think that is wrong. I had hoped that this Bill might do something about that particular practice.</P>
    <P>Much has been made in the discussion of the giving to local authorities of some initiative in regard to the licensing of amusement halls and funfairs. Senators who spoke on this section seemed to think that those local authorities should not be asked to agree to these funfairs, that it should be done centrally.  I cannot agree with that viewpoint, because if we look at the matter for a moment, we will appreciate that different towns and different localities might have different views about the desirability of having these funfairs in their boroughs.  I do not know whether Dalkey, for instance, might take the same view as Bray.  You are faced with those different views.  It could have something to do with the attitude of the inhabitants of the locality. Some people feel, in conscience, that these things are morally wrong and I think their views in that respect have a right to be respected.  If the people in a locality are dead set against funfairs, the local authorities should be given the power not to permit them in the locality.  The Senators who have spoken against the section have not, to my mind, told us exactly the objections they see in that provision, and, failing more convincing evidence that it would be wrong or undesirable, then, I would certainly urge on the Minister to allow that section of the Bill to stand.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCrosbie" hpid="Mr. Crosbie Mr. Crosbie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crosbie</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Senator Walsh, I must express disquiet at Section 50. This is the section which permits a superintendent of police to examine and open postal packets at the request of a suspicious member of the Department <Col N="718" /> of Posts and Telegraphs.  I think it is quite outrageous that, under any circumstances, any member of the police force in normal times should be permitted to open and examine any postal letters or packages.</P>
      <P>I must point out to the Minister that this section goes much further than the actual regulations laid down by the Revenue Commissioners in cases of letter packages which are suspected of containing contraband and goods which are subject to revenue duty.  In that case, where a postal packet arrives in this State addressed to a resident here and where the customs authorities in the Post Office suspect that this packet contains dutiable goods of one kind or another, they notify the addressee and request him to attend at the customs section of the Post Office, where the packet will be opened in his presence.  Admittedly, Sir, if the addressee does not take advantage of that request and does not turn up, the packet will be ultimately opened in his absence.</P>
      <P>It seems to me that this Bill outsteps the bounds of what I think we should look on as the rights of the private individual in this country.  I sincerely trust that between now and the Committee Stage, the Minister will give further serious consideration to this particular section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator ffrench O'Carroll that no legislation passed by this House can have the effect of preventing people from gambling in this country.  I will go further and say that no legislation passed in any House in the world would have the effect of preventing people from gambling, because gambling is the very essence of life.  You cannot live without taking risks and the person who crosses the street at the present time is gambling with his own life.  Practically speaking, every effort of living is an act of gambling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having said that, I think it should be said, perhaps, that it is very doubtful if politicians are the best people to restrict or control gambling, because of all the gamblers in society, the politician is, perhaps, the most efficient, or at least the one who <Col N="719" /> practises gambling most frequently.  A politician must be a gambler.  It has fallen to the politician, as the representative of the people, to decide how gambling should be controlled and regulated and I suppose we have got to do the best we can in the circumstances.</P>
    <P>It will be accepted that this Bill is necessary in every sense of the word, in so far as gambling has been carried on in this country over a number of years and has been carried on illegally. Violations of the law, even though they may be crude and ill-considered laws, are undesirable, and it is undesirable that those charged with enforcing the law should be more or less instructed to ignore breaches of the law. For that reason, I think it is desirable that the law governing gambling, lotteries and other such things should be tightened up in so far as it is possible to do so.</P>
    <P>When we come to the details of tightening up the law, we find ourselves up against very grave difficulties. I feel&mdash;I may be wrong in this &mdash;that if this Bill is enacted in its present form without amendment, it will have some peculiar effects.  One of the effects will be to prohibit people from sending out of this country Hospital Sweep tickets.  Section 34 of the Bill states:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(1) No person shall send or attempt to send out of the State any ticket, counterfoil or coupon for use in a lottery or any money for the purchase of, or any money representing the purchase price of, a ticket or chance in a lottery or a prize won in a lottery, or any document relating to the purchase or sale of, or indicating the identity of the holder of, any such ticket or chance of the winner of any such prize.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It would appear, on the face of it, that that section would have the effect of prohibiting the sending out from this country by post of sweep tickets.  I suppose we must assume that they must be described in law as lottery tickets. However, I suppose that is a matter which will be considered.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am entirely against the provisions of the section which seeks to place upon the local authority the onus of deciding whether gaming should be permitted or not in their areas.  I agree with Senator Hayes that a grave injustice might be inflicted if a person who had been engaged in that business were, by a motion of the council or failure of the council to pass a resolution, put completely out of business after the passing of this Act.  There is no provision for compensation or anything else.  That would seem to be a grave injustice.  In addition to that, it is very doubtful if any useful purpose is served by having this power placed in the hands of local authorities. I think it would be far better to allow any citizen or group of citizens, or company, who wish to carry on this business to apply to the courts for a licence to operate an amusement hall or any business of that kind.  The courts would be fair and impartial.  If there was a local opinion against the granting of such a licence, it could be put forward in the courts and the objections could be stated there and would, I am sure, receive very full consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is in this particular part of the Bill one sub-section which I find it difficult to understand.  Section 3 says that a local authority may, by resolution, adopt this part in respect of the whole or a specified part of its administrative area, and may by resolution rescind such adoption.  Sub-section (2) of the same section says that for the purpose of this section the administrative area of a council or of a county shall not include any borough, urban district or town.  As far as the borough or urban district is concerned, I assume that it would be dealt with by the urban or borough council, but as far as a town is concerned which is not an urban town with an urban council, and which is not a borough, of course, there does not seem to be any provision made for it.  I do not know whether it is a typographical error or not, but it seems that the wording is so vague that it would have the effect of preventing this resolution from <Col N="721" /> operating in respect of a town which has not got an urban council.</P>
    <P>One section of the Bill I would warmly applaud, that is the section that prohibits cheating in regard to every form of gaming.  Whatever we may say about the desirability or otherwise of gambling, everyone will agree that anything in the nature of fraud or dishonesty or deliberate cheating should be dealt with as sternly as possible.  If the chances are fair, everybody knows what he is doing, but, if they are not, a crime, or at least a serious offence, is committed which should be dealt with.</P>
    <P>Our approach to this whole question should be to regard our people as adult and free citizens capable, in the main, of looking after themselves.  It is only in respect of children, or people in their formative years, that protection should be required.  There should also, of course, be protection against fraud and dishonesty; but if people are prepared to put down stakes in regard to any coming event, whether it is a toss of a coin or anything else, there cannot be any serious objection.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether this Bill will have the effect, when enacted, of making illegal the time-honoured and old-established game of pitch-and-toss at the country cross-roads.  That game has been widely practised and does very often involve very serious losses for the individual concerned.  Many might regard it as illegal, but I would say that, if the forces of the law were to be employed to suppress it, they would be kept fairly busy.  In these matters, a certain amount of common sense is desirable.  The main object should be to see that if gaming or lotteries or gambling are carried out, they are carried out with a certain amount of restraint.  The same point is important with regard to amusement halls and things of that kind&mdash;that they are conducted in a way that does not interfere with or annoy the people in the district.</P>
    <P>It is a strange thing that we impose fairly rigid restrictions in regard to lotteries here and insist that the person running a lottery must obtain a <Col N="722" /> permit from the superintendent of the Guards, or, if the amount is higher than £300, from the court; but anyone in this country can start a weekly paper and can run a lottery for a prize without any limit, as far as I know. It appears that there is nothing in this Act or in any legislation to prevent that being done.  In addition to that, it would seem that newspapers published and printed outside this country can be imported and run lotteries for very high amounts.  If there is anything wrong in running a lottery for a very high prize fund, it should be equally wrong in regard to those newspapers.</P>
    <P>There are in this Bill a great many anomalies and a great number of contradictions. I think that it should be given very careful consideration by this House in regard to the details of the sections to ensure that as far as possible it is not made more illogical or more unworkable than it actually is.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. McHugh</NameTxt>
      <P>Everybody has referred to this as a Committee Bill and has been proceeded on Second Stage to discuss details of the sections.  Since it is rather late, I will confine my remarks to just two points which I think are of fairly general interest and would seem to touch on some principle.</P>
      <P>One of them is that there seems to be a certain amount of anonymity allowed to the object of a lottery.  For example, there is no stipulation that the beneficiary of a lottery, considered legal by this Bill, must be a resident of the Twenty-Six Counties, that is, the area under our jurisdiction, and there is no indication in the Bill, that I can find, at any rate, that the object of the lottery must be located in this part of the national territory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Just to amplify my point, you will find, under Section 33, while a licensee must have his name on the ticket, the beneficiary's name or the object for <Col N="723" /> which the ticket is being sold need not necessarily be on the ticket at all.  I dislike this kind of anonymity about beneficiaries or objects.  It may be that this is designed to let in the Mater Hospital, Belfast.  I am sure it is a very deserving object, but I would point out that, in widening this Bill for this purpose, you also let in what the Minister has already described as the crooked promoter from abroad.  I can see promoters from Samarkand to San Francisco descending on this country to promote lotteries for the purpose of setting straight the Tower of Pisa or to make crooked the steeple in some remote part of Europe. I think that is important because there should be a provision of some kind that the beneficiaries should be resident in the Twenty-Six Counties, or that the object for which the funds are being collected should be in the area under the jurisdiction of the State.</P>
    <P>There is another point which I am sure has struck other Senators, and that is that there does not seem to be anything in the Bill to prevent a large organisation, with branches in different areas, and with, perhaps, a number of charitable purposes, all very estimable in their own way, from running perhaps 20 or 30 lotteries in the same week, in all of which they would have a ceiling of £500, but if you take them as a total, you will find that hundreds of thousands of pounds can be taken in by a particular organisation.</P>
    <P>I will have more to say on the Committee Stage.  It seems to me that too much power is being given to the Garda superintendent and too little to the public who may have objections to lotteries in their area through canvassing by children, which can be just as annoying as amusement parks.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. Everett Mr. Everett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the criticism of Senators and the points raised can be dealt with on the Committee Stage. I want, however, to remove impressions which may have been created by Senator Hawkins.  He said we were taking rights away from certain individuals. The position is quite the opposite.  I am trying to establish the right of a person at a carnival to play <Col N="724" /> pongo, a game that has been prohibited. We have known cases where not alone the promoters but the members of the committee of a carnival being run for charitable purposes were prosecuted at the end of the carnival. Not alone were the committee members, who were doing the work voluntarily, fined, but the owner was also fined.</P>
      <P>We have had consultations with professional showmen and amusement caterers.  We recognise that they are an important element in the community. They are part of the life of rural areas.  They have asked us to put these sections in the Bill for their own protection.</P>
      <P>The reason local councils have been given the right to appear before district justices is that we have had representations from seaside places in County Dublin where amusements and carnivals are carried on, and where people have found themselves unable to sleep until after 2 a.m. because of the noise of loud-speakers and juke boxes.  We have also had representations from the business people of Talbot Street protesting against loud-speakers and amusements going on from early morning and interfering with their trade and customers.  In those cases, the local authority will have the right to appear before the district justice and make their objections. In my own constituency, we have Glendalough, and the public authority would object to any carnival coming there.  I am sure that would be the wish of every Senator in this House.  That is why we are giving the right to public authorities to come before a district justice.</P>
      <P>In regard to licensed premises, we are now amending the law so as to give the owner of a licensed premises the right to have an innocent game of whist on his premises.  Up to the present he, or even a hotel owner, could be prosecuted if he did so.  In future, they can do so, where they are deriving no profit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been suggested that we should not allow children to sell tickets.  I have given that matter very serious consideration and I was expecting, if I decided to prohibit children from <Col N="725" /> selling tickets, to be lacerated in the Seanad for interfering with rights and taking away the rights of the individual. I thought it would be too drastic at the present time to take away those rights from the people.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Everett) James Everett">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Everett)</NameTxt>
      <P>The object of the Bill is to prolong the present Rent Restrictions Acts, which otherwise would expire at the end of next month, for a further period of one year, that is, until the 31st December, 1956.  It is settled policy that these Acts ought not be allowed to lapse before the Government have completed their examination of the whole problem of rent control with particular reference to the recommendations in the Report on Rent Control presented to my predecessor by the Conroy Commission.</P>
      <P>The commission's report contains a comprehensive review of the rent control problem and its main recommendations are that the present controls be continued, with some increases in controlled rents for landlords who are liable for repairs to meet increased repair costs, and that control be extended to houses built since 1941 or to be built hereafter.  The report also recommends an extension of control to furnished lettings.  There are other recommendations which also raise important issues and there are many suggested amendments of a technical character.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The aim of the Government is to reach a fair solution of this problem, which has persisted since rent control was first introduced almost 40 years ago, and which has since grown in complexity. A complicated system of legal rights and obligations has developed in the meantime and must be taken into account in assessing the situation. <Col N="726" /> Since the war relatively few houses have been built for letting apart from those provided by local authorities. Private builders have been active in building houses for owner-occupation, but there is still a shortage of houses, particularly in Dublin and Cork, and it will be some years before the shortage can be fully overcome.</P>
    <P>These are some of the considerations which the Government have to bear in mind.  I am not yet in a position to announce their final decisions although I am hoping to be able to do so during 1956.  In the meantime, I am sure there will be general agreement on the necessity for continuing the present Acts in force for a further period and I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <P>Finally, I should like to take this opportunity of saying that a Bill is being prepared on the basis of the recommendations in the second report of the Conroy Commission, that is to say, the Report on Reversionary Leases under the Landlord and Tenant Acts.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrederickHawkins" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>We are somewhat disappointed by the information which the Minister has given us in connection which the recommendations of the Rent Restrictions Commission.  We have been waiting for quite a long time now for a comprehensive Rent Restrictions Bill and I would like to point out to the Minister the importance of having such a Bill brought in as early as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister referred to the fact that, in late years, there have been no developments in the provision by private enterprise of houses for renting. The Minister could not expect and the Government could not expect it to be otherwise, while this whole question of rent restriction is hanging in the air, and while people who might be prepared to build for renting do not know exactly where they stand.  So, apart altogether from doing justice to the landlord and tenant who are landlord and tenant at the moment, if we want to encourage the erection of houses for letting, by private enterprise or by local societies, we should be in a position to introduce the comprehensive Bill, so that people will <Col N="727" /> know what provisions will govern the letting of houses in future.</P>
    <P>The Minister also stated that the houses being erected are all for tenant purchase.  That may be very good, but there is a big want, and that want is being passed over, and local authorities have now to provide what was provided in the past by private enterprise.</P>

      <P>We made some Orders to-day for Committee Stages on Wednesday next, but it would appear that only one of these Bills will give rise to a long or substantial Committee Stage, that is, the Bill we have been discussing, the Gaming and Lotteries Bill.  We have discussed this matter with other members of the House and there would appear to be agreement that there is no need for a meeting of the House until December 14th, when we would take these Committee Stages.</P>
      <P>The Seanad adjourned at 10.5 p.m. until Wednesday, December 14th, 1955.</P>
