      <P>The object of this Bill is to obtain legislative authority for the increases in old age and blind pensions, and widows non-contributory pensions, which were forecast by the Minister for Finance in his financial statement on 4th May, 1955, to come into effect as from Friday, 29th July, 1955.</P>
      <P>For old age and blind pensioners, the increase is 2/6 a week, added to each of the present statutory rates, which are 21/6, 16/6, 11/6 and 6/6. About 166,000 pensioners will benefit by these increases, including about 6,000 blind pensioners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the inter-Party Government took office in 1948, the maximum rate of old age and blind pension under the Old Age Pensions Acts was 10/- a week.  Cash supplements to pension were also being paid, at 5/- a week in urban areas and 2/6 a week in rural areas.  Public assistance authorities had power, in rural areas, to grant a further supplemental allowance not exceeding 2/6 a week to pensioners in necessitous circumstances, recovering 75 per cent. of the cost from <Col N="1828" /> State funds.  Under the Social Welfare Act, 1948, new inclusive pension rates were fixed, the maximum being increased to 17/6 a week, and the various supplemental schemes were discontinued.</P>
    <P>Early in 1951 the inter-Party Government decided to increase these pensions still further, and to raise the maximum to 20/- a week.  This was announced in the Dáil on 2nd March, 1951, by Deputy Norton, who was then Minister for Social Welfare.  Before this promise could be implemented, there was a change of Government, but the new Minister, my predecessor, promoted legislation which gave effect to it in the Social Welfare Act, 1951, under which the increases were allowed as from 5th October in that year.</P>
    <P>Under the Social Welfare Act of 1952, the maximum rate was increased to 21/6 a week as from 4th July, 1952, to counter-balance the increased cost of food when subsidies were reduced. The present Bill will bring the maximum up to 24/- a week.</P>
    <P>I feel sure that there will be little, if any, objection to granting these increases to the aged and the blind.  On the other hand, there may be some who will say that 2/6 a week is not enough.  To these I would point out that the Government would be very glad to give greater increases but for the fact that even a small increase for each pensioner involves finding a large additional sum when there are so many to be paid.  The 2/6 increase now being provided will cost £1,085,000 in a full year.  This, added to the provision for old age and blind pensions in the current year's Estimates, which is £9,420,000, would bring the total for a year to £10,505,000.</P>
    <P>Approximately 28,000 widows who are in receipt of non-contributory pensions will also get increases of 2/6 a week as from 29th of next month.  If the widow has one dependent child, she will get an additional 1/- a week, and if she has two or more dependent children the addition will be 2/- a week, along with the 2/6.  The yearly cost of these increases will be about £199,000, which will bring the total estimated cost of widows' non-contributory <Col N="1829" /> pensions in a full year up to £1,799,000.</P>
    <P>When the inter-Party Government took over in 1948, widows' non-contributory pensions were being paid at 11/6 a week in county boroughs, 10/- in urban districts, 7/6 in small towns and 8/- in rural areas.  All these figures are inclusive of the cash supplements which were being paid with the pensions.  Under the Social Welfare Act, 1948, the supplements were discontinued; and the pension rates were increased to 14/- a week in the county boroughs and urban districts and 10/- a week elsewhere.</P>
    <P>Widows' non-contributory pensions were again increased by the Social Welfare Act, 1952, when the maximum pension for a widow with two or more dependent children became 32/- a week.  The present Bill increases this to 36/6 as from 29th July, 1955, so that in such cases the increase is 4/6 a week.</P>
    <P>The total number of persons who will receive increases of from 2/6 to 4/6 a week under this Bill will be about 194,000.  This will bring the total annual cost of old age and blind pensions, and widows' non-contributory pensions, up to about £12,304,000.  This is a large sum in relation to the total expenditure by the Exchequer, but it will not be grudged as it helps to make life easier for the most necessitous and deserving classes in the country.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the Bill because of the increases envisaged in it, increases that will be available to old age <Col N="1830" /> pensioners, blind pensioners and widows after the operative date, 29th July.  I do not say that these are anything like what many people expected, in view of the many pronouncements made about the necessitous classes of people mentioned in this measure, but of course it is always found that, when people take responsibility, the money is not so easily procured as it would seem to have been before these people took responsibility.</P>
    <P>This 2/6 a week in the case of old age pensioners, blind pensioners and widows scarcely makes amends to these classes of people for the way in which they have been treated in the distant past.  I suppose it can be truthfully said that the sum of 2/6 a week at present is not worth any more than 1/- was in 1939 or 1940, so that, according to the changed value of money, what we are actually doing in this measure is giving the old age pensioners, the blind pensioners and the widows 1/- extra.  However, we have to be thankful for small mercies.</P>
    <P>There is one thing which I cannot understand, that is, the omission of widows' contributory pensions from the provisions of the measure before us.  While we are grateful for the consideration that is being given to those widows in receipt of non-contributory pensions, I say it is an injustice to exclude those widows who are in receipt of contributory pensions, especially when one recalls that their deceased husbands were paying their contributions over the years.  The Minister and the Government may have some idea of doing something for them in the future.  If so we would like to hear about it.</P>
    <P>There are other sections of the people who come under the heading of social welfare, who are not mentioned in this measure at all.  It cannot be denied that the impact of the increased cost of living falls heavily upon them also.  However, we will have another time to discuss that particular aspect of the matter.  I welcome the measure and I know that the Seanad will pass it through quickly, so as to make the benefits available to old age pensioners, blind pensioners and widows as quickly as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S.T. Ruane</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like also to welcome this measure and congratulate the Minister on its introduction. It is evidence of the fact that the Government has decided to concentrate, at the earliest stage possible, on relieving two of the most deserving sections of the community&mdash;old age pensioners and widows.  Though Senator Kissane refers to the increase as a small mercy and is anxious to discuss the value of money now compared to what it was some time ago, I cannot help feeling that it certainly is a step in the right direction and not in the direction pointed to in a cartoon in the section of the Press that supported the Opposition before the general election.</P>
      <P>We were treated then to a cartoon showing a little boy standing in front of a blackboard on which was the headline: &ldquo;Do not cut a rod to beat yourself.&rdquo; An article underneath pointed out that in the event of a change in Government old age pensions and widows' pensions would be reduced by a considerable amount.  I am quite satisfied that those responsible for that foolish prophecy are gratified that it has not come true.  There is no doubt that this measure has been received very well by every section in the community as it will bring very necessary relief to those most deserving of it.</P>

      <P>I would like to add my small meed of praise to this Bill, which gives these additional benefits to the deserving people named.  In the country there is dissatisfaction in the fact that the contributory widows' pensions have not been increased accordingly.  It appears to those interested that it is another penalty being put on industrious persons who try to look after their wives and dependents. I am glad that the people who have not contributed are getting an increase, but I am sorry, and most people in the country feel likewise to-day, that the people who have been contributing over the years are not getting some recognition and an increase in their pensions also.  These people are in a bad plight and they find 24/- a week a very small amount of money.  We agree that when it is all added up it is a vast sum of money, <Col N="1832" /> perhaps more than this country can afford to give, but in the allocation of moneys I think Governments and responsible persons ought to give credit where people are trying to help themselves&mdash;and in this case that is not being done.  The contributory widows' pensions should be increased, even by a small amount, in recognition of the fact that they have helped by their own industry to provide for themselves. We are all grateful that these deserving people are getting increases in their allowances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OwenSkeffington" hpid="Dr. Sheehy Skeffington Dr. Sheehy Skeffington">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister mentioned that some Senators may criticise the measure on the grounds that it did not give enough, and I think that is the sentiment of many of us here.  I intend to speak mainly about the old age pension rates, and I want to establish some comparisons, but what I say does apply similarly and equally to the widows' pensions. I should like to feel that in this country, where we have had the right to govern our own affairs for over 30 years, in the social improvement that has gradually been brought about in certain spheres and that is still being aimed at by successive Governments, the first place is given to those who will be here least long to enjoy such improvements.  I refer to the aged. Therefore, I should like to see the aged, the old age pensioners, take precedence when it comes to finding money for increased pensions and allowances.</P>
      <P>I am not satisfied that the extra 2/6 on to the 21/6, bringing the total old age pension to 24/-, is sufficient.  I do not feel that to-day an old couple of pensioners&mdash;who have to be 70 before they qualify&mdash;can live adequately on 48/- a week at the present level of prices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That brings me to the question of the means test.  I notice that, though the amount of money being given to old age pensioners is to be raised, there is no suggested change in the basis of means test.  I suggest that when the rates were originally devised for this means test the sums involved meant considerably more than they mean now.  In those days, £52 or £104 a year meant in value of goods far more than <Col N="1833" /> they mean now, yet we are still applying the same kind of means test.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister, and perhaps he would have figures to reply, just how much it would cost the State were he to decide&mdash;if not now, at some future date&mdash;to abolish the means test in relation to old age pensions. The Minister is a representative in the inter-Party Government of the Labour Party.  I can remember Labour Party conferences year after year discussing resolutions calling on the Government to abolish the means test in relation to old age pensions, and that type of resolution always fell into the category of those being carried unanimously.  I am convinced that the Minister is sincerely desirous to see the day when that means test can be abolished, and I would put the question to him in a friendly fashion as to how near he anticipates that day to be.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, the old age pension at one time was 10/- a week.  In fact, I may be reminded by some Fianna Fáil Senators that there was a time when Cumann na nGaedheal slashed that old age pension from 10/- to 9/-. We look back, all of us here, in the same spirit I think, to the days when old age pensioners were getting 9/- or 10/- a week.  I think that to-day all of us would recognise that even in those days that was a wretched rate. I think all of us would recognise that it was not enough, and that it enabled people to live only in abject poverty. I submit that this wretched rate, as it was then, nevertheless to be equalled to-day in terms of goods, in terms of purchasing value, would have to be at the very least 25/- a week&mdash;and now we are being asked to raise the old age pension to a miserable 24/- a week. I would suggest that, looking back on those days now, none of us here could be satisfied that old age pensioners in those days were getting fair play at 9/- or 10/- a week.  I suggest that even were we to raise the old age pension now to the purchasing power equivalent of about 25/- a week, we still should be doing them no more justice to-day than we did then.  Therefore, I should like to see it raised above 25/-, which would be the mere minimum modern equivalent of the <Col N="1834" /> pre-war 10/-.  I find, however, that unfortunately this Bill sets out simply to raise the old age pension to 24/- per week.</P>
    <P>It is obvious&mdash;it is not a point I will dwell upon&mdash;that comparisons will be made between the old age pensioner living south of the border and the old age pensioner living north of the border, where the United Kingdom retirement pension rates apply.  I should like to have a look at the rates in the United Kingdom.  We here, to a couple of old age pensioners when they have reached the age of 70, give them the equivalent of 48/- per week for the two of them.  That represents £124 per year for both of them to live upon.  One thing can be said about that and it is that although it entails a means test it is nevertheless&mdash;and this is to the credit of our Government&mdash;a non-contributory pension.  In the United Kingdom, the main retirement pensions are given at the age of 65 to men and at the age of 60 to women, and they are contributory pensions.  They would amount to a sum per year of some £169 for the aged couple.  There is one provision which, among others, makes it difficult to establish an exact comparison, because while the old age pensioner in the United Kingdom gets his contributory retirement pension at 65, or her pension at 60, there is a provision which allows them to continue working without drawing the pension immediately&mdash;to continue contributing, and not to draw the pension&mdash;until, in fact, the man is 70 and the woman is 65.  In that case, they will draw a yearly total of £247.  It is obvious that a strict comparison is not either possible or wholly fair.  There are different situations there.  There is the fact that this is a contributory pension, and there is also the fact that taxable resources in Britain are greater than here.  Nevertheless, I think the disparity&mdash;which is a disparity, as I have mentioned, even between the Twenty-Six Counties and the Six Counties of this country&mdash;between £124 a year here and £247 a year in Britain is very great.</P>
    <P>I do not want, however, to stress overmuch the comparison with the United Kingdom, but I should like to <Col N="1835" /> take one or two other countries and mention as briefly as I can what it has been found possible to do in relation to old age pensions there.  The first country I should like to mention is Australia.  In Australia&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am afraid the Senator is travelling outside the scope of this particular Bill.  The Chair thinks it inadvisable that we should court discussion here on this Bill of the economic conditions of the whole wide world.  The Senator will try and observe that opinion from the Chair.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall endeavour to make my remarks as brief as possible.  However, I should be grateful if I were allowed to establish what I think could be done in this country.  With your permission, Sir, having mentioned the nearest country, which is not comparable for various reasons of economic structure, and so forth, I should like to mention one or two smaller countries, starting with Australia.  I can assure the Chair that I will be brief.  I will not make a long speech.  I should just like to be permitted to mention the fact that I think you could say that the Australian rate is rather comparable to the Irish rate for, although they pay the pension at 65 and 60, the sum is £175 for an aged couple, and those, of course, are Australian pounds.  There is also a means test, but it is a more generous one&mdash;and that is a point I should like to make here because it does not stop the pension unless there is an income of over £250 a year.  Again, of course, it may be said that Australia is not really comparable.  I should like to turn now to three of the smaller countries among whom I should like to see Ireland, free Ireland controlling its own destinies, taking its place in the world to-day.</P>

That is a legitimate question, and I think it is one that anybody in a debate might put either to me, or to the Minister, or which might legitimately be put by the Minister.  The Minister or the Government might say: &ldquo;It is all very well; we do not yield to anybody in our desire to increase the old age pensions, but where is the money to come from?&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That was the final point which I had intended to make in my speech which has come more quickly to its end under your direction.  I would suggest that it would be perfectly possible to raise the old age pensions&mdash;and although I refer almost exclusively to old age pensions I have in mind the others, widows' pensions and other pension rates&mdash;by means of reframing and reassessing the inauguration of structural changes in our taxation system. I think that it would be possible for the sums involved&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I should like to feel that in this Bill, which is a Social Welfare Bill, we were able to make more obvious our desire &mdash;I am speaking generally as a member of the Oireachtas&mdash;to treat the weak and the under-privileged in this country better, proportionately, than so far we have found it possible to do. I will conclude with the suggestion that if we want an example of civilised behaviour in this matter we would do well to turn our minds to the Scandinavian small countries of Northern Europe.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall endeavour to be very brief in order to facilitate the work of the Seanad.  I would like to say that I welcome this measure in that it affords some measure of relief to our most hard-pressed people.  I think that the swiftness with which the Minister has introduced this measure&mdash;he is a member of a comparatively young Government&mdash;indicates his enthusiasm and that it should not be taken as the mark or the measurement of what either he or the Government hopes to achieve in regard to social welfare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With some other Senators who have already spoken, I think it is regrettable that it has not yet been found possible to increase the pensions for contributory widows and orphans.  I appreciate that there is some difficulty in that since the principle there is not the same as in the case of non-contributory widows' pensions.  I imagine that a review of the benefits for the <Col N="1839" /> contributory widows' and orphans' pensions would also involve a review of the contributions, and that the Minister would need to give careful consideration to that aspect of the matter.  It might also be that the Minister would favour a more comprehensive social welfare system altogether.</P>
    <P>However, without going too deeply into that, I want to say that this measure is very welcome.  The increased benefits are very welcome, especially when they are taken, as they must be taken, in the light of the Budget which gives us subsidised butter and is keeping tea at a low price without any increase in taxation. I again welcome the measure and I hope the Minister will soon be back to us with even more comprehensive and improved benefits for all those people who are covered by the Social Welfare Bill that is before us to-day.</P>

      <P>I, like other Senators who have spoken, welcome the Bill. At the same time I must express&mdash;and I am sure that in doing so I am voicing the views of many in this House and outside of it&mdash;my very keen disappointment at the Bill before us which makes provision for an increase in old age pensions to the extent of 2/6 per week. There is no provision in it for the removal of the obnoxious means test, about which we heard so much in the past and about which so many promises were made, promises for its removal. While the sum set out in this Bill will be appreciated by the people concerned &mdash;old age pensioners, blind persons, widows and orphans&mdash;it hardly compensates them for the increases which they have to meet at the present time as regards the cost of various commodities. Therefore, their position will not be any better than it was this time 12 months.  Take the 2/6 increase that is being given, and then examine how it is going to be expended by the old age pensioners. Coal has risen by 12/6 a ton in the last few weeks.  The prices of potatoes, meat, vegetables, wheaten meal, cocoa, coffee, and a number of other commodities which I could enumerate, have all increased, regardless of the promises that were made to reduce <Col N="1840" /> these prices.  We are all anxious to help the people concerned in this Bill, but, when regard is had to the increases which have taken place in the price of so many commodities, their position will not be any better than it was 12 months ago.</P>
      <P>As a result of the Budget, the Government have an extra £3,000,000 to spend and they wisely considered that this particular section of the people was one that could benefit from it. What I am suggesting is that the benefits are not as real as they appear on paper when it comes to the question of the spending of this 2/6 by the old old age pensioners.  Senator Sheehy Skeffington referred to a very important matter, that is, the manner in which means are calculated.  Any widow with an income of £52 10s. per year will be entitled to only 22/6.  I think that the Minister should have raised the figure in the Schedule when he decided to increase the benefits.  I should also like to avail of this opportunity to make a special plea for a section of the people who I think are most deserving&mdash;old age pensioners living in urban areas.  They are certainly in a much more difficult position than those living in the country.  The Local Government Department has undertaken the provision of a certain type of house for persons in this group.  The rents are high, and the rates are increasing year by year.  Taking into consideration the fact that the old age pensioners will have only 24/6 provided under this Bill, they certainly will have difficulty in eking out an existence towards the end of their lifetime. I think the Minister should take this into consideration as early as possible, and improve conditions for that section, rather than have a general increase all round, if it is a question of using to the best advantage whatever moneys we have at our disposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another argument in favour of my proposal is that when the Book of Estimates was presented early in the year we saw a reduction of £10,000 in the amount for old age pensions.  We queried that reduction.  Some thought there was foreshadowed a possible tightening-up of the regulations in regard <Col N="1841" /> to the granting of pensions but we accepted the reason given by the Minister that it had been found, over the years, that the number of persons qualifying for old age pensions was on the decline and that, therefore, there was a saving of something like £10,000 last year.  I accept that that would help to explain the reduction in the amount which we are now providing but, if the Minister's explanation is correct, we should have more sympathy with these classes of people and we should do more to make their position better.</P>
    <P>Another very important question arises.  The public assistance authorities throughout the country are empowered to give additional allowances to supplement the old age pension in cases where it is deemed essential to do so.  I wonder will the granting of this additional 2/6 per week result in placing the persons who are already in receipt of, say, 5/-, 6/- or 10/- from the public assistance authorities, because of a reduction which may be brought about by the local authority, in a worse position than they are in to-day?  This is a matter about which, I think, the Minister should make a very definite statement.  Local authorities throughout the country have, I think, drawn the attention of the Minister for Finance to the discrepancies which have occurred up and down the country in the granting of disability pensions. Here, again, we can have the position of persons worsened if the local authority does not take a more generous view than many of them are taking at the present time.</P>
    <P>This is a very important Bill which provides for the granting of increases to old age pensioners, widows, orphans and blind persons.  I appeal to the Minister to consider including also increases for those persons who are entitled to the widows' and orphans' insurance on a contributory basis. I do not agree with Senator Murphy when he said that he understood the Minister would have difficulty in making these increases applicable to insured persons, because it would necessitate an increases in contributions. We have had increases already given to persons of this type without <Col N="1842" /> having to increase contributions.  That was done prior to 1948.  I can quite understand the Minister's difficulty, but I think if he were serious he would be anxious to go much further than he has gone to-day.  He has a very difficult time because on many occasions we have heard references being made by his colleagues to social services as being a medical chest from which you take a bottle to give to the patient&mdash; just a passing remedy which does not create any permanent improvement in the patient's condition.  That view has changed somewhat and I am sure that the Minister will utilise all his energies to bring about a complete change of heart amongst his colleagues, and thereby provide for those persons to whom we have referred even greater security, particularly the old age and blind pensioners, in the end of their days.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crosbie</NameTxt>
      <P>In welcoming this Bill and congratulating the Minister on the speed with which he has acted after the action of the Minister for Finance, might I say to our colleagues on the other side of the House that we regret that the increases are not greater than they are?  I was glad to hear Senator Kissane, when he was referring to his regret that these increases were not greater than they are, use the expression that he thought they would hardly be adequate to make up to the old age pensioners and the other pensioners involved for the way they had been treated in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was particularly glad when Senator Kissane accepted responsibility for the treatment of pensioners of all descriptions in this country over a period of 19 years.  If the increases provided in this Bill are not as adequate as we should like to see, might I point out. that that is due to the fact that there were two periods of spend-thrift Government by the friends of Senator Kissane and his colleagues&mdash;one period of 16 years followed by another period of three years&mdash;which left the national Exchequer in the position that we, in the year 1955, are able to help those people only to the extent provided in this Bill?  I should also point out to the Senators on the opposite side that we take an optimistic view of the future <Col N="1843" /> of the country and I have no doubt that this time next year we shall have the Minister back in this House with another Bill which will give those unfortunate people something additional.</P>

      <P>I wish to offer my meed of praise to the Minister and the Government for the introduction of this measure.  I would also like to say that I join with my colleagues in offering him our congratulations on the speed with which the measure was introduced so soon after the election had taken place.  I have only one note of criticism to offer on the Bill itself and that is on the point to which several other Senators have already alluded&mdash;the exclusion of the voluntary contributory widows' pension from any increase under this particular measure.  The point I would like to put to the Minister is that it seems to me that the exclusion of this category of very deserving people appears to be tantamount almost to putting a premium on improvidence. Furthermore, I would suggest that it is far from offering any encouragement to people, as I underStand the present Government is anxious to do, to provide for themselves the means of facing the contingencies and hazards of life from their own resources.  Finally, I would like also to suggest that it is time that the Government should consider the complete abolition of any means test before necessary assistance of this kind is made available to unfortunate people who need it most.</P>
      <P>Apart from that note of criticism I have nothing but praise to offer to the Minister and the Government for the introduction of the measure.  I am glad to hear Senators from the Government side of the House state that they hope it will be only the beginning of some type of future legislation of this kind that will go at least part of the way towards bringing our social services under this heading into line with the assistance given by all progressive Governments abroad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Having regard to the very much increased cost of living at the present time and the sharp increase <Col N="1844" /> which has taken place during the past year and particularly during the past. few months I think it is inevitable that a measure of this kind should be introduced so as to assist those in the lowest income group.  No one will suggest for one moment that 24/- constitutes an excessive income for any person who has no other means of subsistence. It is not a livelihood.  It is merely a means of prolonging the existence of such persons.  Personally, I have often felt that there should be a closer examination of this whole problem with a view to doing perhaps a little more for those who are absolutely and completely dependent upon the old age pension.  There are many people who fall into the classification of having no means but in the last resort if there were no old age pension somebody of their friends or relatives would come to their rescue and prevent them from dying of starvation.  Such people are not in quite the same category as those who have no immediate friends or relatives, who have to live in a house or room and pay rent for it, and who have to depend absolutely and completely upon this subvention from the State.  I would like to see some special investigation with a view to doing something more for such people.</P>
      <P>I am in complete agreement with all those who have spoken in regard to the inconvenience, expense and irritation involved in the means test, but I have never been able to accept completely the view that the means test should be completely abolished.  I have never been able to convince myself that a person with £5,000 or £10,000 per year of an income should be granted an old age pension.  I do not know why this complete abolition of the means test is so frequently advocated, but I would think that there should be a very drastic modification of the means test.  There is, as we know, a very large section of the community who must be classed as in the lower income group.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>At any rate, if we are to accept Senator Crosbie's promise that there will be a further Social Welfare Bill further increasing old age pensions and other pensions I hope that the suggestions I have made will be borne in mind and that some attempt will be made to eliminate all investigation in regard to people who are ordinary wage earners, people who have what is known as a health card and are, therefore, classed in the public assistance group.  I do not think that because such a person is working for his week's wages&mdash;it may be only £4 or £5 a week&mdash;that should be taken into consideration at all.  When such a person, holding a health card, reaches the age of 70 he should automatically qualify for the old age pension. He would qualify if he told an untruth and said he was not working, but I think he should not be compelled by law to tell that untruth.  The same should apply to people with a very small valuation.  There should be a complete wiping out of investigation in regard to those with small holdings. That would constitute a certain saving of money to the Department in regard to investigation, and that saving could be passed on to the old age pensioners generally.</P>
      <P>Senator Crosbie introduced a sort of acrimonious note into this very amiable discussion when he stated that the fact that it is only a small increase is due to our history over the past 19 years.  It is rather strange that he did not go back&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>That is a question I hope I am entitled to answer.

We were not in a position to provide it in 1952 but we did in 1952 and during the preceding year provide an increase of 4/- in all&mdash;an increase of 2/6 in 1951 and a further increase of 1/6 in 1952, making a total of 4/-, as against the 2/6 provided here.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamFearon" hpid="Professor Fearon Professor Fearon">
      <NameTxt>Professor Fearon</NameTxt>
      <P>One question has been running through my mind&mdash;why the half-crown?  According to some of us, it is not nearly enough, and, according to others of us, it is all right and we hope for better luck next time.  Old age is not a disease; it is inevitable; and if we escape microbes and motorcars we are all going to be old.  The expectation of life is steadily increasing. I have worked out the figures and I think we are paying these benefits to one in 30 of the population at present and I imagine that, in about five years' time, one in 29 point something will be receiving them.  For that reason, I was rather surprised to hear Senator Hawkins saying that the number was decreasing.  I think that the number of old people receiving these benefits is inevitably going to increase.  The number of blind people may decrease, but the number of old people, I think, is going to increase.  Consequently, in considering the extent of the welfare benefit, we have to consider something which is going to go on and on, and how are we to get a reasonable figure?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One way to approach it would be in terms of the cost of living and I suppose the most reasonable way would be to give a pensioner a bonus related to the change in the cost of living and then it could rise and fall; but I rather think the departmental difficulties involved in doing that would be very great.  The other way is to see what fraction of our national income could we divert to the support of our people, not all of whom are unfortunate but some of whom are.  These benefits are costing, I believe, £12,000,000 and the cost, I presume, is going to increase, <Col N="1848" /> and if we could get an idea of what would be a fair fraction and distribute that amongst these people we would not have the perpetual contentions that they are not being given enough and that these are small sums indeed. Of course, they are small sums, but we accept them as an indication of the pocket and the heart being in the right place.</P>
    <P>At the same time I should be relieved if the Minister would indicate whether there is any steadfast underlying policy with regard to this problem of old age pensions, blind pensions and so on.  As I see it, it means that every few years we shall have to give a little more of these wretched dribs and drabs, whereas if we had some policy relating the pension to the cost of living or if we decided that a certain fraction of our national income would be diverted in this way, with a rise in the national income the benefit for these people would increase.  Naturally, like all men of goodwill, I strongly support the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank the Seanad for their reception of this very short Bill.  As I said in another place, my only intention in this Bill was to come immediately to the rescue, so to speak, of old age pensioners, blind pensioners and widows and orphans at present in receipt on noncontributory pensions.  I should be the very first to say and to proclaim that, in my opinion, 24/- a week is certainly not sufficient for an old age pensioner to live on and I should like to describe this&mdash;and it is only intended to be&mdash;as an instalment to these people because they have lagged very far behind for the past 30, 40 or 50 years, ever since old age pensions were first introduced and I should like to assure the Seanad that, within my term as Minister for Social Welfare, this will not be the only increase that will be given to these very necessitous people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know whether some members of the Opposition Party were in earnest when they talked about an increase in the cost of living or whether they had lost their memories. They said that this would only compensate old age pensioners for the increase in the cost of living and I do not think it would be unfair of me to <Col N="1849" /> pose the question: Who is responsible for the abnormal increase in the cost of living since the last increase?  I want to give one or two short and simple facts.  In April, 1952, the cost-of-living index figure stood at 115; in August, 1952, the cost-of-living index figure stood at 122, due to the proposals embodied in the Budget of 1952. The present Opposition Party at that time tried to justify fully an increase of 1/6 per week to provide for an increase in the cost of living of seven points.</P>

      <P>It has risen from May of last year to the present time by two points.  I think this Government are taking care of the old age pensioners for the period during which they have been in office, but, apart from that, they are endeavouring to compensate them and others for the irreparable damage done to them in the 1952 Budget.  I do not want to say any more than that and I would not have made any reference at all to it, but for the fact that some members on my right hand side described this increase &mdash;though not in quite these words&mdash;as a niggardly increase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Mrs. Dowdall raised the question of increases for those in receipt of contributory pensions and I want to assure her and other members of the Seanad that these will not be forgotten.  It was not intended in this Bill to provide for them and for those in the insured classes, but I trust that I will be in a position in the future&mdash; in the near future, I hope&mdash;to provide for increases not alone for those in <Col N="1850" /> receipt of contributory widows' pensions but also those who are in receipt of sickness benefit, unemployment assistance and unemployment benefit. That is part of the insurance scheme and let me warn the Seanad that it will necessarily mean an increase in the contributions from the employees, from the employers and, of course, proportionately fom the State itself.</P>
    <P>Senator Sheehy Skeffington mentioned the means test and asked me to indicate the cost to the State for the abolition of the test.  The latest figure I have is £2,602,000.  I want to repeat that as far as I am concerned I am for the abolition.  I do not say I will be able to abolish it this year or next year or in the near future but I certainly agree with the principle and if it is within my power in the future, however long or short it may be, I certainly will give fullest consideration to it.</P>
    <P>I think Senator Sheehy Skeffington would be the first to agree that if the Government or I had £2,500,000 to dispose of, it would be better to devote it to increases in existing pensions rather than to the abolition of the means test.</P>

It was not my intention nor the Government's intention in this Bill to interfere with the means test but I certainly agree with those members here who said that it is due for revision. It is not long ago since it was revised. The Senator was under a misapprehension when he said that the scale now laid down has been in operation for a long time.  This scale for the means test was introduced in the Social Welfare Act, 1952.  I think there is a case for a revision in certain parts of it and it certainly will have my consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Fearon asked if the Government would consider what part of our national income we should devote to old age pensions or whether we would <Col N="1851" /> consider some other means of allotting a certain portion of the State's income to those necessitous people.  Senator Sheehy Skeffington also referred to Great Britain and spoke about the rates given there.  Having regard to our financial resources, I think we can compare reasonably well with Britain, when I mention that we are devoting 2.4 per cent. of our national income to old age and blind pensions while Britain is devoting about 2.5 per cent. As the Senator himself rightly admitted, their financial resources are such as to enable them to give substancially more than we can.</P>

No doubt between this and then the necessary machinery will be set up to grant these increases. Reference has been made to the means test.

      <P>Before we take up consideration of the amendments tabled to this Bill, I wish to say that I consider amendments Nos. 1 and 7 out of order and they may not be moved. These amendments deal with matters outside the scope of the Bill.  The Senators have been notified accordingly.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 4:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 16, between lines 30 and 31, to insert the following paragraph:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(c)  a chief engineering officer.</P>
      <P>I moved this amendment originally on the Committee Stage, as Senators will remember.  As the hour was getting late and I thought it might be fruitful to have some time for consideration, both for ourselves and for the Minister and his advisers, I withdrew the amendment acting on a hint dropped by Senator Professor Hayes that I might reintroduce it on the Report Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Senators will remember, the purpose of this amendment is to add to sub-section (10) of Section 17 the name of the county engineer to those already appearing in the sub-section as being capable of becoming approved officers within the meaning of the Act.  So far, there are three or perhaps one <Col N="1854" /> might say four categories of people who may become appoved officers&mdash;(a) the county secretary; (b) the town clerk, and (c) any officer approved of by the Minister.  The fourth possible one would be a health officer.  The point that seems to me to be not justified in this setting out of those who may become approved officers is that if the county manager wishes to make the county secretary an approved officer within the meaning of this section he can do so without the permission of the Minister whereas if he wants to make his chief engineering officer an approved officer under this Act and under this section he must go and ask the Minister.  Going and asking the Minister means referring the matter to the Department of Local Government. The Department of Local Government is like most Departments which have a lot of work to do.  I do not think it is any more dilatory than others and in some respects it is probably more expeditious.  Nevertheless, I think it would be fair to say that when one seeks for a metaphor to express speed of action or alacrity one does not normally find oneself saying that the action took place as swiftly as if it had been referred to the Department of Local Government.  That being the case, this apparatus, as it were, this necessity implied by the terms of the Act, as it is found at present, means that if a county manager in his wisdom wishes to delegate some of his functions to an extremely important technical officer, the chief county engineering officer, he has not the power under this Act to do so unless he refers the whole matter back to the Department of Local Government.  It was for that reason, among others, that it seemed to me that the hope was legitimate that the Minister might consider accepting this amendment and allowing the name of the chief engineering officer to stand side by side with that of the clerical officers, the town clerk and the county secretary.</P>
    <P>There is another point, however, and the Minister made it in reply to me on the Committee Stage.  He said he did not want to give any arbitrary ruling as between the professions: he did not want any trouble.  He did not want to <Col N="1855" /> mention one profession and perhaps be told by a representative of another profession that that other profession had been forgotten.  He mentioned many others&mdash;the county solicitor and I think he also mentioned the county architect.  Very frequently, the county architect is also, I understand, the chief engineering officer.  However, I would suggest that there is a difference between the activity and the work of the chief engineering officer, in practice, and the work in general of such an officer as the county solicitor.  The difference is that the county solicitor is usually acting in a purely advisory capacity, whereas the chief engineering officer combines the advisory capacity with the necessity of carrying out an executive function implementing works on the site.  That seems to me to be quite an important distinction. It also seems to me to warrant ensuring that the chief engineering officer&mdash; this highly important technical officer &mdash;shall have the possibility of having certain functions delegated to him by the county manager when the county manager sees fit&mdash;I would remind Senators that this is a permissive not a mandatory clause&mdash;without having to go through all the rigmarole of referring the whole question back to the Minister and to the Department.</P>
    <P>I understand&mdash;and I think representations in that regard have been made both to the Minister and to his predecessors&mdash;that it would be considered by the engineers themselves to be extremely valuable if the chief engineering officer were to have access to the various committees not merely as an observer&mdash;not merely as an adviser and an assessor to be consulted if necessary&mdash;but with the right to intervene and speak and sponsor his own work before the committee.  In a letter which was sent to the Minister by the County Surveyors' Association summing up various earlier representations that had been made to the Department since March, 1954, it is stated that:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;in the interests of the council and their chief engineering officer, my association&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1856" />&mdash;that is, the County Surveyors' Association&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;felt that both the administration and performance of the duties of county engineering could be considerably improved by affording control of this very important function to the chief technical officer.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The letter later continues:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The council should further be directly instructed on any technical matters by the chief officer so that the council would understand what they were doing, and the chief technical officer would be satisfied that they were fully aware of the matters to which they were voting moneys.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That seems fundamental to me.  It is essential that the county council should know exactly what is intended by the chief engineer, and the best way of their knowing that is for them to hear the chief engineer himself.  I am not suggesting at all any ill-intention on the part of any clerical officer who might have the duty of interpreting the wishes, desires and plans of the chief engineering officer to a committee or to the council.  I am simply suggesting that, in practice, more clarity and efficiency will be ensured if the officer is allowed, as of right, to be there and to speak for himself.</P>
    <P>It is not my intention to say very much more at this juncture, but I would ask the Minister to reconsider the matter&mdash;to ask himself whether his reluctance to add the name, very simply to this list, of the chief engineering officer, is entirely justified, in view of the fact that the whole section is permissive and not mandatory, and in view of the fact that the chief engineering officer will not, in fact, have power delegated to him unless the county manager so desires.</P>
    <P>Why not, therefore, add the name of the chief engineering officer to those of the county secretary and the town clerk?  What positive advantage is there to be gained in thus insisting that, in his case, the whole matter in every instance of a proposal for delegating such power will have to go back to the Department and the Minister?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry that the very able case presented by Senator Sheehy Skeffington has not completely impressed me as a member of a local authority.  I can see why the Senator insists on this particular amendment so strongly, but I cannot see what advantage it would be to the county engineer to have managerial functions delegated to him, if the manager thought fit to do so.  I am expressing this view as one with experience as a member of a local authority.  As we all know, the county engineer invariably attends every meeting of the county council. He is consulted on every matter and usually expresses his opinion fairly and freely on every matter connected with his Department.  It, therefore, seems to me that he would not gain anything by having managerial functions conferred on him.</P>
      <P>I can see some good reason for confining this delegation to particular types of persons, to the secretary of the county council and to the town clerk of an urban authority, by reason of the fact that they perform functions somewhat similar to those of the manager inasmuch as they are executive officers in their own way to an elected body.  Therefore, they are in a position, possibly, to discharge a wide range of functions.  They are not far removed from each other as against the very specialist functions of the county engineer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For these reasons I wish to say that, while I sympathise with the views put forward by Senator Sheehy Skeffington, I do not entirely agree with him, although I must say that I could not see any very great objection to conferring this power on the county engineer.  On the other hand, I do not see any reason for this since the county engineer has ample scope at the present time to put forward his recommendations directly, and in the strongest possible way, to the local authority for which he acts.  As I have said, he not only attends the county council meetings as adviser to the manager, but I think that in actual practice he is also adviser to the county council and is freely and directly consulted on all matters that <Col N="1858" /> affect his particular branch of the administration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Minister for Local Government (Mr. P. O'Donnell) Patrick O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. P. O'Donnell)</NameTxt>
      <P>I sympathise a lot with the motives which have inspired the Senator to move this amendment, but I think that he is really under a misapprehension as to the powers which will be conferred by the section as it stands.  Now, under the section as it stands, only the executive functions of the manager may be delegated and not reserved functions. Executive functions are confined by law to the doing by signed order of anything which a council had previously to do by resolution.  The object of the section is to enable the manager to be relieved of routine duties so that he can devote more time to the more important and onerous duties of his office.  The county secretary and the town clerk are the officers who normally carry out these duties.  It must not be forgotten that the manager cannot automatically delegate functions to these officers.</P>
      <P>The Senator, in his opening remarks, said that the county secretary may become an approved officer without the sanction of the Minister as regards the functions to be performed by him, and he went further and said that that was not so with regard to the county engineer.  I presume he was referring to sub-section (3) of the section.  What the Senator said is not so.  The county manager cannot delegate any executive function even to the county secretary or the town clerk without the prior sanction of the Minister.  It must be obtained, and if he wishes to delegate functions to the county engineer he may do so, provided he obtains the sanction of the Minister.</P>
      <P>The section will not affect in any way the right of the county engineer to have access to the council or to explain to it any technical point that he wishes.  He still will have that right, and if certain engineering functions should be delegated by the county manager, he has the power to do so with the sanction of the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Senator referred to implementing works on the site in the case of a contract.  That is not an executive function, and that power could not be <Col N="1859" /> delegated.  I think that the Senator's amendment is based on a misapprehension of the functions which the Minister will approve of the manager delegating.  He could not possibly approve of a function which is not an executive function.</P>
    <P>The section, as it stands, will not place the county engineer or any other technical officer in an embarrassing position.  I would like to assure the Senator and the House that the original purpose of the section when I inserted it in the Bill was this: I found that county managers were spending a considerable period of their time signing what I may call minor and routine orders, such, for example, as the temporary employment, in some cases, of a charwoman.  These routine minor orders required the signature of the manager to execute them.  I want to delegate those powers to some minor official, such as a town clerk or a county secretary, so that the county manager may have much more time to perform his major executive functions. I think it would be ridiculous to ask that the county engineer should have such minor powers as those delegated to him.  I am not opposed to the county manager delegating certain engineering functions, provided they are executive, to the county engineer. I have provided for that in the section. The manager may, with the approval of the Minister, delegate such functions as are performable by him to an approved officer, and he is defined as the county secretary, or the town clerk, and in the case of a health function an officer approved by the Minister for Health.</P>
    <P>I am not thinking of the county medical officer of health.  It may be a home assistance officer.  Even though the matter is entirely outside of my jurisdiction, I cannot imagine the county manager, with the approval of the Minister for Health, delegating certain powers to the county medical officer of health because the intention in the section is merely to cover minor powers.  That being so, I can imagine my delegating them to home assistance officers or some such other minor official of the local authority.  As I said at the outset, I am not trying to <Col N="1860" /> belittle, in any way, the status of county engineers or other such executive officers, legal officers or medical officers.  I am merely trying to take this onerous burden from county managers, the burden of minor executive functions, and hand them over to town clerks.  I appreciate very much what the Senator has said, but I think it would be unfair to specially write into the section county engineers and coupled with that, officers approved by the Minister.  I would ask the House to accept that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like, first of all, before coming to what the Minister has said, to say something about what Senator Cogan has said. He asked what advantage would it be &mdash;he said he did not quite see the point &mdash;to the chief county engineer to be included in this list of potential &ldquo;approved officers.&rdquo;  He said that the engineer already appears before the county council and before its committees. But I suggest, and I think this is one of the main points, that for a technical officer merely to appear before a committee, and to have the right to be questioned, is not enough. I have had experience, as many here have, of being on committees where technical advisers were present without the right to speak unless they were questioned.  Sometimes it becomes possible for a member of such committees to realise that the technical officer would welcome a question in order to express his opinion.  This seems to me to place the technical officer at a disadvantage: if he is not given the right to be there as sponsoring a particular measure, as being, in fact, in control.</P>
      <P>Senator Cogan suggested that these engineers would gain nothing by having the possibility of becoming &ldquo;approved officers&rdquo;, and of having their names included.  I beg your leave, Sir, to quote again from this letter sent by the County Surveyors' Association to the Minister.  The secretary states, among other things:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;My association further felt that independence in control of all direct labour works would ensure further efficiency and economy to the council. These points were set out clearly in <Col N="1861" /> a letter addressed to your Department on the 27th March, 1954, when the previous Government were in power.  On the 8th September, 1954, a reminder was sent to the new Taoiseach whose private secretary stated that our letter and the previous memo had been referred to the Minister for Local Government for attention.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Finally, further down, the letter reads:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The association then instructed me to draft an amendment to the Bill, which was sent to you on the 28th April last.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The last point is:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I am to state that the association are unanimously in favour of Dr. Sheehy Skeffington's amendment as it provides some measure of statutory instrument by which control may be delegated to the county engineer in his Department, notwithstanding the restrictive form of the present proposal.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I feel that turns on what Senator Cogan says.  He said that he does not see any advantage accruing to the engineer by the amendment.  It appears <Col N="1862" /> that the engineers are not in agreement with him on that point.</P>
    <P>The Minister makes the point that only certain functions can be delegated under the section.  I think we are all aware of that, but it would be better than nothing.  When I mentioned the implementation of works on the site, I was thinking of the responsibility of this technical officer which is very great, and upon which depends the expenditure of a large amount of money. The Minister has said that he has no desire, in any way, to lower his status. I suggest he has an easy way here of raising the status and the prestige of the technical officer by simply putting him in line with, not ahead of or above, the clerical officers, the administrative officers, the office workers, the town clerk, and the county secretary.  Since this whole section is simply permissive, as I said before, it seems to me it would be a laudable example of the removal of red tape, if the Minister were to include the chief engineering officer side by side with the town clerk and the county secretary in this section.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 5:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 17, between lines 51 and 52, to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Each council of a county and each corporation of a county borough shall appoint from amongst its members a committee to be known as the scholarships committee and sole responsibility is hereby assigned to such committee for carrying out all the functions conferred on the local authority by the Local Authorities (Education Scholarships) Act, 1944.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1863" /> In moving the amendment I shall be as brief as possible.  I should like to assure the Minister and the Seanad that the object at the root of this amendment is to give more time to county councils to carry on the business for which they are elected.  As Senators know, county councils are a cross section of the country.  The majority on the councils, in fact all the members, are fully competent to deal with matters connected with roads and institutions, but there are certain matters such as education, where a select few take more than an ordinary interest in that particular service.  It is with a view to having the work of such a body not impeded by having their reports submitted for an inquest to a subsequent meeting of the county council that I am proposing this amendment.  By adopting it, county councils would have more time to carry on their work, and the beneficial schemes which have certainly made it possible for many a poor man's child to enjoy a secondary and university education would be helped on.</P>
    <P>I should like to state that the original idea of providing what was considered in County Mayo as a stepping stone from the national school to the university was the formation of a scholarships committee.  That was done by what was referred to as the Sinn Féin county council in 1918 when four county councillors, four teachers, and four or five managers constituted a scholarships committee.  This provided a scheme of scholarships which, after much amendment by what I refer to as a system of trial and error, was eventually accepted as the foundation of the scholarship scheme for every county in the Republic.</P>
    <P>This scholarships committee meets only once or twice a year, goes into its work very carefully, and its report is submitted to a subsequent meeting of the county council.  It has happened from time to time that a county council has fundamentally altered that scheme, and held up its operation because the suggested alteration had to be submitted to the Minister for sanction.  If this amendment is accepted I believe that it will prevent such an occurrence happening in the <Col N="1864" /> future and will make for a better administration of the scholarships scheme.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamStanford" hpid="Professor Stanford Professor Stanford">

      <P>Teachers in the universities are naturally interested in an amendment of this kind.  I would like to support it for two reasons&mdash;first, on its own merits and, secondly, because I hope it may lead to what I consider would be a desirable improvement in the relations between the county councils and the universities. Senators are no doubt aware that there are a good many of the local authorities which do not sanction scholarships to Trinity College, Dublin. There are fewer of these, I think, than say, ten years ago.  There seems to be a general tendency in all local authorities to move towards allowing their scholarships to go to Trinity College, but there are still a good many who do not allow any scholars from their areas to receive the local scholarships to Trinity College.  There is an ironical aspect&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Here we have a precise reference to the setting up of a committee to deal with scholarships from the local authorities. I submit that my remarks are certainly relevant.  I do not think anyone could possibly rule that they are irrelevant. It seems to me to be a matter of expediency, that there is some fear that it may raise a controversial debate.  I do not think we should be over-cautious in a matter of that kind.

I am the last person to abuse the privileges of this House.  I have always tried to defend them.  If you rule that I am out of order, I will certainly accept it.  I am simply, if you like, apologising for the point I am raising.  It did seem to be an admirable and clear opportunity for raising a matter quite contingent to the proposal.

The point I made, supporting you, Sir, was that if the question which Senator Stanford wanted to raise was raised, it was a very wide question and not that it was a very controversial question&mdash;a question far wider than the one which Senator Ruane purports to raise in putting down the amendment.

      <P>On a point of order, may I say that I have noticed in the debate this afternoon, and in some recent debates, a tendency in this House to imply that we must get through the business as fast as possible? There has been a good deal of criticism of Seanad Eireann in the public Press and elsewhere and it will not help the prestige of this House if the impression is given that, if some wide-reaching debate is liable to develop, it must be stopped at all costs.

      <P>As Leader of the House, may I be allowed to say that I have never made a point of order here simply to prevent wide debates being started?  A House of Parliament must obey certain rules of order.  They are based on common sense and not solely upon a desire to do the business in the quickest possible time.  Senator Stanford knows himself that he can raise almost any matter by way of motion, but the idea that a word in an amendment should suggest to you that you can have a wide debate is certainly not in accordance with common sense. Senator Stanford is not being ruled out on any technical ground; he is being ruled out simply because the amendment on the paper does not, of itself, allow a debate on the subject he wants to debate, a subject which nobody objects to debating at the appropriate time.</P>

      <P>First of all, this amendment is absolutely unnecessary. Under Section 58 of the Local Government Act of 1925, any county council can, with the sanction of the Minister, delegate its functions to a committee. There is nothing to prevent any county council, which wishes to, setting up such a committee as has been suggested, subject to the sanction of the Minister, which in all cases is readily given I understand.  It has been the practice in the case of one county council&mdash;Laois County Council&mdash;to delegate their functions under the Irish Universities Act of 1908 which deals with university scholarships and under the Local Authorities (Education) (Scholarships) Act, 1944, to a scholarships committee.  These two Acts have been delegated by Laois County Council to a committee, with the sanction of the Minister, and Mayo County Council or any other county council may also do so, if they wish.  I do not see, however, why we should compel them to delegate their powers to a committee.  We will leave it to the discretion of the local authority itself, and if a county council wishes to appoint a committee, it may do so under this Act of 1925.  I am sure the Senator will agree that we should not compel any local authority to do something they do not want to do.  Full powers are there to set up such a committee as Senator Stanford, Senator Sheehy Skeffington and the mover of this amendment suggested.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 6:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 17, between lines 51 and 52, to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>The powers, duties and functions conferred on local authorities under the following Acts and Orders are hereby vested in the case of each county in the county committee of agriculture who shall in future be solely responsible for the carrying out of such powers, duties and functions:&mdash;Diseases of Animals Acts, Seeds and Fertilisers Supply Acts, Wild Birds Protection Act, 1930; Sheep Dipping Order, 1948; Control of Dogs Orders.</P>
      <P>These Acts and Orders were legislative Orders sent on to county councils before agricultural committees were set up.  Now that you have or will have agricultural committees functioning as subsidiary bodies of the county councils, I hold that those committees are the proper committees to deal with these Orders and I am putting forward this amendment to provide for that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support this amendment.  Everything possible should be done to enlarge and extend the powers of the county committees of agriculture.  At the present time an attempt is being made to put them under a cloud.  Under the guise of a so-called parish plan, an attempt is being made to take the agricultural instructors from under those committees and put them under the direct control of the Department of Agriculture. In view of that attempt, something should be done to give recognition to these important bodies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In a purely agricultural country, it is important that there should be in every county a democratically constituted body with important executive and administrative functions in relation to agriculture.  These committees are democratically constituted. They are appointed by the council <Col N="1870" /> immediately after election and they include in most cases a large proportion of the members of the council or additional members selected by such a newly-appointed county council, that has been elected by the people of the county.  Therefore, they are sufficiently representative to be recognised as capable of discharging important agricultural functions.</P>
    <P>This amendment seeks to give these committees some additional powers in matters with which they are specially qualified to deal.  Most counties&mdash;there are exceptions, of course&mdash;try to ensure that members of the county committees are either farmers or farm workers, or people closely associated with agriculture. There is strong criticism if a council departs from that rule.  Therefore, as these committees are composed of agriculturists in the true sense of the word, these particular Acts should be under their administration.</P>
    <P>In regard to the Diseases of Animals Acts, these diseases are dealt with very extensively by the county committees and their officials.  In regard to the Seeds and Fertilisers Supply Acts, it would be very useful if the county agricultural instructors could have a say in their administration.  We are now approaching a time when those instructors will have only a small compact area to administer.  They will be in close touch with the farmers individually and personally, they will know their economic circumstances and their needs in seeds and fertiliser. and they will be able to make recommendations accordingly.  Therefore, the county committee would be the proper body to deal with the administration of those particular Acts.</P>
    <P>In regard to sheep dipping, it is directly a matter that concerns these county committees.  Particularly in a sheep raising county, the committee deals with all matters pertaining to that industry.  In the same way, most committees have passed resolutions dealing with the control of dogs at night where they are destructive to the sheep.  That committee is the proper body to deal with that matter and it should not be referred to the county council.</P>
    <P>As far as the Wild Birds Protection <Col N="1871" /> Act is concerned, I suppose the committee would be qualified to deal with it also, although I would say that there are many committees and many farmers who would like to see a Wild Birds Extermination Act to cover the really destructive type.  I suppose even in agricultural districts it is necessary to protect certain types of wild birds.</P>
    <P>All these matters are relevant to the ordinary business of a county committee and I think it would be a useful thing to transfer these functions to them, particularly with a view to adding to the prestige of those committees, which are being put under a cloud to some extent at present, as I have said, by an attempt to take away from them their present agricultural instructors and take away certain functions which they already have.  Therefore, I would ask the Minister to accept this amendment.</P>

      <P>I have a considerable amount of sympathy with the mover of this amendment.  With great respect, I cannot see how, under a County Management Bill, we can transfer the functions of the Attorney-General to prosecute under the Wild Birds Protection Act.  With regard, however, to the other Acts which are mentioned in the amendment and <Col N="1872" /> which are administered by local authorities, there is no necessity for the amending Acts.  As I said on the last amendment, any local authority which so wishes may delegate its functions to a committee&mdash;an agricultural committee if you wish to call them that.</P>
      <P>Under Section 58 of the Local Government Act of 1925, they have full powers to delegate their functions under these particular Acts to any committee they wish under the section. Again, if they wish, there is power under Section 60 of the Local Government Act of 1955, which we passed last month&mdash;that is, in so far as Acts which are administered by local authorities are concerned.</P>
      <P>I do not think it is right that we should compel local authorities to delegate their powers to committees.  However, any local authorities who so wish may avail themselves of the sections of the Local Government Act, 1925, and the Local Government Act, 1955, to delegate their functions to a committee&mdash;with the exception of the Wild Birds Protection Act, 1930, which is administered by the Department of Justice through the Attorney-General. I am afraid that, no matter how much we desire it here, we cannot accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>I think that one of the most interesting things that have been explained to us here is the power to delegate to the various local authorities many of the functions which we understood in the past were the functions of the county managers and in many cases were the functions of the county councils which they were not able to delegate to subsidiary bodies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An amendment in my name appeared on the Order Paper to-day.  I understood that, in those cases, the Minister <Col N="1873" /> could delegate many of the functions which are ordinarily performed by the county manager to the town clerk of a borough council.  At this point I should like to ask the Minister if he would make an experiment by seeing to it that a great deal of these powers are delegated.  He always has the safeguard that, if they are in any way abused, he can revoke their delegation. I believe that, where competent town clerks are operating with borough councils, it would be a development, and a pilot development, in local affairs.  I would like to recommend it to the Minister and the finance committees.</P>

      <P>With regard to what Senator Burke has said, under this Bill we are giving the county manager power to delegate functions.  I sincerely hope he will avail of that power to delegate to town clerks some of the executive functions which he now performs himself.</P>
      <P>I hope this will not be the last Bill amending county management.  I hope that, as the years go by, we may possibly amend the County Management Acts.  If we find this power of delegation working out sufficiently well, it may be possible at some future date&mdash; having the benefit of this experiment&mdash; to introduce amending legislation to meet the suggestion of Senator Burke and have powers given to the town clerks and other such dignitaries which they have not got at the moment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>This motion has been <Col N="1874" /> so long on our agenda that I must apologise if the resumption of the debate on it has come as somewhat of a surprise to me.  When I moved the adjournment of the debate on the 11th May last, I had been dealing with that part of the motion which refers to the enforcement of the present traffic regulations.  I had pointed out to the Seanad (a) that there seems to be an ignorance of the law at present in regard to traffic regulations and (b) that there seems to be rather a looseness in the enforcement of the regulations as they stand at present.  I pointed out that we had expected an improvement in the enforcement of the regulations by reason of the recruitment of new Gardaí.  I referred to the introduction of the &ldquo;courtesy cops&rdquo;, as they were called, and to the putting of the Gardaí in high speed motor cars. Some of my friends have pointed out that these high speed motor cars of the Gardaí seem now to be rather the most dangerous type of vehicle to meet on the road.  It might be no harm if, sometimes, the courtesy cops, who are very seldom seen, paid attention to their colleagues in the big black cars. However, my point was that the recruitment of additional members to the Garda Síochána and the putting of the people concerned on wheels has not meant any improvement in the enforcement of the regulations.  I compared the position as it exists in Dublin with the position in Belfast and I showed that the comparison was not in our favour.</P>
      <P>As we all know, the principal transgressors are the cyclists, secondly the lorries which are not properly maintained and thirdly, to a certain extent &mdash;and they are probably the most hated people&mdash;the drunken drivers.  There is the additional factor&mdash;particularly in rural areas&mdash;that one of the greatest dangers on the roads are animals which are allowed by their owners to stray. They avail of what is called &ldquo;the long acre&rdquo; and in spite of the apparent prosperity of agriculture some of our people still will not forgo the advantage of &ldquo;the long acre&rdquo; and, accordingly, animals are allowed to stray with very grave danger to the users of the roads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1875" /> The second part of the motion calls for amendment of the law.  It calls for a driving test.  I must declare myself in favour of such a driving test.  At the moment, we have the position that anybody can purchase a licence and, by doing so, is entitled under the law to drive a car.  We usually refer to physical defects.  We say that, even if a man has physical defects, he can get a driving licence.  Even people who have not physical defects are also incapable of driving a vehicle with safety either to themselves or other road users.  In my opinion, and in the opinion of a lot of people, good driving is a craft which has to be acquired, and some people can never acquire it. That is the position&mdash;they never seem to be able to learn.  It would seem to me to be sensible that people, before they are allowed to go out on the public highway using a dangerous weapon, should have to satisfy the competent authorities that they are able to control that dangerous weapon and so will not be a danger either to other road users or themselves.</P>
    <P>In my opinion, one of the reasons for the higher standard in Britain is that one must pass a driving test before one is allowed out on the road.  Not only must one know how to drive properly but, more important still, one must know the rules of the road.  That is to say, one must be able to drive with safety and know when one has to give way to traffic as well as what one is supposed to do when approaching major road junctions.  Here we never learn the rules of the road.  The Minister, when he intervened in this debate, told us about the traffic regulations and said that the Department had issued a booklet.  We here in the Seanad, and I am sure we are no different from the bulk of other road users, knew nothing about that.  We have ideas of our own as to when one is supposed to give way to another driver.  It is something which we acquire by hearsay and probably by reading of reports of prosecutions in the newspapers.  Unfortunately, we have no knowledge of the rules of the road, and that is one of the reasons why I think a driving test should be enforced.  It would ensure that not <Col N="1876" /> only would we have to satisfy the competent authorities that we could drive a car properly, but that we knew the rules of the road and could drive with some degree of safety.</P>
    <P>I know that the objection to the introduction of a driving test would be the cost.  I would like to draw the attention of Senators to the cost of the present position in another direction altogether.  I should like to refer to the fact that, according to the statistics published in the <i>Irish Trade Journal,</i> and in the <i>Statistical Bulletin</i> for March, 1955, there were some 8,332 accidents in 1954, an increase of 757 over the previous year.  Those accidents resulted in the cost of 267 killed and 4,769 injured, a total of some 5,000 persons between killed and injured. These figures represent an increase of some 300 over 1953, while the increase in 1953, as compared with 1952, was another 300, so that we have a mounting cost, not on the financial side, but in life and in limb to persons on our roads.  When people argue against the introduction of the cost of a driving test, they should bear in mind what the cost is in the number of people killed and injured as represented by the figures which I have given.  We find that the cause of accidents is divided up.  Some 45 per cent. of the cause of accidents was attributed to drivers.  I was somewhat surprised to find that the percentage was as low as 45 per cent.</P>
    <P>I referred on the last occasion to the danger of pedal cyclists.  I find that my information is confirmed in that the cause of accidents, rated at 19.5 per cent., is attributable to pedal cyclists. We find that children under 14 years of age account for 13.5 per cent. and other children over 14 years for 10.4 per cent., and the surprisingly high figure of 4.8 per cent., due to defects in vehicles.  That figure, I think, underlines what I said previously when I referred to the fact that there were so many heavy lorries careering along the roads of the country which were obviously mechanically unfit to be on the road at all.</P>
    <P>The motion also calls for the imposition of speed limits.  I must confess that I have some mixed feelings in <Col N="1877" /> regard to speed limits.  I think that a speed limit is necessary and desirable in built-up areas.  I feel, however, that where we do take action in regard to enforcing a speed limit we tend to go too far.  We look for a speed limit which is obviously too low and it only encourages people to break it.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the speed limit fixed in some cases would be more appropriate to pedestrians or cyclists than to the modern car.  It is quite ridiculous to say that a speed limit of 20 or 25 miles is a proper speed limit at the present time if you have a competent driver and a properly maintained vehicle.  It is ridiculous, as I say, and will only be broken.  However that does not counteract the general argument in favour of a speed limit as such through built-up areas.  The law should be amended so as to provide that a speed limit can be enforced in those built-up areas.  It would in my opinion help to reduce the terrible toll on the roads, particularly the deaths and injuries caused to children under 14 years of age, who, as we saw, have 13.5 per cent. of the accidents attributable to them.</P>
    <P>The third call for further legislation is that dealing with major and minor roads.  I do not think that any Senator would quarrel with that particular part of the motion.  There have been indications in Dublin lately that the authorities are waking up to the desirability of marking clearly some junctions and indicating that you are approaching a major road.  They have only done so in some places and there are quite a few important junctions taking a lot of traffic where there is no indication whatever as to which is the major and which is the minor road.  Naturally then it is the case of an argument at the junction, to drive ahead and hope that the other fellow is not going to do so, and the strongest usually gets away with it.  The weaker gives way&mdash;either his nerves or his car give way.</P>
    <P>In talking about these major junctions, I think the condition should be enforced that people approaching a major road should stop and should not be allowed to take chances as they are at the present time.  Too often it seems to be thought proper and quite a <Col N="1878" /> reasonable thing to slow down for the junction and come around the corner prepared to jam on your brakes if danger threatens.  That is quite wrong and the Gardaí should strictly enforce the regulation that cars approaching a major junction should definitely stop before going on to the major road.</P>
    <P>That is all I wish to say on this motion.  May I again apologise for being taken rather unawares with the resumed debate?  I trust that Senators have not been too bored by my rather rambling speech.</P>

      <P>I, too, like Senator Murphy, am glad to see this motion coming to the surface again.  I was beginning to feel that the pilots or drivers of the motion were guilty of rather slow driving; and the motion itself was beginning to look as if it might constitute a sort of traffic block. I am glad, therefore, that it has come up again for discussion and I regard it as a valuable motion.  I should like to make some remarks, I hope at not too great length.  There was some talk on the last occasion when we mentioned this motion&mdash;some months ago now, I think&mdash;of high-powered cars, and of small cars, fast cars and slow cars.  I stand here as a representative of the not negligible majority, those who are cyclists rather than drivers of big or little cars on the road.  I can say, too, that I have had experience of cycling here, and of rather more exciting and adventurous cycling in the traffic of the City of Paris.  In France the traffic, particularly in the big cities, tends to run at a tempo which rather frightens us when we go there first, but this is due I think to the fact that they have certain organisational advantages which might be copied here, as was mentioned by Senator Hayes and one or two others earlier on.  I propose to mention those in a moment or two.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While speaking, nevertheless, of cyclists, and in a sense on behalf of cyclists, I am bound to recognise that in this city of ours there are many thousand careless, negligent and indeed grossly ignorant users of the pedal cycle.  Many of them cause accidents both to themselves and to others.  I do think <Col N="1879" /> that the major proportion of those accidents derives rather from ignorance than anything else.  I feel that perhaps if they are not educated in the rules of the road some of the blame for that might attach to the authorities in charge.</P>
    <P>One must say, nevertheless, of car users that while the big majority behave well on the roads there is a small minority&mdash;I should place it at something like 3 or 4 per cent.&mdash;of car users of the roads who consider that the size of their car is sufficient in itself to give them priority over any other user of the road.  That is an attitude of mind.  It is a psychological thing which is increasingly to be feared and consequently increasingly to be deplored.</P>
    <P>I saw figures quoted to-day that by 1958 we may hope to have on the roads of Ireland something like 180,000 cars. That is a frightening prospect, in view of the fact that our roads are not in fact wide enough or sufficiently well organised to carry this quantity of traffic, and the sooner we set about implementing the suggestions indicated by this motion the better.</P>
    <P>There is a regular feature in the popular motoring column of the <i>Irish Times</i> which I think most of us read with gratification.  That is the last paragraph which attributes a &ldquo;black mark&rdquo; to a nameless road user arising out of an incident which has happened in Dublin or elsewhere.  We read it, of course, hopefully, in the hope that we may recognise the registration numbers of some of our friends, or better still, of some of our enemies.  I think myself that the focussing of public opinion in that way upon bad manners on the road is a useful thing, and might quite well be copied in a more general way.</P>
    <P>The question of road tests is mentioned in the motion.  It is quite obvious that the application and inauguration of road tests for drivers is long overdue in this country.  We must have them, and we must have them quickly.  The question of cost arises.  I do not think we should hesitate to say to people who want the privilege of getting a certificate that <Col N="1880" /> they are able to drive that they should be prepared to pay a reasonable proportion at least of the cost of organising such tests.  It is obvious that in the beginning there will be considerably more numbers applying for these tests than at a later stage when it becomes a routine matter. That is all the more reason for tackling it quickly.</P>
    <P>I should also favour in relation to this problem the inauguration of very simple public propaganda by the traffic authorities for the teaching of the simple rules of the road.  I believe that the Department of Health has set a headline in that way, and has succeeded in putting over to the public elementary rules of health which some people knew, which others thought they knew, by means of vivid posters and simple propaganda.  I believe that sort of thing done by the Civic Guards, for instance, through the medium of the Press and by posters, could be extremely useful for educating people and reducing the ignorance upon which many instances of the misuse of the roads depend.</P>
    <P>There is another point in this&mdash;our duty in the international field.  Anybody can walk into an office here, as Senator Murphy has pointed out, and buy a driving licence.  The same person can go around to the A.A. offices and for the expenditure of another £1 or £2 buy an international driving licence giving the Irish driver the right to drive a car abroad in many countries where the most stringent tests are applied to the natives of those countries&mdash;I am thinking particularly of France.  We are failing in our duty to the other countries of Europe by allowing people who may know little or nothing about driving to obtain in that way an international driving licence.  It is necessary, therefore, for those various reasons, to improve the organisation and the application of the rules, and the understanding of those rules at present obtaining.  Much has been done, particularly in Dublin and in the other cities, fairly recently, but I think a lot still remains to be done.</P>
    <P>I think that dealing with traffic at busy crossings in the city could be greatly improved.  We are sometimes <Col N="1881" /> confronted with a Civic Guard, sometimes with traffic lights, but there are many people who deplore the fact that we have no system such as they have in Paris, for instance, whereby a Civic Guard in such a place as the centre of College Green could have his stand on a platform and from there control the traffic lights at quite a distance from him.  We have no system whereby pedestrians can be controlled at the narrowest point of the road, and frequently, as, for instance, in College Green, the pedestrian crossing is at one of the widest points and causes a far longer hold-up of traffic than need be if we had a better system.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of road surfaces.  We have done a great deal in this country during the last 20 or 30 years to improve road surfaces.  Would that we had progressed as much in other fields!  But I would draw the attention of the Seanad to a practice in France of a deliberate refusal on the part of certain towns and villages in the north of France to improve the road surface going through the town, for the reason that they found that notices put on the roadway asking motorists to slow down and saying &ldquo;thank you&rdquo; to them after they had gone through the town, were not enough.  Some of those towns said: &ldquo;Right.  We will bring back the old cobble stones and any motorist going through here fast will run a serious risk of breaking his springs.&rdquo;  That, of course, appeals to the sentiments of the motorist, and he tends willy-nilly to slow down in such towns.  I would suggest that possibly such a consideration might be applied where other means of getting traffic to slow down have failed.</P>
    <P>I should like to make another suggestion, again based on French practice, which may seem trivial or absurd, but which, in my opinion, is extremely efficacious in France.  That is the possession by the traffic policeman of a loud and shrill whistle.  Anybody who has had any experience of traffic in Paris will know the effect upon the motorist, the pedestrian, or the other users of the road, of the shrill pursuing whistle of the French policeman.  He commands attention by it, not only <Col N="1882" /> from oncoming traffic but from receding traffic.  He commands the attention of the whole street, and draws the eyes of everybody upon the motorist or road user who has been at fault. He makes longer &ldquo;the long arm of the law&rdquo; by this capacity to draw attention to himself, and to what he wants to implement, by this shrill whistle. He succeeds, also, in speeding up traffic where necessary.  I suggest that this apparenty trivial item of accoutrement for traffic police is one reason why the control of traffic in Paris and France is far more effective and instantaneous than it is in Ireland.</P>
    <P>There is just one final danger to which I should like to refer.  That is the danger of the drunken driver.  We have in this country evolved a system of licensing public houses for the absorption of intoxicants known as the <i>bona fide</i> system.  You have to be a <i>bona fide</i> traveller in certain circumstances in order to get drink.  I wonder do we ever pause to wonder what do those words mean&mdash;&ldquo;in good faith,&rdquo;&ldquo;genuine&rdquo;.  You have to be a &ldquo;genuine&rdquo; traveller, but of course we know that in fact and in practice the words have become a mockery, or a symbol of hypocrisy, because to rank as a bona fide traveller all you have to do is to travel a few miles.  Obviously those rules are bad.  Obviously they force people to travel by car when they want a drink, when in fact they would be far safer drinking without travelling by car.  It is high time we dealt also with that matter, as adult people and not as moral children, who have to make believe we are &ldquo;genuine travellers&rdquo; when we want only to get a drink within the city precincts.</P>
    <P>The question of children brings me to what Senator Murphy said about the incidence of accidents caused by children.  One of the reasons for that is our failure as a society to provide adequate recreational facilities for children, who are forced all too often to play in the streets for lack of playgrounds, swimming pools, football grounds, and so on.</P>
    <P>Finally, I should like to say that I think we have one very precious thing <Col N="1883" /> in this country, and that is natural good manners.  Perhaps the road is one of the places where that attribute, which I believe to be a fundamental Irish attribute, is least visible.  I think we could do a lot by simply encouraging upon the roads the use of what I would call natural Irish good manners.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crosbie</NameTxt>
      <P>My intervention in this extremely interesting debate will be very brief because all the speakers so far have covered every aspect of road traffic control that exists.  We have heard speakers referring to major roads, minor roads, pedestrian rights at crossings, motorists' rights, cyclists' rights and cyclists' wrongs, and I would not have intervened in this debate at all, when the subject has been so well covered, were it not for the fact that when the Minister intervened he informed the House that an amending Traffic Bill was in contemplation.  It is with that end in view that I make my humble intervention.  Senator McGuire in the course of his speech referred to lights and lighting, and this is just one aspect I would like to comment on.  Because motor cars are fitted with very powerful headlights, other road users are quite under a misapprehension that the motorist's range of vision is far greater than it actually is.  Various factors such as weather, etc., tend to narrow his field of vision very considerably although his lights appear to be just as bright.  In this respect, and as this motion is intended primarily to bring about the better safety of all road users, I bring up this question of cyclists' lights.  The law as it stands at present compels the cyclist to carry a light in front of his bicycle and I think to carry a reflector on the rear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First of all, might I say that within the City of Dublin anybody approaching any of the main approaches to the city between the hours of 5.30 and 6.30 on a wet winter's evening by motor car will find himself running a very grave risk of picking off hundreds of persons, who are on their way out from their work in the city to their suburban homes riding bicycles?  I say without fear of contradiction that you will meet <Col N="1884" /> them in groups of anything up to 30 or 40 and, in that group of 30 or 40, there will only be one or two bicycles actually carrying a front light.  I do think that the police authorities have been extremely remiss in the City of Dublin in not enforcing the law in that respect.</P>
    <P>I shall pass from that point and in conclusion make my final point, which is&mdash;again referring to the interference with the motorist's visibility which may come about through conditions outside his control&mdash;that in my view, if there is to be a new Traffic Act, a reflector on the rear of a bicycle does not fulfil the conditions which would provide for adequate safety of the cyclist himself in certain conditions at night.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesCrosbie" hpid="Mr. Crosbie Mr. Crosbie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crosbie</NameTxt>
      <P>When the House adjourned, I was dealing with the question of lights on bicycles.  I was pointing out that under certain conditions the field of vision of drivers of motor cars becomes extremely limited.  I want to make a point with regard to what is likely to happen, and what in fact does happen all too frequently, in the case of motorists who are overtaking cyclists at night in conditions of bad visibility, brought about either through weather or through the glare of the headlights of oncoming cars.  In these circumstances, the fact that a cyclist has, by law, a reflector on the rear of his bicycle is of very little assistance and all too frequently cyclists have been run into by motorists, through no fault of the cyclist himself. Although the cyclist is obeying all the rules of the road, riding his bicycle on his proper side, well in on his left-hand side, that kind of accident has taken place quite frequently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I speak on this subject with a certain amount of feeling&mdash;a feeling of gratefulness&mdash;as I had personal experience of such an accident in these conditions &mdash;a feeling of gratefulness that the cyclist on that occasion was neither injured nor killed, as he quite easily might have been through no fault of his own.  In view of the fact that we have been promised that there is to be a new Traffic Act, I want to make <Col N="1885" /> the point that that Traffic Act should contain a regulation that, in addition to a lamp on the front of his bicycle, a cyclist should be compelled to carry a lighted lamp on the rear of his bicycle.</P>
    <P>It may be said that this is throwing an added expense on the cyclist and it has often been pointed out that the bicycle is the vehicle of the poor man, but I do not think that is a sufficient answer, because a bicycle lamp costs very little, a few shillings, and an extension from the front lamp to the rear of a bicycle would again cost only a shilling or two, so that it would be no hardship to enforce such a regulation and it would be in the safety interests of the cyclists themselves.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer, in conclusion, to this question of a driving test before a licence is issued.  It was suggested here that the introduction of such a test might entail too much expenditure. I do not think that argument is valid. It would not be necessary to have all the holders of licences tested.  When a driving test was introduced in the United Kingdom, it was not retrospective; it was for the future and people who already had licences were not subject to it.  The same procedure could be adopted here.  You would then be faced with the comparatively small task of year by year testing only those who were coming newly into the field of motoring.</P>
    <P>I trust the Minister will do all in his power to speed up the introduction of the new Traffic Bill.  Despite the fact, as he said here on the last occasion, that a great number of the points raised were covered under the Traffic Act, there is still a feeling in this House that there is a certain vagueness about certain road regulations.  If I, as a motorist of many years' standing, were to offer any advice to motorists, it would be this&mdash;that under Traffic Acts or regulations you may have certain rights in theory, but in actual practice when you take a motor car on the road you will find that you have nothing but a vast series of liabilities. If everybody were to drive with that in mind, we would have fewer accidents.</P>
    <Col N="1886" />
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>This motion is of such importance that some of the points raised deserve repetition.  The motion is in two parts.  The first part suggests that the present traffic regulations should be more strictly enforced.  With that I am in wholehearted agreement.  I maintain that there is a great deal of laxity in the enforcement of the existing regulations. I listened to the Minister when he commented on the motion earlier and, quite frankly, I was not impressed by his insistence that all the abuses referred to in the motion are catered for already in existing legislation. I am sure the Minister is perfectly right, but the fact ought to be stressed again and again that, while it may be all to the good to have these abuses covered in existing legislation, there is not much point in that if it is not being strictly enforced.</P>
      <P>The experience of the majority of motorists is that there is wholesale abuse of the existing regulations.  I would like to quote one instance, one of the most glaring I know of.  We have within ten miles of Dublin a town which, supposedly, has imposed a speed limit on traffic passing through the town.  I am referring to Bray.  I pass through Bray quite a lot and I can truthfully and honestly say that seven out of any ten motorists never recognise that speed limit.  I have been passed myself in the main street of Bray by people who, according to any test I could apply, must have been travelling at 40 miles an hour; and I have seen the Garda authorities standing on the footpath witnessing that sort of driving in a town like Bray.  A great deal more should have been done in providing speed limits through every provincial town&mdash;but more important still is the enforcement of those limits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second part of the motion suggests that there should be a driving test.  I would be in complete agreement with the suggestion that there ought to be a very severe test, not alone of the driver but of the car. I heard it said here that it would be impossible for the Department to insist on the production of a certificate of road-worthiness before a driving licence could be issued in respect of a <Col N="1887" /> particular car.  I would like to point out that in practice some of the insurance companies, if not all of them, have overcome this difficulty in recent years by a very simple insistence on the production of a certificate of road-worthiness before they will agree to insure a car.  If it can be produced for the insurance company, it should be possible to produce it within six or nine months when a man goes to renew his licence.  There certainly ought to be some test.  It seems wrong that any citizen is entitled to a licence regardless of whether he is maimed, crippled, deficient in eyesight or hearing or in some other of his faculties&mdash;that it is in order for him to go into the office of any local authority and demand a driving licence on production of a statement that he is over 16 years of age.</P>
    <P>A strong case exists for saying that the minimum age limit should be raised and I would suggest it be raised to 21 or certainly to 18 or 19.  I recognise the difficulty that would confront the Department and I admit that it might not be altogether feasible to insist that everyone holding a driving licence at the moment should undergo now a driving test, but I maintain that it should be feasible to insist that for the next generation of drivers we should be satisfied that they are capable physically and mentally, according to some reasonable test, and that they are fit persons to have in charge of a car under traffic conditions as we know them in our towns and cities to-day.</P>
    <P>In regard to driving licences, I do not think the authorities are strict enough in their checking of those in charge of mechanically propelled vehicles.  I allude particularly to motor cyclists and other forms of vehicle, apart from motor cars.  I can illustrate my point by quoting briefly an instance I experienced personally not long ago. Driving out from Dublin on the way to the West of Ireland, I was on a particularly good straight, level stretch of road.  I had travelled the same road frequently.  I knew it pretty well.  On this particular stretch of it I had a perfectly clear view for at least a mile or one and a half miles ahead.  I was <Col N="1888" /> aware that there were no intersections either by way of by-roads or laneways. Fortunately for me, I did not take any gamble, so to speak, on my knowledge of that particular stretch of the road. As I was proceeding along what appeared to be nothing more than a long high hedge skirting the side of that road for the best part of a quarter of a mile, suddenly, right out from the middle of that hedge, a tractor swung out on the road in front of my car.  The tractor was drawing a trailer and it emerged literally from the centre of that hedge.  There was no laneway or roadway there.  What had happened, obviously, was that the farmer had cut a gap in the hedge a day or two previously for the purpose of enabling the tractor to be taken in or out of his field.</P>
    <P>There were two young fellows sitting on the tractor and one of them was trying to wrestle the steering wheel from the other.  They emerged on to the road at a speed of not less than 15 or 20 miles per hour.  Because of the nature of the vehicle and of the particular type of opening through which it emerged, leaving a sharp fall to the road itself, they could do nothing but bring it well across the road and make a wide are in order to get the vehicle on to its proper side of the road.  Fortunately for me, I was able to get my car on to the offside of then and save myself.  I shudder to think what would have been the case if it had been a bus load of people or even if I had been travelling at an extra ten miles per hour, as I would have been entitled to do in the circumstances.</P>
    <P>I stopped my car and asked these two young lads if either of them had a driving licence.  One of them told me that his age was 16½ years.  He said he had a licence but when I asked him to produce it he told me he had not got it with him.  The other young lad told me he was 15 years of age and said he had no driving licence.  In my view, the authorities ought to be in a position to prevent that sort of thing from happening. I feel that people of that age should not be permitted to take charge of vehicles of that kind.  I should like to see a stricter enforcement of such <Col N="1889" /> regulations as we have and perhaps we could improve on them then.</P>
    <P>There seems to be a lot of laxity so far as pedestrians are concerned and that is particularly noticeable in the city.  Anybody who has had experience of walking in cities in England and even in Belfast and who then comes back to Dublin cannot but notice the manner in which motorists and others ignore the rights of pedestrians.  It is really shocking to see women and children having to stand indefinitely while motorists and others pass them by without the slightest consideration. Generally speaking, they ignore them, despite the fact that pedestrians have a perfect right to use the crossings.  I feel the Garda authorities could do a lot to educate motorists as to their responsibilities to the public in this matter.</P>
    <P>Throughout most of the country and certainly along most of the major roads adjoining the city we have a system of major road signs which the local authority go to a lot of trouble to erect, in the first instance.  Any motorist who knows his job should realise that, in his own interests, he is expected to pay attention to these signs.  However, even though thousands of these signs are erected, we know that they are much more frequently ignored than they are recognised by motorists generally.  Again, I believe our authorities are lax in not insisting that these very definite and reasonable requirements are complied with a lot more strictly than they are by motorists generally.  If, as the Minister says, existing legislation is adequate to cater for all these contingencies or hazards, then it is high time that the existing regulations were enforced and enforced strictly.  Some of us might not care for the regulations to be enforced very strictly but it is in the interests of the community at large that it should be done and we have to think of and legislate for the community at large.  I have great pleasure in supporting the purpose and intention of this motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this motion and share with the Senators who have <Col N="1890" /> spoken before me the desire that, in the very near future, the Minister will bring in a Bill which will not only summarise the existing laws but also cover the suggestions which have been made by members of this House.</P>
      <P>The motion, as proposed by Senator Professor Hayes, falls into two sections, as the last speaker has remarked.  I think that the first section, which deals with the present traffic regulations, should be more strictly enforced.  The Minister says that he will deal with it in a future Bill.  A great deal has been said about a compulsory driving test.  I think every member of this House would welcome some form of driving test before a new applicant is granted a driving licence.  As well as an actual test in ability to handle a vehicle, I think it is equally important that the new driver should have a full knowledge of the road code.  I understand a booklet is available which sets out briefly a road code for this country.  I think the Minister should consider examining the English code and modifying it to suit our requirements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my view, an adequate knowledge of the road code is even more important than a driving test on the actual handling of a vehicle.  It is most desirable that an applicant for a new driving licence should have some actual knowledge of the working of the engine of the motor car or vehicle which he proposes to drive.  During the war, I was quite horrified to come across a bus standing on the side of the road with its engine over-heated. The driver and conductor were standing beside it and were apparently doing nothing.  I might say that the engine of the bus was still running.  I remonstrated with them and eventually I said I would walk to the nearest Garda station and report them for sabotage. I pointed out that they were destroying the engine of the bus at a time when it was exceedingly difficult to get replacement parts.  I told them I would report them to the Gardaí if they would not go to the nearest house and get a jug of cold water, which was all that was required.  The driver refused to do it, but the conductor said that, while it was against union regulations, <Col N="1891" /> it might be the most feasible thing to do in the circumstances.</P>
    <P>The Minister or possibly Senator Professor Hayes mentioned that there is a speed limit for buses.  I think he said the speed limit for a double-decker bus is 20 miles per hour and that it is 35 miles per hour for single-decker buses.  If these speed limits do exist then I fear they are generally ignored by the driver.  On many occasions I have followed double-decker buses doing well over 40 miles per hour, and I have seen them driven at excessive speeds even in towns.  On one occasion I was following a single-decker bus in the country in my own car.  I was not able to keep up with it at 60 miles an hour, and that bus was loaded with passengers.  If there is any method by which we could impose a speed limit on buses it should be done without delay.  I believe it is possible to fit a regulator to the accelerator to prevent their going over a certain speed.  I think that, as far as public vehicles and lorries are concerned, some regulation is necessary.</P>
    <P>Some Senator asked, when referring to pedestrians, if they had got any rights as road users.  I often feel on occasions that they would seem to have no rights at all.  On many of the streets in Dublin they are taking their lives in their hands if they attempt to cross, but, as far as the law is concerned, the pedestrian would seem to have more rights than any other road user.  Not long ago I heard of a case of a messenger boy who specialised in being knocked down.  He was knocked down by my sister-in-law and duly got a settlement from the insurance company. He confided to her subsequently that it was the second time that day that he had managed to get knocked down, and on each occasion without serious injury.</P>
    <P>Cyclists were mentioned by Senator Sheehy Skeffington.  I have a great deal of sympathy with them, particularly those employed in the city who very often are in a great hurry going home to lunch from their place of employment.  While I say that, I think they have very little knowledge <Col N="1892" /> at all of the traffic code.  I think that they are probably the worst offenders in ignoring the traffic lights.  It was suggested to me some time ago, judging by the number of cyclists who ignore the traffic lights, that we have a greater number of colour-blind people in the City of Dublin than in any other city in the world.  I think something should be done in the way of educating road users in our cities with regard to obeying the traffic lights.</P>
    <P>When driving into town this morning, at Harcourt Street corner I noticed a large group of children waiting patiently to try and cross over to Adelaide Road.  It is quite impossible for a pedestrian at a busy time of the day to cross there in safety.  One of the arrows points left, and the position is such that it is impossible for anyone to cross with safety.  I consider that during certain hours of the day a policeman or a traffic warden should be on duty there to see that the large number of children going to the local national school will get over in safety. The situation which I have described is to be witnessed there every morning. This morning I stopped my car and waved to the children to cross. Immediately the drivers of three cars behind me started to blow their horns. A good deal has been said about the importance of giving some indication as regards major and minor roads. Someone should take the responsibility of deciding which of two roads constitutes a major road.</P>
    <P>Drunken driving was one of the matters dealt with extensively by a number of previous speakers.  I think we shall have to face up to what is done in the Scandinavian countries where they have very strict rules with regard to drunken driving.  I believe that they have a medical test.  If there is an indication that a driver has consumed even a small quantity of alcohol his driving licence is suspended.  In Sweden, when people are going to a party, they draw lots as to the man who is to drive the car.  The only thing he is allowed to drink at the party is milk.  I am not advocating that we should go to that extreme, but I do <Col N="1893" /> think that the penalties for drunken driving should be much more severe than they are at present.</P>
    <P>In Belfast they have a system of pedestrian crossings similar to that which exists in London.  I had an opportunity not long ago of testing that system for myself.  At these pedestrian crossings you press a button.  The light turns green, and you can cross with safety.  That is a system which I think might be introduced at the pedestrian crossing which we have at Merrion Row.  I referred a few moments ago to cyclists.  I wonder would the Minister consider it desirable to introduce some form of licence for cyclists?  In most countries in Europe there is a small licence fee charged on bicycles.  That means that there is an identification number or a disc provided for the bicycle which is a great help to the police in the case of accidents or breaches of the law.</P>
    <P>The question of the number of heavy vehicles which are on the roads and are mechanically unfit was referred to by Senator Murphy.  I agree with him that it is most desirable that some form of test of the running capabilities of vehicles should be introduced before an owner can renew his tax.  Lorries are probably more guilty in this respect than motor cars.  The insurance companies insist, I think, on a certificate of fitness in the case of vehicles which have been in use for four or five years before they will renew the insurance policy.  Perhaps it would be possible for our taxation office to operate a system along that line.</P>
    <P>Lastly, I would put this suggestion to the Minister.  It is one which I have made on a number of occasions at meetings of the Dublin Corporation where, I am afraid, it was not received with any great favour.  In pre-war Berlin, and it may also be the case in post-war Berlin, the police were entitled to impose a small on-the-spot fine.  On two occasions I was guilty of breaking the traffic regulations in Berlin.  On each occasion, the policeman when he found that I was a foreigner&mdash;by the way he spoke excellent English&mdash;explained to me the mistake I had made, and asked me to try <Col N="1894" /> and avoid doing so again.  He refused to impose the fine on me.  It was one mark at that time or about sixpence, but I insisted on paying as I had been guilty of an offence.</P>
    <P>I believe that if our police were allowed to impose small fines on the spot for breaches of the traffic regulations it would help to bring home to people more quickly than in any other way the seriousness of their offence. The fine should not be big enough to make it difficult for a man in the street to be able to put his hand in his pocket and pay it.  If a person was unfairly fined there should be adequate protection to enable him to appeal.  I believe that if pedestrians could be fined up to a maximum of 2/6, cyclists 5/- or 10/-, and motorists £1, it would help in no uncertain way in the observance of our traffic regulations.  I welcome the motion, and hope that the Minister in his Traffic Bill will introduce provisions to enable an improvement to be brought about in the present very unsatisfactory situation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S.T. Ruane</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall be very brief.  I have been listening to practically every Senator who contributed to the debate on this motion, and while I find no cause to differ with the suggestions made as to the necessity for enforcing traffic regulations and laws and for having driving tests and setting up speed limits I think that in this matter prevention would be better than cure.  To my mind one contributory cause, if not the greatest contributory cause, to the accidents to-day on the highways are the local bodies, encouraged by substantial grants from the Local Government Department.  Huge sums of money involving thousands of pounds' expenditure are devoted to the cutting of hills, the removing of what are called dangerous corners, and giving wide open spaces to the speed merchant. The result, as many Senators know, is that at present some of the most serious accidents take place on the straight.  I really think that if the Local Government Department paid more attention to representations made by local bodies to devote some of the thousands of pounds expended on improving those roads to the county <Col N="1895" /> roads instead it would be better, because these roads were never built to carry the traffic that has to go over them at the present time, and if these roads were improved many very serious accidents would be avoided.  I hope that the rather exhaustive discussion of this motion will lead to something being done to meet with the requirements of the motion and to make conditions of travel for the ordinary pedestrian safer than they are at present.  As many Senators have pointed out, pedestrians have gradually been driven off the highways as a result of excessive speeds indulged in by motorists.  Those who manufacture cars are out for speed tests, and all this is an encouragement to speed which can only be carried out with danger to the ordinary user of the road.  Perhaps the debate on this motion may be responsible for bringing about improved conditions, and if that happens it will be well worth the time spent on it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>As the joint mover of this motion, I propose to be brief because it has been very fully discussed. I think that every possible point, or almost every possible point, that could be made on it has been reiterated.  I shall try to stress just a few of the things which I think are of importance in the debate.  I believe that one of the virtues involved in putting down a motion of this sort&mdash;and it has not been the first discussed in this House: the late Senator Douglas and myself had a very similar motion here some two or three years ago&mdash;is, as the Minister stressed when he intervened earlier, that it wakens the public conscience to the seriousness of the toll on our roads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I noticed that during the week the Minister for Justice was invited to the annual meeting of the Safety First Association and it was a shock to me to learn that five people were killed every week on the roads of this country.  Nobody seems to think that there is anything wrong about the matter. I remember a clergyman speaking some time ago about the moral question involved in the case of a man on a roof taking off tiles.  The clergyman <Col N="1896" /> stated that if that man threw them down on the street and killed somebody he would have the same moral responsibility as if he aimed them at the person he killed.  I believe the man or woman driving a motor car on the roads is driving a guided missile, a lethal weapon, and that such people should be competent to drive to the extent that not alone will the car not kill somebody but it will not cause any harm to anybody. We have a duty to see that adequate safeguards are taken so that the public may be protected from those who want to use this lethal weapon on the roads.</P>
    <P>The first thing we must do is to encourage people to know their duties to the public, and we can only do that by propaganda.  It was suggested here that we should have some newspaper propaganda.  I believe this could be done through many of our places of education where children are being instructed in road safety and what to do.  They ought to be instructed that accidents on the roads are a blot on the 20th-century public conscience in view of the number of people who lose their lives every week.  It is a sin against society, if you like.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>Are you suggesting a speed limit?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not.  I think the suggestion of a speed limit is very difficult because five miles an hour might be too fast in one case and, on congested public roads, it might sometimes be better for people to drive fast to relieve congestion because where you have a big number of cars trailing after one another, it is often the most fruitful cause of accidents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am far from suggesting five miles an hour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Maybe I was a little bit unreasonable in hoping that anybody might slow down to five miles an hour. I do not think that the Minister and his Department should seriously consider the issue of a well prepared book drawing to the attention of everybody who buys a driving licence the basic things that ought to be observed and that everybody ought to know.  I know that there is a difficulty in the matter.  If I <Col N="1897" /> were brought up before a justice for some offence, I could say that I did not see it in the little book I got when I got my driving licence.  Still it is better that people should have a considerable amount of knowledge than that they should have none.  It is a bad argument to say that we will not give them information when we cannot give them all the information.  We ought to have as much propaganda as we can.</P>
      <P>I was very interested in some of the suggestions made by Senator Douglas and several others that the Gardaí ought to be able to impose a fine on cyclists and such persons.  I think the suggestion is very important because these people do not carry identification and it would be a very difficult problem, having regard to the way development has taken place in this country, to license cyclists.  It was suggested that the system that appertains in the United States and in Germany ought to be considered by the Minister.</P>
      <P>Senator Sheehy Skeffington spoke a great deal about the regulations in Paris.  I have been in Paris several times and I was always rather frightened by the traffic there.  A friend of mine who has driven all over Europe said to me that the way he drives in Paris is to wait at one of the streets leading to the boulevards until he sees a large bunch of taxis coming. Then he gets out quickly into the middle of the taxis and feels like a battleship or an aircraft carrier protected by a number of destroyers, they are going so quickly, but he has adequate protection.  I am sorry that Senator Sheehy Skeffington is not here to hear what my friend tells me about Paris conditions, but I think it is a very good way to get around Paris if one can happen to do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A driving test has been mentioned.  I think it would be an impossible problem to test everybody in this country who is driving a motor car, but we could start off by having a test for every new applicant for a driving licence.  I do not think there is anything against charging anyone who wants to drive a motor car around for a driving test.  My daughter has just <Col N="1898" /> begun to drive a motor car and I insisted that she would go to a properly approved motoring school to learn to drive a motor car and the basic things that people ought to know about the courtesies and the reasons for them on the road, giving away to traffic and those other various things which many of us may not have impressed as adequately on ourselves as we ought to.</P>
    <P>The Minister ought to consider having a driving test for all new drivers and I suggest also that those who drive heavy vehicles, such as lorries&mdash;any vehicle with a carrying capacity of over one ton&mdash;should not be allowed to drive, unless they have had a driving test.  I think it is obligatory in the case of hackney drivers, which is a very good thing.  I discussed this question with one hackney driver who told me that he had to do a test and he said that it was very beneficial because all the things that are of importance were stressed and he had to go through the course and read the manual to prepare himself for it.  It made him aware of many of the things that one should do on the roads and the educational value of the test was very great.  I further suggest that the licences of all persons convicted of any offence whatever on the roads, no matter how trivial, should be held until they have had a driving test.  Perhaps I should qualify that and say that they should be given a month, or some such period, to qualify by having a driving test, and if they do not pass the test, they should not get back their licences.</P>
    <P>The suggestion made here that there should be a certificate of mechanical fitness of a vehicle is an admirable suggestion. Senator Crowley made the suggestion to-day and other Senators made it on the previous day on which we discussed this motion.  It would be a very simple matter, because, for driving safety, what is needed is an assurance that the steering joints are in good condition and the brakes in good condition, and I believe a competent mechanic would be able to give such a certificate of fitness after not more than half an hour's examination of the vehicle.  If, at a later stage. that car meets with an accident and <Col N="1899" /> if it can be shown that it did not measure up mechanically to the required standard, it would be a stigma on the garage and a garage like that might then not be allowed to issue such a certificate.  A further safeguard would be if it were made obligatory on insurance companies to get a certificate from an approved garage of the fitness of the vehicle before granting an insurance certificate.  I understand that, in the case of cars over ten years of age, the insurance companies will not give a certificate until the car is examined by a garage and a certificate given by the garage.</P>
    <P>With regard to the marking of major roads, in travelling on the road from Cork to Dublin, one sees along the road, &ldquo;Junction on the left&rdquo;, &ldquo;Junction on the right&rdquo;, and so on. All these things are told to the motorist the whole way, so that a person driving on the principal highway in the south of this island from Cork to Dublin is constantly being made aware of every junction on the road. I should say, however, that people travelling on 90 per cent. of the roads running on to that highway are not made aware of the fact that they are entering a main highway.  I remember five or six years ago approaching the City of Dublin when a cyclist came straight out in front of me from a by-road.  I was able to avoid him with a great deal of good fortune, and I said to him after that he should not have cycled out in that fashion in front of a car.  He replied: &ldquo;Did you not see that there was a turn there?&rdquo;  How could I possibly slow down to let everybody drive out on to the main highway from every by-road?  But he thought he had as much right to drive out on the main highway as I had to drive along it.</P>
    <P>There was a lesson in that for me. He had never been made aware that, as a cyclist, when he was approaching a major road of that nature, the main Dublin-Cork road, he was not entitled to run straight across the road.  That is why I think these roads ought to be properly marked and the Minister should arrange for some sort of liaison between the Gardaí and the local <Col N="1900" /> officials with regard to a uniform system of marking our roads.  I should like to see the roads running out on to our principal highways having a white line across them to show people that they are crossing into a danger zone, if you like.  At the particularly dangerous points, as Senator Murphy suggested, there ought to be a &ldquo;stop&rdquo; sign.  In parts of the North and in Britain, where narrow by-roads enter major roads, people are compelled to stop to see if there is oncoming traffic. The Guards and local authority officials dealing with the problem will know where these ought to be put and the application of a little common sense would be of enormous benefit.  I think it would do away with accidents.</P>
    <P>There is one final point I should like to refer to, though it is largely a matter for the Minister for Justice as it applies to traffic control.  I refer to the use of horse policemen.  The horse policeman is used in Britain for controlling crowds on the occasion of football matches and at points where there is a large pedestrian problem.  For that work, I think he is unique, because, being so high above the ground, he can see what is happening and can see where the congestion is.  A man on a horse commands a great deal of respect.  Ireland is more the home of the horse than any other country, and, if these men could be fitted in, for the controlling of crowds on the occasion of hurling or football finals in Croke Park or international rugby matches at Lansdowne Road, not alone would they be useful, but they would be an advertisement for the country as the home of the horse.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the Minister should see to what extent he can have the suggestions made here put into force immediately, because the Minister for Justice spoke this week at a meeting of the Safety First Society and he shocked me by the announcement that every week of the year in Ireland five people lose their lives.  When we sit into a car to drive, we might ponder that and ask ourselves if enough precautions are being observed and enough consideration being given by the public&mdash;it is the courtesy of the public that is going to save us more <Col N="1901" /> than anything else&mdash;and we might also think about whether we are doing enough to see that the holocaust of the roads is reduced so far as it is humanly possible to reduce it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. P. O'Donnell)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank the Seanad sincerely for permitting me to intervene briefly, and I do mean briefly.  I have already spoken on this motion and given my views, and I am delighted indeed to hear so many constructive suggestions put forward by various Senators on all sides. Unfortunately, I will not have an opportunity of replying to them all, but I should like to refer to a few of them.  It was suggested by Senator Douglas that bicycles should be licensed.  The bicycle is the poor man's motor car and I sincerely hope that there will never be a licence imposed on the poor man for the riding of his bicycle.</P>
      <P>Senator Douglas also suggested that we should have school wardens and he instanced cases in Dublin, no later than this morning, where he had to pull up his car to let school children pass.  I took steps already, no later than two weeks ago, to permit Dublin Corporation to appoint school wardens.  I have no doubt that one of the first acts of the new corporation will be to appoint them, to protect the lives of the children on the way to school and coming from school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Crowley mentioned that insurance companies sought certificates of road-worthiness for cars in some cases.  It is true that they do, but I question the legality of it.  Insurance companies have a monopoly of business and in my opinion they are bound to accept a proposal for the insurance of a car, irrespective of its condition. They may repudiate liability afterwards on the grounds that the car was not of a certain road-worthiness, but in my opinion they cannot refuse to insure it.  They would go a long way <Col N="1902" /> towards assisting safety on the roads if they granted bigger bonuses for &ldquo;no accident claims&rdquo;.  I think the maximum bonus one may procure after 40 years is 33? per cent.  If they gave an annual and progressive reduction, many people would be more careful than they are.  That is a suggestion which might be worth consideration by our insurance companies.</P>
    <P>Another Senator suggested that police should be given an opportunity of imposing fines.  I certainly hope that will never occur in this country. I had the experience myself of being fined once, though not the driver, for a breach of a parking regulation in America.  If you can get away by paying a fine, there is a tendency to pay it and admit an offence, although you may not have committed one at all.  It is a very bad thing.  One can imagine a young policeman fining a driver of the fair sex, for parking in a wrong position.  One can imagine these little abuses; I will not go into them in detail, as I am sure the House appreciates what I mean.</P>
    <P>We have here what are vulgarly described as &ldquo;courtesy cops&rdquo;.  I think they are doing very good work, facilitating strangers to the city.  They are on the road, not for the purpose of detecting traffic offences but to assist visiting motorists, either from the country or from outside the country.</P>
    <P>Most of this debate, as far as I can gather, comprised suggestions, not that we should amend the law but that we should insist on the present law being enforced.  This is not a police-ridden State and I hope it never will be.  We have an example of that in another part of this country at the moment. We have not got sufficient police to man every by-road, but we can act in another way.  I appeal now to the citizens of this country to assist the police in the detection of misdemeanours or breaches of the Road Traffic Act.  I was disappointed to hear Senators instancing cases where they saw glaring breaches of the law.  What did they do?  They admonished the culprit!  There was an onus upon those Senators and citizens to go to the nearest Garda barracks and report the incidents and, if requested, to attend <Col N="1903" /> court and give evidence against those who committed them.</P>
    <P>If we could instil into our citizens a spirit of citizenship, on seeing a breach of the law they would not connive at it and just criticise it afterwards; they would do their duty and report it. Only last week a driver of mine followed a motorist through the streets of Dún Laoghaire, procured a uniformed Guard, and eventually tracked down a motorist who had committed a serious breach of the Road Traffic Act.  If every other motorist did the same thing, if we reported the lorry owner who has not got his mirror adjusted properly, who has not got a number plate clearly illuminated on the rear, who has not got his lights properly adjusted or a proper tail light affixed, and if these people realised that each and every one of us was a policeman to enforce the Road Traffic Acts, we would be doing something constructive to assist in the enforcement of the traffic regulations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quite satisfied with the results that have accrued from putting down this motion.  I would like to thank Senators who took part in the debate and the Minister for his attendance and his contribution. The motion is not an attack on motorists or cyclists&mdash;or on bus drivers, as was suggested here at one time.  I agree entirely with the Minister, that we are more concerned here with the enforcement of the present law than with the amendment of that law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In his first contribution, the Minister told us that an amendment of the law was contemplated and that, of course, ignorance of the law was no excuse for anyone.  We know that.  I wish to stress as strongly as I can that we should have no amendment of the law until some better effort is made to enforce the law that exists at present, whether that is done by the Guards or by the public generally.  In Dublin, when a Garda is on traffic duty, the observance of the traffic laws is simply magnificent, but sometimes one gets the impression that the members of the force who are not on traffic duty <Col N="1904" /> are more neutral than ordinary citizens about breaches of traffic laws.  That may not be so, but that is the way it looks to me, from observation of traffic at particular places.</P>
    <P>What we need is a clearer definition of the present law, a wider knowledge and a more strict enforcement of it. I do not particularly mind what the rule is, as long as it is a rule.  For example, the Minister told us that the rule is that you give way to traffic on your right.  That depends on what are major and what are minor roads.  The money the Dublin Corporation spent on putting up signs is completely wasted, as no one minds them.  In fact, the sign on the road &ldquo;Go Slowly&rdquo; induces a great many motorists to blow the horn and go faster, as it gives them notice of an intersection and they want to make sure that no one can come out of the intersection to interrupt their speed.  Anyone who drives a car or rides a bicycle in the city can give many examples where, on the main road, if there is a road coming from the left, no one gives way and you insist on your rights at the peril of your life.  I do not think that is necessary. There should be some clearer definition of major and minor roads and it should be an offence not to stop on reaching a major road&mdash;and that regulation should be enforced.</P>
    <P>There has been some talk about the &ldquo;police State&rdquo;.  I am not in favour of &ldquo;police States&rdquo;, but I have been a pedestrian in Belfast as well as in Dublin and I know that the pedestrian is far better off in Belfast.  There is not the slightest doubt of that.  I know one road in Dublin where there is no way of crossing it anywhere from Rathfarnham to the quays, for anyone but the expert, agile youngster.  If you are older, or if you are a woman with a pram, there is no way of crossing the road, as the motorists do not want to let you cross it.  I suggest that very drastic regulations should be made to the effect that when you step on to the road, even if you are wrong, you are let pass.  In other places you are let pass.  You are not killed.  You are fined.  Fining, however, is a much less drastic punishment than the punishment meted out here.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1905" /> This is a very difficult motion to discuss. You are never sure, so to speak, what particular Minister is responsible. Certainly, something will have to be done in Dublin to give pedestrians some rights on their own streets.  At present, they have none.  Anybody who has to cross the road constantly at places where there are traffic lines knows that he is risking his life every time he crosses.  If there is a Garda present then, of course, everything is grand, but the position is very serious when the Garda is not there.  For example, there is a Garda present at the traffic lines at Leeson Street when the children are leaving the schools: there are a number of schools there. When the Garda is present everybody behaves magnificently.  I keep different hours from school children and I know that when you have to cross there, without a Garda being present, you have to be very slick in order to save your life.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RogerMcHugh" hpid="Dr. McHugh Dr. McHugh">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McHugh</NameTxt>
      <P>May I interrupt the Senator for a moment to mention something which he said and which perplexes me?  The General Bye-laws for the Control of Traffic, 1937, provide that the driver of a vehicle must give the right of way at a pedestrian crossing&mdash;Section 9 (1).  Do we need new legislation or is the present legislation not being enforced?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>We do not need new legislation.  The legislation we have is not being enforced.  In Belfast it is not enforced; it is observed.  It is not observed here.  If you are half way across the road in Dublin and the light changes the motorists charge upon you.  I do not know what can be done about it, but certainly that is what happens in Dublin.  I know the regulations.  I have studied these regulations which Senator McHugh has quoted.  He is right about the regulations, but they are not being enforced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I come now to the question of the speed limit.  The objection to a speed limit is that it is difficult to enforce. You are quoted a particular section of the law which says that you must not drive at unreasonable speeds.  If we are not going to have a general speed limit for built-up areas of even <Col N="1906" /> 35 miles per hour, then we should have a more rigid enforcement of the law where there is unreasonable driving. I submit that there is unreasonable driving on the roads very near Dublin and that very often it is done by the same people.  If you live on a particular road and go out that road, say, at five to one or five past one, every day you will see the same car and the same person at the wheel speeding along&mdash;and that same person has the habit of always blowing his horn.  I know it is confined to a minority but it is that minority which makes life very dangerous.  I suggest that if we have not got a speed limit we should at least have a more radical enforcement of the law as it stands.</P>
    <P>The bicycle is said to be the poor man's motor car.  I know a particular man, the father of six children, who was knocked down by a cyclist and the cyclist went off and left him.  That man was out of work for six months as a result of being knocked down by the cyclist.  There was no remedy against the cyclist and there was no way of discovering who he was.  I know that some people will say that the cyclists are poor but, incidentally, they are not all poor.  The fact of the matter is that the cyclists can do what they like on the roads and get away with it.  Some consideration must be given to a law which would enable one to identify a cyclist who knocks somebody down&mdash;and cyclists do knock people down sometimes.  If a working man or a working woman or a child, particularly a bread winner, is knocked down by a cyclist the position at the present time is that the cyclist can go away and there is no remedy of any kind and no compensation. Indeed, if the cyclist stops there is no compensation either because the cyclist has nothing to give.</P>
    <P>With regard to the blowing of motor-horns, Paris used to be famous&mdash; perhaps &ldquo;infamous&rdquo; might be the right word&mdash;for that.  However, they remedied the position.  They found that there was certainly no greater danger when motor-horns were silenced.  I think it would be well worth while experimenting in this city to silence motor-horns at particular times&mdash;say, from 11 p.m. to 8 a.m. <Col N="1907" /> Every motorist knows that in the dark he can use his lights as effectively as a horn.  Unfortunately, there are people in this city who have a habit of blowing the horn and they cannot be stopped.</P>
    <P>Another point, which is not mentioned in the motion, but which was alluded to during the course of the debate, concerns <i>bona fide</i> traffic.  That should mean that people are travellers in good faith.  The only genuine thing about the <i>bona fide</i> traffic in and around about Dublin is that people have a <i>bona fide</i> genuine thirst.  They go to get that thirst satisfied and come back unfit to drive cars.  Everybody who has ever spoken to a Garda knows that those drivers make life almost intolerable for the police.  I agree with the Minister that we have not enough police&mdash;if that is what he said.  Perhaps we should not have any more than we have but we should not impose on them intolerable burdens&mdash;and an intolerable burden is imposed on the police by that particular type of traffic.  It has no reality at all in modern conditions and, <Col N="1908" /> from the point of view of safety on the roads, it should be abolished.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to urge upon his colleague, the Minister for Justice, to make sure that, when new legislation is being considered and before it is introduced, it is enforceable.  There is a small booklet circulated in England which is subsidised by the Government. It can be purchased for 1d., I think. There is no comparable booklet here although there is something rather like it.  This is a matter of very great importance.  I agree with one thing said here this evening&mdash;that the majority of motorists are quite reasonable citizens.  However, there is a minority causing death on the roads.  I think that that minority should be dealt with in the most drastic fashion possible and until we can arrive at that stage there is no use in making more laws or more regulations.</P>
    <P>I ask leave to withdraw the motion.</P>
    <P>Motion, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
