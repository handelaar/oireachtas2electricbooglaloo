    <Title>Seed Production Bill, 1955&mdash;Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Dillon) James M. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Dillon)</NameTxt>
      <P>The use of quality seeds is a primary requirement in good agricultural practice.  The production, processing and sale of high standard seeds is not, however, haphazardly achieved but requires direction and control. Measures for such control are already contained in existing emergency legislation, and the present Bill is designed to replace and amplify in permanent form these existing provisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From the time a satisfactory strain of seed is developed by a plant breeder until it becomes available to ordinary farmers, many stages of reproduction take place.  The early multiplications can be undertaken under the direct supervision of the breeder of the strain, but, as the quantity of seed available increases, later reproductions must necessarily be carried out on farms.  The work of the breeder in developing the desirable characteristics of the strain would be nullified if, through lack of adequate direction in the later stages of reproduction, such desirable characteristics were lost.  It is, accordingly, necessary to exercise competent and adequate supervision <Col N="1512" /> over the various steps in the development of such strains from the selection of growers, the preparation of the land and the inspection of the growing crops to the harvesting, drying and cleaning of the seed and its subsequent warehousing and sale.  Such supervision entails the employment of trained staff and the provision of buildings, plant and equipment which is not readily within the resources of an individual grower working independently.  Coordination of effort and centralised direction is, accordingly, required and this Bill provides the necessary machinery for this purpose.</P>
    <P>Schemes for the production of high quality seeds of one or other kind are now in operation in virtually all countries.  A customary feature of such schemes is the provision of a distinctive designation and a mark, seal or label which will serve to identify the seed as being of some special merit.  Many such schemes are voluntarily operated, but, where they are in force, there is necessity for some special statutory provisions in relation to certain aspects of them as, for example, the prevention of cross fertilisation or the protection from misuse of designations such as &ldquo;certified&rdquo; or of seals, labels, etc., which are recognised as identifying the quality of the seed.</P>
    <P>This Bill embodies these modern developments.  It treats of two facts of seed production.  The first is the production, processing and sale of good quality commercial seeds and in this respect it is at present confined to the common root or farm seeds, that is, kale, mangel, rape, turnip, including swede turnip, sugar beet and fodder beet.  Power is, however, taken to extend the Bill to cover other seeds should the need later arise.</P>
    <P>The second aspect of seed production dealt with in the Bill is the provision of enabling powers for the operation of schemes for the certification of seed.</P>
    <P>In so far as the production, processing and sale of seed is concerned, the Bill contains no new legislative features and its introduction is in fact in accordance with the policy of replacing emergency legislation by permanent enactments.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1513" /> It may be well to review the origin and operation of the temporary legislation replaced which is the Emergency Powers (No. 254) Order, 1943, and certain subsidiary Orders made under it.</P>
    <P>Before the last war, the bulk of our requirements of the common root seeds, and indeed of vegetable seeds generally, were obtained through Great Britain.  Early in the war, the exportation of such seeds from Great Britain was prohibited and a critical situation in regard to supplies developed here. My Department thereupon sought the co-operation of the principal seedsmen here in the production of such seeds in the country.  In response, the principal seedsmen organised themselves into two groups and embarked on production in which they have since continued with a good measure of success.  Cómhlucht Siúicre Eireann also entered into the production of sugar beet seed and their work in this connection will be familiar to you.  It is of course open at all times for other qualified and adequately equipped persons or firms to apply for licences to engage in this business.</P>
    <P>It is not outside the bounds of possibility that overseas sources of supply of seeds might again become difficult and for this reason, if for no other, the preservation of a seed producing industry which would render the country as far as possible independent of imports is a desirable safeguard. Also, of course, there is the very real and immediate economic advantage of an additional cash crop which seed production provides for growers. Furthermore, seeds developed and produced in the environment and climate of this country should give better results than those from places in which soil and climate may be quite different.</P>
    <P>The production of seeds is in itself not sufficient, but steps must also be taken to ensure that the seed produced will be of the highest quality and equal or superior to anything available elsewhere. With a view to ensuring that these proper standards will be attained the Bill provides that firms applying for licences can be required to show that they have facilities necessary to discharge satisfactorily all stages of <Col N="1514" /> production, from the sowing of the crop to the sale of the seed.</P>
    <P>An important section of the Bill is that which prohibits the growing of certain seeds in certain areas in order that these areas may be exclusively preserved for the production of other seeds.  This is to prevent cross-fertilisation. At present, the growing of mangel and sugar mangel plants to the seeding stage is prohibited in a wide area of Munster in which Cómhlucht Siúicre Éireann is producing sugar beet seed, and this arrangement, which has been in operation for over ten years, has worked quite satisfactorily.  You will, of course, understand that this control does not prevent the growing of mangel crops for fodder in the area.</P>
    <P>Provisions relating to the operation of schemes for the certification of seed are contained in Part III of the Bill. The merit of certified seed is that it is backed by a State Department or other accredited certifying agency to the effect that its growing and processing has been supervised by the certifying authority, in accordance with the conditions of the particular certification scheme and that, as far as is reasonably possible, the authenticity and quality of the seed can be vouched for.</P>
    <P>The production of certified seed is well developed in various countries. One aspect of it, the certification of seed potatoes, has been very successfully operated in this country since 1931, and a valuable export trade exists.  A similar trade in other certified seeds might likewise be developed. My Department has been operating on a voluntary basis schemes for the production of certified seed of wheat and of a new strain of perennial ryegrass, and it is intended to continue these schemes, and to develop others on a voluntary basis.  Some aspects of them require, however, a certain statutory backing, such as the preservation from misuse of seals, labels, tags, etc., which it is hoped will establish themselves as authenticating the quality of the seed to which they are attached.  Also, provision must be made to ensure that the term &ldquo;certified&rdquo; is not applied to any but genuine certified seed.  Part III <Col N="1515" /> of the Bill is directed to providing for this but, in line with my general policy, I do not propose to have recourse to these provisions, unless evidence of improper practices indicates that they should be brought into force.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrederickHawkins" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>We welcome the introduction of this Bill, firstly, because it replaces the provisions made under the Emergency Powers Orders and takes us, as it were, out of that period, and places on the Statute Book permanent legislation; secondly, because in its own way, it gives recognition and appreciation to the great efforts and the success achieved by those people who, during the emergency years, undertook the production of seeds in order that our crops might be produced.  The Minister has informed us correctly that, prior to the emergency, our main supplies of seeds were obtained from Great Britain and that. during the earlier years of the emergency, for reasons best known to themselves, a decision was made by English firms to discontinue the supply of essential seeds to this country.  Were it not for the fact that our own people produced those seeds, we would be in a very difficult position to-day.  For those two reasons, which I think are sufficient, we welcome the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is nothing new in it.  Its provisions arise out of experience gained during the emergency, and it makes no new provisions beyond those contained in the emergency Orders made during those years.  It is very important for our people, particularly for the farming community, that when they purchase seeds a guarantee should be given that the seeds are what they purport to be.  I am glad that the Minister makes provision for such certification being provided.  On the whole, I think the Bill is one that could be dealt with more properly on the Committee Stage.  Therefore, we on this side of the House welcome the Bill.  We should also like to express our hope that the Minister will continue to give to those people, who were the pioneers of this great industry which has grown up in this country, the credit and appreciation they deserve. These were the people who <Col N="1516" /> made possible the continued production of the many crops grown during those years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamStanford" hpid="Professor Stanford Professor Stanford">
      <NameTxt>Professor Stanford</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two reasons why I welcome this Bill.  The first is because it is a mark of scientific approach to the main source of our wealth in this country.  As a representative of a university, I welcome the possibility that there will be increased employment for people trained in the universities and colleges, in scientific agricultural work of this kind.</P>
      <P>As citizens, we must all welcome any sustained effort to increase the products of our rich soil.  I speak as a layman on this subject and it seemed to me that the Bill was of such importance, within its limited sphere, that I should take some expert advice. With the caution that everyone must have in depending on other people's advice, I should like to make a few remarks on the general background of the Bill, and on two sections in particular&mdash;Section 16 with its regulations which will affect farmers very considerably in the future, and Section 21, which deals with the question of certification.</P>
      <P>As a mere layman on this subject it seems to me that the emphasis in producing crops up to the present has been on increasing the fertility of the soil.  The ordinary farmer has been led to believe that, the more manure or fertiliser he put into the soil, the better the crop would be.  In fact that is not so, because the law of diminishing returns comes in very quickly, and the more artificial or natural manure you put into the soil, the more it will be washed out by rainfall in a few years.  The more it is artificially enriched in a wet year, the more it is likely to lose in terms of the amount of money and effort put into it.  We must reckon with that all the time. We cannot get our crops simply by raising the chemical fertility of the soil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have, as this Bill envisages, to reckon with two other elements.  We have to reckon with the fact that our weather is sometimes different from the weather of countries which have been producing our seeds up to the <Col N="1517" /> present.  That is a very serious point, and it is one which this Bill is seriously tackling.  Thirdly, we come to the essential element in this Bill, the variety of the crop, and this is of supreme importance.  Variety is the only factor which lends itself to a simple mode of control, namely, to sow seed of the most suitable variety in the most suitable places.  That is what we are aiming at.  What seems to me to be the most important point in dealing with getting the right variety into the right place is the question of the distribution of the seed.  It is essential that when a farmer buys this home-bred seed he should get reliable seeds.  Various methods have been tried to ensure that the stock seed will be good.</P>
    <P>It may be of some interest to the House to compare the methods that have been adopted in other countries for seeing that the stock seed is thoroughly reliable and ideally suitable. In New Zealand, seed crops are eligible for certification only if they are grown from pre-selected stocks obtained from the pure-seed station. The field must be approved by a field's division officer, the crop is then inspected several times while it is growing, the stocks are sealed after threshing and, after gleaning, a sample is drawn for trial and the bags are re-sealed.  If the result of this test is satisfactory, the lot of seed is accepted as Government certified.  That, in the opinion of the expert on whom I am relying, is not entirely satisfactory.</P>
    <P>A better system is that which is used in Sweden.  Then there are three types of certification.  The first is the ordinary method of State sealing.  This only requires a parcel of seed to be put up to a certain standard of germination and purity for it to receive the State seal.  The second&mdash;and this is more significant, I think &mdash; is a system of after-control.  In this, a sample of the seed is taken and sown for trial.  The purchaser can, by supplying the number of the certificate to the central seed-testing station, get information as to the results of this trial.  If wrong information has been given him, he is thus able to assert a claim for damages. <Col N="1518" /> Finally, the most complete certification is given in Sweden by both pre-control and after-control cultivations. In this, a sample of the stock seed from which the bulk is to be grown is submitted for trial, the growing crop is then inspected several times and compared with the pre-control plot as well, to see that it is properly isolated from other seed plots. After gleaning and processing, another sample is taken for after-control certification. If the first control is satisfactory, a certificate is issued and the post-control is to satisfy the authorities that the certificate is not misused&mdash;for there is considerable danger there.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that in this Bill we have not gone quite far enough in the direction of this proper certification. Now, I speak for a practical farmer in the south of Ireland, who objects to the risk&mdash;and I think the Minister may agree that it is a grave risk &mdash; that unless this stock seed is tested after it has been produced, a farmer may buy a large quantity of it and have a complete failure of his crop.  As far as I can see, there is no way of getting compensation for that&mdash;he has just made a bad buy and that is that.  It seems to me that if the State is taking responsibility in this matter it should be responsible for the results, for what comes from the State seed.  I would ask the Minister whether he is prepared to insert in the certification section, Section 21, some provision for testing the seed after it has been produced. As I read the Bill, it is very good up to the point where the seed is put into the bag and guaranteed, but after that if the farmer finds a failure in his crop he gets no compensation. Am I right in that?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Might the failure not be due to some other cause than seed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamStanford" hpid="Professor Stanford Professor Stanford">
      <NameTxt>Professor Stanford</NameTxt>
      <P>That is quite true.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>While we can undertake to guarantee the seed, we cannot undertake to guarantee the farmer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamStanford" hpid="Professor Stanford Professor Stanford">
      <NameTxt>Professor Stanford</NameTxt>
      <P>I would submit that an expert could tell when the failure of a crop is due to the quality <Col N="1519" /> of the seed and when it is due to the quality of the land and the work put into it.  Is not that so?  Would not a competent man be able to say: &ldquo;This is a failure of seed&rdquo; or &ldquo;This, is a failure of treatment&rdquo;?  On those grounds, I think it might be considered that the seed should be tested after certification, that there should be post-control as well as pre-control.  It is the method, as I am informed, that is used in Sweden and I think it might get better results for us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the bulk of certified seed would be so tested, but to say that every bag a farmer buys was to be tested and the crop produced was to be guaranteed, would be going further than anyone could go.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamStanford" hpid="Professor Stanford Professor Stanford">
      <NameTxt>Professor Stanford</NameTxt>
      <P>No, but a supply of seed from a particular area or a particular field&mdash;will that be tested for the further crop, so to speak, after it is produced?  Will the test be performed on that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I am in a position to say &ldquo;yes&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamStanford" hpid="Professor Stanford Professor Stanford">
      <NameTxt>Professor Stanford</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest to the Minister it might be well to make that implicit in the Bill because, as I read the Bill, it is not explicitly stated. Am I right in that?  I think that is so?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will have an opportunity of informing the Senator, when he is replying.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamStanford" hpid="Professor Stanford Professor Stanford">
      <NameTxt>Professor Stanford</NameTxt>
      <P>I would point out that it was the fact that the Minister intervened spontaneously to reply during my speech which led me into this way of error, perhaps.  The second point I wish to raise is on Section 16. It is not a matter of seed certification but a matter of the rights of the ordinary farmer.  I would like everyone who values his property and who remembers the Minister's promise that he would never send an inspector inside the gate of any farm in Ireland uninvited, to consider this Section 16 carefully.  You will also find that in Section 4, clause (2), the unfortunate farmer who may have been away for <Col N="1520" /> some reason or another will get necessarily no more notice than something in the manner of a Wild West sheriff's notice affixed to a tree or some other prominent place, and that is regarded as legal serving of the notice.</P>
      <P>Secondly, under Section 16, a farmer may be prohibited from growing a certain type of grass, for example, on his farm at comparatively short notice, as far as I can see.  That may seriously upset a rotation in a farmer's land, if he intends to plant a certain type of grass there and suddenly finds, perhaps just before he is going to sow, that by ministerial regulation he cannot sow that particular crop there.  I wonder would the Minister consider giving a statutory time for the serving of that notice?  I know that one farmer who understands seed-growing fairly thoroughly is perturbed at the notion that he might suddenly be told: &ldquo;You cannot grow Italian rye grass or something of that kind on your land because we have scheduled an adjacent seed field to grow some seed which might be cross-pollinated by it.&rdquo;  I would like the Minister to consider that point and see that farmers get fairly good notice so that they can work it into their rotation and, if it is a question of buying a particular type of seed, will know well in advance what to avoid.</P>
      <P>In this Section 16, if the Bill is applied to grass seeds, considerable hardship could be caused.  For example, if a perennial rye grass area were in the neighbourhood, a farmer would not be allowed to make hay from Italian rye grass or <i>vice versa.</i>  The solution I urge on the Minister is that sufficient notice should be given so that the farmers could sow only the permitted strain in the proper time.  If they are given too short notice, there could be considerable loss.  These are matters which might be raised again on the Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one other general point.  I would like the Minister to give me some information.  Besides growing the seed, we must breed root plants. Perhaps the Minister could tell us a little more about what is being done about plant breeding in the country. I know some who would be considerably <Col N="1521" /> interested.  The difficulty is that most of the root and green crops that produce our seed are bred in the eastern counties of England where the differences from Ireland in soil and weather conditions are very marked. As a result, and this is the experience of a practical farmer, we find a good deal of bolting of mangels throughout the country from seed brought from the east coast of England.  This is because our winter's are slightly warmer and our summers are slightly cooler.  If we can get to the stage where we are breeding the plants, as well as producing the seed, it will be a considerable improvement in agriculture throughout the country.  I am conscious that what I have said may seem somewhat muddled.  But I am voicing the opinion of a highly trained agriculturist from across the water who has been farming in this country for some 20 years.  I am sure that he and others like him would like to see his suggestions put into operation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to welcome this Bill.  It is a most desirable measure and shows that the Minister is aware of the great use that is being made of seeds at the present time and of the activities of our farmers in that direction. One aspect of seed growing, which I think will increase considerably in this country, is the growing of grass seeds.  Grass is definitely our most valuable, and at the same time, our most neglected crop.  I do some farming myself amongst my other activities and I am growing three or four acres of grass seed this year, but on reading the provisions of this Bill that attach to the granting of licences it seems to me that those who have drafted the Bill are inclined to be rather monopolistic.  They seem to be trying to make it difficult for people to engage in the seed business, and for any Irish business man to start in a small way in the seed business would be extremely difficult under the Bill. Section 11 (a) of the Bill stresses &ldquo;the desirability of ensuring so far as practicable that the total volume of seed of any class that will be available for sale in a particular period is related to the probable market demand for seeds of that class in that period.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1522" /> Therefore, in the granting of licences the officials of the Department might recommend to the Minister that they think that there are enough people in that particular business or that there might be administrative difficulties in having more people in the business.  I think it is not desirable that those provisions should be in the Bill.  I remember that Senator Prendergast asked a question here regarding a new entrant to the highly speculative business of exporting meat to America, at the request of the then Minister.  The Minister told Senator Prendergast last year that anyone who would comply with the regulations would be allowed to enter into that business.  I think that in the seed business anyone who complies with the seed regulations ought to be allowed to enter into the business.</P>
    <P>There will be a very large variety of seeds to be dealt with.  Some people may want to deal with grass seed only; others may want to deal with wheat seed, barley seed, turnip seed or mangel seed or any or all of the other varieties that go to make up our economy.  I would like to ask the Minister to consider that position, because I am aware at the moment of at least one or two people who would like to engage in the seed business and I think it would be undesirable and contrary to the interests of the business people in this country if they were to be kept out.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is anything further to say on the Second Reading of this Bill.  The powers given to the inspectors seem to be pretty wide but I do not think that such powers have ever been abused.  The Department of Agriculture is a long-established Department with wide experience of dealing, not alone with farmers but also with business people and they will have sufficient enterprise and competence to deal with this matter.</P>

      <P>As this Bill simply seeks to preserve the emergency powers legislation already in operation and put it in permanent form, I take it that it will be accepted by the House unanimously.  It is, I think, satisfactory to know that the efforts that have been made over the past few years to develop seed growing in this country have achieved a considerable amount of success.  In the early stages of providing our essential seeds, this industry was subjected to a very considerable amount of criticism, and some of that criticism came even from the Minister himself.  If he will recollect, at that time the suggestion was that the seeds are the raw material of the agricultural industry, and that there should not be any restrictions on their import.  I think that, in the main, the criticism which was directed against the production of seeds here came from seed merchants who felt that they were aggrieved by reason of the fact that the two companies promoting the growing of seeds here were given a monopoly in regard to what ever quantity might be required to be imported.  I think, of course, that that monopoly was necessary since those companies were engaged in the production of seeds, but we could not allow a position to develop in which more seeds would be imported into the country than would be used, and that the seeds here would be left unsold.</P>
      <P>I think that the production of home grown seeds has justified itself, but in this, as in all other matters, the Department must not only do the right thing but must appear to do the right thing.  I think it is desirable that it should be brought home to all concerned that whatever restrictions it is necessary to impose upon the importation of seeds are imposed in the general interests of seed growing here, and, in the last analysis, in the general interests of the agricultural industry, because it is desirable that this nation should not be entirely dependent on outside sources for all its seed requirements. Experience has proved that in many cases our home grown seeds are superior to anything that we can import and are better adapted to our climatic and soil conditions.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1525" /> It is the unfortunate and, perhaps, the monotonous experience of Ministers that they have from time to time to eat their own words, and in Section 16 of this Bill the Minister is compelled to eat many of his past assertions in regard to excluding inspectors from entering upon any farmer's land without the farmer's consent.  The powers provided in this Bill are of a very drastic nature.  They are not as modest, perhaps, as the powers proposed in the tillage regulations during the war which merely compelled the farmer to till a certain amount.  In this Bill, the Minister is taking power to prevent the farmer from sowing certain crops on his land, and even compels him to destroy certain crops which he has already sown.  That is something which, I think, the Minister would in other days have fiercely and vehemently denounced. However, one learns as one grows older, and even Ministers learn from experience.  As far as the farmers are concerned, I do not think they are unduly worried about the powers which are being taken by the Department under this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not suggesting, but I say that the farmers are not unduly worried about the powers that are being taken by the Minister under this Bill.  I think they are absolutely necessary, as the Senator himself pointed out, just as compulsory tillage was absolutely necessary during the grave period of the emergency through which we passed.  If you want to protect any industry, and particularly an important industry such as this, you must be prepared to give certain powers to the responsible Department.  I am satisfied that those powers will not be abused by the inspectors of the Minister's Department, and I do not think, as I have said, that the farmers have very much to fear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be an intolerable and an impossible position if, after considerable expenditure had been involved in <Col N="1526" /> the planting of certain new seeds, they were destroyed by cross-pollination or otherwise.  I think that, drastic as these powers may appear to be, the House would be satisfied to give them to the Department.  It is our invariable experience in dealing with the Department of Agriculture and its inspectors that, whatever faults they may have, one is not aggressiveness or a tendency to trample on those with whom they are dealing so that I think we can be satisfied that the powers given will not be abused but rather will be used to protect this industry.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is power in Section 16 which would enable inspectors to bring tractors over fences and destroy crops if they so desired. We are giving these powers voluntarily under this Bill and I am quite satisfied that the powers will not be abused by the Department.  The powers given to the Department of Agriculture in the past have not, as far as I know, been abused.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is, I think, desirable that not only should we produce seeds here for our own crops, but that we should seek to produce seeds for export, particularly seed potatoes.  I think that is an industry which should be developed as far as possible.  I was rather surprised, as a member of a county committee of agriculture, that, when an attempt was being made recently to promote the growing of certified seed for supplying the new varieties of potatoes for the glucose factories, the matter was not brought to the notice of the county committee of agriculture until it was too late for farmers generally to undertake this particular production.  I think it was not until the month of April that the matter was brought to the notice of the county committee. In a matter of that kind, I think that ample notice should have been given, because I fear that sufficient quantities cannot be grown under that particular scheme.  I was rather surprised that the Department should have allowed so much time to elapse and adopted a <Col N="1527" /> scheme at such a late period in the year.</P>
    <P>I would also like to draw attention to what happened in regard to kale seed.  There was a complete famine during the spring season and now I notice that it has come on the market a little more plentifully, I do not know from what source.  At one time there was no source except to invoke the aid of the smuggler.  I assume that the cause of the shortage was the adverse weather conditions last year.  This bears out what all of us who are engaged in agriculture know&mdash;how extremely erratic is our climate, particularly for tillage crops and also for such things as seeds.  We have to face grave risks, and if occasionally people have to pay what they may consider a higher price than they would pay for the imported seed, it must be borne in mind that enormous risks are involved to the people engaged in this particular line of production.  The entire crop may be, and frequently is, destroyed.  All these seed crops are extremely vulnerable in a wet season.</P>
    <P>Senator Stanford referred to this matter of loss.  It is only those engaged in farming who know how considerable are the losses which can be met in the growing of tillage crops.  I am intimately acquainted with a number of farmers who have lost £10 or £20 or £30 per statute acre on the growing of beet, not seed, but nobody ever takes such losses into consideration.  People say that the farmers are making heaps of money but they do not seem to understand how grave are the risks involved.</P>
    <P>Although it is true that occasionally you may come upon seed of inferior quality I think that in fairness to our seed merchants and our seed producers generally it should be said that the quality of seed is of a high standard. That applies not only to grain but to roots and vegetables.  It is fair to say that, whether it is imported or produced here, the greatest possible care is being taken to ensure that seed is of high quality in regard to purity and germination.  I do not, however, think it would be possible for any seed <Col N="1528" /> merchant or producer to give the guarantees that are being asked for by Senator Stanford.  Seed, as we know, is a very delicate matter, particularly in regard to germination.  The germination of seed wheat or oats, for example, may be of a very high percentage at the time when the sacks are being sealed, but within two or three weeks it may have deteriorated to a very considerable extent.  That may be due to natural causes or to mishandling by the retailer or somebody else before it reaches the farmer.  It would, therefore, be impossible for those who seal the sacks to give an absolute and complete guarantee in regard to the quality of the seed by the time the farmer actually put it into the land. The farmer himself may be partly responsible for some loss in germination after he receives the seed for storage.  The guarantees given at present are as far-reaching as anyone could reasonably expect.</P>
    <P>The Bill as a whole is acceptable and most of its terms have to a great extent already been in operation.  It has not received any great criticism except along the lines I have suggested.  As regards the criticism of placing certain restrictions on imports in order to help home production, I do not think we can get over that in any way.  If we want to produce our own seeds here we have to protect the producer, and that applies equally to fertilizers and other commodities also.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamOCallaghan" hpid="Mr. O'Callaghan Mr. O'Callaghan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Callaghan</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret having missed the Minister's opening statement. If I had been here, I would know exactly what his approach to the Bill was and I am therefore at a loss in speaking.  I believe the time is ripe for big developments in seed production in this country.  I speak from personal experience of growing many different kinds of seed and I have also had experience of seeing seeds of almost every conceivable kind being grown in Holland.  I have seen fields of carraway seeds, flower seeds, bulbs and every kind of seed you can think of.  If they can do these things in Holland I do not think we should have much difficulty here.  We have the land. The climate perhaps is not as good. <Col N="1529" /> We have as good farmers, and I think it is very desirable that we should grow as much seed as we could handle for ourselves anyway here.  That would help to give employment on the land and stop the export of dollars or sterling to countries which do very little trade with us.</P>
      <P>I speak from personal experience when I say that many seeds can be grown in this country which are not being grown to any extent at the present time.  The sugar company appears to have made a very great success in the growing of beet seed. I grew beet seed for ten or 12 years myself and did not find any more difficulty than in growing any other crops. I have also had experience of growing swedes and turnips, narrow stem kale and several other seeds here.  They are not being grown very extensively in this country and I think it is a great pity they are not.</P>
      <P>I do not know exactly what the purpose of the Bill is but I am sure that when he gets the Act the Minister will proceed along the lines of big developments. I would like him to do that and I see no difficulty about it.</P>
      <P>Narrow stem kale was mentioned here by the previous speaker.  I happened to be growing some during the present season and the price I am getting is something less than 2/- a lb.&mdash; 1/9 or 1/10&mdash;but it is being sold at 15/- or 16/- a lb.  Whether that is on the black market or not I do not know.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that some seedsman is undertaking the growing of 500 acres of H-I rye grass.  I do not know whether he has got going with it but at any rate he is thinking about it.  I am sure the Minister will be glad of that because H-I rye grass is a top notcher in New Zealand, and many farmers who have grown it here feel just as enthusiastic about it as do the New Zealand people.  The growing of H-I rye grass seed will have a psychological effect and will probably tend to develop H-I pastures very largely. I have no doubt that the Minister will agree with me that that would be an excellent thing because in my own experience there is no better grass than H-I rye grass.  I think the previous <Col N="1530" /> speaker said that the Minister, was not sympathetic, and other people have said that he is not sympathetic, to seed production, but I know the Minister is big enough to change his mind and to do the right thing when he realises that it is the right thing to do.  I have no doubt at all that the development of seed production is a most desirable thing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to be able to tell Senator O'Gallaghan that H-I rye grass has been grown commercially in this country for about five or six years, mainly in County Wexford, and I imagine that its cultivation will continue to expand as the demand for it increases.  I entirely agree with the Senator that it is a very desirable grass and I am glad that enterprising seedsmen have been propagating it for some time.</P>
      <P>Senator Cogan says that the Department did not notify committees of agriculture before the month of April of the possibility of growing Dutch varieties of high starch content potatoes. The Department of Agriculture never notifies committees of agriculture about high starch content potatoes because they were not asked to Ceimicí Teoranta, I believe, were in correspondence with county committees, but the Department had nothing to do with it and were not consulted in the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the Department not prohibit the growing of these seeds in certain areas?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The Department objected strenuously to the growing of these types of seed in seed potato growing areas, on the ground that they might have introduced virus diseases into our seed potato stocks which would have destroyed our export trade in seed potatoes, but the Department had no correspondence with county committees about this matter to which Senator Cogan referred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not aware of any intention anywhere to restrict entrance to the business of growing seeds&mdash;an apprehension mentioned by Senator Burke&mdash; except in so far as it is necessary to prevent a newcomer growing an unsuitable <Col N="1531" /> variety of seed in the immediate proximity of an established grower who is growing another variety of seed. For instance, if Comhlucht Siúicre Eireann is growing sugar beet seed in one particular district and another man comes in and proposes to sow mangel seed in an adjoining district the newcomer would be prohibited from doing so because these two seeds cannot be grown in proximity to each other, as they cross-pollinate and one would destroy the other.</P>

I believe that competition is the life of trade and if I could abolish all restrictions, including all tariffs, all quotas and all other restrictions on trade, inside and outside, I believe it would be an eminently desirable thing to do; but I live, I hope, as a realist in a world in which we have to compromise in some measure, but the fewer restrictions I am called upon to put on anybody under any statute, the Senator may rest assured, the better pleased I shall be.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>But, of course, we have always had powers and must have powers to prevent the lunatic from growing a crop of thistles for the ruination of his neighbour's land.  We have always had that power and I imagine that if some lunatic started growing Indian hemp or opium poppies we would have to have power to go in and restrict him from growing these. I do not think that is any abridgment of the general principle that I do not accept it as desirable that the Minister for Agriculture for the time being should wish to mobilise the contents of five fields of inspectors or line the farmers' ditches with Civic Guards to break down their gates or to break down their ditches because they will not do what he tells them.  I think there <Col N="1532" /> is a wide distinction between the two positions.</P>
      <P>Senator Stanford opened by making some reference to chemical fertilisers and I thought I heard an echo of Sir Albert Howard ringing through his observations.  I venture to swear that if he approaches his adviser and mentions the name Sir Albert Howard, his adviser's eyes will flash and he will see all the signs of enthusiasm rising in his countenance, because, in the opening sentences of the brief to which Senator Stanford told us he was referring as he spoke, I recognised the words of an enthusiast for Sir Albert Howard.</P>

I am not reflecting on the truth of either proposition, but Buchman and Howard are written all over their disciples, no matter what topic they begin to talk about.</P>
      <P>The Senators inquired if farmers could be unduly restricted in the crops they grow.  I think that, if the powers prescribed in the Bill were improvidently used, the answer is &ldquo;yes&rdquo;, but I do not think you can have the minimum powers requisite to make it possible to grow agricultural seeds without running the risk of having these regulations improvidently used for the improper and undue restriction of farmers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Here is my difficulty, and I am speaking off the cuff on the point raised by the Senator.  A situation might arise in which a very valuable crop of sugar beet seed was approaching maturity and the Department's attention might be drawn to <Col N="1533" /> the fact that some eccentric person had suddenly elected to grow a crop of mangel seed right in the middle of that large and valuable area of beet seed.  Suppose I were under an obligation to give a farmer not less than a month's notice before taking action under Section 16, I might be faced with the position that the pollination stage of these two crops might have come and gone before the month's notice had elapsed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamStanford" hpid="Professor Stanford Professor Stanford">
      <NameTxt>Professor Stanford</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I ask what particular length of time the Minister has in mind for giving notice in the ordinary way?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>In the ordinary way, the longest notice it is possible to give. I have a constitutional horror of pushing people about in any way.  My ordinary inclination would be to get an officer of the Department to go to such a man, and, in the most friendly way possible, to direct his attention to what requires to be done in order to comply with the minimum requirements and to get him to do it voluntarily.  I should imagine that the invoking of powers against our neighbours should only be resorted to when no other device will operate, and then, I should imagine, the longest possible notice should be given, but I think that I must reserve the right to deal with an emergency, if and when it arises.  I want to be perfectly frank.  I do not think, in regard to this seed raising business, if you want proper certification, that you can put on the certifying authority the kind of restrictions that all of us would like to be put upon them, because you may have an emergency to deal with, and we can only depend on the remedy of Parliament and an appeal to Parliament to restrict an improvident user of the wide powers which are undoubtedly conferred by a Bill of this kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Stanford asked me what seed production is being done in Ireland. We have, at Ballinacurra, a place where the Department, in collaboration with Messrs.  Arthur Guinness, Son and Company, Limited, undertakes the breeding of malting barleys.  This has been going on for very many years.  We also have the <Col N="1534" /> Albert Agricultural College which, as Senators know, is one of the oldest, if not the oldest, in Europe, or in the world.  We also have Comhlucht Siúicre Eireann which is specialising in the propagation of sugar beet seed.  We also have our own new farm recently purchased at Lucan where the seed propagation division of the Department will carry out its own operations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I believe that in the Laois-Offaly direction, you will find farmers there growing mangel seed, in particular.  I am answering the Senator off the cuff when I say that my distinct recollection is that it has been grown more so in Laois.</P>
      <P>The Senator further asked what were our methods for the certification of seeds.  This is a highly technical question. I am not giving the Senator a short answer when I say that, if he or his friends are interested in the practical aspect of this matter, the Department would be gratified if they would call on the Department, and discuss their methods of seed certification because, when one deals with this aspect on an occasion such as this, it is very hard to prevent the discussion becoming boring.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is substantially true to say that the methods employed by us before we will attach the Department's certificate and seal on certified seeds, correspond to the highest standard employed by the Swedish authorities, as described by the Senator.  At the same time, all agricultural seeds sold in this country by anybody are required to conform to the lowest standard of certification referred to as operating in Sweden.  You cannot sell seeds here at all, if they do not correspond to those standards.  Those standards are enforced by a peripatetic survey by the Department.  Samples of seeds are taken regularly, and are tested in our seed-testing station, which is located in the science building of the college.  If the seeds taken from a retailer's premises do not conform to the standards <Col N="1535" /> of purity and germination which are fixed as the minimum by the Department in respect of whatever variety of seed it is&mdash;hayseed, clover, timothy, turnip or mangel&mdash;the name and address of the merchant is taken, and put in what is called the black list, which is published in all newspapers in the country.  This list shows that the seeds have failed to reach the required standard, and there is a statement as to the particular matter on which they failed to reach that standard.  Senators, therefore, will realise that seed certification in this country is very high, according to our existing regulations.</P>
    <P>Senator Kissane, as I understood him, made reference as to whether people were required to build houses.  I think that may have arisen from my reference in the earlier stages of the discussion.  &ldquo;Warehousing&rdquo; is a technical term, meaning keeping the seed in stock, but it does not envisage building specific premises for that purpose. Ordinary seedsmen would do this on their existing premises, but for a person with no such facilities, the provision of premises for the safe warehousing of seeds is required, in accordance with regulations made by the Department.  Only in so far as he could get adequate premises would he be required to do it.</P>
    <P>I have a distinct recollection of some other point which Senator Kissane made but, unfortunately, I have not got a note of it.</P>

      <P>Regarding the amendments to the Factories Bill, the only ones calling for comment from the Chair are Nos. 1 and 20 offered by the Minister.  These amendments introduce substantial new matter and in accordance with procedure it is necessary to recommit in respect of them.  Senators will also remember that with a view to speeding the Committee Stage of the Bill within a specified time there was an understanding at that stage that amendments not disposed of would be retabled and the Bill recommitted to consider them.  The amendments involved are No. 9 onwards and I take it that the necessary motion will be made for recommittal when they are reached.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Norton)</NameTxt>
      <P>By way of preface I have to say that the issuing of a number of the amendments which have been introduced here as Government amendments represents the decision by me to meet, as far as practicable, some suggestions which were made by the <Col N="1537" /> Seanad during the Committee Stage of this Bill.  Amendment No. 1, however, is not one of these amendments.  I am asking the Seanad to agree to amendment No. I. because I think there are distinct advantages in amending the Bill in the manner contemplated. Under Section 127, an advisory committee would be set up and the structure of the advisory committee is set out in this section, but the advisory committee cannot be set up as the Bill now stands until the Bill itself comes into operation and, before the Bill can come into operation, persons who will be affected by the Bill must get a reasonable period within which to familiarise themselves with the provisions of the Bill.  Apart from that, it will be necessary, before you can make the Bill operative in substantial measure, to promulgate a whole variety of regulations.</P>
      <P>Normally, if this Bill is passed without the amendment which I am now offering to the House, it would mean that the Department of Industry and Commerce would proceed at once to compile the large number of regulations which would be necessary to give effect to the Bill.  Then they would fix the operative date and the regulations would apply.  In that way, the advisory committee not being in operation, it would not have an opportunity of seeing these regulations and of course could not be expected to deal in a matter of a week or two with the very many regulations it will be necessary to promulgate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am asking the House to do something which I think will commend itself to the House.  I could arrange that all these regulations would be made and issued departmentally, without the advisory committee getting an opportunity of beaming its collective wisdom on them.  I prefer to have the services of the committee, so that both sides will have an opportunity of examining the regulations and of giving their views on them.  In other words, I am asking for power to appoint the advisory committee first, so that I can avail of its collective wisdom and so that they can make suggestions as to how best the regulations could be drawn up.  That would <Col N="1538" /> be advantageous both to the Department and to factory owners, as well as to workers affected.  I commend the amendment to the House in that spirit.</P>

      <P>I understand that the Minister requests the House to agree to give effect at an earlier date to the section which provides for the setting up of the advisory council, so that he can have the wisdom of this committee at his disposal in drafting the various regulations.  We on this side would be entirely in agreement with that, but there is a doubt in my mind as to whether the implementing of this new section would mean that the Act itself would come into force on that day, without giving those to whom it applies an opportunity of considering the Act and making preparation to put its terms into effect.  If that were so, we would be doubtful about accepting this amendment.  If it is only to avail of the advice and knowledge mentioned, we would be in entire agreement with it.  The new sub-section says that &ldquo;notwithstanding anything ... the section shall come into operation on the passing of this Act.&rdquo;  The amendments made here will have to go to the other House and the Act will come into operation on receiving the signature of the President.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DominickMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that Nos. 3 and 4 go together.  They are both connected with the supply of drinking water.  My amendment differs from No. 3 in that No. 3 omits the provision of drinking cups or drinking vessels.  The purpose of my amendment is to provide that wherever possible the drinking water should be delivered in a upward jet.  I think that is very important and you will find that in recent years in many factories it has been the practice to supply the drinking water from upward jets which are the most hygienic source of drinking water supply.  We find, however, that that is not possible in certain instances.  I believe that if there is not sufficient pressure in the water supply, you cannot get the upward jet to operate.</P>
      <P>It is where that cannot be done that I am trying to provide that there should be drinking utensils in use which would not be the cause of spreading disease.  You will know that there are certain diseases communicable by drinking vessels, which are very dangerous and serious and no amount of washing or rinsing of the cup or utensil will provide against the spread of that disease.  It would be a very serious matter in factories with a large number of employees, where workers might be drinking out of the same cup, if a large number were infected with the disease by one particular person drinking out of the cup, in spite of any washing or rinsing that cup might have got.</P>
      <P>It is because of that risk that I have put down the amendment which provides that there should be a supply of paper cups.  I can imagine that the reaction of some Senators would be the cost of these cups but from my inquiries I find that they are procurable for a very small fraction of a penny and I do not think that, in instances where the upright jet is not practicable, there could be any serious objection to the supply of paper cups which can be used and disposed of immediately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1541" /> I think that the owners of factories would look upon this proposal as a long term saving because it would be a saving to the extent that it would prevent the spread of disease and loss through sickness.  I think that if Senators would look upon these two points&mdash;the supply of drinking water through upright jets and where that is not practicable the supply of paper drinking cups&mdash;they would consider that they are good points and that there would be support from all sides of the House for this amendment.  I believe that the owners and proprietors of factories would welcome such an amendment.  Those of them who have the welfare of their employees at heart already provide those upward jets for drinking water and they would welcome the extension of such a provision to all other factories and factory owners and proprietors.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a double-barrelled approach to this section by Senator Douglas and by Senator Murphy.  The effect of Senator Douglas's amendment would be to remove from the occupier of the factory the duty of providing suitable cups or drinking vessels.  Senator Douglas believes that it may be unhygienic for the occupier to provide the cups and he thinks that the workers should provide the cups themselves.  I doubt if the workers would do that, but if the occupier does provide a cup there is nothing to prevent the worker from providing one of his own.  If the worker supplies a cup, then he will not be expected to bring it to the factory with him in his pocket every day and it will have to be deposited in his locker.  If he wants a drink of water from his own cup, he will have to go to his own locker, get his own cup, dust it, and bring it to the water, fill it with the water and have his drink.  When he has drunk, he will have to rinse his cup, dry it, go back to his locker and put it back there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can imagine that being a rather leisurely action as we all know the pattern of human life and human frailty.  I was much astonished when I saw an amendment of this kind fathered by Senator Douglas.  The Bill <Col N="1542" /> is more realistic.  It says that if you can provide jet water do it as it is the best thing to do but if it cannot be done, the occupier of the factory should provide suitable drinking utensils and some means of washing them.  I think I should protect Senator Douglas from the consequences of his own amendment.</P>
    <P>Senator Murphy approaches the matter from a different angle and seeks to establish the ideal situation.  He says that if water is available, it should be wherever practicable delivered in an upward jet from which the employed persons can conveniently drink, but he believes that, where that is not possible, it is an unhygienic practice to have a communal glass or cup used and seeks to have a drinking vessel provided which would be used only once and then discarded.  We would all like to see a situation of that kind in operation, but I do not think at this stage that we can have such a provision written into our legislation and say that it must be the practice.</P>
    <P>I would prefer a more realistic approach to the matter and a slower method of dealing with this question of water and I would suggest that the matter await the making of the welfare regulations contemplated under Section 57 of the Bill.  I think that both Senator Douglas and Senator Murphy might approach the problem by making regulations as we find the situation and then fitting the situation into the regulations in the hope that we will ultimately reach the position visualised in the amendments they have submitted.</P>

      <P>In the discussion in Committee on paragraph (f) the fear was expressed that a safety delegate might go outside his terms of reference in his discussions with the inspector. I agreed then that the paragraph should be amended to relate his representations to the inspector to such matters as had been discussed by the safety committee on which presumably there had not been satisfaction obtained from the occupier of the factory.  The amendment which I have tabled provides that the representations which the safety delegate will make to the inspector shall be such representations as he is requested to make by his safety committee.  That will not give him the right to make representations on any matter which may momentarily come into his head when speaking to the inspector in the factory.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Minister's approach to this, but there is still a difficulty I fear.  The safety delegate has certain functions, and the Minister now proposes to provide that the only matters which he can bring before the inspector are matters and representations made on the request of the safety committee.  How can the inspector know that the suggestions put before him by the safety delegate have already been discussed and are the unanimous decision of the safety committee and that they are not instead the whims of the safety delegate himself?</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>

      <P>&ldquo;The inspector shall consider any representations made to him by the safety delegate at the request of the safety committee, and for this purpose he may inspect any records of the proceedings of the safety committee.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Therefore, he sees the minutes of the safety committee and knows whether the safety delegate is acting within his authority.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrederickHawkins" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that I am making this addition to the sub-section at the request of the House, namely, that the representations which the safety delegate would make would be at the request of the safety committee. It was pointed out in committee that the safety delegate might go off the rail and give the inspector his own broad views on how factories should be run.  Therefore, it has been decided to tie the safety delegate to his committee more definitely so that he will be the organ of the committee rather than the dispenser of his own views on life's problems.  This addition is being made to the sub-section to make it clear that these are the representations which the inspector has to consider, that is, representations made by the safety delegate at the request of the safety committee.  The inspector will be entitled&mdash;that is already <Col N="1545" /> in the Bill&mdash;to inspect the records of the proceedings of the safety committee. Therefore, he will have access to the records.  These will show the nature of the discussions which took place on the matter and probably the decision arrived at.</P>

      <P>In page 53, Section 84, sub-section (1), line 35, to delete &ldquo;,subject as hereinafter in this section provided,&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to say at the outset that I was very pleased when I read the list of Government amendments to find that the Minister had put down an amendment which meets a number of the points that I was aiming at in my amendments which we discussed on Committee Stage.  Amendment No. 9 is simply consequential on the complete removal of sub-sections (2) and (3). The suggested removal of these two sub-sections is dealt with in amendments Nos. 11 and 14 standing in my name.  The Minister's amendment, No. 10, also aims at deleting sub-section (2) in its entirety.  Amendments Nos. 12 and 13 in my name were designed as a sort of compromise effort in the event of the whole of sub-section (2) not being deleted.  I should like to say that the Minister's amendment <Col N="1546" /> No. 10, which is removing entirely sub-section (2) and about which we had a lot of discussion in Committee, seems to me to be an eminently wise amendment.</P>
    <P>I stated my reasons on the last occasion and I do not think it is necessary to cover that ground again.  I would like to think that this is a demonstration that the Minister is open to persuasion by this House and the other House, and that the fact that he is so open has been demonstrated by him on this occasion by other amendments as well as this.  It is a demonstation which we welcome, that Ministers are prepared to listen to the views expressed here, take them into account, ponder them and where they are so convinced to propose amendments themselves along the lines suggested. Therefore I think it excellent that the Minister is prepared to drop what seemed to me most unwise exceptions to the application of the provisions of this Act, exceptions set forth in sub-section (2).  I think it possible that he may have been influenced to some extent by feeling that by maintaining sub-section (3) many of the difficulties which he saw-unreal difficulties I think myself&mdash;and which he was trying to cope with in sub-section (2), could be dealt with under the provisions of sub-section (3); in other words, he may have concluded that sub-section (3) dealt sufficiently widely with the situation&mdash;that it could give him sufficient discretionary power.</P>
    <P>That leads me, therefore, to consider once more sub-section (3).  The Minister has proposed to drop altogether sub-section (2), but he has not, yet at any rate, agreed to drop sub-section (3), which says that this Act shall not, except in so far as the Minister may by Order direct, apply to any premises which do not constitute a factory if the premises are subject to inspection by or under the authority of any Minister of State.  My amendment No. 14 seeks to delete altogether this sub-section. Before stating as briefly as I can my reasons for asking that it be deleted, I would like the Minister, if he speaks on this, to give us some idea of just what factories, or rather <Col N="1547" /> premises, which do not constitute factories but would be considered factories for the purposes of this section, are or would be covered by sub-section (3)&mdash;what type of factory would and what type of factory would not be covered by it; in other words, what general type of factories are at present under the authority of a Minister of State.  One can think of examples.  One can think of factories in industrial schools, for instance, and perhaps workshops in jails.  There may be other examples, and I would like to be clear in my mind, and the Seanad would be grateful, I think, if the Minister would make it quite clear just what general categories of factory would be exempted from the provisions of the Factories Act by this sub-section, and what types and general categories would not be so exempted.</P>
    <P>I realise of course that all of this refers to premises which but for this Section 84 do not constitute a factory, but we have decided in the opening portion of this Section 84 to include nevertheless certain premises which, though they are strictly and technically not factories, ought to be safeguarded, or their workers safeguarded, by the provisions of this Bill.  That is a preliminary question I would like cleared up&mdash;just what kind of such factories are under the authority of a Minister of State and what kind are not?</P>
    <P>A second preliminary question is: what kind of factories of this type has the Minister in mind as being &ldquo;subject to inspection by any Minister of State&rdquo;?  I would submit to the House that that phrase is a dangerously wide one&mdash;any factory which is subject to inspection by any Minister of State. You could imagine a factory being inspected for half a dozen different kinds of reasons, not all of them connected even remotely with the preoccupations underlying the provisions of this Bill.  If the factory, by reason of the fact that it is being inspected for some other reason, is to be excluded from the other provisions of this Bill, that would be dangerous and unwise.</P>
    <P>The point was made on the Second Stage of this Bill that the good employer <Col N="1548" /> would welcome the Bill for the reason that the good manufacturer or employer would already, in a large percentage of cases, have in his factory conditions conforming to the general rules, regulations and safeguards being laid down by this Bill&mdash;that the good employer would already have seen to it that his factory was being run on lines such as are prescribed now by this Bill, and that therefore he would welcome an Act which would give statutory authority to the conditions in his factory and, furthermore, place an obligation perhaps on some of his rivals, who were, shall we say, a shade less good employers, to bring their standards up to his and to expend as much money as necessary, where the occasion arose, upon provisions for safeguards for the benefit of their workers, too.  The point was well made that the good employer would welcome the Act, would be proud to have his factory come in under it.</P>
    <P>In those circumstances it seems to me surprising, and perhaps even regrettable, that there should be any suggestion that a factory under the authority of a Minister of State should not already in large measure have implemented all the provisions and guaranteed all the safeguards which are laid down in this Factories Bill.  Of course, some of those safeguards may be new ideas which they might not have implemented so far; but I should like to be able to imagine every Minister of State who has such a factory under his authority rejoicing to be brought in under the provisions of this Bill, in order that he might set a good example to private enterprise by the co-operative and expeditious way in which the factory under his authority would apply the provisions of this Bill. Therefore, I find it disconcerting that there should be a sub-section in relation to these factories which do not technically constitute factories, but which, if they are run by private enterprise or by private organisations or institutions, will nevertheless be deemed to be factories, that there should be a sub-section, I say, aimed at providing that if they come under the authority of a Minister of State they will be excluded.  I find that disturbing. I do not think it is justified, and <Col N="1549" /> that is my main reason for asking for the abolition of this sub-section.</P>
    <P>There is just one other point I should like to make in relation to it, and that is that it vests in the Minister the power to make exceptions even to this sub-section.  The sub-section says that this Act &ldquo;shall not... apply&rdquo; and so on, except in so far as the Minister may by Order direct, so that the Minister himself reserves the right to insist, in spite of everything in this sub-section, that the provisions of the Act shall apply nevertheless to some unspecified factories of this kind.  I think we are all agreed, and the Minister probably also, that the less legislation by decree, by ministerial Order or by statutory instrument we have, the better, and the bigger the proportion of legislative power that we can retain in the hands of the Oireachtas the better.  Therefore, on that general principle also, I would object to this sub-section, which seems to me to give to the Minister enormous discretionary power in picking and choosing, as between those factories which are either subject to inspection by any Minister, or under the authority of any Minister, and in deciding which of these shall be subject to the Act and which shall not.</P>
    <P>I should like, in conclusion, to put this suggestion to the Minister which I would hope he might consider: If he is not prepared to accept the amendment, as apparently so far he is not, and to remove altogether this sub-section, which seems to me to be the best solution, would he be prepared to have it framed, as it were, in reverse, and to say, by the removal of the word &ldquo;not&rdquo;, that &ldquo;this Act shall apply to any premises... except in so far as the Minister may by Order direct&rdquo;? The purpose of that would be that the Act would apply automatically to all these factories, except where the Minister saw that a case could be made for making an exception, and then he could make his Order and direct that such and such a factory be excepted under this sub-section.</P>
    <P>The value of that would be that when the Minister made such a Statutory Order under the powers given to him by this Act, it would have to be laid on the Table of the House, <Col N="1550" /> and the Oireachtas would have the right to put down a motion with regard to it, if it was thought to be unsatisfactory, and the Minister would be under the necessity of coming to the House and explaining what considerations were in his mind when he decided to make an exception of a certain factory under this sub-section. I hope that will appeal as strongly to other members of the Seanad as it does to me&mdash;the advantage of placing on the Minister the onus of justifying any exceptions upon which he decides, rather than saying that all of these factories shall be exceptions, unless the Minister decides that some shall not.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>There was a long discussion on this section on the Committee Stage in this House and&mdash;I hope he will not mind my saying so&mdash; I think Senator Sheehy Skeffington saw all kinds of difficulties and sinister purposes in the section which, in fact, are not there at all.  Let me say at the outset that these sub-sections which I am proposing to delete have been in the Factories Acts since 1907,&rdquo; a period of 48 years.  During those 48 years, these sub-sections have given no trouble whatever, and I am quite satisfied that, if they were left there for another 48 years, they would give no more trouble, so long as they are interpreted by reasonable inspectors, on the one hand, and a reasonable management, on the other.  It is because there has been a well-beaten track of approach to these particularly difficult problems of how to deal with people in institutions, all of whom are not there because of their saintly proclivities, that I have decided to delete these sub-sections and to allow the full impact of the Act to operate, believing that the inspectors concerned will understand that, when going into an institution of this kind, they are not going into a high-powered factory in the country, and that they will approach the problem in the climate of the institution in the same way as they would approach the problem in a busy high-powered factory&mdash;from the standpoint of what, from experience, they know happens in these factories. I, therefore, decided to delete subsection <Col N="1551" /> (2) which carries with it the deletion of paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) and the section itself would then stand with sub-sections (1) and (3) in it.</P>
      <P>Really, the modification of the impact of the main Act on these institutions is very small and, on the whole, relatively insignificant.  Sub-section (2) can only begin to apply if the Minister, by Order, directs that it shall apply. If the Minister does not make such an Order for a particular institution, sub-section (2) would give them no relief whatever.  In other words, the Minister has to make an Order before these modifications apply.  Furthermore, an Order can be made only in relation to an institution where the only persons working&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The position is that certain conditions have to be satisfied before the relaxations take place and the relaxations then are two-fold: first, the medical officer of the institution may be appointed to be the certifying doctor &mdash;it does not say he will be and it does not say that the Minister proposes to appoint him; it says he may be, and there is no obligation whatever on the Minister to make that appointment&mdash; it is one of the two relaxations from the full impact of this Act&mdash;and secondly, in such institutions as are <Col N="1552" /> carried on for reformatory purposes, inmates may not be questioned by an inspector, save in the presence of a manager of the institution, if the manager of the institution has given notice to the Minister; but the Minister may, if he wishes, despite the desire of the manager, override this provision and allow an inspector to examine the inmates alone.  In other words, the Act applies in full, except that in certain circumstances the Minister may make an Order.  If he does, the only modifications that take place are that the doctor to the institution may be appointed as the certifying doctor and or the inspector may interview an inmate, if the Minister so desires, in the presence of the manager of the institution.</P>
      <P>These are the only modifications from the full impact of the Act and then they are only made if the Minister makes an Order operating these two sub-sections for the purpose of modifying the main provisions of the Act.  I think these are relatively trivial.  I know, if I were an inspector and wanted to go into a certain place, I would ask for the manager and say: &ldquo;I want to see So-and-so.&rdquo;  I might prefer to have the manager there when putting questions.  I might prefer, because of the sex of the person, to have the manager or matron present.  I am quite certain that this has been the practice down through the years, during which inspectors have been discharging their duties in a manner which gave the utmost satisfaction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one case in which I am not prepared to accept the amendment, and that is the case of sub-section (2). which Senator Sheehy Skeffington desires to delete.  I think he might be reasonably satisfied that the main ghost has been in sub-section (2), and he might, on reconsideration, recognise that there is protection for people who might be adversely affected by the non-application of the Act to the persons contemplated under sub-section (3).  Sub-section (3) applies to institutions, such as reformatories and industrial schools, which are subject to fairly close degrees of inspection by different Government Departments, both as regards the health and general <Col N="1553" /> welfare of the inmates.  In this case, I think there is good reason that the Minister for Industry and Commerce should not normally interfere in that degree of control and protection, unless he has good grounds for believing that his intervention is absolutely necessary in the interests of the inmates.</P>
    <P>If there is anything wrong in these institutions, there is an easy way of getting at the problem.  The Minister for Justice is amenable in Parliament for the administration of Borstals.  For the industrial schools or reformatories, the Minister for Education functions under the appropriate legislation, and can be made amenable in the House. If there is any deficiency, from an inspectorial point of view, in the administration of Borstals, industrial schools or reformatories, the appropriate Minister can, as I said, be made amenable for whatever shortcomings are there.  I think it is not right that the Minister for Industry and Commerce should come in to legislate for the problems of these particular institutions, unless he is satisfied that there is justification for such intervention by him.</P>
    <P>Under sub-section (3), it is provided that, should the Minister for Industry and Commerce believe it is desirable or necessary to inspect these places, power is given in that sub-section for the Minister to make an Order which would put these premises in the position that they would be subject to the full protection of this Bill.  In other words, if any information reaches the Minister for Industry and Commerce that the administration or supervision of an institution by other Ministers is not such as to give a reasonable degree of satisfaction, then under sub-section (3), the Minister for Industry and Commerce may, by Order, direct that these institutions will be brought within the scope of this Bill.  I think this meets the situation reasonably.  In other words, the responsibility for supervision is being placed properly on the shoulders of the Ministers responsible, but, if it is shown to the satisfaction of the Minister for Industry and Commerce that these institutions which are <Col N="1554" /> controlled by other Government Departments are not being administered or supervised satisfactorily, then the Minister for Industry and Commerce moves in, and, by means of an Order, can apply the provisions to these institutions.</P>
    <P>I think, if he stands back and looks at it objectively, with a view to seeing what is a reasonable approach to meeting these cases, Senator Sheehy Skeffington will, on reflection, admit that the weight of wisdom lies with the Ministers, whoever they may be, in accordance with the legislation which they must administer.  If they fail to do that, and a situation exists in any of these institutions which makes it necessary for the Minister for Industry and Commerce to move in, then he has all the power he wants to exercise in sub-section (3).  Therefore, I think that this sub-section should be left in.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OwenSkeffington" hpid="Dr. Sheehy Skeffington Dr. Sheehy Skeffington">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened with great attention to the Minister's view.  I think, perhaps, he is under a misapprehension about certain points. I do not think I said, or implied, that there was any sinister design in the Bill, as it was put before us, asking for certain exceptions to the provisions of the Act.  But I could not agree with the Minister that the exceptions he mentions are trivial.  It is true that there are only two of them, and it is also true that he has agreed to drop them.  I did not, in fact, in opening, refer again to the points at issue under sub-section (2), because I felt we had dealt with them on the Committee Stage and because the Minister now proposed dropping the sub-section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister made a point again that the only modifications sub-section (2) allowed were in relation to the certifying doctor, and in relation to the examination of an inmate as a witness to an accident, or something <Col N="1555" /> of that kind, by a departmental inspector.  Now, these do not seem to me to be trivial exceptions.  The certifying doctor has certain duties under this Bill in other connections. For instance, under Section 79, it is stated:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(1) It shall be the duty of the certifying doctor to investigate and report&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) upon cases of death or injury caused by exposure in a factory to fumes or other noxious substances, or due to any other special cause specified in instructions of the Minister as requiring investigation....&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That certifying doctor must view the factory, under these conditions, entirely objectively.  If, in one capacity he is a doctor of the institution, and is responsible for certain conditions, and is, in fact, employed by that institution, and if, in another capacity, he is to certify and inquire and go into the question of special causes of accident or injury and so on, I suggest that he himself would find it awkward to have to pass judgment on the results of causes for which he, in another capacity, may have been partially responsible.  That is why I do not regard that exception as being trivial.</P>
    <P>The Minister dealt with another point&mdash;he phrased it here to-day rather differently&mdash;when he said that the other exception allowed the inspector, if he liked, to interrogate an inmate only in the presence of the manager. That is not quite the way in which the exception is phrased.  It says that &ldquo;if the managers of the institution give notice to the Minister to that effect an inspector shall not, without the consent of the managers...examine an inmate of the institution save in the presence of one of the managers&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>It is true that at the end of the section the Minister is given power to waive this provision.  It is not, however, just a question of the inspector deciding that he might like to examine an inmate only in the presence of the managers.  The sub-section says that he &ldquo;shall not&rdquo; examine the inmate <Col N="1556" /> except in the presence of the managers &mdash;unless the Minister himself intervenes. Therefore, I do not think these are trivial exceptions and I am very glad the Minister has decided himself to propose the deletion of this sub-section (2).</P>
    <P>I might advert also to the fact that the Minister has said that these exceptions had been enshrined in legislation in this country since 1907.  There were a lot of things happening in this country in 1907 which it became necessary to change in all kinds of ways.  I am not one who believes because a thing was good enough here in 1907 and has gone on for 48 years, that for that reason alone it must be a good thing. Many things that were in existence then and are still in existence were excellent and still are, but I do not think it is a good defence, when we are deciding to codify and rejuvenate our legislation, to say something has been going on for 48 years and may go on for another 48.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a fair indication, at the same time, that it will not cause a revolution next week, if it has been there for 48 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OwenSkeffington" hpid="Dr. Sheehy Skeffington Dr. Sheehy Skeffington">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington.</NameTxt>
      <P>That is quite true, but I do not think I am suggesting that a revolution would be caused in relation to the interrogation of an inmate in a reformatory about how an accident took place.  It seems, nevertheless, to be quite wrong to insist that he can only be interrogated in the presence of people whom he might regard&mdash;quite wrongly perhaps&mdash; as responsible for the accident.  It is most unlikely that a boy or girl in such circumstances would be inclined to give frank evidence to the Department inspector.  Even though that point is not likely to make a revolution, I think it would be a mistake for the Minister to amend legislation only when the point has been reached when he feels there will be a revolution if he does not do so.  It is part of the social-democratic philosophy to which he and I both subscribe.  I believe that it is better to reform, to change and to remove abuses before the revolution comes wherever that is possible.  I do <Col N="1557" /> not think I am misinterpreting the Minister in saying that.</P>
      <P>The Minister made the point that we are dealing with people in institutions, with people in industrial schools.  He even went so far as to suggest that many of these people are there not because of their great virtue&mdash;which was a slightly negative way of saying they had been sent there because of some misdemeanour.  He knows, of course, that in industrial schools that is, in most cases, not so&mdash;that many people are inmates through no fault of their own, but through family circumstances or poverty.  He said, furthermore, that an inspector had to use common sense in going into such factories, as they were not the same as &ldquo;high-power factories&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I have every confidence in the common sense of the inspector, but I say that the provisions of the Act in regard to safety and welfare ought to apply in general terms to factories even though they be under the control of Ministers.  Therefore, I am being obstinate about sub-section (3).  I feel that to remove entirely such factories in industrial schools and so on from the jurisdiction of this Act would be a mistake.  Even though they be not &ldquo;high-power factories&rdquo;, we are just as concerned about the safety of the workers involved, even though they be inmates and even though they be committed for some misdemeanour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has made the case that he is quite happy about these factories at present because he has every confidence that the fellow-members of his Cabinet, in so far as they are looking after such factories, are doing a good job and he does not think he should intervene.  I do not think intervention would be necessary in any major way, but just as a second check, if conditions are all right.  I can see the Minister making a major intervention only if it should turn out that the conditions in such factories in industrial schools or gaols were not as good as the Minister now believes them to be under the guiding authority of some of his fellow Ministers.  He talked about the Minister for Education being responsible for the Borstals.  That is quite true, but it is hardly fair to place on that Minister <Col N="1558" /> all the onus of being quite satisfied, in relation to Borstals, not only as to educational standards and methods of teaching and training, but also about safety and protective mechanisms on machinery, about slippery floors, fire-escape possibilities and so on.  I feel that the Minister for Education would be very glad of the co-operation of the Department of Industry and Commerce in helping him to put things right if they are wrong, or of getting a pat on the back if the conditions are already as laid down under this Bill.</P>
    <P>There is a final point I should like to deal with, though the Minister did not advert to it.  If the Seanad decides not to pass my amendment No. 14, which moves the deletion of sub-section (3), I would ask him to consider whether, if it is to stand it might not be better framed with the removal of the word &ldquo;not&rdquo;.  As at present framed, what it amounts to is that we as a legislative Assembly decide that under this sub-section this type of factory&mdash;that is, all factories under the authority of a Minister of State or inspected by his authority&mdash;shall be outside all the provisions of the Act, and the Act shall not apply at all.  This is not just a question of saying that certain provisions shall not apply but of saying that to all such places none of the provisions shall apply.  We are giving the Minister power to make exceptions, it is true, and to say that, despite the provisions of this sub-section, he decrees that certain such factories shall be included.  All the power that would remain in the hands of the Oireachtas, in that case, would be to say to the Minister: &ldquo;We do not think you should have made this particular exception.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If you reverse it and say that this Act shall apply to all the premises, except in so far as the Minister may by Order direct, then where the Minister thinks it fitting that a certain factory should be excluded, the Oireachtas will have the right to say: &ldquo;We do not think that that factory should be excluded; we think that the protection of the Act, which we gave in legislation to that type of factory and that type of worker, should be maintained.&rdquo;  If the Minister can justify his decision about making such an exception, he <Col N="1559" /> would come before us, put his case, and the Oireachtas would then have the power not simply of deciding that the exception was a bad one but of maintaining the provisions of the Act in relation to those factories, if the Oireachtas saw fit.  As the Bill is framed at present, the Oireachtas could only give its opinion arising out of a ministerial Order in relation to exceptions which were being brought within the ambit of the Act and not in relation to exceptions which were already outside it.  Therefore, I would appeal to him to consider putting this sub-section in a different way and seeing to it that the Act shall apply except in so far as the Minister may by Order direct.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I must confess that I am rather uneasy in regard to sub-section (3) of the section and the statement of the Minister does not altogether reassure me.  There are two points.  First of all, if the premises are subject to inspection by any Minister of State the provisions of this Bill do not apply to those premises, unless by Order of the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  It does not seem to me that there should be any objection or difficulty in applying the provisions of this Bill to such premises.  I cannot see any objection or why it cannot be done.</P>
      <P>The second point on which I am uneasy is why premises under the authority of any Minister of State should not have the provisions of this Bill applied to them.  What exactly would be the premises under the authority of a Minister of State?  The Post Office?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  A reformatory. Look at Section 1, which refers to a reformatory or a Borstal school or an industrial school.  There is another section which clearly declares that these are not factories at all.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DominickMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DominickMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>The second point I was going to make does not, therefore, arise.  I will take the Minister's word for it.  My first point with regard to inspection still stands and I hope that the Minister will look again at this matter and, if he cannot see his way to delete sub-section (3) altogether, that he will turn it around as suggested by Senator Sheehy Skeffington so as not to have it in a negative form and have any Order made to exempt these premises come before the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>May I make this point so that no one else may make the same mistake as Senator Murphy who was apparently misled by Senator Sheehy Skeffington.  These are not factories. Every factory is covered by the Bill. These are institutions and institutions are reformatories, Borstals and industrial schools which are under the control of separate Ministries who inspect them.  I am saying in this section that, while in the past they never came within the scope of the Factories Bill and no Minister for Industry and Commerce ever had the power to intervene before, I am now taking the power for the first time in this section to say that if it is shown to my satisfaction that all the supervisory functions are not being discharged, I shall send an inspector to visit these places.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Whom does the Senator think?  I get complaints every day from mothers and fathers to the effect that the factory laws are not being carried out in such and such a factory.  These people are put into these institutions very often with the consent of their parents and the parents go on visiting them.  In Ireland, it is never difficult to get a complaint.  These are not factories.  Every factory is covered in the Bill.  Now, for the first time, I am leaving it open to any aggrieved person to say that conditions in such and such an institution are not satisfactory and in that case, even though they are <Col N="1561" /> not factories and have never been described as factories, and have never been within the scope of a Factories Act, I am taking power to apply in full the provisions of the Factories Act.</P>
      <P>We could talk on until next week on this question but I think we have got to settle it in the ordinary democratic way.  I have gone further than any Factory Bill has ever gone before by taking the power given to me in Section 3 of dealing with these people. Previously, they were all outside the scope of the factories legislation but now they can be brought in if anything is wrong.  Not infrequently the Department of Industry and Commerce is asked, in connection with places like this, to come and have a look at them. That co-operation has gone on in the past and it will continue and our inspectors after visiting such a place can say that they do not think that the proper safeguards are being taken and that the provisions of the Act should be brought to bear.</P>
      <P>I think I have met Senator Sheehy Skeffington's point of view fairly reasonably but I do not think it is reasonable to ask me to delete sub-section (3).</P>

      <P>I am sure that if an inspector under the Minister for Education or the Minister for Justice went into one of these institutions which were getting grants from the State and saw that these people were being exposed to the risks referred to, they would issue a direction.  If their information were to reach us, we would take steps to deal with the matter.  The Department concerned could ask the Department of Industry and Commerce to request their factory inspector to look at such machines or at such operations as have been mentioned.  Advice would be given as to what should be done.  That is done at present and can continue to be done.</P>

      <P>One of the reasons I am not in favour of sub-section (3) is because Burke's aphorism &ldquo;refined policy ever has been the parent of confusion&rdquo; could be applied here.  A recent case which we read in newspapers would seem to show that there is sometimes a conflict between the regulations governing industrial schools and the Constitution itself.  In that recent case, the superior of the institution and the district justice agreed that there was a conflict between the regulations governing the retention of these inmates or their release and the protection which is given in respect of the ordinary constitutional rights of the citizen.  I think it would be simpler, both for the inmates and for these who have to decide the law, if no exceptions were made or if the Minister were to accept Senator Sheehy Skeffington's suggestion by deleting the word &ldquo;not&rdquo; from sub-section (3).  The latter would seem to <Col N="1563" /> be a far easier way of dealing with the matter.</P>

      <P>I have great sympathy with the views put forward by the Senators who have spoken on behalf of people who are inmates of various institutions, and with their desire to secure for them the same safeguards as those which are being proposed for people engaged in ordinary industry. Here, however, we have a Factory Bill which to my mind caters in general for those persons who sell their labour for hire.  But now an effort is being made to bring within the scope of the Bill a different class of person, those who, for various reasons, are confined in institutions. I would suggest to the Senators who have spoken that they should take some other means of achieving the object they have in view rather than through a Factory Bill.  In my opinion what they are seeking cannot be done under this Bill.  I think it is unreasonable to expect that the Minister would be prepared to put into operation, in the case of institutions which are run for charitable or other purposes, the same conditions as those which are embodied in this Bill and which apply to industrial plants and factories run for profit.</P>

      <P>I do not want to delay the House.  Senator Hawkins said that this Bill in general is intended to protect those who sell their labour for hire.  I am sure he does not disagree with those who try to extend the same measure of protection to those who happen to be inmates of institutions.  I would refer him to the wording of sub-section (9) of Section 3 which specifically says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Premises belonging to or in the occupation of the State or any local or other public authority shall not be regarded as not being a factory for the purposes of this Act, and building operations, etc.... shall not be excluded from the operation of this Act, by reason only that the work carried on thereat is not carried on by way of trade or for purposes of gain.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I think it is clear that this Bill does aim to cater not only for those who sell their labour for hire but for others, too.  Senator Murphy made a valuable point when he said that if we are to leave the Bill as it is now, the Minister, having excluded by the Act all these factories in institutions, may on certain information being given to him, have to bring in one or two such factories.  That would be tantamount to an accusation by him against one of his colleagues, because it would mean that he had found conditions in one of these institutions, under the control of a colleague, to be so bad that he had to use his power under this Bill to include it, whereas if the position were reversed, and these institutional factories were already in, no colleague of his could object to his making the exemption.  He would, however, have to justify the exemption to the House. The Minister has said that, if he did include them now, they could all &ldquo;get exemption to-morrow&rdquo;, but he omitted to tell us under what power or Act such institutions could get exemption to-morrow.  I do not think that the House has had enough information on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Furthermore, if it is so that all these factories in institutions would have the right to claim exemption under some <Col N="1565" /> unspecified Act, how can the Minister ask, in this sub-section itself, for power to bring them in, because that is what he is doing?  He is asking us in this sub-section to give him power to &ldquo;direct by Order&rdquo; that such factories shall come in.  More or less in the same breath he tells us that if they care to claim exemption they can get it!  If that is so, I fail to see why he is asking for the power to bring them in by ministerial Order.</P>

      <P>I find it unsatisfactory that the Minister should have to rely on casual information and complaints that the conditions are such and such in these factories, rather than on his own departmental inspectors' reports.  In conclusion, I would remind the House that in all of this Bill we are dealing with the safety and welfare of workers in factories.  The reason why they are in a factory is irrelevant. We want to guarantee the safety and welfare of workers whether they happen to be inmates of an institution or not.  If they are workers who are inmates in an institution, as I said before, they have less protection than the worker outside, who is selling his labour for hire and who has the protection of his trade union.  I would again ask the Minister to consider the deletion of the word &ldquo;not&rdquo; so that the onus would be on him to justify any exemptions to the Oireachtas.</P>

      <P>(4) Any person undertaking any such building operations to which this Act applies as may be declared by regulations of the Minister to require notice under this sub-section shall, not later than seven days after the beginning of the operations, serve on the Minister a written notice stating the name and postal address of the person so undertaking the operations, the place and nature of the operations, and whether any mechanical power is or is to be used and, if so, its nature.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I think this amendment would meet Senator Hawkins' amendment because it is making the arrangement much more flexible as to what the notification should be.  When this matter was discussed by the Special Committee of the Dáil, the view was expressed that substantial building operations or works of engineering construction should be notified to the Minister as soon as possible after their commencement so that the inspection staff would be quickly aware of the undertaking.  It seemed to be the general desire of the Dáil Committee that this obligation of notification should not be imposed upon a contractor having a number of small jobs even though, of course, the provisions of the Act will apply to any and every job.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In response to the wish of the Dáil Special Committee, I tabled an amendment which was adopted as sub-section (4) of Section 88 in the text now before the House.  In the sub-amendment Deputy Lemass pressed that, as well as granting an exemption for operations which could be completed within six weeks, exemption should also be granted for operations which would require not more than six persons to be engaged at any one time.  This was intended apparently as another measure of the size of the operations. <Col N="1568" /> I found it difficult to meet the wishes of the Committee in limiting the obligation to send notice of substantial operations.  It is a difficult thing in a Bill of this kind to define what exactly are substantial operations. Distinctions by reference to the time taken for a job or the number of men engaged on it are not very satisfactory. There can always be special pleading that the job was intended only to be a short one but in fact took longer than was expected because this or the other thing happened.  Measurements in relation to the number of men employed can be equally unsatisfactory as the number of men engaged at any one time in any job can vary enormously with the particular operation that is going on.  Furthermore we may find that, in the course of time, measurements we now write in from the point of view of time or the number of persons to be employed may be varied by changes which will take place in the intervening years.</P>
    <P>Consequently I came to the conclusion that the best thing to do was to put in an amendment designed to meet the Dáil point of view and the viewpoint put forward by Senator Hawkins. which is on the same lines as the Dáil point of view, which makes it possible to have these matters, concerning what type of operation required notice to be sent to the Minister, dealt with by regulations after we have more precise experience.  In other words the amendment makes it more flexible.  We can do as the Senator suggests.  We can make the number five or six or seven or eight, and we can fix any time by regulations which can be sent to the Advisory Committee and, if at any time these regulations are unreasonable, they can be annulled by a motion of the Oireachtas.  I think that is a more flexible way to deal with it.</P>

      <P>This is the customary confirmation of a Sugar (Prohibition of Import) Order and it relates to the Order to be made this year.  The Sugar (Control of Imports) Act, 1936, empowers the Government to prohibit by Order the importation of sugar, except under licence.  Import licences may be granted to the Irish Sugar Company only and the Order requires the approval of the Oireachtas and is the customary Order dealing with the matter.</P>
      <P>The only change on which I should like to comment, so far as this year's Order is concerned, is in respect of the currency of this Order.  Previous Orders prohibiting the import of sugar except under licence operated for a period of 12 months in each case.  On this occasion, the period of the prohibition of imports has been altered to 20 months.  The purpose of the alteration is to provide that, in the case of any further annual Orders which may require to be made, the period of six months, within which the Order must be confirmed, shall be altered from May to October, as at present, during which both Houses are for a part of the time in recess, to the period January to June which will operate in future, during which time both Houses are usually in session.  It is felt that this alteration would suit the convenience of both Houses much better than the present arrangement.  In future, Orders will be in respect of 12-monthly periods operating from January to December.</P>

      <P>Under this Order the scheme of insurance provided in the Act of 1942 against loss of wages due to stoppages caused by the weather is now extended to manual workers in civil engineering and the branches of the painting trade not included in the building trade.  Up to the present, this scheme has been confined to the building trade.</P>
      <P>The building and civil engineering trades overlap to a considerable extent. Civil engineering contracts often include work which comes within the definition of &ldquo;employment in the building trade&rdquo; already covered by the Act but many firms, the bulk of whose work is in the building trade, also carry out engineering contracts. Workers frequently change from one industry to another.  Those who have had long spells of employment in the building industry during which they paid contributions into the fund feel aggrieved when they are debarred from receipt of benefit during spells of employment in the civil engineering industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Experience of the operation of the Act has also shown that some work carried out by painting contractors, for example the painting of bridges and public lighting standards, does not come within the definition of employment in the building trade and there <Col N="1572" /> has been constant pressure to have the benefits of the Act extended to all work of a kind commonly done outside the building trade.</P>
    <P>Representatives of both workers and employers in the trades concerned have been in close consultation with my Department in regard to these extensions and I am happy to be in a position to say that the Order reflects their agreement.  The Order will come into operation on the last Monday of the present month and I now submit it for formal confirmation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>We welcome the extension of this benefit to this type of trade, but there are one or two questions on which we should like to have some more information.  One of these matters has been raised already in relation to persons employed by local authorities.  I understand many local authorities have a scheme of their own in operation which is more efficient than this scheme.  I am not quite satisfied that this scheme makes provision for all the types of persons who suffer in their employment as a result of weather conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second question is what demand the extension of this scheme will make on the insurance fund and what provision is being made to meet this demand or any further demands that may arise as a result of the extension.  We all appreciate the benefits of the scheme, <Col N="1573" /> but we would like to see these schemes in such a position as to be capable of meeting whatever demands might be made on them.  Apart from that matter, there is this question of persons employed by State boards, such as forestry workers and others.  I am not quite satisfied that they come within the scope of the benefits of this scheme. If not, are their positions any worse as a result of not coming under this scheme?</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister how painters employed by the week are affected, because I have not heard of any of them who have been penalised as a result of wet-time?  For instance, a painter employed in painting a house may go indoors if there is rain.  If the weather is fine, he paints out of doors.  Would the person employing him have to affix this type of stamp?  I think the Minister should look into the matter.  I know that, in my town, there is great difficulty in getting painters.  Instead of having short-time, wet-time, or any sort of broken-time, as far as I can see, they are working continuous overtime.  I looked for a painter recently, and he said he might be able to come in two months' time.  Different conditions operate in schemes, where there is a good deal of outside work and where there is broken-time.  Persons working in some schemes have no broken-time, and others lost days through the condition of the weather.  I know the virtues of this legislation.  It was brought in to protect people in building schemes, and rightly so, but there ought to be some way of meeting the case I mentioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the point raised by Senator Burke, I do not think we could run a scheme of this kind at all if we were to make special exemption of the case he puts, because, if we are to have an insurance scheme at all in vogue, all workers of the kind specified in this Order will have to be embraced.  It may be that the painter Senator Burke had in mind can duck in and out of the weather, and he may have a particular employer in mind.  I do not think that the majority of employers would tolerate a man, who is engaged in painting, ducking inside, sitting down, and at <Col N="1574" /> the same time paying him for that. Therefore, I think it is necessary to have this scheme, and, to put it on a proper financial basis, all workers in the building trade and all workers in the civil engineering trade will have to be included, so as to set up a fund which will provide compensation for workers who find themselves unemployed in inclement or wet weather.</P>
      <P>It is true, as Senator Hawkins said, that forestry workers are not included. This is not intended to be the ideal type of wet-time insurance scheme.  It is important, inasmuch as it is extended to workers heretofore not included.  This extension has been agreed to by the employers' representatives in the building and civil engineering trades and by the trade union representatives.  They themselves agree that, for the present, it would not be right to include employees of local authorities, forestry workers, or those employed by Bord na Móna, those employed by, say, the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, or those employed on public relief schemes, because I think, on examination, it will be found that practically all of that type of workers are protected to some extent by their employers.</P>
      <P>As a matter of fact, in the case of county council workers, in particular, and in respect of road workers, there is a scheme of compensation for wet time which, I think, is much more advantageous to them than this State scheme we have here.  This scheme was suggested by the Minister for Local Government, I think, in 1950, and has been adopted, I believe, by every single county council, except three.  We trust that those three councils will adopt the scheme which was suggested by the Minister for Local Government.  There is also a scheme for road workers whereby they are paid for part of a day, and once they are paid for this wet time, they do not have to make any contribution.  Bord na Móna also has its own scheme, as has the Department of Posts and Telegraphs. They would readily agree that the scheme under which they operate would be much more advantageous even than one to which they had to contribute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1575" /> I think Senator Hawkins also asked about the ability of the funds to carry this extension.  I think I am safe in saying&mdash;I am absolutely certain in saying&mdash;that the fund can well bear the extension.  Needless to say, the bad weather which we experienced last winter, and the strike in the building trade, meant that the resources of the fund were very strained.  But, as the general building programme is now in full operation, I am confident that the fund will be built up again to such an extent that we shall be able to build up a fairly respectable reserve to provide for any other extensions that may be deemed necessary in the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. P. O'Donnell)</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the first tasks I set myself on assuming office as Minister for Local Government was to ascertain at first hand the views of local representatives on the management system.  That system has been in operation generally for over 12 years. Its introduction was in the nature of an experiment and there was a general feeling amongst all Parties and the public generally that operation of the system would come up for review in due course; that its merits and demerits would then be examined objectively and that whatever defects could be cured by legislation should be cured.  I accordingly arranged a series of meetings throughout the country, at which I met representatives of elected councils and the managers and heard their criticisms of the present system and suggestions for its improvement. The amendments to the present system proposed in this Bill are in accord with the wishes of the great majority of the local representatives with whom I discussed the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill is not a complicated measure and in so far as it was possible I have endeavoured to avoid legislation by <Col N="1576" /> reference.  I have also had an explanatory memorandum circulated with the Bill.</P>
    <P>A complaint frequently heard against the operation of the management system is that the general supervisory powers of the elected members are effective only if they have advance knowledge of the manager's proposals. Section 2 meets this complaint.  It provides that the members of a local authority may, at any time, by resolution, require the manager to inform them of his proposals before performing any specified function.  It will be for the elected members to determine the matters on which they wish to be informed; functions in regard to officers and servants and individual health functions only are excluded from the scope of the section.  Generally, representatives did not want the selection of tenants for local authority houses to be made a reserved function.  They did, however, consider that the manager should consult the elected members in regard to the allocation of tenancies of houses.  Consultations in regard to this or any other matter decided on by a local authority may be arranged under Section 2.  I consider it essential, however, that members should, as a matter of course and without a resolution, be informed of works of a capital nature before they are committed to any expenditure on them.  Sub-section (7) provides accordingly.  Section 3 empowers the local authority, if they so wish, to prohibit the undertaking of any such works provided they are not works which the local authority are required by law to undertake.</P>
    <P>Section 4, which is to a certain extent complementary to Section 2, gives the elected members an effective system of control over the acts of the manager.  At present they have the power to require the manager to perform a specified function in a specified way.  I found, however, from my discussions with local bodies, that this power has rarely been availed of, mainly because of the absence of power to obtain prior information as to the manager's proposals, and also because the procedure involved is so cumbersome. Under existing legislation the notice of intention to propose a resolution <Col N="1577" /> requiring the manager to do a particular thing, must be signed by not less than one-third of the members and a date between seven and 14 days of the date of the notice specified for the holding of a special meeting, at which the resolution is to be proposed. The resolution must be passed either by more than half the total membership of the local authority or by more than two-thirds of the members present and voting.  Section 4 of the Bill substitutes a simple form of requisition for the existing cumbersome procedure.  The notice of intention need only be signed by three members.  The resolution may be moved either at an ordinary meeting or at a special meeting.  A simple majority of the members present and voting will be sufficient to carry the resolution, provided the number voting for the resolution exceeds one-third of the total membership of the local authority.  A requisition under Section 4 may refer to any matter which the manager or the local authority can lawfully do, except that it may not extend to any functions in relation to employees or the performance of an individual health function.</P>
    <P>At present, when an appointment is required to be made to the office of county manager, the Minister requests the Local Appointments Commissioners to recommend to him a person for appointment.  The person so recommended is appointed by virtue of such recommendation, the Minister fixing the date on which the appointment takes effect.  Because of this unusual method of appointment some members of local bodies are under the misapprehension that the manager is an officer of the Minister and that hence his first loyalty is to the Minister rather than to the local authority. In order to emphasise the fact that the manager is an officer of the local authority, Section 5 provides that the manager will be appointed on the recommendation of the Local Appointments Commissioners by resolution of the appropriate local authority.</P>
    <P>Some criticism of the management system has related to the increases in the staffs of local authorities in recent years.  It is agreed that increases have <Col N="1578" /> been necessary because of new or expanded services, but it is felt that the local councils&mdash;the employers&mdash;should have definite and direct control over increases in staff and general increases in remuneration.  Section 6 of the Bill provides, accordingly, that a proposal to increase or decrease the number of permanent officers under a local authority may not be submitted by the manager for sanction without the consent by resolution of the elected members, and that the manager may not fix an increased or reduced rate of remuneration applicable to any class, description or grade of office or employment without similar consent by resolution of the elected members.</P>
    <P>Sections 7 and 9 give new powers to all local authorities wishing to avail of them in regard to the preparation of the annual estimate of expenses. Under the law as it stands, the manager prepares the annual estimate of expenses and submits it for consideration at the annual estimates meeting.  I have been impressed by representations that members could exercise a more positive financial control if they were to have a hand in the preparation of the estimates, rather than have to try to criticise and amend an estimate prepared by the manager. The Bill accordingly makes provision for a new procedure for the preparation of the estimates, which may be adopted by any local authority wishing to avail of it.  Under Section 7 a local authority may elect from amongst its members an estimates committee to consist in the case of a county council of two members from each county electoral area, and in the case of every other local authority of not more than one-third of its membership.</P>
    <P>When I had the Bill drafted I included this provision as one that would be mandatory on all local authorities, but during the passage of the Bill through the Dáil I accepted a recommendation that it should be made a permissive provision so that each local authority could decide for itself whether or not it would adopt it. Where an estimates committee has been appointed it will be the duty of such committee to prepare the annual <Col N="1579" /> estimate of expenses.  This does not mean that the members of the committee will have to perform work which is appropriate to officers of the local authority.  The estimates committee will have the full assistance of the officers of the local authority and such assistance will include the preparation and submission of statements of the estimated receipts and expenditure and so on.  It is not necessary to provide explicitly for this but to remove doubts and to clarify the intention behind Section 9 it is provided in sub-section (2) that the manager must, so far as is not inconsistent with the due performance of his other duties, attend every meeting of the estimates committee and furnish the members with such information, assistance and advice as they require.  Where the manager cannot himself attend, he must under sub-section (5) designate an officer to act in his place.</P>
    <P>The estimate of expenses prepared by the estimates committee will be presented to the estimates meeting of the local authority and the local authority will not be committed in any way to adopting it.  Where the manager considers that an estimate of expenses as prepared by an estimates committee would seriously prejudice the efficient or economical performance of the functions of the local authority, he must prepare a separate report specifying the provision which in his opinion is necessary.  This report will be furnished to members of the local authority with copies of the estimate.</P>
    <P>If the estimates committee fail to prepare the estimate, or where an estimates committee has not been appointed, the manager must himself prepare the estimate as heretofore.</P>
    <P>Section 8 provides that it shall be the duty of the estimates committee&mdash; or where no such committee exists, the manager&mdash;to furnish the members of the local authority, at such intervals as the members may decide by resolution, with whatever financial statements they require to keep them informed of the position of the local authority's finances.</P>
    <P>Under the existing law, the members of the local authority cannot at an estimates <Col N="1580" /> meeting, make an amendment of the estimate to which the manager objects.  Consideration of any amendment proposed must be adjourned to a special meeting, and at that special meeting no new amendment can be considered. I am satisfied that these provisions are too restrictive of the members' freedom to examine and decide on the estimate.  They are being repealed and new provisions are being included in Section 10.  This section will enable local authorities to amend an estimate of expenses at the estimates meeting or at any adjournment thereof, provided that the meeting may not be adjourned to a day outside the period of 21 days from the day on which the estimates meeting began.</P>
    <P>Section 12 empowers the Minister to group for management purposes two counties, the councils of which have requested him to do so.  It is provided under Section 13 that the Minister may degroup any counties grouped for management purposes, on the receipt of a request from each of two such grouped counties.  In Section 14 there are similar provisions to enable the present arrangement, whereby the Dublin City Manager is also Dublin County Manager, to be terminated. Consequential provisions dealing with the Dublin Assistant Managers are contained in Section 22.</P>
    <P>Section 28 of the County Management Act, 1940, and corresponding provisions in the City Management Acts, empower the members to make, if they so think fit, regulations prescribing the procedure to be followed in regard to the reception and examination of tenders. I found in the course of my discussions with local representatives that many of them appeared to be unaware of their powers under these provisions. Section 15 of the present Bill places an obligation on each new council to make a formal decision to have regulations or not, and provides that the regulations may extend to the seeking of tenders, as well as to their reception and examination.</P>
    <P>Section 61 of the Local Government Act, 1925, placed a responsibility on the chief executive officer of every local authority to advise the members before they voted on any resolution to <Col N="1581" /> do any act in consequence of which an illegal payment would be made or a loss or deficiency in the funds of the local authority was likely to arise.  The names of the members who voted for the resolution were recorded in the minutes.  The purpose of this section was to protect the members of the local authority by requiring the chief executive officer to give warning whenever the council were considering some proposal which, if adopted, might result in a surcharge or charge.  If the warning were not given, the council as a body might subsequently be surcharged or charged.  When, notwithstanding a warning given under the section, the council adopt the proposal the names of the members voting for the proposal are recorded in the minutes and these members and no other members are liable, in the event of a surcharge.</P>
    <P>In Section 61 of the Local Government Act of 1926, the term &ldquo;responsible officer&rdquo; is defined as meaning the secretary, clerk, R.M.S., or other chief executive officer of such local authority.  This definition must be brought into line with the management code under which the manager is the chief executive officer of the local authority.  This is done in Section, 16 of the Bill, which places responsibility for objecting on the manager or in his absence on such other officer as may be designated by him.</P>
    <P>It is necessary to stress that the question of warning does not arise where a local authority are proposing lawful expenditure outside the provision made in the estimates, such as the repairing of a road the repair of which was not included in the road works scheme.  Once a work requisitioned by the members is a work that can lawfully be carried out and the council provide the money, by authorising the expenditure, the manager must carry out the work.</P>
    <P>Section 17 empowers a manager to delegate any of his functions, with the approval of the appropriate Minister, to an approved officer of that local authority.  The intention is to enable managers to delegate some of their less important functions, as they may have <Col N="1582" /> to attend to important administrative duties elsewhere.  The manager will continue to be responsible for the acts of his delegate and he may revoke the delegation at any time.  At present, managers are obliged to give a considerable proportion of their time to the making of orders of a routine character, because of the legal requirement that everything in the executive functions of a manager which formerly required to be done by resolution of the local authority should thereafter have to be done by the manager by signed order.</P>
    <P>The remaining sections of the Bill contain miscellaneous provisions of a minor nature, designed to clarify or facilitate the administration of the Management Acts.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TedOSullivan" hpid="Mr. T. O'Sullivan Mr. T. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am one of those very agreeably surprised to find that the people who were most opposed to this County Management Act in 1940 have given it their full approval and blessing now.  When one remembers all the noise that was made up and down the country since 1940, and even a few years ago, as to the dictatorial powers of managers, how they should be curbed and how they should be abolished, I am very glad indeed to find now that it has been recorded by the Dáil after so many years that the city and county management scheme has come to stay, that it is here to stay, that it has been proved a good scheme and that it will remain.  I was always in favour of the scheme.  I saw from time to time that it could be improved and was anxious to see improvements made in it but I had lost hope for some time when I found that many public men, members of corporations and county councils, would have none of it&mdash;they would have no improvement and would prefer to see it abolished completely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I read and heard many speeches through out the country on the occasion of the last local election campaign to the effect that the county and city managers should be abolished and that all authority should go back again to the hands of the elected representatives, I felt then, and I am sure now, that that would have been a retrograde step.  I am glad indeed <Col N="1583" /> that the Dáil has passed this Bill to improve, if only slightly, the city and county management scheme.  For that reason, I welcome the Bill and I congratulate the Minister on adhering to all the definite principles laid down in the 1940 Act.</P>
    <P>It was necessary for him, indeed, to bring in certain improvements in that Act.  I do not know how it operated in some counties but I can say for County Cork that people do not think there is any amendment necessary because we have had in County Cork, thank God, the very good fortune to have excellent managers, far-seeing, responsible men, who discussed every possible matter that they thought would concern the members of the council with the council.  They were slow to take any action that would not be in accordance with the wishes of the council and were strong enough at the same time to take very positive action when it was needed.</P>
    <P>In that way we were very lucky, and I cannot remember an occasion on which the county manager did not have the approval of the county council in his work.  It was a very happy state of affairs but I am satisfied, all the same, that some members of the county council thought that they themselves should have more powers.  From time to time they considered that if they were managing affairs they would get on better.  Of course it is difficult to get 46 men, at any one meeting, who would be of the same opinion on any matter, but at the same time, looking back over the years I am satisfied that the County Management Act has been a success in County Cork.</P>
    <P>The only point I wish to refer to is that some members were not in entire agreement with the manager on the question of increases of salaries and wages or possibly the appointment of extra staff.  It was our experience that, where any of these disagreements occurred, the instructions, in one form or another, were sent down from Dublin, and when any decision was taken locally as to increase in staff or wages we had no trouble.  Members generally resented the position where the manager put the proposals before <Col N="1584" /> them, received by letter from Dublin, that an assistant engineer or two assistant engineers or two or three medical officers of health should be appointed at certain salaries.  The council would have preferred if these proposals had been put before them first.  That, I am glad to see, has been provided for in this Bill and we have a guarantee that that state of affairs will not occur in future, that a manager will not be able to do it himself and that it will not come to us from Dublin. That is something we must welcome in this Bill.</P>
    <P>I have noticed in other counties that the managers and the council did not get on so well and I suppose it is hard to expect that every new Act passed by the Oireachtas should be perfect without amendment.  I have never said that the 1940 Act was perfect.  It will probably be found after a few years that this Act can be further improved beyond the amendments suggested here at the moment.  The fact remains that I am very happy to find that the principle or system of management is here to stay.</P>
    <P>In Cork, which is the biggest county in the State, we had a total expenditure last year of nearly £3,000,000 made up of almost £290,000 in the northern assistance area, of £450,000 in the southern area and of about £180,000 in the western area.  I hold that the expenditure in each of these areas is more than the expenditure in the smallest county in the State where you have a manager.  In addition to the sums I have given, there is an expenditure on roads of £892,000, on health £178,000 and for mental treatment £218,000.  These figures represent a huge expenditure and there is a huge staff.  The managers have to accept a responsibility for all that expenditure that I think is more than they should be expected to bear.  We have a manager and two assistant managers. We worked one assistant manager to death.  The other man will probably stand up for a few years more.  We have a temporary man at the moment, but I think they are all overworked, having to supervise such a huge expenditure over a very wide area.  The <Col N="1585" /> permanent position of a second assistant manager has not yet been filled although it was advertised by the Local Appointments Commissioners. All the applicants, I understand, were interviewed and yet no appointment has been made.  I am sure the Minister will tell us why later.</P>
    <P>I mentioned in the Dáil, on a previous occasion, that I thought some provision should be made in this Bill for a third assistant county manager for Cork.  Even if that appointment had been made we would still have more work for each assistant county manager than there is for a manager in the smaller counties.  I think it is not too late yet to ask the Minister to consider that question.</P>

      <P>I know that, but I am asking the Minister to incorporate it in the Bill.  There can be no question about it then.  If the Minister and his Department are satisfied that it would be a good thing to do then I think he should incorporate it in the Bill.  I am certain that when the Minister says a thing may be done, he is satisfied that it would be a good thing to do.  Therefore, he should not give us the excuse for not doing it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of these estimates committees, on which there was so much discussion in the other House, it has been possible at all times, and has happened from time to time, that councils set up committees to consider estimates. Of course, we had definite areas where we had to submit statutory estimates to the manager for North, South and West Cork.  In each of these areas you had a committee or a board of assistance.  The members of the board or committee always composed the estimates committee.  When the total estimate came to be considered by the council, composed of the estimates furnished by these boards or hospital committees with the other estimates for roads, etc., it was considered by the council as a whole.  Unless a council, for one reason or another, decides of its own volition to appoint a sub-committee, I do not think it should be <Col N="1586" /> mandatory on it to appoint an estimates committee, and I am glad to see that the Bill has been amended to that extent.</P>
    <P>I see a reference in the Bill which I do not quite understand.  It is in connection with North and South Tipperary. I wonder does that mean that there will be a manager and an assistant manager in North Tipperary?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. P. O'Donnell Mr. P. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Donnell</NameTxt>

      <P>I think that possibly under Section 12 the Minister could bring in this suggestion of mine with regard to a third assistant manager for Cork County.  I would ask him to consider that.  I am satisfied that this Bill will be of some assistance in making people who have been opposed to the system of county management understand it and approve of it.  There is really very little in the Bill.  It is some improvement on the previous Act.  We welcome it as such, and I have no doubt that as the years go by we will improve it further.  On the whole, I have to congratulate the Minister and the different Parties supporting him, on having been converted 100 per cent. to the management system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanRuane" hpid="Mr. S.T. Ruane Mr. S.T. Ruane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S.T. Ruane</NameTxt>
      <P>As one who, for quite a long time, has been associated with local administration, I must say that I feel impressed with the changes which have come over several people who in earlier times resisted any innovation suggested for the improvement of the local bodies.  I have a vivid recollection of an incident in my own county where an appointment was made by the Appointments Commission which was resisted vehemently by many.  As a matter of fact, I would say that in that county the general election of 1932 was fought on that issue.  The promise made by various <Col N="1587" /> people of the Opposition at the time, was that if there was a change of Government the system of centralisation, as it was called, would be abolished and powers would be restored to the local bodies to make these appointments.  The Government at the time, through the refusal of the local body to appoint the appointee of the Appointments Commission, gave an opportunity to the council to reconsider its decision.  The council refused in its wisdom or unwisdom and the Government dissolved it.  They sent to County Mayo a commissioner whose administration during the few years he was there certainly won the approval of everyone interested in efficiency and economy.</P>
      <P>I would like to compliment the Minister on the introduction of this Bill, for he has gone as far as any Minister could reasonably go to restore power to local bodies, the absence of which was given as a reason why many people, who would be useful in local administration, did not seek election. If there is anything in the contention that the absence of those powers in the past deprived local administration of certain desirable people, that excuse is no longer there.  I quite admit that some seasoned administrators would like to see the Minister go further and to restore power to local bodies to make certain appointments by vote. Quite a number disagree with that view and I certainly do not agree with it.  I believe that system of appointment in many cases seriously militated against the interests of the people and that these appointments should be made only by people with qualifications to make a selection on the order of merit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 4 of this Bill appeals to me because it gets rid of a rather roundabout way of getting the manager to do certain things, by securing the signatures of one-third of any local body to have a certain motion given effect to, and by securing a two-thirds majority afterwards.  That was a rather roundabout way to give local bodies power to bring the manager to pay attention to their views.  Now that <Col N="1588" /> has been modified and, as the Minister pointed out in his opening remarks, there is no reason why very beneficial results should not accrue.  Certainly the power restored to local bodies to analyse certain matters of expenditure is absolutely necessary, for I do know cases where very expensive schemes have been put under way without the local body knowing anything about them and they have not been successful. It is also desirable that in the matter of selection of tenants for cottages the opinions of representatives should be canvassed because, through their local knowledge, they would be able to help the health authority in making selections.</P>
    <P>I am not so happy about the section which provides for the setting up of an estimates committee, because my experience of such committees in the past has been that, no matter how efficient their work may be, it would be subject eventually to an inquest by the whole body and very often radically altered and not improved.  If such a committee is to be of any value, it should be a committee of the whole council.</P>
    <P>When the Local Government Bill was going through this House I made certain suggestions that I thought would improve it, in so far as the delegation of certain duties already carried out by county councils was concerned.  These duties would be more appropriately given over to subsidiary bodies.  For instance, county councils at present have to administer the Diseases of Animals Acts, Sheep Dipping Order, Seeds and Fertilisers Orders, Control of Dogs Order and Wild Birds Protection Orders.  I hold that these duties, which were really legislative Orders passed before agricultural committees were set up, should now be given to agricultural committees, which are functioning in every county.</P>
    <P>There is another matter which has to do with education.  We do know that after a new council is formed, among the various subsidiary bodies set up is a vocational education body which has complete autonomy during <Col N="1589" /> the lifetime of the county council.  It comes before the council just once a year for the finances necessary but the council has no more to do with its work.  There are other educational bodies such as scholarship committees and I cannot see why scholarship schemes and so forth should not be administered by a vocational education body or a separate committee set up and that their reports would not have to be submitted afterwards to the county council.  I do know of many cases of injustice arising where recommendations made by a competent education committee because of the qualifications were set aside by a vote of the local body.  That should not be so.  If the vocational education machine works as well as it does I do not see why other branches of local education administration should not have a similar chance.  I think this measure is a good one.  It certainly will make for efficiency and, I hope for, what is equally important, economy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DominickMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>In so far as this Bill gives back to the elected representatives of the people more control in local matters, the Labour Party welcomes it.  I should say at the outset that I am not very well qualified to speak on this particular measure, but, as one who is free from the hurly-burly of local politics, perhaps I might give what I consider is one of the difficulties. Going around we hear references from local bodies to the fact that they have a good manager and from others that they have a terrible manager altogether.  It often seems to me that the tendency is to judge the system on the type of manager in a county or a city.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this measure we are concerned with the principle of managership as such and we are cutting down the emphasis on the managing and giving back more of the responsibility to the elected representatives.  That seems to me to be the main purpose of the measure, and I am rather puzzled then to hear references to the fact that various groups represented here have been converted to the idea of the city and county management system.  I think, quite frankly, that the greatest <Col N="1590" /> fault in the system is the fact that we refer to managers at all.  I think it is an unfortunate title which puts both the local authority and the person concerned, the manager, in a difficult position to start with.  I would rather see these people, now referred to as managers, given some different title, because they should not be managers. They should be, and I think they would want to be, the servants, the highest servants, of the local authority. Because of that, I feel that the title is unfortunate and I think it a pity that the opportunity was not availed of in this measure to change it altogether.</P>
    <P>However, the Bill as such is welcome in that it gives more control to the elected representatives, which, I think, is a very good thing.  I hope that the measure of control that has been given will encourage us to go further in the future.  I trust that this second experiment will work satisfactorily and that local representatives will accept and faithfully discharge their new responsibilities and that the managers&mdash;I hate the word&mdash;will accept the fact that they are and should be the servants and the handmaidens of the local authorities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LouisWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>It is in the interest of our social life that the State should encourage as far as possible the taking of an intelligent interest by people in local government affairs and should encourage them to serve on local government bodies.  In this Bill, there are a number of desirable provisions and these should clarify the rights of members of local authorities and encourage them to take a greater interest in the varied functions of local bodies and in the onerous responsibilities of members of local authorities themselves.  The work and the activities of local government bodies has increased enormously in recent years and the result is that few people are now anxious to stand as candidates at local elections.  One has only to note the enormous increase in the clerical staff of local authorities to realise the tremendous correspondence entailed by membership of these bodies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The managerial system apparently <Col N="1591" /> has now been accepted by all Parties and it is good to know that it is no longer a political or controversial issue in this country.  Recent legislation, and particularly the Health Acts and the Housing Acts, has imposed much additional work and has put this work on the shoulders of local bodies and it has resulted in an enormous expenditure for them.  It is only right therefore that whatever information is required by members of local authorities should be obtainable from the county manager.  Section 4 simplifies the procedure which was formerly set out in Section 29 of the 1940 Act and it is an improvement.  The section of this Bill concerning the procedure to be adopted in connection with receipt of tenders is somewhat similar to Section 28 of that 1940 Act which is now being repealed by this Bill.</P>
    <P>Estimates committees have been functioning for many years in many counties.  In some counties, they are called finance committees and they do not, of course, take responsibility for the preparing of estimates.  They simply deal with the estimates when they have been prepared by the heads of the different sections and approved by the county manager.  I do not think it is advisable or wise that the estimates committee should now be required to prepare these estimates. I feel that they can deal with them much more objectively, can get their teeth into them much better, with a considerable saving of time, if the estimates are presented, when completed and approved by the manager, who is the person who spends the money provided, to the estimates committee.</P>
    <P>As a typical example of how effective an estimates committee can be, the Minister probably knows that this year in my county the county manager's estimate amounted to a rate of 46/7 and, after three long meetings of the estimates committee, lasting all day, that figure was brought down to 41/-.  I do not think that state of affairs could have been brought about if the estimates committee were responsible for preparing the estimates, in the first instance. In that case, the estimates <Col N="1592" /> committee would become official-minded and obsessed with the importance of the various sections requiring the money, and, later on, when the estimates approved by the estimates committee came before the general body of the council, they would not be able to treat them as objectively as they would if they had not to prepare the estimates in the first instance.  I think, therefore, that the Minister should not ask them to prepare these estimates, nor should he ask them to provide a statement of the financial position of the council when they are asked to do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that it is permissive, but once the estimates committee is formed and the responsibility rests upon them in the first instance, they may not be anxious to disown the responsibility which has been cast upon them.  I think, therefore, that the present system is much more effective.  It is the one which is in being in so many councils, and has proved successful.  I cannot visualise any council where the estimates committee will function as suggested by the Minister in this Bill. I do not think there is any advantage whatsoever in asking the estimates committee to prepare an estimate.  To my mind, a much more useful committee would be the general purposes committee, and that type of committee was in the 1950 Bill.</P>
      <P>I have a good deal of experience of the general purposes committee in my county.  I happen to be chairman of that body, and it meets approximately two weeks before the county council meeting.  The meeting lasts all day, and the committee deals with housing, health, water and sewerage schemes and general policy.  There is a free discussion on all the heads of the different sections, and the Press is not present.  As a result of the exchange of views, the committee makes certain recommendations to the county council. If the Minister would consider permitting such a body to be incorporated in the present Bill I feel that it would be&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>That committee is elected by the county council, and can be re-elected each year.  That is one matter on which I do not agree, as far as the proposals to form an estimates committee under this Bill is concerned. I feel it would be desirable that the estimates committee should be re-elected each year.  In connection with the method of election of the estimates committee, I do not think that a council will get the best type of estimates committee by confining it to two members from each electoral area. Sometimes that may mean that a particular person who is very suitable for that committee may not be on it, and, furthermore, the number of elected representatives from each electoral area is not always the same.  For instance, in my county, there is one area which elects four members, and most of the other areas elect six members. That means, therefore, that the Milford area, for instance, which has four members, has two members on that estimates committee, and all the others have the same number. There is no provision that the chairman or the vice-chairman of the county council should be a member of the estimates committee.  The standing orders of most councils provide that the chairman and vice-chairman of each county council shall be automatically members of every sub-committee of that council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no provision either in the Bill to limit the expenditure of a council, over and above the amount provided for in the estimates, where a member brings in a motion to expend certain moneys which the county council is apparently entitled to do at any meeting.  For instance, a notice of motion does not set out the amount which shall be required, and it is only when the motion is discussed, and when the county engineer or the other official concerned states the amount at the meeting, that the members of the council discover for the first time what the passing of the motion will entail to the council in expenditure.  Sometimes <Col N="1594" /> these motions are brought in well on in the evening, when quite a number of members have left; the motion is passed, and most of the members have no knowledge of the supplementary amount passed by the council. That amount has not come before the estimates committee, in the first instance, or before the county council, until the actual motion is discussed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Exactly, there is no limit, and that is my trouble.  Personally, I think there should be a limit. Most people may not agree with me, but I personally think it is unfair that an estimates committee should work so hard preparing the estimates of the county council.  These are passed, and during the course of the year, the sky is the limit as far as these motions are concerned.  That means that there is a very big deficit at the end of the year.  I think there might be a limit of, say, 3d. or 4d., and if it exceeded that amount during the year, it should certainly be with the permission of the Minister.  Then the council would not be faced with such very serious deficits as at present come along.</P>
      <P>My principal objection to this Bill is Section 16.  I feel that the exercise of this privilege by the manager will, at times, deter the members of local authorities from passing a resolution, because they may be surcharged.</P>

Very often, the members of the council will be deterred from passing the resolution because of the fear most people have of involving themselves in a potential financial loss.

    <Speaker pid="DenisBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to express my gratitude to the Minister for introducing this Bill.  It has been long overdue.  We had amendments to the present County Management Acts foreshadowed in 1948 and again in 1950, but the present Minister is the only one who has been able to bring in an amending Bill.  It is a great step forward. I suppose it is only right to say that the manager believes in <i>via media.</i> The protagonists of the County Management Act of the &lsquo;30&rsquo;s said it was necessary to have it owing to the <Col N="1598" /> complexity of the functions that local authorities were expected to perform. Each year those functions are becoming more complex and more comprehensive. Senator O'Sullivan mentioned the expenditure in his county as being in the neighbourhood of £2,000,000.  I am a member of South Tipperary County Council&mdash;it happens to be only two-thirds of the county&mdash;and our estimate this year was in the neighbourhood of £1,300,000, for two-thirds of a county.  It is necessary to have a very competent higher executive officer to look after the day to day expenditure of that money and we could not expect any county council or any of its subcommittees to look after it.</P>
      <P>What I objected to principally in the last County Management Act was that there were many things which should be considered policy but in regard to which we were not allowed in any way to impose our views.  The effect was that the most responsible type of citizen would not let his name go forward as a public representative. Only last week I approached a very competent and able man to ask him to allow his name to stand for a local council and he said: &ldquo;Why should I waste my time in that sort of affairs?&rdquo; After long persuasion, telling him about the increase of powers and so on, he consented reluctantly to stand. He is a person who was acquainted with local authorities when they had power.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe that in this small State of ours it should be the desire of Government to let the people grow up, to let them develop.  I think it was Newman who defined a place of education as a place where people met and talked and where their latent talents were drawn out and exercised.  We should be able to get responsible businessmen, farmers, trade union officials and Labour representatives to run our public bodies in a responsible way, as adults having the sense of responsibility which God gave to them. They ought not to have to get permission to do the various things from the officials of the Department or from the Minister, or from anyone else for that matter.  If they make mistakes from time to time, and if the area which they represent is not so well <Col N="1599" /> governed locally as it should be, the people who elected them will soon wake up to that situation&mdash;and five years will not be long coming round again.  The common sense of the ordinary man and woman will change many of those representatives.  I am not a person who believes that we have not sufficient common sense to elect generally good and efficient public representatives.</P>
    <P>There is one matter which I want to ask the Minister about and which I think has been overlooked, possibly because the bodies concerned are not as important as the larger bodies, and that is the question of the borough councils and urban councils.  I believe that most of these councils were very efficiently run.  They usually had a competent town clerk who took an intense interest in local affairs and these councils were manned by local people who were interested in the rates and in seeing that their services were administered in such a way as to keep the town good and clean and efficient and progressive.  The County Management Act has put these urban districts under the control of the manager and the effect has been to bring big business methods into the small towns to the detriment of the towns.</P>
    <P>There has been talk in many cases of de-urbanisation and if this comes about you will have to get something like Muintir na Tíre and other voluntary bodies to run these places.  Formerly, these councils were run by elected representatives who volunteered to do the work but that has been destroyed by the imposition of State run management on the country towns of Ireland.  If the Minister cannot give consideration to the matter in this Bill he might consider it at a later stage.  There could be nothing more appalling than if we fail to interest our younger men in the proper running of our towns.  Such interest would help to keep them from emigrating to other countries because they would feel that they had a part in the towns and that the towns were worth living in.  The more centralisation we have from the top the more baneful and derogatory is the effect.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1600" /> The tendency under the present system of appointments to the position of town clerk does not help.  In many of the urban councils that I know the town clerk is now just an official who comes in and serves in that town for a short period.  Then, if he can prove to the Local Appointments Commissioners that he has been used to managing a municipal graveyard or a municipal waterworks in a town of 4,000 or 5,000 people, he is promoted to a town of 10,000 or 12,000 people and so he goes on.  Before the present system he was paid a salary which kept him in the town and which was adequate to keep him there but now the councils have to get permission from the Department to pay a salary which is not adequate to keep him.  I live in a town of 10,000 or 12,000 population and in the twenties we were in trouble there.  We got down from the City of Dublin a very competent young official and we paid him about 50 per cent. more than was the general run at the time, but we got a man who did very good service for many years and who only left us to become a county manager.  Local people ought to be encouraged to run their own affairs and to take a greater interest in them.</P>
    <P>To return to some of the things that are strictly in conformity with this Bill&mdash;according to Section 2 the manager will be required to inform the council of his intentions.  That is a very desirable provision because heretofore the chairman of the authority was the only one that need be brought into the full confidence of the manager. Section 3 provides that members of the local authority may require the manager to do any particular thing that can lawfully be done and for which money has been provided.  That is a very desirable matter because it makes the manager explain how he proposes to expend the money.  Section 4 provides that the manager shall now submit to the council his proposals to increase the number of officials employed or their salaries.  That is a matter which the Minister discussed with the county councils when he went on a tour of the country but there is one aspect of it which I would like to discuss.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1601" /> Would the Minister tell us if we have power to fix the hours at which our officials must attend their offices because I think that while we ought to have contented, well-paid responsible officials co-operating with our local authorities, we ought also to ensure that they are not well-paid for doing very little and that has been the tendency under the County Management Act.  In our county, the office hours are from 10 to 5 and the officials get all the bank holidays.  Some time ago some of our Church leaders spoke of the desirability of people changing from the bank holidays to the Church holidays.  That was with reference to manual workers but our non-manual workers were given the Church holidays as well as the bank holidays as the expense of the ratepayers.  I felt that it was a form of cynical hypocrisy to make the ratepayers pay for the Church holidays as well as the bank holidays.  None of us object to the office hours of from 10 to 5 and to long holidays which we feel they deserve but to give them the Church holidays and the bank holidays is too much.  Their condition ought to be parallel with conditions that are generally applied in the best type of clerical work in the districts&mdash;what trade unionists in any particular county town accept as the best conditions such as in solicitors' offices or other business offices of a similar type.  These ought to be the conditions that should apply in county council offices.</P>

      <P>The best employers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, the best employers but the county council ought not to start out to show that they are the best employers at somebody else's expense. A public authority is a business concern and we ought to encourage people to run these things on business lines. Any body that spends over £1,250,000 in a year, if not run on business lines, is bound to give rise to loss of public funds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are certain difficulties with regard to the committees.  Senator Walsh referred to some of them.  The Minister has suggested, in the case of county councils, that there should be two members from each county council <Col N="1602" /> electoral area.  That may not be the best provision to make.  I would feel inclined to suggest that he should substitute three for two.  What may happen is this.  You have, for example, a county council electoral area with seven or eight representatives.  It may be that only three of them are interested in financial matters.  You may have another county council electoral area with four representatives and none of them may be interested in financial matters, and yet you may have to take two from that electoral area.</P>
    <P>As regards urban councils, the large ones have 12 members and the smaller ones nine members.  If you have four members on a committee from the large urban councils and three from the smaller ones, that will provide a very ineffective committee. I would submit that three is hardly a committee at all.  It may happen that one member has to remain away for some reason or another and in that case you are left with a committee of two.  I would suggest to the Minister that he might make provision for a maximum of six in the case of these urban bodies.  I feel inclined to the view that was expressed by some Senator to-night that in the case of the smaller bodies we might have a committee of the whole house.</P>
    <P>I am a member of a corporation, and I remember that about five years ago we had great difficulty with regard to a very heavy demand that was presented to us by the manager.  I think that we met on three nights a week over a period of four or five weeks.  It was a committee of the whose house, and each member had a great deal to contribute to the question before it. No member felt that he was being left out in the cold.  The average attendance at our meetings was about nine. It was not too large, but it was certainly adequate to give expression to the feelings of a cross-section of the people in the large town of which they were public representatives.</P>
    <P>I notice that provision has been made allowing us in Tipperary to have a county manager and an assistant county manager, or to have a manager for the county council in North Tipperary and a manager for the <Col N="1603" /> county council in South Tipperary, if we should like that.</P>
    <P>There is one thing which has struck me with regard to local appointments. I think that only once did I hear of a businessman or a farmer being asked to be a member of the panel which selects people for local appointments.  I would hate to think that there is no farmer in Kickham's county good enough to sit on a board with civil servants to pick a person to be a county manager.  I once met a businessman in the City of Dublin who was on one of these boards, but I have never met anybody else.  After all, farmers and businessmen have to keep their feet on the ground and face the solution of practical problems.  If they fail to do that they just go out of business.  They are not in the position, if things are not going well with them, of being able to increase rates to balance their domestic budgets.</P>
    <P>While I say that, I want to stress the point that I have nothing but praise for our civil servants.  I think that in the Civil Service you have one of the finest bodies in the world.  A man who came from America in connection with E.C.A. some years ago stayed with me for a few days.  One of the things he said to me was that our Civil Service in Ireland was composed of the finest public servants in the world.  If we are going to have civil servants forming these boards we ought, I suggest, see to it that people who see things from the other side are also represented on the board.  That is important from the point of view of the sort of manager that we are going to get under the Bill. If all businessmen or all farmers or all trade union officials or all civil servants were to be the people who were going to be put on these boards, then I think you would not get the right type of person to fill these positions.  My suggestion is that if you mix the boards with different types of people, people of common sense and ability, you will have a better board and will get better officials.</P>
    <P>I do not think I have anything more to say on this stage of the Bill.  I repeat what I said at the opening that I think it represents a desirable step <Col N="1604" /> forward.  This Bill is going to give back a great deal of powers, particularly power to form policy which local bodies had formerly.  That, in my opinion, should in the long run provide us with a better type of public representative, and consequently with better county councils.  These county councils will work better and co-operate better with the officials who will be charged with the duty of putting into effect the policy which the council decides upon.</P>

      <P>I think it was in 1929 that the managerial system was first introduced here.  It was introduced as an experiment, first in the appointment of a manager for Cork City.  It was later extended to the Dublin Corporation. If we examine the whole gamut of local government in the intervening years, I think we must be satisfied that great progress has been made. Every Act which is passed by the Oireachtas means additional responsibility for the members of local authorities.  It was found about 1940 that it was not a practical proposition for elected representatives meeting once a month or once a fortnight to discharge all the duties that were being imposed on them in their capacity as public representatives, duties which derived from legislation passed by the Oireachtas.  Therefore, it was found that no longer could those people discharge these functions in a manner that would be in the best interest of the whole country and it was decided that the managerial system should be extended to the whole country.  I think it was in 1940 we had a Bill before us here making provision for the extension of that service.  We had many members of local authorities standing up in this and the other House and putting before us many reasons why that Bill should get the approval of the Oireachtas.  However that might be, the majority in this and the other House agreed that in the best interests of local government the managerial system should be accepted.  It was put into operation on the eve of a general election in regard to local authorities.  We may have our views as to whether that was the right procedure or not, but the facts were that <Col N="1605" /> the members of Dáil Éireann and of this House accepted the view that this system should be put into operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the intervening period we had many criticisms of the system.  We had suggestions made by various parties that if they received the confidence of the people they would undo this great injustice and give back to the people&mdash;and by the people they meant their local representatives&mdash;the responsibilities and the authority that they exercised before.  I have been a member of this House for quite a long time.  I remember when the first inter-Party Government was elected we had a Bill before us in 1948 introduced by the then Minister for Local Government to postpone the local elections and to make provision that the only local elections held would be those in County Kerry and County Dublin.  My memory may not be serving me as well as I would like it to do, but I think those were the provisions of the particular Bill.  He sat in the chair which the Minister for Local Government now occupies and asked this House to accept the measure he then proposed on one particular ground&mdash;that he was not prepared to allow the local elections to be held and suggested that they should be postponed to 1950 in order to give him and his officials an opportunity of considering a very major and important matter, which was no less than the functions of the county managers.  This House gave him permission to postpone those local elections from 1948 so that we should have the provisions of a Bill which his Party might accept.  I have before me a copy of that particular Bill.  I do not wish at this stage to detain the House by going over all the things that have happened in the intervening years, but it is an extraordinary thing that we were asked in 1948 to deprive the people of an opportunity to which they were entitled of electing their local representatives, and we were asked to do that and by a majority gave consent to that suggestion.  We gave consent because a proposal was put before us that there was going to be presented to us in the very near future a Local Government Bill which would hand back to the members of the local bodies many of the functions they formerly <Col N="1606" /> exercised.  In accordance with that pledge given by the late Deputy Murphy, then Minister for Local Government, we had introduced here the Local Government (County Administration) Bill, 1950.</P>
    <P>I would particularly ask the members of the Labour Party who have gone up and down the country and criticised the implementation of the managerial system to explain to us how they can reconcile their attitude now with their attitude then.  I will admit, and it is only fair that somebody should admit, that the only difference in the Bill asking us to hold over the local elections of 1948 to 1950 was that we were going to change the title of the manager to county executive officer.  I do not think myself that that was worth while, but, however, that was the position at the time.  Since then we have had statements made by very responsible people.  We have a statement made by no less a person than the person who at one time held and now does hold one of the most responsible positions in this country, a person who was formerly Minister for Finance, that they proposed to decentralise, and by decentralisation he meant handing back to the local authorities powers of which they were deprived by these terrible monsters of Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made&mdash;by, I think, Senator Murphy&mdash;to the Appointments Commission.  I have said in this House before that, while I was not a member of the Party who introduced this measure, I would say without fear of contradiction that I was one of the very few persons who did so much to maintain that system when it was challenged in no uncertain way, even in my own native town.  I did that, because I was convinced that, if we were to give effect to the policy in which we believed, a policy of giving equal opportunities to all our people, which meant that there was going to be no influence, no hereditary claim to any particular position, it was necessary to do so.</P>
    <P>Now we come to the managerial system.  I think it was 1940 when the then Minister for Local Government introduced the Bill.  There were then, naturally, qualms of conscience; there <Col N="1607" /> were then suggestions that if there was not going to be influence from the political point of view, there might be influence from some other point of view, in regard to the activities of the persons occupying the positions of county managers.  We have gone a long way along the road to overcoming these suggestions.  It is possible, because we are a very small country and because the manager is entitled, just as any member of the Seanad is entitled, to enjoy social activities and social contacts, that there may be suggestions that the manager might be influenced by these social contacts-whether they are made in the local golf club or any other club&mdash;and that, when it comes to the making of an appointment, these are the things that weigh with him.</P>
    <P>It was a big thing to try to get over, as it were, on the people, but again I say without fear of contradiction that if the issue were put before the people to-morrow morning by means of a plebicite or in an election, as to whether they would maintain the present system of having a manager in charge of the direction of county affairs, or whether they would revert to the old system, they would vote overwhelmingly in favour of the present system.  That is a personal view, but it is a view that has been sustained and approved of by the introduction of this Bill.</P>
    <P>In this Bill, there is no fundamental change; there are no new powers given to local authorities; and there is no giving back of the things Fianna Fáil deprived them of.  If we examine the provisions of the Bill what do we find? We find that the only feature in the Bill is Section 4 which provides that the members of a county council may requisition the manager to do certain things.  We were informed here, and we accepted it at the time, and I think the whole country accepted it, that when we agreed to the principle of a county manager, we should look upon him and the elected representatives should look upon him as a manager elected by a board of directors.  Can the Minister or any other responsible person convince me that, where you <Col N="1608" /> have a board of directors and where you have a manager directing their affairs and where they decide that such and such should be their policy, the manager must not immediately act in accordance with their direction?  That was the fundamental principle on which the managerial system was passed through the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. P. O'Donnell Mr. P. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Donnell</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrederickHawkins" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister may say that these things have not been observed.  I agree, but we must understand the circumstances in which this system was introduced.  It was introduced as something that might, if you like, be tested out, by the appointment of the county secretary. I have my own views on whether that was the right approach or not, but the county secretary was appointed as the manager.  A lot could be said in favour of the appointment of the county secretary, because he was the man who had very intimate contact with members of the county council and the person on whom the whole direction and procedure devolved over the years.  The Oireachtas accepted it that he was the person who should be appointed as county manager, and he was appointed.</P>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister one or two very pertinent questions in relation to the operation of the managerial system.  I have made a very close study of the administration of this legislation and I have, as yet, failed to trace any case in which a manager who exercised the shrewdness that should be exercised by a person in his responsible position, who took his board of directors, as it were, into his confidence and said to them: &ldquo;These are the proposals I wish to put into operation&rdquo;, has not got 100 authority in all cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have attended as many meetings as anybody else in this House and have heard as much criticism of the implementation of this Act.  Maybe the manager came up against a question, and he sat back and said: &ldquo;This is an executive function, and you have no power to interfere in it, because it is <Col N="1609" /> put upon me by Parliament.&rdquo;  You had a person of that kind asserting his authority and there were very few to challenge it.  I would say that, by the experience gained in the administration of this Act, they will be fewer in future.</P>
    <P>Let us now come to the Bill before us.  I am one of those who have a total disregard for going back over something which people said last year or the year before.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrederickHawkins" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>But having that sense of approach in these matters, I cannot understand how the Minister can get up and read from his brief the introductory speech we heard this evening, and try to suggest to us that this Bill will give back to the members of local authorities something for which they yearn and are glad to get.</P>
      <P>Let us examine the Bill.  Let us see what it gives back, or what the Minister suggests it gives back.  I should like, before proceeding to discuss this matter, to say, as a member of a trade union, that I would never like to feel that, in a discussion in this House, I would go too far away from what their views are, or, to my mind, should have been.</P>
      <P>In 1948, the first inter-Party Government was formed.  I would ask the members of the Labour Party to read over a statement issued by no less a person than Deputy Everett, who is now the Minister for Justice.  Deputy Everett, in his excuse to join the then Coalition Government, put forward, as one of his principal reasons, that he had got a guarantee from that Government, and would use his influence in directing their policy, and that one of their first acts would be a reversion to the days in which the local authorities had the powers they had prior to the introduction of the managerial system.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrederickHawkins" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>I will get to that if the Minister waits.  I am in no hurry <Col N="1610" /> whatsoever.  I had got to the stage at which the first inter-Party Government was formed in 1948, when we then had, as I said, this proposal for a new Bill. We had the suggestion by the then Minister that he was giving his support to that Government in order that the local authorities should get back the powers they formerly had.  It is true, of course, and I am glad that the present Minister has reminded me, that in the new set-up there was no such guarantee, and no such statement made.  Why, I do not know, except that possibly a reasonable explanation would be their anxiety for office.  Be that as it may, we have before us this Bill.  To the Minister's own county, that historic county of Donegal, no less a person than the Attorney-General, who was the former Minister for Finance, went and made a very definite and emphatic statement that it was time that there should be decentralisation. Decentralisation, in his mind, meant that we should give back to the local authorities the powers of which they were deprived by the nasty Fianna Fáil Government.</P>

If there is an answer to that question, Senator Hayes may be in a better position to answer it than the Minister. Therefore, I do not wish to press the Minister for an answer, because it was at that time a very political question. I am prepared to go on and on, and examine the whole period from 1922 to 1955.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrederickHawkins" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>I would say to the Minister: do not induce me to do so. If the Minister wants a very clear and definite statement as to why the county managerial system, or the then city managerial system, was introduced in <Col N="1611" /> Cork City, I will leave that to another day.  I think that Senator Hayes would agree that this is the better way.</P>
      <P>To get back to the Bill, what powers does the present Bill give back to the local authorities?  The Minister, in his statement, referred to Section 4.  I am prepared to accept that this is a very laudable section.  The Minister may say that this gives back certain powers to the local authorities.  I may be prepared to agree with him in so far as Section 4 is concerned, but when we come to Section 16 we find that an officer of a local authority may come in before a meeting of a local authority and say to the members: &ldquo;The proposals which you have put before me now are illegal, and, if they are implemented, will cause a deficiency in the funds.  Therefore, I warn you now that if you proceed with this resolution each and every one of you may be surcharged by the auditor.&rdquo;  Where is the freedom given to them in this Bill?  We have the Minister proposing in one section to give them power to requisition certain things to be done and in another section we find that an officer&mdash;the county engineer, the medical officer of health or someone else-can come in to the meeting and say: &ldquo;If you proceed with this resolution you may be surcharged for the amount of money involved.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>There is no giving back of powers in either Section 4 or Section 16.  In Section 16 we are transferring the responsibility from the officers to the elected representatives.  Prior to this, it was the responsibility of the officer who was charged with making a particular payment and who would be surcharged by the auditor if such was found to be illegal.  Now we are removing that responsibility from him. The Minister&mdash;and any Senator here who is a member of a local authority&mdash; will agree with me that if there is a suggestion to do a particular type of work and if the county engineer or other responsible officer says: &ldquo;That is all right, boys, you go ahead with the work, but you are liable to be surcharged&rdquo;, the members who were very ardent in supporting the proposal will probably reconsider their approach.</P>

It is not that; it is a case of something in which the majority of the members would agree amongst themselves, no matter what Party they represent, it is important that they should do, and then finding a clause inserted here that some officer can come in and say: &ldquo;You cannot do that because I have already allocated the money&rdquo; or &ldquo;I have already spent the money on other schemes.&rdquo;  Whether or not it is a question of allocation or of expenditure, I hold that those representatives&mdash;who are elected by the local people and who <Col N="1613" /> must in the last analysis go back to those people&mdash;should be charged with the responsibility as to whether it was illegal or not, whether it was a right act to perform or not, and whether the expenditure was justified or not.</P>
      <P>I object&mdash;and whether I am the only person here or not who will object, I will object as long as I possibly can&mdash; to the suggestion that any officer&mdash; whether he is a county surveyor, a county medical officer, an assistant surveyor or someone else&mdash;can come in and intimidate the elected representatives and coerce them into the belief that, because their proposal will involve an expenditure that is not in his mind justified, and will cause a deficiency in the funds&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I take up this interruption because the appointment of rate collectors was deliberately left to the local authorities.  The Minister has told us that he visited every county council in the country and heard their views and that their views were that the appointment of rate collectors should be left to the members of county councils.  These people decided this because they believed that the person appointed locally by the county council was the person who was going to have the co-operation in his particular area to make his collection the best that could be made.</P>

It is because of that majority that we were able to appoint these rate collectors.  We make no apology for it.  If there was a question in Westmeath, I am quite sure that Senator L'Estrange would not go into the Lobby to vote with Joe Kennedy.  What is wrong in a majority Party on a county council appointing rate collectors?  Is there anything wrong in it any more than a Government appointing judges?  If we want to remove these things from political patronage I am prepared to support a motion to that effect in this House provided it is going to involve the removal of every political appointment from Government patronage from the rate collector to the High Court judge.</P>
