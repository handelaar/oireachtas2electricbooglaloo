      <P>The Social Welfare (Temporary Provisions) Bill, 1955, which is now before the Seanad will provide an extra week's payment of pension or benefit in the week before Christmas to all recipients of old age and blind pensions, widows' non-contributory pensions and long-term disability benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As was stated by the Tánaiste in the Dáil on 26th October last, the Government are anxious to give some help towards meeting the increase in the cost of tea to the classes covered by this Bill.  The people concerned are the most deserving in the community of help.  Their income leaves little or no margin for meeting the higher cost of what to them is a necessary of life. It is proposed, accordingly, to make them an additional payment in one sum <Col N="730" /> of an amount approximately equal to the increase in price of tea for one year.</P>
    <P>Those who will benefit number 219,000.  Of these, 208,000 or 95 per cent. will get the maximum weekly rate of pension or benefit, as the case may be.  In the case of disability benefit, this will amount to 36/-, where the recipient is a married man.</P>
    <P>It is not proposed to double the pension or benefit where persons are resident outside the State, and only one extra payment will be made to a person, such as a blind pensioner, who is also in receipt of long-term disability benefit.</P>
    <P>It is hoped to make all the payments in the week prior to Christmas.  The time has been short in which to make the necessary arrangements, which include the passing into law of this Bill. It has accordingly been necessary to ask the Seanad to deal specially with this Bill to-day and to pass it through all stages, if possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrederickHawkins" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>I particularly welcome the principle enshrined in this Bill.  I think it is a principle we can all accept, that is, that we should give some consideration to those people in receipt of State pensions, particularly at the season of Christmas.  It has been an accepted practice over quite a number of years by very many employers&mdash;I could safely say by the majority of employers&mdash;to give a double payment at Christmas to their employees.  It has also been the practice for all charitable organisations to do likewise.  Therefore, as I said at the outset, I agree with the principle.</P>
      <P>I am in total disagreement on four grounds with the reasons put forward by the Minister for the introduction of these proposals.  In the first place, the proposals before us to-day are made as a suggestion to compensate persons in receipt of old age pensions, blind pensions and non-contributory widows' and orphans' pensions for the increased price of tea.  I think that is not a very justifiable reason and is one to which we should not give our approval.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last January, the Government, as it were, took a gamble.  They gambled <Col N="731" /> on maintaining the then existing price of tea and made an arrangement with Tea Importers, Limited, that the banks would provide accommodation to enable the quantity of tea required to be sold at the then existing prices. When the announcement was made in January last, the Labour Party, in particular, claimed great credit for having maintained the price of tea.</P>
    <P>Later on, an invitation was issued. I think it is a good thing that we should make as many contacts as we possibly can, particularly when these contacts are with the heads of foreign countries.  As I say, an invitation was issued to the Premier of Ceylon who was a guest of the Taoiseach.  He made a statement which was utilised to bolster up the gamble that was being made.  That gamble turned out to involve the country in no less a sum than £1,500,000.</P>
    <P>We now have, as a result of questions and answers given in Dáil Éireann, the information that the maintenance of the tea price over the 12 months results in consumers having to pay no less than 3d. per lb., not on the original price of tea, but on the price paid to the bankers, as interest on the moneys advanced.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce made the announcement in Dáil Éireann that it was proposed to allow tea to find its own level and that tea prices would be increased by 2/- per lb.  Members of this House&mdash;there are a few members in the House who are engaged in this particular business&mdash; will agree with me that no wholesaler or retailer of tea at the present time can sell the tea.  The sum of 2/- was just one of these things that was mentioned in order to minimise the position.  Tea has been increased all round by no less sum than 2/6 per lb.</P>
    <P>The Minister made another very enlightening remark in the introductory statement, to the effect that the consumption of tea in general was something about 2 oz. per head.  Of course, that related to the time when tea was rationed.  He suggested that he proposed to bring in a Bill in order to compensate the old age pensioners, the blind pensioners and those other <Col N="732" /> sections of the community, and that is the Bill we have now before us.</P>
    <P>If we examine the Bill, we find it does not even do exactly what the Minister promised to do on that occasion.  It makes provision to give a number of those people in receipt of various allowances an additional allowance on 23rd December, but we still have the very obnoxious means test we heard so much about in recent years.  A person in receipt of 6/- or 9/- per week old age pension will not receive the compensation of 6d. per week which the Minister promised in order to compensate him for the increase in the price of tea.</P>
    <P>This whole matter poses another very pertinent question.  How did the Government come to the decision, and how did the members of the Labour Party in the Government accept it as a reasonable one, that of all the commodities which have increased in price during the past 12 months, only one commodity should be provided for in the case of those in receipt of the various pensions to which this Bill applies?  Mind you, it does not provide for a very large section of the people who are in receipt of allowances from the State.  We will get to that later on. The first question is how did the Government come to the decision that it was only in relation to this one particular item that we must compensate the old age pensioner?  Was it not an acknowledgment of the bungling and the gambling that took place in this whole business?</P>
    <P>It was a gamble, no doubt.  It might have turned out otherwise.  It might have been that the price of tea in the general market might have been reduced, and, as a result of that reduction, tea consumers in this country would have been put into the position that they would be compelled to accept tea of an inferior quality over a number of years so that the Minister's loss in this particular gamble might be made good to Tea Importers, Limited. No matter what way we take it, whether you are on the swings or the roundabouts, you cannot lose.  That was the gamble taken, and that is the gamble for which we are asked to pass this Bill, so as first to pacify the members of the Labour Party and then to <Col N="733" /> suggest to those people in receipt of old age pensions and others that we are conferring on them a great benefit.</P>
    <P>There is no benefit being conferred on these people.  If we want to compensate them for the increase in the cost of living that affects them just as every other section of the community, we should live up to our responsibilities. I do not want to delay the passing of this Bill for one moment, but let us take just one meal.  Let us take the old age pensioner's breakfast. I am sure that, as a member of the Labour Party and as Minister, the Minister will agree with me that the old age pensioner who is capable of eating a rasher in the morning is entitled to that.  What do we find?  Over the past 12 months, that one item in the old age pensioner's breakfast costs him no less than 8d. or 1/- a lb. more.  He may like a sausage of any variety.  We find that those sausages are going to cost him from 6d. to 8d. a lb. more.  He may like jam or marmalade, or he may be one of those people who would like just a plate of porridge in the morning.  That plate of porridge will cost him 2d. each morning more than it did 12 months ago.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonKissane" hpid="Mr. Kissane Mr. Kissane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kissane</NameTxt>
      <P>What about the egg?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrederickHawkins" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>That is another question, which will be dealt with later on. The pensioner may be one of those people whose health does not allow them to take any of these things, but he may like a biscuit or some light confectionery.  The little biscuit the pensioner may have with his cup of tea at 12 o'clock, or in the morning, is now 8d. a lb. more than this time 12 months ago.  Confectionery is just the same.  In that particular line, the increase has been brought about, not because of any outside influence, not because of something that was beyond Government control, but definitely by Government action in removing the subsidy from the flour that was used in the baking of those biscuits and confectionery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Why, if we are going to do justice to these people, do we not take all these things into consideration?  If the old age pensioner lives in Cabra <Col N="734" /> or elsewhere, he has to take a bus to the local post office to collect this increase in his pension, but for that he has to pay an extra charge.  Is there provision made in this Bill for that? I can safely say that no member of this House can contradict me when I state that, in respect of any one of the items I have mentioned, the provision we are making here now would not be sufficient to cover it, whether it is biscuits, confectionery, sausages, rashers, tea or anything else put before those people at just one meal.</P>
    <P>I have another very serious objection to these proposals, that they do not cater for quite a number of people who are relying, as it were, on State allowances.  I should like to have from the Minister the reasons why this Bill does not apply to persons in receipt of national health insurance.  Surely the House will agree that the head of the family who is laid off sick, undergoing medical treatment, should be aided just as generously as the persons to whose aid we are coming, who, because of their means and because they do not qualify under existing regulations for the full pension, are being assisted by the halfpenny or three halfpence we are providing for in this Bill.  Surely a man who is unemployed through no fault of his own and drawing unemployment insurance is entitled to some compensation, if we must compensate for the bungling and gambling that has gone on over the past 12 months in this particular field.  There are persons in receipt of disability allowances, and those disability allowances are being given after the most careful consideration and gruelling inquiries into the circumstances.  Surely those persons are entitled to some consideration, if we are in the mood to give consideration of that kind to anybody. I should like to have the Minister's views on these points.</P>
    <P>There is another question.  The decision to maintain the price of tea at its then level was taken last January.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, might I at this stage point out that, while, as a member of the Government, I may have responsibility for the increase in the price of tea, I have none as Minister here in the Seanad?</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrederickHawkins" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>The interjection of the Minister is, of course, very appropriate. It is one that I would expect, and it is just one of those other indications as to how the wind is blowing.  After all, as I have already stated, when the decision was made to maintain the price, we all put out our chests, particularly those of us who were in the Labour Party.  We all accepted that we were going to get the credit for this very magnificent job that was being done; but now that the piper has to be paid, we do not like it.  I have every sympathy with the Minister when he states in this House: &ldquo;I am not responsible.  I am prepared to wash my hands of this&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I am trying to point out that I am not here as Minister for Social Welfare, talking about the price of tea or how it occurred.  I am here in connection with a Bill which deals with how compensation is to be given to certain people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kissane</NameTxt>

      <P>Nothing about tea in the Bill, but there is going to be a whole lot about tea before we are finished with the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce stated very emphatically in Dáil Éireann that he was going to introduce, or have introduced, a measure to compensate those people who are to be compensated under this particular Bill because of the increased price of tea. You cannot disassociate the price of <Col N="736" /> tea from this Bill, because the Minister himself in introducing the Bill, gave as his reason that it was an attempt, or it was proposed, to compensate those people in receipt of old age pensions, blind pensions, and non-contributory widows' and orphans' pensions, for the increased price of tea, and no other reason.  I am trying to put it to the House that if we want to be fair to these people, we should make provision for compensating them at least for every increase that has resulted from Government action.</P>

      <P>Which Government? Would that apply to the subsidies removed by the Fianna Fáil Government?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrederickHawkins" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Senator wants to take me down the avenue and talk about subsidies, I am prepared to take the open road on it and do so, but that is not the proposal before us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that not the whole question&mdash;how open is the road?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrederickHawkins" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not the proposal before us.  The proposal before us is to make compensation to the persons in receipt of old age pensions, blind pensions, and widows' and orphans' non-contributory pensions because of the increased price of tea resulting from what happened from 1st January, 1955, to 1st November, 1955, and we are here to-day called together specially to consider this Bill. Notwithstanding the fact that the announcement made about maintaining the price of tea was to the effect that the price would be maintained to 1st September, no action was taken to fulfil that.  I have no doubt at all, and am prepared to admit even here in this House, that the Minister for Industry and Commerce must have fought very hard in the Cabinet to maintain the credit that the Labour Party took for the maintenance of the price.  He must have fought very hard indeed to ensure that tea would be maintained at that price, but he lost the fight, so some carrot had to be held out and the carrot held out for the Labour support in the Dáil and in this House is this Bill, under which we are in some small way compensating <Col N="737" /> the weaker section of our people because of the increased price of tea.</P>
      <P>I would be in thorough agreement if the Minister came before us and said honestly: &ldquo;We are responsible for the increased price of tea.  Therefore, we are prepared to compensate as far as the nation can out of our national finances the weaker sections of our community.&rdquo;  I suggest to the Minister and the House that the same approach should be taken in relation to bacon because of the bungling of both the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Minister for Agriculture. We have prices controlled, prices established one day, the retailer controlled one day, the wholesaler left a free market, the curer left a free market, and so on.  We have also the position in relation to the withdrawal of the subsidy on flour for the confectionery and biscuit manufacturers.</P>
      <P>I disagree with this Bill for another reason.  It is a very bad precedent to establish in this Parliament, that any Government can bring forward a Bill of this kind to pay a supplementary allowance to any one section of our people.  I am not saying that precedent is being utilised at the moment, although the whole fit-up has some relation to a particular event that is taking place very far removed from this House at the present time.  I leave it to the intelligence of the members to figure out for themselves what I am referring to now.  You could have a precedent initiated now whereby a Government, on the eve of a general election or on the eve of a decision on any important question put to the people, would use what is done here now as a justification for what they might do then.  That is why I say this a very bad precedent.</P>
      <P>It is a very difficult job to make provision for a supplementary payment of this kind.  What provision has been made up to the present?  How is the allowance to be paid?  Will it entail the issuing of a new book or a new document to each pensioner?  The post office authorities who are charged with the payment of old age pensions must be authorised; how will that authorisation be given to them?  That is a very important aspect of the question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="738" /> I agree with the principle, but I do not agree with the purpose for which the Bill has been introduced.  I do not agree with the provision in it because it is not wide enough.  I am sure that the Minister and members of the Labour Party here will agree with me that provision should be made also for those who have paid contributions to national health insurance and unemployment insurance and who are now undergoing medical treatment, or who are unemployed.  There must also be considered those in receipt of disability pensions and I.R.A. pensions. To all of this vast number of people, the State has an obligation, just as it has to the small group we are catering for to-day.  Unless the Parliamentary Secretary gives some reason for excluding those persons, I must take steps to have the matter rectified on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanRuane" hpid="Mr. S.T. Ruane Mr. S.T. Ruane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S.T. Ruane</NameTxt>
      <P>Unlike the last speaker, I welcome the Bill and congratulate the Minister on its introduction. According to Senator Hawkins, no benefit is conferred by it on those whom it is intended to benefit.  He will find it difficult to convince those who will draw, a few days before Christmas, double the amount they usually get in old age pensions.  He takes the Minister and the Government to task because they have concentrated on tea alone.  Of course, it is pretty evident to everyone that they have done so. Tea is not a native product.  I agree with Senator Hawkins that the old age pensioner would like a rasher for breakfast, that he could enjoy a sirloin for lunch and that he could do with cutlets for tea.  How would he bring that about?  Does he wish the Government to subsidise the production of pigs, cattle and sheep; and, if so, how is it to be done?  There is only one way of bringing down the cost of commodities, essential articles of food produced in this country, and that is by lowering the price paid to those who produce them.  I do not think any speaker on the other side would stand for that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In so far as this double payment at Christmas is concerned, it is not the only action of the present Government to benefit the most deserving section <Col N="739" /> of the community.  Last June&mdash;within the memory of everyone&mdash;the equivalent of £1,250,000 was voted to increase old age pensions.  The £250,000 that will be voted as a result of this Bill, brings the contribution of the present Government to that section of the community up to £1,500,000.  That is not a bad gesture from a Government that is accused of being indifferent to the wants of the most deserving section of the people.  I find that there are 165,923 old age pensioners.  Of that number, over 158,000 will draw the full amount, 24/6, twice over; over 2,000 will draw 19/- and an increase of 19/-; over 2,000 more will draw an increase of 14/-; and the balance will draw an increase of 9/-, that is, double the amount at present being paid.  I am sure this Bill will be welcomed by every section of the people as an excellent act of the present Government.</P>
    <P>When I listen to arguments of the Opposition who try to make very little of this gesture, my mind goes back to advice given to me by an old parliamentarian some time ago: &ldquo;If ever you want to gauge the standard of improvement in any measure introduced by an inter-Party Government, all you have to do is read the speeches of the Opposition and the more vehement they are in denouncing it, the more sure you can be that it is a very effective measure.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We can go back to the start and we find that is so.  It is a rather drastic standard to judge Opposition speeches by, but it is the only standard we can go by in the Opposition approach to this measure.  I congratulate the Minister on introducing the Bill.  He has conferred a deserved benefit on the most deserving section of the community and he will be thanked for it in the way that such people can thank him whenever the opportunity comes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to underline a point made by Senator Hawkins. While this Bill will be accepted by the House as some relief to the poorer sections of the community, it will be accepted by all that it is very inadequate relief.  It does not comply with the promise made of 6d. a week increase in the old age pension.  As far <Col N="740" /> as I can make out, it will range from 5½d. per week downwards possibly to 2½d.  That is very poor recompense to that poor section of the people.</P>
      <P>Senator Ruane talked about people on this side being vehement in opposition to this Bill.  There is no opposition whatever to it, but there is criticism of its inadequacy.  There is also the criticism that was expressed by Senator Hawkins, that it is not a desirable thing to introduce a measure which confers financial benefit on a section of the community for one week and one week only.  A precedent is thereby established by which a Government, on the eve of an election or by-election, could spend a considerable amount in that way.  As part of the national revenue, it may be a comparatively very small sum, but it may be spread over a lot of people for only one day in the year.  That precedent is being set up now.  It was adopted in regard to the Civil Service when a temporary provision of this kind was made which enabled £1,000,000 to be spread over a large section of the community.  Here we have £250,000 being spread over an even larger section.</P>
      <P>It would be far better if the principle were accepted that it is desirable to give some bonus to the poorer sections of the community at Christmas time, as is done by some good employers.  I think it should be a permanent measure and that this Bill, instead of being for one week only this Christmas, should be for Christmas week in all coming years.</P>
      <P>In addition to that&mdash;I am expressing a personal opinion now&mdash;I have often felt that in some way or another, pensions and allowances of the poorer sections of the community should be related to the cost of living, by means of a cost-of-living bonus which would rise or fall, according to the changes in the cost of living.  That would be desirable because the increases in the cost of living which have taken place over the last year have placed a severe burden upon the people in the lower income groups.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The principle of providing one payment, and one payment only of this kind, spreading it over a large number, is one that would lead to very bad <Col N="741" /> results, if followed by future Governments. I would ask the Minister to indicate that, while this Bill is of a very temporary nature and relates only to one week's payment, the Government intends to make this measure permanent and to double the pensions in respect of Christmas week in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamStanford" hpid="Professor Stanford Professor Stanford">
      <NameTxt>Professor Stanford</NameTxt>
      <P>I would congratulate the Minister on one small point in the Bill.  Perhaps he is not directly responsible for it.  I refer to the improved type in the rubrics of this Bill.  It is the first time I have seen it used in the rubrics and I am sure we are grateful to him as Senators.  The work of legislators should be eased in every way by those who prepare Bills. This is an example of thoughtfulness by those who prepared this Bill and I congratulate the Minister on that point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I stated by way of interjection&mdash;I hope it will not be regarded as an interruption&mdash;that whilst, as a member of the Government, I have to accept and take full responsibility for the increase in the price of tea, as Minister for Social Welfare dealing with this Bill, I did not think it was proper to talk about the actual price of tea or how the price occurred.  That is the only point I wanted to make then and I did not intend it to be an interruption of Senator Hawkins's speech.  The fact is that the tea price has increased by approximately 2/-. What amuses me is that one Fianna Fáil Senator or, I might say, one Fianna Fáil public representative, tries to outdo the other when talking about the increase in the price of tea. Various increases were suggested in this House and in the other House. One Fianna Fáil man started off with 2/2 and I think that to-day we have got up to about 2/8.  If my information is correct, it may not be 2/- per lb. but I am not the best judge of that, any more than is Senator Hawkins the best judge about the 2/8.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been reckoned that the increase will be approximately 2/- and not on the actual amount given by way of ration during the emergency when the average consumption <Col N="742" /> per individual was determined at 2¼ oz.  That is the latest and most up-to-date figure.  It was thought, in respect of old age pensioners, blind pensioners, widows and orphans and all those catered for in this Bill, that the average weekly consumption would be higher.  The compensation was, therefore, arrived at on the basis that they would consume approximately 4 oz. and that the increase in the price of tea would mean to them an additional 6d. per week, approximately.  That is how the actual amount was arrived at.</P>
    <P>I do not think the Tánaiste was guilty of breaking a promise, or that the Government were either, in the light of what the Tánaiste said in the Dáil.  He did not promise 6d. per week.  I do not think any Senator can produce any information from the Dáil debates to show that he promised an actual 6d. per week.  Here is a quotation from the Tánaiste's speech in the Dáil on the 26th October last, as reported at columns 75 and 76 of the Official Report:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Government have been most anxious to see, therefore, what could be done, as evidence of their goodwill, of their sympathetic understanding of the difficulties of these people, as evidence of their desire to help them, to shelter them from the impact of this increase in the tea prices and they have decided that it will give to these persons, that is, to old age pensioners, widows, blind persons and long duration disability benefit recipients, a compensatory payment of their basic allowance in one single payment which will offset the additional cash cost in one year of the increased price of tea....&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is exactly what this particular Bill is doing.  I am glad that Senator Hawkins and some of his colleagues are concerned about the old age pensioners because it did not seem evident in recent years that they were.  The record of this Government in respect of the people catered for in this Bill is second to none and, in that, I include all Governments since the establishment of this State in 1922.  Nobody can point to a time when so much was given by way of increase to old age <Col N="743" /> pensioners as has been given this year. An additional 2/6 per week was given to them, plus other classes, in July, costing £1,250,000&mdash;and now we propose to devote £250,000 to them.  That is no mean sum of money and, when I make that statement, it is not necessarily to be taken as my view, or the Government's view, that the old age pensioners have enough.  However, it is the best effort that has been made by any Government since the establishment of this State.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to consider, in this connection, the compensation given to old age pensioners in 1952, when, as a result of direct action by the Government at the time, the cost of living increased by 13 points.  The compensation given to old age pensioners in respect of that increase in the cost of living was a miserable 1/6 per week.</P>

      <P>In the words of Deputy MacEntee, the then Minister for Finance, a sum of 1/6 per week was to be given to those people to compensate them for the withdrawal of the food subsidies.  A sum of 2/6 was given in the previous year and it had no reference to the 1952 Budget.</P>

      <P>I cannot give the actual number of points, but the increase in the cost of living has no relation to the 13 points increase as a result of the 1952 Budget.  The compensation we have given this year for the increase in the cost of living that has occurred is far in excess of any increase given during the régime of the Fianna Fáil Government or any Government.  The main point is this.  People may describe this Bill as a mean Bill and may talk about its inadequacy so far as these people are concerned, but it is £250,000, and it is the first time that the Government have acted directly by giving an increase, where there was an increase in the cost of an essential food commodity, such as tea.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="744" /> I am conscious of the plight of other people who are in receipt of different social welfare benefits.  As I told the Dáil about two years ago, I am having examined the possibility of coming to their assistance.  I hope to have that examination completed in a reasonable time.</P>
    <P>The method of payment will be by a single cheque to old age pensioners, blind pensioners and widows and orphans on 23rd December.  All these people have to do is to produce their pension order books when they will be given an additional amount&mdash;the amount to be the same as their weekly payment.  Those who are deemed to be chronically ill or who are long-term disability benefit recipients will receive an additional cheque on the week commencing 19th December.</P>

      <P>In sub-section (1), line 35, to delete &ldquo;established&rdquo; and insert &ldquo;incorporated&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The reason I set down this amendment was in order to seek clarification of the definition of &ldquo;Irish body corporate&rdquo; as given in the Bill.  In the Bill, it is defined as a body corporate established under and subject to the law of the State and having its principal place of business in the State.</P>
      <P>I am not clear whether it is intended that that would include a company incorporated outside the State which has filed its particulars in the companies office here and has a place of business in the State.  The wording used here is rather different from the wording in Section 62 which speaks of an Irish body corporate and, in Section 19, there is another wording.  While in my amendment I have suggested the alteration of the word &ldquo;established&rdquo; to the word &ldquo;incorporated&rdquo;, I have made that suggestion simply because it seems to be the sense of the Bill and it would be desirable that there should not be any ambiguity.  My own feeling is that it is desirable that we should have as many ships as possible under the Irish flag.</P>

      <P>The term &ldquo;established&rdquo; is <Col N="746" /> the term used in a similar context in Section 1 (d) of the Merchant Shipping Act, 1894.  The parliamentary draftsman has been consulted and he would prefer to retain this term which is well recognised and is broader than the term &ldquo;incorporated&rdquo;.  Moreover, the phrase in the Merchant Shipping Act, 1894, viz. &ldquo;bodies corporate established under and subject to the laws of some part of Her Majesty's Dominions and having their principal place of business in those Dominions&rdquo; has been the subject of judgments in the courts here and elsewhere and it would be better, therefore, to retain the word which has been accepted and recognised in this context for many years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I notice that in the interpretation it says that a consular officer includes any officer, whether he is or is not in the Civil Service.  In the subsequent paragraph, it says that &ldquo;diplomatic officer&rdquo; means a person in the Civil Service of the State who is an ambassador extraordinary and plenipotentiary, an envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary, a <i>chargé d'affaires</i>, a counsellor of embassy or legation, a secretary of embassy or legation, or an attaché. Does that mean that a person, to be in the diplomatic service, must be a civil servant?  I could envisage a position where an eminent doctor or eminent statesman, an eminent member of this House, or anyone in any walk of life other than in the public service, might be selected for the position of an Irish ambassador or diplomat abroad.  Would such a person be precluded from acting in this capacity under this Bill unless he were a civil servant?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be a pity if everything in this country were made entirely <Col N="747" /> careerist.  I should like to see maybe ideas of voluntary service or recognition of voluntary service given by voluntary institutions from time to time.

These include the ferry vessel used in Cork Harbour, as well as supply and stores vessels.  It is desirable that some of these vessels should be brought within the Merchant Shipping Acts, so that their operations could be made subject to compliance with the law as regards manning, safety measures, etc.  No State-owned ship will, however, become subject to the provisions of the Bill, unless the Government make an Order as provided in Section 17 of the Bill.  The effect of the amendment moved by the Senator would be to exclude entirely from the scope of the Act all vessels of the Naval Service owned by the Department of Defence.

      <P>My amendment is to provide that the Minister may authorise any body or person to use a flag in lieu of the national flag.  I take it that the kind of flag that the Minister envisages here might possibly be a flag issued to the Naval Service, or possibly a flag issued by warrant to a yacht club, or a flag issued by warrant to a shipping company.  The suggestion I make is that, instead of the words &ldquo;in lieu of&rdquo;, the words &ldquo;or in addition to&rdquo; be inserted, so as to enable such a special warrant flag to be flown along with the national flag, if it were so desired.

      <P>In sub-section (1), line 51, after &ldquo;colours&rdquo; to add &ldquo;except on the foremast&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment is to deal with what I understand to be the universal practice, that is, that a ship coming into an Irish port from a port abroad would fly the flag of the country it has left and <i>vice versa.</i>  I understand that practice is universal.  I believe that, in the 1947 Act, there is a similar section. It would appear that all ships have adhered to this universal international custom.  The amendment, as worded by me originally, is, I think, defective. I am told it should be &ldquo;except on the foremast&rdquo;.  I understand this point might be of some little importance.  As the section stands, Irish ships will have either to break the law of courtesy, or else the ordinary law.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crotty</NameTxt>
      <P>The courtesy flying of the flag of another State when entering ports of that State is a well-established international custom and is, in some South American States, the law of the land.  Section 11, as drafted, however, is merely a re-enactment of Section 3 (1) of the Merchant Shipping Act, 1947, and that section, in turn, re-enacts the substance of Section 73 (2) of the Merchant Shipping Act, 1894.  The apparent contradiction between the law and established custom has given rise to no difficulty or misunderstanding at any time, and it has been accepted by all authorities concerned that the courtesy flying of a foreign flag does not constitute the hoisting of a flag distinctive of nationality, in the sense of this section. Moreover, it might be dangerous, without very full consideration, to give recognition under our law to a practice which is, as yet, merely custom and which has not, so far, been officially recognised in international law.</P>

      <P>I appreciate the Parliamentary Secretary's point of view that, if there was a clause in an Act of 1894 which was incorporated in an Act of 1947, we should not in the <Col N="751" /> year 1955 adopt a section which in fact, and not in practice, has proved bad law.  It appears to me that Section 11, as it stands, would mean that every Irish ship entering the port of Montreal or New York and which out of courtesy flies the Canadian flag or the American flag on its foremast is, in fact, breaking the Merchant Shipping Act, 1947, and would break the Act we now propose to amend.  I consider that it would be quite wrong for us to continue this practice.  Let us either tell our ships that they are not in future to fly the flag of any other nationality, or amend this Bill to see that international practice is covered.  Would the Parliamentary Secretary give us an assurance that he will look into the matter further and submit a suitable amendment?</P>

I doubt, although I am not a lawyer, on grounds of common sense, whether a judge could rule against the clear meaning of the Act.  This is an amendment worthy of praise.

It is often flown on what is known as the jack mast. When it is on the jack mast, the national flag may have a white border, provided for elsewhere in this Bill. The position is that when Irish ships are entering a foreign port, it would be customary to fly the flag of that nation on the foremast, but on returning to Ireland from a foreign port, it would be customary, in a slightly different position, to fly the flag of the nation from which it has arrived.  That is the only difficulty in this amendment in our name, that in arriving at your home port, you do not fly the flag on the foremast, but in a slightly different position of the rigging.  I do not think it would be a very serious matter for Irish ships if they had to return to their home and fly the flag of a foreign country on the foremast, and it would not be very serious if we accept the amendment, because it would not in any way affect international custom.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ArthurCox" hpid="Mr. Cox Mr. Cox">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 5:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To add a new paragraph as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(e)  a person who at the relevant date is and has been for the previous five years ordinarily and principally resident in the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only persons who are qualified persons are the Government, a Minister of State, an Irish citizen or an <Col N="754" /> Irish body corporate.  The amendment I am proposing is to include persons who have been at the relevant date for a long time resident in this country.  I appreciate, of course, that the Bill does provide for the possibility of reciprocal arrangements between this country and another country, but it is quite possible that there might be people who are not citizens and have been long resident here who would give great service to this country by helping in Irish shipping&mdash;and, indeed, so far as I know, there might be such people in existence at the present moment. This Bill is an extraordinarily drastic one, because, not alone does it say in various places that things are not to be done, but it goes so far as to say that a ship or a share in a ship owned by an unqualified person is to be forfeited.</P>
    <P>I have no knowledge whether there are such persons, but I am sure there are, who are not Irish citizens, but are resident here and own shares in Irish ships.  It is quite possible that they might find their interests forfeited before a reciprocity agreement was entered into.  In any event, I think this is a proper provision to make&mdash;that even an alien who is not a citizen but has been long resident here, should have certain rights.  The Control of Manufactures Act, of which personally I strongly disapprove, did make provision in favour of a person resident here.  I would suggest that it would be a very wrong and, indeed, an unwise thing to provide that such a person could not have a share in an Irish ship.</P>
    <P>My own view is that the present Bill is unwise in many ways in seeking to limit so very strictly what ships can be under the Irish flag.  I should have thought that it would have been all in our interest to have done everything we could to encourage more ships to come under the Irish flag.  It seems to me that this Bill is restrictive and may have directly the contrary result to what we would all wish&mdash;to help in the strengthening of the Irish marine service&mdash;just as, in my opinion, the Control of Manufactures Act, instead of helping nationally, has hindered nationally.  I would ask that provision should be made that a person who, at <Col N="755" /> the relevant date, is here, and has been for the previous five years ordinarily and principally resident in the State, should be a qualified person, capable of holding validly a share in an Irish ship.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>If what Senator Cox says is true, that a person not ordinarily resident in this State can have his rights taken without compensation, it is a matter about which I feel we might want to put down an amendment on the next stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJCrotty" hpid="Mr. Crotty Mr. Crotty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crotty</NameTxt>
      <P>An alien who is resident in the State for five years is entitled to apply for naturalisation.  If he were naturalised, he would acquire the right to register his ship in this country under (b) of Section 16.  In any case, it would be open to him to form a company established under and subject to the law of the State and having its principal place of business in the State.  It should scarcely be necessary, therefore, to include special provisions in the Act to enable such a person to register a ship.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ArthurCox" hpid="Mr. Cox Mr. Cox">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary in his reply has mentioned that such a person can get around the Act by registering a company here and holding shares in the company.  Like other lawyers, I have made part of my living, quite honestly, by such an expedient under the Control of Manufactures Acts, but I really think that this kind of legislation under which you can do things by being clever and by forming a company in a particular way, while it is very profitable to me, is not really desirable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know what the feeling of this House is, but I quite definitely think it is wrong that a person who has been resident here for a considerable time, even if he is not a citizen, should not hold an interest in a ship.  From the purely legal point of view, I think the point I have made is correct, that, if there is a person at present who is not a citizen, not a limited company, and who holds an interest in an Irish ship, he may find his interest forfeited before this State had made a reciprocal agreement with the country to which he, by his nationality, might belong. <Col N="756" /> This is not a trivial amendment.  It is an important point, and I would like to press the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamStanford" hpid="Professor Stanford Professor Stanford">
      <NameTxt>Professor Stanford</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to support this amendment.  I do so for somewhat academic reasons.  In the honourable Republic of the Athenians there was a class of citizen called &ldquo;resident aliens&rdquo; who were given full privileges of citizenship in matters of this kind, such as shipping business.  They were of very great value to the Athenian State.  Any ancient historian, I believe, would support that.  Resident aliens in our community might be of equal value, so, on the basis of ancient history, as well as modern expediency, I would support this amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be in favour of this amendment also.  Like Senator Cox, I disapproved of the Control of Manufactures Act and had a good deal to do with it, in the sense of discussing it from time to time.  As Senator Cox says, the ingenuity of the legal profession is very largely exercised in evading that Act.  Now we find a complete change of front in regard to Government policy with respect to the Control of Manufactures Act, that aliens and foreigners, generally regarded as in some way or other objectionable people to start factories, are being urged and invited and pressed and persuaded to do so.  This section is objectionable because of the ideology behind it.  It says that foreigners should not be allowed to take part in Irish business.  That is really what it comes to.  I agree with Senator Cox that it is illiberal, restrictive, and, like the Control of Manufactures Act, might become a dead letter through evasion; and finally the whole policy of the State may change. I ask the Minister to reconsider it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Fearon</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the Parliamentary Secretary's reply, supposing an alien has been five years resident in the Republic and then wishes to acquire this necessary control and applies for nationality, does that mean that he has to forego his original nationality?  Supposing we have somebody from the Balkans resident here for five years who applies for Irish naturalisation in order to <Col N="757" /> possess a ship, will he have to give up his original nationality, and, if so, is it fair to ask him?</P>

      <P>I was astonished, and, I must say, rather shocked, that the Parliamentary Secretary should suggest that this legislation which we have under review here this evening should be allowed to stand for the reason that it can be evaded.  Legislation that can be evaded is bad legislation.  Surely we in this House should, if we humanly can, formulate legislation that cannot be evaded.</P>

      <P>There seems to be a good deal of reason in this amendment, but there is one question I should like to put to the proposers and supporters of it.  Might it not be extremely dangerous, in a time of war, to have a number of Irish ships owned by aliens, not responsible to our Government, who would perhaps clear out of the country just before the war? It strikes me that it would be rather dangerous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ArthurCox" hpid="Mr. Cox Mr. Cox">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to that point, there was no limitation generally up to recent years on the ownership of ships.  For instance, in England one could own a ship or a share in a ship. The policy here should be to try to build up our mercantile marine, that is to say, a marine which is subject to ourselves and run from this country. Someone, in a debate on some other subject here the other day, compared our position with the position of Norway&mdash;a very, very small country, with a population only about the size of ours&mdash;which is a wealthy country because she has a great marine and the Norse flag is flown in every part of the world.  We should try to build up something of that kind here and not tie the whole thing up so much in green paper as to make it impossible for enterprising people to come here and help us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support Senator Cox in his amendments.  I think Senator McHugh's objection is not really sound.  If a ship is registered in an Irish port, it would not be possible to transfer it to another port, without the permission of the Minister. <Col N="758" /> I feel that, in time of war, that permission would not be forthcoming.  At the present time, we are encouraging aliens to bring capital in to set up new industries.  We had the Industrial Development Authority not very long ago trying to set up new industries here; yet in this Bill we are proposing to make it impossible for those aliens to bring in shipping to have it registered here.  Shipping is a form of investment and it would be desirable to give every possible opportunity to people from abroad to come in here and take up residence, and, if possible, to bring more shipping in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish the Parliamentary Secretary would reply also to the question which I raised on confiscation. Confiscation of the rights of people living outside the country would cause the greatest uncertainty and would defeat anyone helping to build up a mercantile marine here.  Norway is a country with a population not very much larger than ours.  Her flag is fourth amongst the world's tonnage. That probably in large measure is due to the wise laws enacted to encourage the growth of shipping there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RogerMcHugh" hpid="Dr. McHugh Dr. McHugh">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McHugh</NameTxt>
      <P>I am all in favour of building up our mercantile marine, but I think it is possible to build it up by some other method than alien capital, that we could invest our own capital in it.  I cannot understand the validity of Senator Cox's argument&mdash;because he gives no evidence that the mercantile marine of the Norwegians is owned to any large extent by aliens.  Was that his contention?  Is it not owned by Norwegians?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ArthurCox" hpid="Mr. Cox Mr. Cox">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course I am perfectly certain it is owned by Norwegians mostly, but they need not all be so owned.  My point is that a likely kind of person who might be qualified to own a ship, or be interested in Irish shipping, might be a person resident here for a considerable period, even though not an Irish citizen.  Such a person can own many other kinds of goods and property, and I cannot see why the possible part ownership of a ship should not extend to him also.</P>

      <P>I would not agree with Senator Crosbie's definition that any legislation which can be evaded is bad legislation.  My experience over a number of years is that watertight legislation is practically impossible, and, if it is not watertight, I suppose it could be called bad.  With regard to the amendment, one point strikes me. In this category&mdash;the Government, a Minister of State, an Irish citizen and an Irish body corporate&mdash;if you insert &ldquo;a resident alien,&rdquo; what happens when the resident alien who has acquired a ship, or an interest in a ship, ceases to be a resident?  Would that not need to be dealt with in the amendment?  That is to say, if we are going to provide in Section 16 for a resident alien, will we not also have to provide for what happens to his shares or his control when he ceases to be resident or goes back to his own country?  Surely some provision would have to be made?</P>

I am wondering what happens when he ceases to be qualified? I do not profess to be an expert on this matter, or to understand completely the relevance between Sections 16 and 19, but would the insertion of this amendment have any effect on the reciprocity provisions of Section 19? I merely ask the question.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJCrotty" hpid="Mr. Crotty Mr. Crotty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crotty</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to the questions by Senator Burke and Senator Cox about forfeiture, no alien other than a British subject does or could own an Irish ship at present, so there is no danger of such a ship, or share therein, being forfeited at present.  Under Section <Col N="760" /> 22, no alien may acquire a ship or a share therein, subject to forfeiture. If we were to allow aliens to own Irish ships, then the States with which we wish to establish reciprocal rights might well object.</P>
      <P>Senator Cox may well say whether one may prosper or not under the Control of Manufactures Act by getting around it.  There is no question of prospering under this: it is over and above board.  Without getting around it, he can establish a company, subject to the law of the State and have its principal place of business in the State and be fully entitled to own or part own ships under the Irish flag.  Alien ownership of an Irish ship would raise the question of its nationality under international law and that would be contrary to a recent resolution of the International Law Commission which deals with this subject.</P>

I have in mind Dungarvan, where at the present time there is a revival in shipping.  I understand that no ship is at present owned in Dungarvan, but ships have been owned there, and, as I say, there seems to be a revival in shipping. There may be some advantages for those registering ships at the port which they generally use: I do not know.  According to this Bill, one may apply for the extension of the number of ports in the register, but I do not know how difficult that procedure is. If it is difficult, I should like to suggest that the port of Dungarvan be included in the names of the ports that appear in the Second Schedule to this Bill.</P>

      <P>To insert in line 24 &ldquo;Ballina (River Port)&rdquo; and &ldquo;Newport&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When looking at this Bill, I noticed that one port in County Mayo was numbered amongst the ports of registry whereas two ports that can and have been used by boats of similar draught as those that go to Westport have not been included.  As I have already stated, I do not know what benefits registration confers on a port or whether it puts responsibilities on port authorities.  I have not got any information since I put this amendment down. <Col N="765" /> Perhaps I might get the information from the Parliamentary Secretary now and decide then whether I will let my amendment stand, or withdraw it.</P>

      <P>If Senator Ruane was present during the Second Reading of the Bill, when this point was raised, he would have had the information already, but since he put down this amendment I should like to support it, in principle.  It seems to me that he would be doing wrong to take a local or a regional view of this Bill and it would be wrong, I think, if simply because certain ports in County Mayo were left out, we should include those and those only.  As I suggested on the Second Reading, if we are going to extend these schedules, ports right round the coast seem to be qualified reasonably well.  I mentioned the ports of Arklow, Dungarvan and Kinsale.  I think that if the Bill is to be amended, it should not be amended simply in the interest of the County Mayo.</P>

      <P>The only difficulty I see under the Bill in connection with this question of registry, is that there may not be customs officers in these ports. The chief officer of customs, or one of his assistants, is the person who is qualified to register.  I could see a difficulty if a customs officer was not resident in a small port.  The port I spoke of earlier was the port of Dungarvan, where, I believe, a customs officer is resident.  Therefore, no difficulty would arise there in regard to expense or in making Dungarvan a port of registry.</P>

The port of Ballina has not very much shipping going into it.  I do not think any went in last <Col N="766" /> year.

C.I.E. have made representations that the singling of the line has had a very injurious effect from the standpoint of the efficiency of the services provided, and has retarded them considerably in their efforts to accelerate the service on that line.  I am awaiting proposals on the subject, and I can assure the Senator that, when they are received, they will be sympathetically examined.  It is essential to do something in the way of doubling the line, at least in portions of it, to provide the better service, which I think we should provide, to the West of Ireland.</P>

      <P>I should like to ask the Minister whether in deciding that this grant of £2,462,000 should be considered as a non-repayable grant, it was considered that only portion of it might be regarded as non-repayable. I do not know whether I am the only Senator present who thinks this is a rather fat present for C.I.E.  It is usually considered fairly difficult to find £2,500,000.  I realise that this £2,500,000 was previously granted and we now say we do not want it repaid. I should feel happier if the reason for this could be explained by the Minister, if we could be told that the matter had been given full consideration and that it was considered that not one pound of this money could ever be got back again from C.I.E.  I am sure that the matter was carefully considered, but I should like to hear along <Col N="768" /> what lines it was decided that the total sum must now be considered as non-repayable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that this advance which it is now proposed to treat as a non-repayable grant was made not to C.I.E., but to the predecessors of C.I.E.  It is because of that fact and because we felt it an unreasonable proposition to endeavour to get C.I.E. to pay this advance, that we do not seek repayment.  I think it is beyond their capacity to repay the advance, and if they have it in their books as an advance which they are liable to repay, it is not calculated to enhance their financial reputation, which it is desirable to build up in every way, because C.I.E. will have to go to the public from time to time looking for money to finance their activities, which I hope in the future will be much more economically rewarding than in the past.</P>
      <P>I see no hope of getting back from C.I.E. this sum of money which was paid over as an advance to their predecessors. We think it is better to treat the amount as a non-repayable grant and give C.I.E. the feeling that whatever financial burdens have to be borne by the company are not crippling in their effect, nor should they be calculated in any way to damp the enthusiasm of the board and the whole undertaking to reach a state of financial solvency which is much to be commended and which holds out so much prospect not only for the board, but for the staff and the whole community as well.  In any case, in the present circumstances, the Senator will appreciate that C.I.E. could never hope to repay this money within any foreseeable date, and to leave the amount in their books would have a deleterious effect on the company generally in a number of other fields.</P>

      <P>I feel that there is a good deal in what the Minister says, but I am not sure that I do not view C.I.E. with more optimism than he does, because I should like to feel that there is at least a foreseeable future in which C.I.E. might be able to honour some of this debt, even if it were a debt which was assumed by <Col N="769" /> them from their predecessors.  To say at the outset that they will never be able to repay not merely the total sum but any portion of it, is to give a pessimistic view of the company which I do not think the Minister wants to do.  I feel we are not doing them any harm in retaining the right to ask them for at least some of this, to keep it on their books.  After all, we are not collecting interest on it.  It seems to me unduly pessimistic to say that the company cannot at some foreseeable date be able to pay off some of it.  Why should we wipe it out, and abandon our right to collect any single penny of it?</P>

      <P>The prospects of getting much back from C.I.E. can be judged from the fact that the Department of Finance have consented to this being written off.  If they did that, I think Senators will agree that it was rather a forlorn prospect.  If at any time C.I.E. operates in such a way that it has a surplus which would enable it to pay that big surplus, I take it it can be utilised for highly desirable purposes, namely, providing better services and cheaper fares for the community, because now it is a community service.</P>

The Statutory Instruments Committee have on many occasions had to complain to many Departments about the delay &mdash; sometimes extending up to six weeks and two months.  It does not appear definite whether or not it is necessary under this Bill that the statutory instruments should be sent out at the same time to the Oireachtas as they are sent out to the different colleges set out in the amendments.  The Minister will agree that it is particularly desirable that the House should be informed in the very first instance of these Orders.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as the amendment itself is concerned, when I was framing this Bill, I frankly did not think that statutory instruments as such were things in which there was sufficient academic interest for students in the universities to require them.  Statutory instruments are, by and large, documents in which there would be no academic interest whatsoever. There might be an occasional case in which there would be academic interest.  I think it would be undesirable from the point of view of the university libraries themselves that we <Col N="772" /> should fill them with copies of instruments for which they would have no real use.</P>
      <P>If there is felt a real desire in the university libraries to get copies, I am certainly not going to prevent them; but I would say to the university representatives and to the mover of this motion that I am inclined to think I would be putting a burden on the librarians in expecting them to go through each individual statutory instrument they get.  The various librarians may decide that only 1 per cent. of the instruments sent to them would be of real utility and suitable for retention.  If the university representatives so desire, I am perfectly prepared to arrange that the instruments would be sent on demand administratively&mdash;or as the Seanad should desire, though administratively would be the easier way.  I accept Senator Douglas's view as a necessary concomitant that if it is done for one college, it must be done for all four.  I feel that an administrative arrangement by which the librarian would get, in any case in which he wanted it, a copy of any statutory instrument, would save a great deal of unnecessary paper work and yet the facilities would work out satisfactorily.</P>
      <P>In regard to the point raised by Senator Walsh and supported by Senator Hawkins, one of the reasons for this Bill is to ensure that there will not be the delay in the future that there was in the past.  It is to obviate that delay that I have provided this new method in the Bill.  I hope the new method will mean not merely that the copies of the instruments will be available more quickly to the various bodies named but also that they will be available far more quickly in the Library of the two Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>

      <P>I am supporting this amendment because I was expressly asked by the head of the Law School in Trinity College to support it, or to put down an amendment. It was our considered opinion that it would be valuable to students of law and others to have the statutory instruments immediately available in the college library.  It would be open to the librarian to put them away in the dungeons after the lapse of some years and I do not think the question of storage would be a very serious one.</P>

      <P>Surely the case made by the Minister might be acceptable if it were made in 1939, when the knowledge that there was going to be an outbreak of war necessitated the issuing of quite a number of Orders? Now that we have entered into a period of peace, and hope we may remain in it&mdash;whether it is cold or hot&mdash;and that there will be fewer of these Orders, the Minister is not justified in asking the librarians of the various colleges to make a special request for the various Orders issued.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Dillon)</NameTxt>
      <P>In accordance with the provisions of the Agricultural Produce (Eggs) Act, 1939, every egg and every package of eggs consigned from a registered egg wholesaler's premises must be marked with the marks prescribed by the regulations made under that Act.  The marks at present prescribed for the shells of fresh eggs are the country of origin mark and code mark.  The marks prescribed for packages containing eggs consigned for export are the grade mark; the nationality mark, that is, the words &ldquo;Produce of the Republic of Ireland&rdquo;; the transport mark&mdash;&ldquo;Eggs &mdash;This side up&rdquo;; the exporter's identification number, the quantity mark and the date of export mark.  Each of these marks serves a useful purpose from the point of view of the efficient marketing of our eggs and has not, I am satisfied, militated in the past against the sale of our eggs abroad.  Recently, however, inquiries for unstamped eggs have been received by some of our exporters from countries in which we have been trying to find an outlet for our surplus poultry products, while importers in some of our markets on the Continent have stated that Irish eggs would be more readily saleable on those markets if the date of export mark did not appear on the boxes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In view of the intense competition which our eggs are meeting on the <Col N="775" /> export markets, it seems to me essential that any obstacles which hinder, even in the slightest degree, the sale of our eggs on those markets should, where possible, be removed.  The Bill before you is intended to do that.</P>
    <P>I would like to make it clear that the exportation of eggs, unstamped, would not increase the possibility of the eggs not being up to the required standard of quality.  Eggs in commercial quantities may be exported only by a registered egg wholesaler who is also licensed to export.  Every egg packed for export must be tested for freshness and must be clean and properly graded.  The eggs consigned for export are examined by my Department's inspectors at the ports. These inspectors would be aware of the cases where exemptions from the stamping of the eggs, etc., had been granted and would examine the eggs all the more carefully in such cases.</P>
    <P>The obligation to mark every egg and every package of eggs offered for sale or for export still stands and will be unaffected by anything in this Bill.</P>
    <P>What is sought in this Bill is merely the power to exempt exporters from the obligation to stamp eggs and to mark egg cases.  It is not my intention, however, to grant such exemptions automatically; every application will be carefully examined and exemption will be granted only where I am satisfied that that course is in the best interests of our export trade in eggs and that the exporter is complying with the requirements of the importing country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that the House will approve of this Bill mainly because the Minister and his Department have made the case that some benefit will be conferred on a certain section of our export trade through its enactment. It is, however, a matter for consideration whether the exemptions which it is proposed to give under the Bill may not, in certain cases, be availed of in order to evade the operations of the egg production Acts of the past, which rendered the marking of eggs and packages of eggs obligatory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="776" /> One is inclined to ask when and where does the Bill begin to take effect.  If a dealer is buying eggs from a producer, can he refrain from marking the eggs on the ground that he will be exempted by this Bill?  If he is a dealer who is exporting a certain quantity of his eggs to the Continent and a certain quantity to Britain, or if he is selling a certain quantity on the home market, can he evade his obligations in regard to the British or the home market under this Bill?  When dealing with a matter in regard to which safeguards will need to be operated, I do not think it is easy in a short Bill of this kind to embody safeguards.  I suppose we have to rely upon the Minister's Department to see that nothing is done that will be detrimental to the egg trade in general, in order merely to capture what may perhaps be only a small outlet for some of our surplus eggs.</P>
    <P>I think there is something peculiar about the mentality of people who do not like to see the age of the egg recorded on its shell, or on the packet in which it is contained.  It may be that the people on the Continent who deal in eggs are a little bit, shall we say, broad-minded in regard to their freshness or otherwise.  However, if they want eggs unstamped, I suppose we have to give them to them.  It is a matter on which tastes differ widely. I know a number of people who would be rather inclined to regard an unstamped egg as being fresher than one that is stamped.  I know that here, in the city, there is a certain demand for unstamped eggs, particularly when people are aware of the place of origin of the eggs or when they can secure eggs direct from the producers.  That is understandable.  No hen will put a number on the egg when she is laying it, or after laying it.  The assumption is that, once an egg is stamped or branded, it is at least a little older than it really is.</P>
    <P>In my view, it is a pity the whole business of the marketing of eggs should be in such a haphazard position, so to speak, that it is necessary to stamp eggs for any portion of the market.  It is a pity we could not have all our producers combined in one big <Col N="777" /> co-operative marketing society, so that they would direct the eggs as quickly as possible from the farm to the ultimate consumer, without any delay at any sector of the market.  When a number of people have to handle a product of this kind, there is always a danger that somebody along the line will endeavour to hold up the product in order to take advantage of improving markets.  I am told by those in the trade that there is a tendency for eggs to be a little less fresh during the period when markets are rising.  I suppose that is human nature.  If the producers were all combined in one big co-operative organisation&mdash;I think it would require to be so big as to embrace all&mdash;they could ensure that the eggs would reach the consumer in the shortest possible time and would be concerned to ensure that the eggs reach the consumer in the best possible condition.</P>
    <P>I suppose it is true to say, although I do not know whether statistics have been prepared on this matter, that less than one hen in a million lays a bad egg.  Nevertheless, consumers do occasionally meet with eggs which are not quite good and they are sometimes inclined to blame the hen.  We could avoid that, I think, and it can only be avoided by some system of nationalised co-operative marketing.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note that this Bill is concerned to find a market for Irish eggs on the Continent.  I think some of the continental countries are interested in unmarked eggs.  I seem to recollect that at one time the Minister used to make a lot of capital out of the fact that another Government here was seeking alternative markets for eggs.  I think he created a certain amount of amusement when describing the actions and the activities of officials of the Department of Agriculture as they travelled to the Continent looking for alternative markets.  It seems, however, as if those elusive markets were there all the time.  The Minister is now endeavouring to ensure in this Bill that they will be availed of.</P>
    <P>I seem to recollect also that at one time the Minister talked very loudly about drowning the British people with <Col N="778" /> eggs.  Are we to take it from this Bill that the drowning process has been completed and that there is now an overflow to the Continent, or is it that the British have, by some means, erected a dam that has stemmed the flood and diverted it to other countries? Whatever the reason may be, it appears that there is a market in countries other than Britain, a market that can be availed of.  Of course, the trouble for most people at the present time is that the hens are not laying sufficient eggs during the periods when they are scarce.  I presume this Bill is intended to come into operation when there is a very heavy supply on our markets and perhaps also on the markets in Britain.  Any measure of that kind must be welcomed by this House.</P>
    <P>I should like to direct the Minister's attention to the fact that during the past year the number of poultry here decreased by 71,000.  That is rather an indication that the poultry industry is not progressing.  I suggest that measures should be adopted to deal with that matter.  In this case, I think the Minister and his Department must take the initiative in so organising the poultry industry that it will be co-operatively run, so far as marketing is concerned.  One thing is certain in regard to this matter.  In some cases, I am not too optimistic or too enthusiastic about co-operation, but when you are dealing with a product such as the egg, which is almost as near as possible to being perfect, I think it is something which could be handled by a co-operative society of producers, and handled efficiently, provided the right help and guidance were given to them by the Minister and his Department and provided the matter were approached in a businesslike and official way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid I am not satisfied at all as to the need for this Bill.  As I read it and understand it, in accordance with what the Minister has told us, it is for the purpose of enabling the Minister to allow some of our exporters to evade the present provisions of the Agricultural Produce (Eggs) Act, 1939.  I notice that, under that Act, the penalty for <Col N="779" /> contravening these provisions is £20 fine for the first offence, and, after that, £50 fine, or six months in jail, or both.  I take it that there was a reason for these provisions.  The Minister has told us what they were: the marking on the egg of the code mark and the mark of nationality and the marking on the package of the nationality, transport stamp, quantity, etc., and date.  He told us that some foreign importers find this date mark a little bit of a worry to them.  What was the purpose of asking for the date? It is quite clear that the purpose was so that anybody buying the package subsequently would know, comparatively speaking, the freshness of the egg.  We are now asked by some importers, in countries unnamed, to omit the giving of this valuable information, because they find it awkward &mdash;because they find they can sell the eggs more readily if the date mark is not clearly stated on the package.</P>
      <P>I would contend that the reputation of Irish eggs in any market depends &mdash; arising largely out of this kind of legislation &mdash; upon their reputation of being always fresh.  The date mark and the code mark and the nationality mark are a guarantee, when you see them, that you are getting fresh eggs. There are rare exceptions, but that is the reputation that has been built up. Now, apparently, that will no longer be the method obtaining, because we are making it easier for people in other countries to market our eggs at a greater age.  They need not necessarily mention that they are our eggs, but they can easily market them without any reference to date at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is the need at home for the code marking of eggs?  The answer is that it guarantees freshness, guarantees the recent laying of the eggs. That is the home need for the date and the code mark, and I am quite sure the Minister would not be willing to dispense with them.  I suggest that the purpose of this Bill is to make it easier for some unnamed foreign importer to swindle his own public with Irish eggs.  I would disapprove of the principle of helping that to be done more easily, even though it <Col N="780" /> does not affect our own nationals or our own exporters.  The exporters will still export the same quality of eggs.</P>
    <P>The Minister assured us that in each case where an application is made to him, he will have the matter examined very carefully and that it will be only with the greatest reluctance that he will allow exemptions from these conditions. The nature of his examination will be to ensure that when the eggs leave Ireland, they will be fresh, but he is not ensuring that these eggs will not be marketed anywhere else in a stale condition.</P>
    <P>Our primary consideration on this Bill should be our duty to the ultimate consumer.  I would say that I do not care a curse about the middleman of some continental country who finds it easier to control, stock, and get rid of the eggs at certain inflated prices if we do not reveal the date.  I would be strongly against this Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Dillon) James M. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Dillon)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would ask the Senators to bear in mind the fundamental problem here involved.  The fundamental problem is that we have passed in world markets from a seller's market to a buyer's market, and we are now in the position that, when we want to sell eggs and find an opening in a new market, we are not circumstanced as we were five or six years ago, when the potential purchaser was almost a suppliant at our door for supplies. The position now is that we are painfully conscious that when we get entry into the new market, there is a queue of other potential suppliers behind us waiting for the opportunity to say: &ldquo;If the Irish consignor prescribes any condition that presents a difficulty for you, we are prepared to waive it.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand Senator Sheehy Skeffington's desire to see that it shall be the ultimate consumer of Irish eggs who is protected by any regulations we make.  That is a view with which I would sympathise, if I were in a position to control conditions in foreign markets, but I am not any longer in a position to say, if I get a quota in the Trinidad market, or the German market, or any other foreign market, that I insist on the observance of certain conditions in regard to fresh eggs which do not apply to other eggs, because if I attempt to say that I shall be courteously told that they are no <Col N="785" /> longer interested in Irish eggs and they will get supplies from some other source.</P>
    <P>Our object is to maintain, in so far as it is consistent with commercial possibility, every precaution to ensure that the reputation of Irish eggs going into any foreign market, new or traditional, will be protected, in so far as it is humanly possible to do so.  Senators will note that this is a permissive Bill, to give me authority to exempt a particular exporter in respect of a particular consignment of eggs from such of the regulations as normally would continue to apply to ordinary exports.</P>
    <P>It is our intention, in so far as we will be permitted by the importer, to maintain the regulation that there shall be a date mark in respect of the date on which the eggs were packed and dispatched for shipment on the inside of the middle board, so that the eggs go to a distributor, for instance, in X-land and are then ordinarily passed out to retailers.  The retailer who actually unpacks the eggs for retail sale will be fixed with notice by a date mark on the inside board of the date on which those eggs left Ireland; and he can take it up with his local supplier as to why they were held in storage in the exporting country longer than reason would justify, and he can point to the fact that those eggs were shipped from Ireland on the date described on the inside of the middle board of the box.</P>
    <P>I think this factor may be absent from the minds of many Senators.  The average consumer of eggs thinks of an egg being laid and reaching his table within a very limited time, but if you stop to think for a moment, the egg is laid, say, in County Mayo.  It is then collected, and consigned to the wholesaler, who may then consign it to a shipper.  It may then start on a journey which takes a week to 14 days to complete, and it then has to be passed through the ordinary channels of trade to the consumer in a relatively distant country.  Surely Senators will appreciate that, in these circumstances, notifying the ultimate consumer of every stage of the journey on which that egg has of necessity had to travel is scarcely good advertising for Irish <Col N="786" /> eggs, bearing in mind the refrigeration possibilities and the care that can be given to consignments of perishable products under modern shipping conditions. Nobody wants to be reminded that he has purchased an egg which is the best part of a month old.  Mind you, such an egg might be the youngest egg available to him from any outside source of supply; nevertheless, it is scarcely the particular facet of the egg's attraction that a prudent public relations man would desire to emphasise.</P>
    <P>We are so accustomed to shipping perishable agricultural products to Great Britain, which is in fact no different from shipping perishable agricultural produce to Dublin, that we forget sometimes the wholly different considerations that must apply when we make our supplies enter markets which habitually draw their supplies of perishable agricultural products from countries relatively far removed from their own territory, and which have only recently become available to us as a result of the development of refrigeration practice which makes it possible to send eggs such distances at all.</P>
    <P>Senator Cogan said that he wished eggs were marketed co-operatively. That is a wish to which I emphatically subscribe.  Any Senator who shares that view would do a great public service if, in his particular area, he would undertake the organisation of co-operative effort to that end.  One of the difficulties of the Minister for Agriculture is that it is of the very essence of co-operation that it should not be organised by Government Departments. All I can do is exhort and give every help, advice and assistance I can to any co-operative society that will undertake the co-operative marketing of eggs.  It is manifestly a thing that I as Minister for Agriculture am peculiarly disqualified from undertaking myself.  I renew and reiterate here what I have said many, many times before in public&mdash;there are very few things that a farmer does in the production of the marketing of his goods that he could not do better co-operatively. I am prepared to agree with the proposition that that applies <Col N="787" /> in a very special degree to the marketing of eggs.</P>
    <P>I hope I have clearly explained to the Seanad that the normal marking prescribed under the code of egg legislation to which Senator Sheehy Skeffington refers is, from our point of view, the desirable minimum.  However, we have to be realistic and to realise that in certain of the new markets to which we have gone, two considerations arise.  One is that the importing people themselves will not have these regulations and if we insist on them they will not buy our eggs.  Again, there are certain aspects of the marking of eggs appropriate and advantageous in the case of a readily accessible market, such as the British market or our own, which require to be reconsidered when we contemplate shipping eggs under refrigeration to relatively distant points of consignment.</P>

      <P>I wonder if I might put three questions to the Minister, for purposes of clarification. He stated that for the purpose of these exemptions each case will be studied carefully and each particular consignment. Do I understand him to say that for every consignment the exporter will have to apply for a fresh licence?  Secondly, am I right in assuming that the date inside the egg box will not be dispensed with?  Will it be maintained?</P>

      <P>Then, thirdly, am I correct in assuming that, despite the removal of the outside mark, it will still be possible for the consuming public to identify eggs as being Irish?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Not necessarily.  There are no marks which we require anyone to put on an Irish egg at present that we do not think are of advantage to the ultimate producer and consumer here.  But in new foreign markets we are faced with the fact that it is not practical politics to enforce our ideal conditions.  I am asking the Seanad to give me freedom to waive some of these, which my predecessors have <Col N="788" /> certified to the Seanad are in themselves desirable.  I explained the reason for that, that we are in a buyer's market and I cannot enforce any longer outside our jurisdiction the conditions I think ideal.  I think I made it clear that we intend to maintain as many of them as we can.</P>
      <P>In regard to the date mark on the inside, I am bound to tell the Seanad that an occasion may arise on which we will have to exempt the shipper from marking the eggs in any way. They will simply go into the country of consignment as eggs.  In other cases we will not exempt, where the receiving country is prepared to attempt the sale of eggs with the mark of origin upon them.  It might happen in another country very distant, that we would not think it expedient to name eggs &ldquo;Irish Eggs&rdquo;, because any people in the habit of travelling there might say, if they found an Irish egg, that it must be a month or six weeks old. That might be a block to Irish eggs, in which case I may feel it right and proper in all the circumstances to waive the law.  Our problem is to sell the eggs.</P>
      <P>The Senator asked me in some surprise: &ldquo;Do you mean to say you are going to license every single consignment?&rdquo; Yes, if the consignment does not comply with the marks prescribed or the code as set out in these Acts and claims exemption under this Act, the shipper must produce in respect of each consignment a special licence giving him the benefit of this Act. That is not as extraordinary as it might sound, because what happens is that where we are forcing our way into one of these markets in some part of the world, there are not so many ship pers prepared to undertake consignments to those markets.  Very often only a very limited number of shippers will undertake to go into a new market. It will not give rise to any insuperable administrative difficulty to see that they have the licence which will secure prompt dispatch of eggs for a market of this character.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrederickHawkins" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the operative section, containing a provision whereby we are going to undo much of what has been done over a number of years. It was thought fit, in order that we should gain our place in the external market, that eggs should be stamped and graded.  Much work has been put into that line of activity.  I would ask now whether the proposal before us means we are to deviate from all that we have done and whether it will be possible for the Department to define who is to be the particular exporter. There is an important question and one that the Minister has not answered to my satisfaction &mdash; what is to be the qualification of the exporter, who is to get these particular licences to export eggs without having them stamped or in boxes which may not show the date of their export?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister might sit back and take this as a Bill that is going to pass through very freely.  This is one of the most important Bills that ever came before us.  We have had an export trade in eggs over a number of years.  We have seen that trade dwindle to what it is to-day.  We see the Minister trying to find continental markets, despite all he said in the past <Col N="790" />&ldquo;about drowning the British people with eggs&rdquo;, when he made the statement that the British market was the only one open to us.  Now he has opened up a new avenue in this Bill.  I would like an assurance from him that he or his Department will not be put in a position to open up something that this House would not like to have opened up.</P>
    <P>We have a number of registered exporters.  How is the Minister to decide how many of these will get the licences?  What is the procedure to be adopted?  What is the term of months or years that must elapse, to distinguish the regular exporter from the exporter who might be prepared to export just a consignment of eggs, say, to West Germany.  He must apply to the Department under this Bill.  He must be freed from all the obligations that exist.  How long will it take the Department to decide whether he is a fit and proper person?</P>
    <P>This Bill is not as simple as the Minister would like to suggest.  It means taking out of Parliament a decision and giving it into the Minister's hands &mdash; the decision as to which exporters will get these licences and what the qualifications are.  We have not heard that.  The Parliamentary Secretary &mdash; acting for the Minister in the Dáil &mdash; suggested that there has been a request from continental people that no longer should there be on the face of the exported eggs the date on which they were exported.  If we accept that, it would be a very bad thing.  We would all like to open up new markets but we would also like to remove every obstacle and everything that would stand in the way of our exploiting these markets.  If there is one thing, to my mind, that would lend itself to sabotaging our prospects, it would be the removal of the date of export of this commodity.  I do not see why we should object to having the date on a case of eggs.  I think we should make it clear on every case of eggs we export to the Continent what is the date of export.  If we want to retain a market, we must be prepared to export our Irish produce under our name and under the date on which it was exported.</P>

      <P>I must confess that a great deal of the case the Minister made appeared to me to be reasonable, but I am still not quite convinced that it is really, long term, in our best interest, to adopt the terms of the section, making it easier for foreign importers of eggs to sell older eggs.  This is what I think Section 2 amounts to, to make it easier for importers of our eggs to sell older Irish eggs.  It obviously would not be in the best interests of the Irish egg industry if we were to enable foreign importers to hold for long periods recognisably Irish eggs.</P>
      <P>The Minister tells us that he may even waive the necessity of marking these eggs at all, but I am rather dubious about the morality of such a transaction, because it seems to me that we are making it easier for these importers to slip one over on the public and we do not care, provided the public do not recognise that this is being done with our eggs.  I do not want to say anything further on this section, except to put this question to the Minister: Does commercial morality, which is, I grant, not always of a very high standard, vary in accordance with whether we are in a buyer's or a seller's market?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>No, no.  The Senator is mistaken.  We have, in the past, exported eggs exclusively to Great Britain.  It was only as a result of a situation arising consequent on the heavy subsidisation of egg production in Britain when the British began, during our period of surplus, to produce required themselves, that we were in Great Britain all the eggs they forced to look further afield to the markets into which we have been making our way only in the course of the last few years.  Now, in the British market, where, as I thought I explained, transport problems are almost identical with what they are in the Irish market, we set up what we thought to be optimum marketing practice, not for the advantage of the British consumer, but for the advantage of the Irish producer.  My interest was in the Irish producer and in so far as the advantage of the English consumer operated to the advantage of the Irish producer, but only so far as it was to the advantage of the people for whom I stood trustee, my interest and the interest of the English consumer coincided.  My interest is to make any market into which I can find a way as profitable as I can make it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>That would be to go too far, but my primary concern is to develop that market to the optimum advantage of the Irish producer.  When it was possible for the Irish producer to develop a market in Britain, we laid down a code, in the Act of 1930, which operated effectively to that end, but <Col N="793" /> where it emerges that other markets become available and where the implementation of all those regulations would operate, not to the advantage of the Irish producer but to his grave detriment, I am asking the Seanad to say that, in those exceptional circumstances, I should have power to waive some of the regulations.</P>
      <P>Senator Hawkins asked what regulations I propose to waive.  As at present advised, in respect of one or two markets into which we have found our way, where the practice of marking the individual egg is making it increasingly difficult to sell Irish eggs for the reason that such markets are so remote from our shore that when a person in that market sees an egg described as Irish he instinctively says: &ldquo;If it has come that far, it must be pretty ancient,&rdquo; he is quite unconscious of the fact that in respect of other eggs offered they have come from New Zealand and Denmark, the latter of which is as far and the other twice as far from the market as we are. Neither of these countries mark their eggs and I am asking the Seanad to authorise me to waive certain regulations, so that, in those circumstances, I shall not be restrained from getting the Irish consumer the same advantage as his New Zealand, Australian or Danish competitor is enjoying in this particular market.  The only marks which, as at present advised, I would find it requisite to exempt licensed shippers from is the mark on the egg and the obligation to put the date code mark on the outside of the cases.  We will require them to put a date code mark which will be fully comprehensive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Hawkins wants to know how it will be determined who is to get a licence.  Any licensed shipper who wants to sell eggs in these markets is the answer, but, in practice, it very frequently happens that in these markets the admission of our eggs is controlled by quota and, therefore, various exporters undertake to fulfil part of the available quota.  That means financial arrangements and the deposit of money here by the importer and a variety of other safeguards to ensure that the eggs consigned will be paid for.  All I can do, without <Col N="794" /> attempting to explain to the Senator every administrative step in connection with this trade, is to assure him that in relation to the issuance of these licences to any person who wants and is in a position to sell eggs in these markets, the provision of the licences envisaged under this Bill will present no serious administrative problems.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid I have been seriously shocked by the Minister and by the standards he asks us to uphold.  If I understand him correctly, he contends that we are under no moral obligation to a foreign consumer of our produce except in so far as it suits our pocket.  We are prepared to apply high moral and ethical standards only so long as it pays us, and so long as it brings in a dividend, and if not we are prepared to drop all pretence of applying high standards, or, indeed, any standard at all.  That is why I say I do not think this is a good standard of commercial morality and I will vote against the Bill.</P>

If the Senator is prepared to take up the position that we can set aside the sovereign authority of every country into which we send produce for sale, I say such a stand is ridiculous, fantastic, and absurd.  My duty is to get markets, not to play ducks and drakes with markets.  My duty is to open the channels of trade and to leave it to our people honestly to trade in it, but the Senator wants to put upon me the obligation of following our merchandise into another jurisdiction, putting aside the domestic Government of the people who will be its ultimate consumer, and saying: &ldquo;Your Government is dishonest; the Government of the Irish Republic will pursue this egg into the housewife's pot and there superintend its right preparation and if necessary, into her egg cup or on to her breakfast plate, or into her egg nog, if that is what she proposes to use it for.&rdquo;</P>

I think it would be deplorable if Senator Sheehy Skeffington were prepared or allowed to sell the proposition that the standard of ethics accepted by Oireachtas Éireann was dominated purely by considerations of profit.  The standards of ethics dominating the minds of the legislators of this country are, I think, comparable with those <Col N="796" /> influencing the minds of any legislators in any part of the world, east or west of the Iron Curtain.</P>

      <P>I had no intention of participating in this debate and I am doing so now because of the fact that I consider that the debate has taken an unrealistic turn.  I would go so far as to say that if certain remarks which the Minister made on the Committee Stage of this Bill had been made on the Second Reading it would have obviated a lot of this discussion.  I, for one, am prepared to support the Minister in whatever efforts he is making to find a market for our eggs because I consider it is a matter of vital importance to the agriculturists of this country, those engaged in egg production. As everybody knows, their concern for some time past has been the future prospects of the market.</P>
      <P>With regard to the question of ethics and good moral procedure, it is very dangerous for us to set ourselves up in this House as great judges of what should be a proper moral code.  In this matter, as in all other commercial matters, I think the general law of <i>caveat emptor</i> should apply: I think the Minister would agree with me in that.  After all, if we take a horse or a cow to the fair, it is a question for the judgment of the would-be purchaser, in the first instance, to make up his mind as to whether the animal would be suitable for him, or whether it would be defective.  Therefore, I think the Seanad should support whatever measures the Minister and his Department consider are necessary to take to find an export market for our eggs, and I do not think there should be any trouble about the way in which the licences will be issued.  The Minister has given us an undertaking that the application of each exporter will be properly considered and that only in necessary cases will the exemption licences be granted.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Everett) James Everett">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Everett)</NameTxt>
      <P>The object of this Bill, which had its origin with the late Mr. Justice Casey when he was Attorney-General, is to consolidate and amend the Fatal Accidents Acts of 1846, 1864 and 1908. When the original Act of 1846 was framed, the spread of the railways had caused a substantial increase in the number of deaths from accidents.  Prior to 1846, the law was that a personal action died with the person.  To this there was an exception in this country. Under the Grand Jury Act of 1836, the personal representative of a peace officer, a magistrate or an ordinary person killed as a result of activity in the maintenance of the peace could recover compensation in the old county court, the amount awarded being raised from local rates.</P>
      <P>Since the first Fatal Accidents Act &mdash; (known as Lord Campbell's Act) &mdash; was passed in 1846, the members of the family of a deceased person may, through the personal representative or by themselves, bring an action against any person who by his wrongful act has caused the death of the deceased, irrespective of the circumstances of the death.  It is proposed in the Bill that that position continue to be the law, subject to important changes for the benefit of the family.  I shall refer to these changes in discussing the various sections.</P>
      <P>The new legislation is, under Section 1, designed to come into operation on 1st January next, and it will not apply to any death before that date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Section 2 of the Bill are defined the dependents and they are to be the members of the family who suffer loss. We are adding in the brothers and sisters of the deceased and the half-brothers and half-sisters.  Adopted <Col N="798" /> persons, illegitimate persons, and persons to whom the deceased stood in the position of a parent, or who stood in the position of a parent to the deceased, are also covered.</P>
    <P>The question of the limit of dependency for the purposes of the Bill received long and careful consideration. We examined the law in Britain, in the Six Counties and in the various provinces of Canada.  We took account of the provisions in the Workmen's Compensation Act, 1934, the Air Act of 1936, the Garda Compensation Act of 1941, and we went back to the old Grand Jury Act of 1836.  There are provisions in all these Acts dealing with fatal cases.  The provision about persons in the position of parents and <i>vice versa</i> was introduced on Committee Stage in the Dáil.  We do not think we should go any further.  It was argued in the Dáil that we have gone too far.  Uncles and aunts are not covered where there is no question of being in the position of a parent.</P>
    <P>In coming to the conclusion we have come to, we were influenced by, among others, two considerations.  First of all, if the range of dependents were extended, insurance companies might be tempted to raise their premiums. Secondly, juries could easily tend to award the same amount in damages, irrespective of the number of dependents, with the result that the sums for the major sufferers, say, the wife and children, would be smaller.  Though the limitation to close relatives may not be in theory ideal in all cases, it is, we maintain, sound practically, as otherwise it would be difficult to decide where and how to draw the line.  There must be a definite and clear limitation.</P>
    <P>Section 3 re-enacts the existing law. A tortfeasor who causes death is made liable in damages.  Only one action may be brought, and the period of limitation for bringing it is being extended from one year to three years.</P>
    <P>Section 4 provides for damages.  The section caused us much thought.  We tried to get a wider definition of damages.  We were well aware that many people consider that awards in fatal cases are too small.  We eventually abandoned the proposed definition, however, because we were of <Col N="799" /> opinion that it might only lead to a lot of litigation to settle finally what it actually meant, and because we were satisfied that in the eventual result it would place the dependents in no better position.  Sub-section (1) of the section, accordingly, follows the wording of the 1846 Act.</P>
    <P>Sub-section (2), which is new to the law, allows damages to be awarded in respect of expenses actually incurred by the dependents or by the deceased by reason of the tort.  This provision was inserted to cover funeral and medical expenses, which cannot at the moment be recovered.  Sentimental damages may not be awarded at present and we do not propose they should.  Nothing is given for bereavement, or for pain and suffering, or for loss of the society of the deceased.  It is, to our way of thinking, impractical to introduce the type of speculation which would be inherent in trying to assess in money the sentimental loss of a relative, and we are convinced that it should not be attempted.</P>
    <P>Even so, we do realise that there is a strong case to be made for the view that awards in fatal cases should be higher.  This can only be brought about if, in time, the courts are persuaded to be more liberal.  The persuasion is for the members of the legal profession, and I am afraid there is nothing the Legislature can do to help.  It should be remembered that, though the amount awarded for a very serious personal injury is often much greater than what would be awarded for a death, the question of the pain and suffering a seriously injured person has to undergo for the rest of his life must, in a non-fatal case, be taken into account, in addition to the loss of earnings.  In a death case, there is only the question of loss of earnings: the sentimental loss is not capable of estimation.  This is not to say, however, that there is little to be said for the argument that the difference in amounts is in many cases far too great, but I cannot see how that can be remedied, except, as I have pointed out, by the arguments of legal practitioners before the courts.</P>
    <P>Section 5 is concerned with the sums which are not to be taken into account <Col N="800" /> in assessing damages.  Under paragraph (a), insurance payable on death is to be excluded; this has been the law since 1908.  Paragraph (b) goes much further than the existing law by providing that pensions, gratuities and other like benefits are not to be taken into account.  This is a very important and beneficial provision.  At present, in a death case, where the widow and children become entitled to a gratuity or pension, other than a social welfare benefit, the payments to which they are entitled must be taken into account in assessing damages.  This is not alone the law here bat it is the law in England and the Six Counties, and it is the law in Canada.</P>
    <P>Our proposal is that no amounts, except, of course, workmen's compensation, payable under statute or otherwise on the death are to be taken into account in assessing damages. This means that the members of the family of a deceased person will be entitled to the pension or gratuity payable as a result of the death and also full damages, calculated as if no pension or gratuity were payable.  Statutory pensions and gratuities are payable under the various enactments covering the superannuation of members of the Civil Service, the local government service, the Gardaí and the Defence Forces.  Payments are in addition made on death under the Ministers and Parliamentary Offices Acts.  Companies like the E.S.B. have pension schemes for the widows and children of their officers, and payments under these schemes will be excluded in calculating damages, as also will payments made by an ordinary public or private company.</P>
    <P>An example will illustrate the effect of the proposed provision.  If a serving civil servant dies, his wife is entitled to a gratuity equal to a year's salary. Let us suppose that the gratuity comes to £500 and that the widow has a good cause of action by reason of the fact that her husband's death was caused by the negligence of another person while driving a motor-car.</P>
    <P>In assessing damages under the existing legislation, the court must take into account the fact that the widow is entitled to £500 gratuity from <Col N="801" /> the Minister for Finance, and the damages will be reduced accordingly. Where, if there had been no question of a gratuity, she would have been awarded £2,000, she will, under the existing law, only get £1,500.  Under the Bill, however, she will be entitled to the full award of £2,000 from the court, and she will get the £500 gratuity as well from the Minister for Finance.  Accordingly, she will be £500 better off.</P>
    <P>I should mention that there is another side to a case like this.  It is possible to prevent a widow reaping the benefit of the proposal in the Bill by a provision in the pension legislation or scheme that the gratuity is to be subject to deduction on account of compensation received in respect of death.  There were provisions to this effect in the Garda Síochána Pensions Orders but they were repealed in the 1955 Order.</P>
    <P>Section 6 of the Bill provides for the survival of causes of action against the estate of a deceased wrongdoer.  The section follows the principle to be found in Section 171 of the Road Traffic Act, 1933, which covers proceedings against the estate of a deceased person who has been liable for the negligent driving or management of a mechnically propelled vehicle.</P>
    <P>Section 7 deals with death caused by the negligent driving of a State-owned vehicle and also follows a provision in the 1933 Road Traffic Act. Here I should like to refer to a question which may be raised by Senators and which was in fact raised by an amendment ruled out of order in the Dáil.  This amendment was put down by Deputy Vivion de Valera and was ruled out of order as placing a prospective charge on public funds. The Deputy sought to make the State liable in so far as the Bill was concerned, first in respect of the torts of its servants; secondly, in respect of the breach of any duty which a person owes to his servants; and, thirdly, in respect of the breach of any duty attaching at common law to the ownership, occupation, possession or control of property.  What the amendment sought to do was to provide that the <Col N="802" /> legal relationship of master and servant shall apply to a State servant in the same way as it applies to an ordinary servant, that is, of course, for the purpose of making the State liable for the acts of its servants committed in the course of their employment.</P>
    <P>We did consider a provision on the lines suggested in the amendment, but we decided to leave the matter over for consideration in connection with a State Proceedings Bill.  Such a Bill would deal with the liability of the State for the acts of its servants, the position of independent contractors, the procedure to be followed in suing the State and other related matters.  The whole question is a complicated one, and it is not as easy to provide the right solution as might at first glance appear.</P>
    <P>The State already accepts liability in the case of State-owned vehicles, and the relationship of master and servant applies under the Workmen's Compensation Acts in the case of a State workman. The amendment put down in the Dáil followed the wording of Section 2 of the British Crown Proceedings Act, 1947, which was applied to the Six Counties in 1949.  This section is, however, to be read in conjunction with the whole British Act.</P>
    <P>For instance, the defence forces in Britain are excluded from that Act in cases where a member thereof is injured or killed in circumstances which entitle him or his dependents to a pension from the State.  I should like to remind Senators that, where persons are injured or killed by the actions of State servants in this country, <i>ex-gratia</i> payments are made by the Minister for Finance in practically all cases.  We realise that this type of payment is not a proper substitute for a legal right to damages.  We think, however, that the whole subject of the State's liability is one for separate legislation, and we are examining the position.  I have dealt at some length with this subject in order to show that we were quite alive to what was involved.</P>
    <P>Section 8 adapts any references in existing legislation to the Fatal Accidents Acts.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="803" /> Section 9 is the repeals section and Section 10 is the short title section.</P>
    <P>I trust I have given the House a sufficient outline of the objects of the Bill.  We feel that this is a piece of law reform which is necessary and desirable.</P>

Ní haon díobháil iad a chur i bhfeidhm.</P>
      <P>While, generally speaking, I welcome the provisions of this Bill, I feel, at the same time, it is my duty to point out that it would be far more satisfactory from the point of view of giving constructive consideration to it and to its provisions, if we had more time to consider it.  Unfortunately, we had no expectation, when we last met here, that this measure was to come before us on this occasion.  That is to be regretted, because we are here bringing about rather important changes in the law relating to fatal accidents and because of their very nature it would be advisable and desirable that the members of Seanad Éireann should have plenty of time to consider the significance of the proposed alterations, in the light of the modern world that we live in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>After all, this is essentially a revising Chamber and, that being so, I will say this and I will say no more about it.  It is always desirable, in the case of important Bills, that there should be, between the passing of those Bills <Col N="804" /> through Dáil Éierann and their consideration by Seanad Éireann, plenty of time to examine them carefully.  I am aware, of course, that it is possible to get time for the consideration of the Committee Stage.  That is as it should be but, at the same time, we must remember that the principles of the Bill, by which I mean the things that go to the very root of it, are the things that we consider on the occasion of the Second Reading.  While it is something to have plenty of time to consider the Committee Stage, it is also sometimes very necessary to have plenty of time to consider the Second Stage.</P>
    <P>However, I am prepared to give this measure support for the simple reason that it proposes to bring about changes in the law relating to fatal injuries &mdash; changes which, I understand, have been a long time under consideration. I think everybody must admit that the law which could have been described as suitable or appropriate for the circumstances of 100 years ago, 50 years, or even 20 years ago, may not be appropriate in the circumstances of the present age, especially when we consider the big increase in the number of mechanically-propelled vehicles on the roads of the country.</P>
    <P>While certain changes are being contemplated in this measure to which I am prepared, as one Senator, to give support, changes which, I think, are desirable and which the Minister has said are desirable and necessary in this modern age, there is still one anomaly in the law relating to fatal accidents that remains and will remain, as far as I can see, even after the passage of this measure.  For instance, a great many people up and down the country, and even a good many members of the legal profession, take the view that it is strange concerning the assessment of damages or compensation for accidents on the roads, the assessment is nearly always greater in the case of a person who has been injured than it is in the case of a person who has been killed outright. I will go further and say that it could even happen, under the present law, that a person who has sustained an injury, even only to his <Col N="805" /> hand, will himself get damages greater, and much greater in amount than the personal representatives of a person who has been killed on the road.</P>
    <P>I for one think that is an anomaly, and while, perhaps, it may not be possible to have that anomaly removed in the present Bill, at the same time it should get consideration at some future date.  I know very well that the courts have a certain method of assessing compensation in these cases.  They take into account the trade or profession the person has been engaged in and his usefulness to his family, and not merely his usefulness to them at the time of the accident, but his usefulness to that family if he had continued in that employment.  In other words, as well as having a real assessment of the usefulness of the person in question to his family, there must be also a notional assessment in his case of his services to his family and dependents had he lived.</P>
    <P>But while I have said that the anomaly still remains that a person who sustained an injury can get greater compensation in a court than the personal representatives of a person killed outright, I know, of course, the grounds on which that differentiation is made.  It is held that a person who has been badly maimed or injured will have to suffer pain and loss for the rest of his life, and also that he will be a burden on his own people while he lives.  These things must no doubt be taken into consideration, but at the same time, apart entirely from any legal interpretation that may be put on these matters, the ordinary member of society would look upon the death of a person as being a far greater loss and tragedy than if that person were maimed, and not killed.</P>
    <P>These are just a few general remarks I have to make on this amending Bill. The Minister described it in the other House as a codification measure.  No doubt, it is a codification measure to a certain extent.  As Senators are aware, and as has been mentioned in the other House, the law relating to fatal accidents is now over 100 years old.  The law to which I refer is, of course, Lord Campbell's Act.  It was <Col N="806" /> only under this Act that any compensation at all in ordinary cases could have been got in the case of fatal accidents.  As people will see, even the provisions of that Act appear to have been rather grudgingly and sparingly given, because there were certain conditions attached to that Act which were not attached to other legislation of a similar kind.</P>
    <P>For instance, one of these was &mdash; and still is, until we pass this measure before us &mdash; that the claim for compensation should be made within 12 months of the fatal accident.  I see that that is now being amended and that the time limit is being extended to three years.  That is, no doubt, an improvement and a liberalisation of the law, but, at the same time, I would hold the same view as certain speakers in the other House, that even that limitation is hardly justifiable, and that the time limit that applies to ordinary tort law should also apply to this.  I do not know whether the Minister gave any justification in the other House for the differentiation.  As I say, I have not had time to go into this matter properly, but I would like to hear the Minister on that point &mdash; why he considers the differentiation necessary, between this and other cases under the law of tort.</P>
    <P>Section 2 deals with dependents who will be entitled to get compensation under this measure when it becomes law.  I would say that the Minister is doing a good job when he applies the provision to a wider circle of relations than has hitherto been the case.  There are now being included brothers and sisters, half-brothers and half-sisters, adopted persons, illegitimate persons and persons to whom the deceased stood <i>in loco parentis.</i>  That is a step in the right direction, but the only trouble and the only argument that could be advanced against it is that the class of relations who up to now would have been solely entitled under Lord Campbell's Act to compensation will be in danger of getting less now from a jury in the case of a fatal accident.  However, we cannot have it both ways.</P>
    <P>I was wondering if the Minister and his Department have considered the <Col N="807" /> question of dependents in another light, because it could happen that there would be no brothers or sisters or half-brothers or half-sisters or any very near relations at all and there would still be a deserving dependent, such as a nephew or niece, or uncle or aunt, who should be taken into account but who would not come into all the categories mentioned here.  I wonder whether it would not be possible to have that contingency provided for, because, if I am not mistaken, such a contingency is provided for in other branches of statute law.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonKissane" hpid="Mr. Kissane Mr. Kissane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kissane</NameTxt>
      <P>I would say that in the case of I.R.A. dependents' pensions, the overriding consideration is dependency, whatever the degree of relationship between the person who died and the person who makes the claim. Where dependency can be proved by the person who makes the claim, in respect of a relative, he has a good case.  I am putting that point to the Minister for his consideration.</P>
      <P>I know that it is very difficult to deal with these points all together, because, as we have said in connection with another Bill which we were discussing here quite recently, when you go about doing good in one direction, there is sometimes a danger that you may do damage in another.  That is one of the things we have to take into account.</P>
      <P>There is another point arising out of Section 5 which did not give me any anxiety until I heard the Minister's own statement, or at least until I read it, because I got a copy of the Minister's statement before he came into the House by way of courtesy, and I am thankful to him for that.  I see that, in connection with Section 5, he said:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Our proposal is that no amounts except, of course, workmen's compensation payable under statute or otherwise on the death are to be taken into account in assessing damages. This means that the members of the family of a deceased person will be entitled to the pension or <Col N="808" /> gratuity payable as a result of the death and also full damages calculated as if no pension or gratuity were payable.  Statutory pensions and gratuities are payable under the various enactments covering the superannuation of members of the Civil Service, the local government service, the Gardaí and the Defence Forces.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I do not know why the Minister has mentioned these bodies specifically, because I have always a feeling that when certain categories are mentioned like that specifically, there is a danger later on that other categories will be omitted.  I take, for instance, people who are in receipt of military service pensions, I.R.A. pensions.  Are they to be included in this provision?</P>

      <P>Very well, then.  If it is the case in connection with these persons, that the pensions or gratuities they would be in receipt of will be excluded, from calculation in assessment of damages, I have nothing that will cause me anxiety.  My reason for putting the question was that they are not mentioned at all here, but the other classes of persons are.  Perhaps it would be as well, in order to clear the air and to remove any possible doubt, that the Minister would consider that between this and the Committee Stage, since he did make specific reference to certain other bodies.</P>
      <P>The Minister has mentioned State liability, in connection with which an amendment was tabled in the other House.  I am aware that any attempt to deal with that comprehensively under this measure would be very difficult.  I understand from the Minister that it is proposed to deal with that question later on, that is, the liability of the State for its servants in the matter of tort, in the matter of fatal injuries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is not an unimportant measure. I consider it an important one and <Col N="809" /> therefore it would be right that we should have time to give its provisions the utmost consideration.  What we do here now will regulate the position of claims for compensation for fatal injuries, for many years to come.</P>
    <P>Sin a bhfuil le rá agam an babhta so, agus tá súil agam go bhfaghfaimid an fhaid aimsire sin atá ag teastáil uainn chun forálacha an Bhille seo do scrúdú go mion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ArthurCox" hpid="Mr. Cox Mr. Cox">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>There are some points I should like to mention.  One point that has occurred to me is that, as the Minister is aware, under the Air Navigation Act the Warsaw Convention applies to fatal accidents in the air. This Bill appears to apply to all fatal accidents and, if so, it would appear to repeal the provisions of our Air Navigation Act which limited the amount of damages payable under a fatal air accident under the international convention.  I do not know if that is intended and I doubt very much if it is, so I thought I should draw the Minister's attention to it.  It appears to me that this Bill as framed would conflict with the law as stated, and that might raise the question of international air conventions.</P>
      <P>Another point that occurs to me is that there may be possible danger in Section 4, which says that the damages shall be such amount as the jury or the judge, as the case may be, may think proportionate.  I am not criticising that in the slightest, but as everybody knows, it is possible at the present time, on an appeal ultimately to the Supreme Court, that the court might hold that the damages given were either excessive or were inadequate. It seems to me that that right of appeal, so far as it does lie in certain cases, is a right which, in the interests of both sides, should be retained, if possible.  I am by no means certain that Section 4 may not knock it out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like the Minister to consider also the period in which the action may be taken.  There are two cases &mdash; one is where the person who did the injury is still living and the other is where he is dead.  In the first case, probably the period of three years may <Col N="810" /> be fair enough.  It is, of course, a considerable extension of one year. Under the Air Navigation Act it is two years.  The extension to three is rather long, but at the same time it may be fair.  In the case of an action against the representatives of a deceased person, however, it seems to me that to let the possibility of an action hang on for three years may mean in certain cases that the estate of the deceased cannot be wound up.  I know that in most cases nowadays we are very accustomed to think of deaths arising from motor accidents, in which case it is always an insurance policy, but it does not necessarily follow that that would invariably be the case. While I fully agree that it is just for the remedy to continue against the estate of the deceased person, I think the period of three years is too long and may mean working an injustice the other way round.  That particular provision should be thought over.  The Bill is a very welcome one, if for nothing else than that it codifies and clears up a number of points in various laws.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LouisWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>In consequence of modern traffic conditions and the craze for speed, the number of dependents who would be entitled to damages grows greater each year.  Therefore, this Bill is more than justified.  The Bill provides a number of desirable amendments to the existing law, arising from the fatal injury to a breadwinner in a family, and therefore it is a further step in the march of progress towards better social justice for dependents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In connection with the definition of dependents, members of a family, as set out in Section 2, I feel that injustices may still exist.  A spinster aunt or a bachelor uncle who may be incapable of work may be seriously injured in consequence of the fatal injury to a nephew who may be trying to carry on on an uneconomic holding in one of the western counties.  It is a usual thing for an elderly spinster to try to carry on the home in which she was reared and the holding is so uneconomic that unless some relative like a nephew comes along to help her &mdash; and to obtain work for himself on <Col N="811" /> the roads or on other public schemes during the winter months &mdash; it is impossible for her to carry on.  The only alternative would be for her to sell the small holding and go into the county home.  I suggest that the Minister should reconsider that point.  He has already suggested that if there are too many dependents it may deprive the widow and children of a fair share of the total award.  That is not always the case &mdash; there are often no next-of-kin of the first degree, as in the instance I have given.  I think the Minister should include a provision whereby, if there is no immediate relative and still there is a dependent such as an aunt or uncle, they would be included.</P>
    <P>The Minister has already referred to the fact that under the Workmen's Compensation Acts the total award is £1,800.  If he had any fear as to insurance companies increasing their premiums substantially in consequence of including further dependents than those already in the Bill, then he could limit the total award as in the case I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, it is not a very desirable thing to allow a jury to assess and apportion the damages between the various dependents.  As a result of the numbers of dependents now included, the number of people may be very considerable. If this question of damages is left entirely to a jury, the standard which they apply may vary very much, according to the type of composition of the particular jury, whether for instance they are motorists or a rural jury whose standard of living would be lower and who would assess the damages at a lower amount.  Under this Bill, it would be normal to have a jury, unless all the parties consent that the action should be heard by a judge.  But, as there would be so many parties, in consequence of the number of dependents, it might be difficult to get the consent of all the parties.  The ordinary practice in the Circuit Court is to serve a notice and that notice sets out whether or not a jury is required.  In other words, if the plaintiff in his notice of trial does <Col N="812" /> not request a jury, a jury is not brought in.</P>
    <P>It is suggested that there would be few actions in the Circuit Court, because of the limited jurisdiction of that court.  The jurisdiction in that court is, as far as I know, £600.  But, on account of the number included as dependents under this Bill, it is possible that the claim &mdash; because of the fact that a grandmother or some elderly person may be involved &mdash; may be small.  For that reason, I can visualise that quite a number of actions will be brought in the Circuit Court, rather than in the High Court. I understand that, under a case which has been mentioned in the other House &mdash; Gallagher v. the E.S.B. &mdash; it will be necessary to have an actuary to give evidence on behalf of the plaintiff.</P>
    <P>That is another reason why I think the apportionment of the damages between the next-of-kin and the dependents should be done by the judge rather than by the jury.  He is more of an expert.  He is much better qualified to apportion the damages.  If necessary, he can call in an actuary or an expert to assist him in assessing the damages between those who are entitled to them.  That cannot very well be done by a jury.  For instance, there is no jury in the case of workmen's compensation.  The application is heard by the judge and the judge awards the damages amongst the dependents. I might mention that, under that Act, there is apparently no restriction on dependents, such as there is in this Bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated that juries could easily tend to award the same amount in damages, irrespective of the number of dependents.  Surely that is another reason why a judge would be better qualified and more suitable in the assessing of these damages?  As a number of speakers have already complained, juries, in fatal accident cases, do not appear to award the same high damages as they do in non-fatal cases. Possibly judges may take a more realistic outlook on such a matter.  It is suggested that the courts should be more liberal and that that is a matter for the lawyers.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="813" /> I should also like the Minister to consider whether people under disability &mdash; for instance, people who are temporarily insane &mdash; are properly protected as people who might benefit as dependents.  Only one action can be brought for all the dependents and a person who may be in a mental home at the time of the death may only be there for a short period and would possibly be a dependent and his rights would require to be properly safeguarded. In sub-section (4) of Section 4 it is set out: &ldquo;The amount recovered in the action shall, after having deducted the costs not recovered from the defendant....&rdquo;  I wonder if it is necessary to insert the words &ldquo;and expenses&rdquo;.  Possibly the word &ldquo;costs&rdquo; would be sufficient to cover expenses, but, in case it would not, perhaps the Minister would consider that point. Apart from this, this Bill is a very desirable one and certainly it is very proper that the time limit should be extended to three years.</P>
    <P>I am aware of a case of a fatal accident in my county where correspondence had gone on for a very long time between the solicitor and the insurance company.  Eventually, a year elapsed and, after that time, the insurance company refused to accept any responsibility.  The solicitor in the case had to pay a very substantial amount out of his own pocket, because he felt that he was somewhat negligent in not bringing the proceedings in time.  Senator Cox has pointed out that a person may live for over a year after the injury and the dependents cannot then bring the action.  It is very proper, therefore, that the limit should be extended to the time mentioned in the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. Everett Mr. Everett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>I deeply appreciate and I welcome the constructive criticism of the members of this House.  I should like to take this opportunity to express my thanks to the legal profession on both sides of the House and in both Houses for the assistance they have given me in trying to produce a Bill not from any Party point of view, but one which, in the opinion of both Houses, will do good to the general public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can assure Senator Kissane that <Col N="814" /> we have given very careful consideration to this particular Bill.  He raised the question of the three years and personal injuries.  Under the Statute of Limitations Bill, which has been issued and circulated to Deputies and Senators, the three years' limitation period will apply to personal injuries actions.</P>
    <P>Senator Kissane also raised the position of pensions payable to Old I.R.A. men.  As far as I know, widows or dependents of Old I.R.A. pensioners are not entitled to pensions on the death of the pensioner, but, if they were, these pensions payable to the widow or dependents could not be taken into account under the Bill.  It is the pensions payable to the widow and dependents on the death that are not to be taken into account &mdash; not pensions payable to a person irrespective of whether there is a death or not.</P>
    <P>I tried to meet the wishes of all sides of the Dáil by including a larger number of dependents: one speaker said we had put in too many.  I think the Senator's point is to some extent met by the provision that any persons considered persons to whom the de-deceased stood in the position of a parent and <i>vice versa</i> are also covered. We put in these words so that a person who received any benefits from the person killed, such as was described by Senator Kissane and Senator Walsh would, if there were the relationship of <i>in loco parentis</i>, be en-entitled to benefit.</P>
    <P>Senator Cox raised a point in regard to damages under Section 4.  We are following exactly the words in the 1846 Act.  On the question of the three-year period, we think a year is too short.  We are extending the period to three years in all personal injuries cases, and I think that is the fairest period.  One year was too short, especially where a death took place and the dependent might be sick or ill or otherwise unable to pursue his action within 12 months of the death.</P>
    <P>Senator Walsh pointed out that there may be genuine dependents who are not covered by the Bill.  I know it can happen that a dependent in some way may not come in under the Bill.  These things will happen.  The officials of the <Col N="815" /> Department and myself endeavoured to do everything we possibly could with the suggestions received from all sides of the House so as to try to cover as many as ought to be covered and to do Justice to everybody concerned in the action.</P>
    <P>Senator Walsh also spoke about juries.  I am informed that at present you must have a jury, except by consent, when you must have the judge. That is the law since 1936.  If the law is not acted on in the Circuit Court it does not make it any less the law: parties have the privilege of a jury. Under the Bill, the juries will divide up the amount, whereas the judge now divides it.  I do not want to misrepresent the Senator in any way.  I suggest, however, you cannot have a judge alone in these particular cases, except where there is agreement.</P>
    <P>This Bill is not controversial.  It is not based on Party lines, as I said.  I appreciate the constructive criticism and assistance I have received in both Houses and from all sides.  I shall consider all the points raised between now and Committee Stage and, if it is necessary, I shall bring in amendments. When we pass this Bill, we will have an Act which will be the result of the united wisdom of all sections of the Legislature and which will do the best for the greatest number.</P>

      <P>May I ask a question which arises out of a statement made by the Minister just now in relation to my reference to I.R.A. pensions? While the exemption in the case of the assessment of damages or compensation would apply to a man who is in receipt of an I.R.A. pension, did I understand the Minister to say that it would not apply to his wife, if she were in receipt of an I.R.A. pension?</P>

      <P>I should like to submit that I am in a position to go on with this particular motion.  I understand that the proposer, Senator Crowley, has asked to have this motion postponed, but I should like to ask the House to consider that, where the proposer of a motion is present in the House and is prepared to go ahead with it, but is precluded by reason of the fact that the Minister is not available, the motion should take precedence over any other motion on the Order Paper.</P>

      <P>I should like to submit also that the motion in regard to wheat prices is of considerable urgency.  I think it would be most important to have it dealt with before the Dáil adjourns for the Christmas recess.  If it cannot be taken owing to the pressure of legislative business, I should submit that the Seanad ought to meet on the following day in order to dispose of it.</P>
