      <P>It is hoped that we will finish item No. 1 and that we will not have to meet to-morrow.  We may finish the whole Order Paper, but if the Senator wants to know whether we will meet to-morrow morning for item No. 4, the answer is in the negative.</P>

      <P>May I draw your attention, a Cathaoirleach, to Rule 18 of the Standing Orders:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Unless it shall otherwise resolve, the Seanad shall meet on Wednesdays and Thursdays at 3 p.m., and on Fridays at 10.30 a.m.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>There is nothing to prevent the Seanad from resolving to-night to adjourn to the 1st of February. The other House is adjourning to the 8th of February, and it is the intention that this House should meet on the 1st, which will enable the Minister for Justice to have his Bill for the other House when it meets.</P>

      <P>On a point of order, it had originally been my intention to raise the matter of this motion on the Adjournment the last time, but, under good advice, I decided that it would be fairer to the House <Col N="930" /> and to the Taoiseach not to do so on the very day the Taoiseach was speaking, but to put down a motion for a general discussion.  I had in my mind that the fact of my putting down the motion would not lead to the putting off of the discussion on the matter for another six weeks or two months. It is my earnest hope, therefore, that the Seanad will be permitted to discuss this and, if necessary, to meet to-morrow morning to do so &mdash; though I hope that will not be necessary.</P>

    <Title>Gaming and Lotteries Bill, 1955&mdash;Committee Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 36:&mdash;</P>
    <P>To add a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(3) This section shall not render a lottery which is promoted within the State and in respect of which no person outside the State is entitled to purchase any ticket, counterfoil, coupon or chance unlawful by reason only of the fact that documents, books, records, or other papers are transmitted outside the State to the trustees of or to the object of the charitable or philanthropic purpose or purposes for which the lottery is promoted: Provided always that such lottery is duly permitted or licensed under this Act. &mdash; (Senator Cox.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="ArthurCox" hpid="Mr. Cox Mr. Cox">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>I was speaking yesterday of the desirability of allowing certain lotteries here for charities in Northern Ireland.  If the House approves of that principle, a section of this kind is clearly necessary.  I hope the Minister will approve of it.  As the amendment stands, it clearly cannot cause injury to anyone.  The fact that the documents are sent out of the State does not, in itself, make it illegal, provided that no tickets for this lottery are sold outside the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>A lottery may be promoted here to help the institution <Col N="931" /> the Senator has in mind.  The only operative part of this proposed new sub-section appears to me to be the statement that the documents may be transmitted outside the State.  I think the records must be available here for examination, and subsequently they may be transmitted outside the State, but whether you need to make legislative provision for such transmission, I do not know.  The statement made yesterday, that a lottery may be promoted inside the State for this purpose, seems to cover this point, unless the Senator means that the documents would be kept outside the State and would not be available for examination inside the State &mdash; and I take it that the Senator does not mean that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ArthurCox" hpid="Mr. Cox Mr. Cox">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  If it were to commend itself to Senator Hayes, I should be agreeable to amend my amendment to read &ldquo;provided always that they would be available for examination within the State&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that necessary? If they would be available, presumably their transmission outside would not be illegal.  Perhaps Senator Cox would give the matter further consideration, in the light of this discussion, and see whether the amendment is necessary at all.  If he does not mean that the documents are to be held all the time outside the State there may be some method of arriving at a conclusion. Of course, I am not in a position to say whether a conclusion could, in fact, be arrived at.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ArthurCox" hpid="Mr. Cox Mr. Cox">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not suggesting that the documents and records should not be available in this State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>Then it should be possible to arrange it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ArthurCox" hpid="Mr. Cox Mr. Cox">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>If that were to meet the objection, I would be willing to put down a somewhat amended amendment on the next stage which would include a provision that the documents would always be available for inspection by the authorities or anyone authorised to inspect them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>If they were so <Col N="932" /> available, would any amendment be necessary?  Is there not power already in the Bill to allow this kind of lottery?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ArthurCox" hpid="Mr. Cox Mr. Cox">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not lightly put down this amendment.  I have moved it after consideration and after discussing the matter with counsel.  They feel that unless this amendment is inserted it might be said that such a lottery was illegal simply because the books might be sent out for examination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="ArthurCox" hpid="Mr. Cox Mr. Cox">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>I will bring forward on the next stage an amended amendment making provision that they would always be available for inspection here. I hope it will be accepted.</P>

      <P>Very good.</P>
      <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
      <P>Section 26 put and agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">SECTION 27.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RogerMcHugh" hpid="Dr. McHugh Dr. McHugh">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McHugh</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 37:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (2), paragraph (a), line 9, after &ldquo;lottery&rdquo; to add &ldquo;and shall be an Irish citizen ordinarily resident in the State&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>With the permission of the Chair, I should like to associate with this amendment, amendment No. 38, which reads as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (2) to add a new paragraph as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(d) the beneficiary shall be an Irish citizen or a group of persons who are Irish citizens, ordinarily resident in the State.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of these two amendments is the same as that of amendments Nos. 40 and 41.  It is really to ensure that, as far as possible, these lotteries shall be held within our jurisdiction and run by Irish nationals and controlled <Col N="933" /> by people who are answerable to the authority of this State.  It probably would be most undesirable to have such lotteries controlled either by aliens or by people whose period of residence in this country was short or temporary.  These amendments would not have the effect of cutting off help to worthy charities in the Six Counties whether these charities be Catholic, Protestant or Presbyterian.  They would not hinder the operation by a person or group of persons or by a corporate body of lotteries designed to help objects in the Six Counties.  The amendments would simply ensure that such lotteries would be supervised by the State which would thus provide some sort of guarantee to the public that funds subscribed by them would be properly administered and also that the beneficiary &mdash; that is, the person or body receiving the funds &mdash; would be Irish nationals.  If the beneficiary wishes to pass on the funds to somebody in the Six Counties, and if this is clearly understood by the subscribing public, then, of course, no difficulty about the Six County area arises.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ArthurCox" hpid="Mr. Cox Mr. Cox">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards the amendment to Section 27, I would think it is clearly wrong to pass legislation which would preclude Irish people who happen to be resident in the Six Counties from being able to participate in such matters in the Twenty-Six Counties.  It seems to me that anything like that is directly contrary to all our aspirations and ideals.  I notice that the new Nationality and Citizenship Bill which has been circulated by the Government provides that Irish people in the Six Counties will be Irish citizens.  It seems to be quite contrary to the ideas that Senator McHugh is putting forward.</P>
      <P>Senator McHugh has referred to other amendments to a subsequent section. As I understand one of these amendments, that is, amendment No. 41, it relates to the beneficiary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>So does amendment No. 38.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ArthurCox" hpid="Mr. Cox Mr. Cox">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>The other amendment seems to refer to the beneficiary.  If passed, I think that would directly cut out the kinds of objects which I am <Col N="934" /> trying to speak for and which I am quite certain everyone in the House must have sympathy with.  I should certainly like to oppose the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to express my agreement with Senator Cox; I think it is also the position of the Minister in this matter.  What do these two amendments, taken together, mean if we assume that &ldquo;beneficiary&rdquo; means the person or object benefiting? It would seem that under amendment No. 38 you prevent a lottery from being run for the Mater Hospital, Belfast &mdash; which was spoken about last night and in relation to which everybody was in sympathy &mdash; or simply for the foreign missions, the ultimate beneficiaries of which are not Irish citizens at all.  I do not imagine Senator McHugh wants that position but I think a combination of amendments Nos. 37 and 38 would surely give that position.</P>
      <P>On general grounds &mdash; considering our own position in Great Britain and other places, for example &mdash; it would be rather curious for us to prevent a well-behaved person resident in this State from engaging in this business. As regards the beneficiary, it would be very difficult to determine who the ultimate beneficiary is.  It would seem to be more reasonable to leave the Bill as it has been drafted &mdash; leaving the onus on the Gardaí to make it clear that the person who is running the lottery is a reputable person.  I doubt that the Senator means to exclude the charities in the Six Counties or a charitable matter like the foreign missions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RogerMcHugh" hpid="Dr. McHugh Dr. McHugh">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McHugh</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly I do not intend to exclude such charities.  When I speak of beneficiary, I mean beneficiary actually within the State, that is, a group of persons or a corporate body answerable to this State.  The ultimate beneficiary might be in the Six Counties.  If the beneficiary passes on the funds and the public clearly understands it intends to pass on the funds to the Mater Hospital or the foreign missions, and so forth, that is not a matter for us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>Would that not be a curiously unworkable scheme?</P>

    <Col N="935" />
    <Speaker pid="ArthurCox" hpid="Mr. Cox Mr. Cox">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me that the use of the word &ldquo;beneficiary&rdquo; in that amendment is to use it in a sense in which it is never used.</P>
      <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 38 not moved.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RogerMcHugh" hpid="Dr. McHugh Dr. McHugh">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McHugh</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I can raise the matter again on the Report Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LouisWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 39:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (3), line 15, after &ldquo;beneficiary&rdquo; to add &ldquo;except in the case of a lottery promoted for a charitable, religious or philanthropic purpose when the lottery may be held not more than once in each week, the participating fee or price or ticket not to exceed 1/- and the total prize money not to exceed £25 at each such draw&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>A great number of our churches, halls, monasteries, convents, schools and colleges have been built as a result of the assistance received through raffles. One of the best known types of raffle &mdash; it is well known to members of this House &mdash; is what is called a silver circle. It is a weekly raffle.  The members subscribe 1/- each week for a period of 20 weeks.  It has been run in many parts of the country for a good number of years past.  Under the Bill, as at present drafted, a superintendent of the Garda Síochána would not have authority to give a permit for a raffle each week.  He would only be entitled to give a permit for a raffle once in six months.  As an alternative, however, the promoter can apply to the District Court for permission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>Under Section 28.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LouisWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, under Section 28.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>Does that not settle it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LouisWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>It does, but I think it is undesirable at times that promoters should have to adopt the procedure of going to the District Court, when the superintendent should have the authority to permit such a raffle since <Col N="936" /> the amount each week is limited to the sum of £25 and the stake is only 1/- for each member.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ArthurCox" hpid="Mr. Cox Mr. Cox">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support Senator Walsh.  First of all, it is for a charitable or philanthropic purpose. It is obviously a very small matter.  I think one is going too far in a Bill like this in stopping all sorts of things which have been carried on for years and years.  A small lottery for a charitable purpose can clearly not inculcate the gambling habit.  It seems to be a little unreasonable that a charity organising that kind of lottery should have to go to the expense of applying to the District Court.  That may be quite fair in the case of a big lottery, but, in the case of this type of lottery it seems to be quite reasonable to leave it in the hands of the Garda Síochána.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>Under Section 27, the onus is placed on the superintendent of the Garda Síochána to issue certain permits.  Senator Walsh is endeavouring to meet the case of charitable or church lotteries which take place weekly or monthly for certain purposes.  His scheme is that the superintendent of the Garda Síochána should also have power to determine in regard to these and the scheme in the Bill is that they should be decided under Section 28.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would suggest that it is not any very great hardship to ask that an application be made to the District Court.  In effect, if the superintendent were in favour of the application, as he would normally be, if it fulfils the conditions laid down in Senator Walsh's amendment, the court would grant the application at once.  It would be available for 12 months or for any period.  Permission could be given to hold this particular lottery every month or every week as the applicants desired.  I think this is more a matter that should be decided by the court than by the superintendent.  It is not easy to decide what is a charitable purpose.  That would be something for the District Court rather than for the superintendent.  I think there would be no difficulty at all in getting a decision in favour of the kind of thing <Col N="937" /> which Senator Walsh has in mind in his amendment and which Senator Cox quite properly supported.  Section 28 makes ample provision.  In fact, it makes rather better provision in a way than the amendment does for the kind of thing Senator Walsh has in mind.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DominickMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>May I point out that, if the amendment were accepted, the provision in regard to the division of the gross proceeds under paragraph (e) of Section 28 would not apply?  I think that is desirable in the case of these continuing lotteries.  I think the Senator may be satisfied that the best arrangement would be under Section 28.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LouisWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that a charity is limited to a charitable or philanthropic purpose, it can be visualised that they would prefer to allow more than 40 per cent. of the raffle to be used up in expenses.  These are local raffles and every week there is practically no expenditure whatsoever. It is confined to a village or town.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>They are voluntary workers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LouisWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>All the people associated with that will, as Senator Hickey says, be working in a voluntary capacity. Sometimes, in certain places, there is no District Court for maybe two months.  I take it that a fair amount of notice will require to be given to the court.  I do not know what the procedure will be &mdash; it has not been laid down in the Bill &mdash; as to the notice which will be required to be given to the court.  Sometimes these functions take place with very little prior arrangement and there might not be time to serve the notice that may be prescribed under regulations, which, I presume, will be subsequently issued. However, I am not anxious to press the matter if the Minister considers it is more desirable that the courts should control this type of lottery.  Having regard to the amount of money being spent every week on fashion competitions, crossword puzzles and the rest, there seems to be no limit to the expenditure which a person can incur.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>Are we not talking <Col N="938" /> about two different objects in relation to lotteries?  Senator Walsh is talking about charitable institutions, whereas the Bill states it is for a group of individuals for their own personal enrichment.</P>

      <P>In sub-section (2), paragraph (a), line 31, after &ldquo;purposes&rdquo;, to add &ldquo;in the State and shall be controlled, organised or administered by a person who is an Irish citizen or by a group of persons who are Irish citizens or by a body incorporated in the State&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Everett)</NameTxt>
      <P>We put up a similar case on the other amendments.  Section 26 provides that a lottery shall not be unlawful if it is promoted and conducted wholly within the State in accordance with a permit or a licence.  The licensee must be resident here.  It may be necessary for the members of the Garda to inquire as to the character of the applicant, or any of the other interested parties.  The court would decide for or against granting the licences.  The Senator need have no fear but that the interests of all will be safeguarded by the decision the court may make.</P>
      <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 41 not moved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ArthurCox" hpid="Mr. Cox Mr. Cox">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 42:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (2), paragraph (c), line 34 and lines 36 and 37, to delete &ldquo;£500&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;£1,000&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This matter was discussed in the Dáil and there was not agreement with the proposals then put forward.  I suggest <Col N="939" /> that, in the case of a charity licence, the prize money should be £1,000 instead of £500.  I am aware that the Government did not accede to that then.  In view of the present value of money, it is not an unreasonable suggestion.  Presumably it is desired that the lotteries should be reasonably income-producing for the charities concerned.  Unless the prizes are fairly lucrative, that object will not be achieved.  I am bringing forward the amendment in order to have that point discussed, and, if the Government has altered its view, I think it might be wise to change from £500 to £1,000.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister raised the figure from £300 to £500 in the Dáil.  One of the arguments in the Dáil seemed to me to be a very reasonable one.  From my own experience of lotteries for charitable or church purposes, I think that if you encourage weekly lotteries with a prize up to £1,000 you might do a great deal of harm to the charity arrangements which Senator Walsh was trying to provide for in his last amendment. By allowing certain people in bigger places and with bigger resources and more voluntary workers to offer £1,000 you might have an adverse effect on a great number of very deserving charities which could not offer a figure above £500.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. Everett Mr. Everett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Hayes has explained my views.  In the Dáil, I was opposed to increasing it to £500, realising that it was going to commercialise a number of lotteries and thereby deprive the local parish priest or organiser from getting subscriptions to help local objects at 1/- a week.  Where you offer £1,000, what parochial lottery could compete with that; it means inducing people to give their shillings for the chance of £1,000 instead of subscribing for the object of the local &ldquo;silver circle&rdquo;.  For that reason, I opposed £500 in the Dáil.  I am personally against &mdash; and so is the Government &mdash; increasing the commercialising of lotteries, because it would have a very bad effect on the small lotteries in rural areas.</P>

      <P>In view of that, I cannot <Col N="940" /> press my amendment, although I feel that the Minister is making a mistake. When the Minister spoke of commercialising, perhaps he used that word for lack of a better word.  I do not think there is anything commercial in any of the lotteries.

      <P>I move amendment No. 43:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (2) to delete paragraph (d) and substitute a new paragraph (d) as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(d) Where the prizes to be awarded are of fixed sums the value of each prize shall be stated on every ticket or chance; but where a percentage of gross proceeds is allocated as prize money whether such percentage is fixed by reference to the gross proceeds of the particular lottery or any previous lottery, the percentage of the prize fund only need be stated, with the proviso that where in any lottery the amount of the prize fund exceeds the amount mentioned in the next preceding paragraph the surplus shall be applied for the benefit of the charitable or philanthropic purpose for which the lottery is promoted and the prize fund shall be limited to the amount so mentioned.</P>
      <P>This is rather a legal amendment, but one which I think is really necessary and I hope the Minister will accept it. In the preceding section, we have been speaking of a fixed sum of £500. Where the lottery takes the form of a percentage &mdash; provided it does not offend against the Totalisator Act &mdash; it is necessary to have a provision such as is contained in my suggestion.  It merely indicates to the people who get the tickets what they would have; and if the result of the division of this unfixed or this unascertained sum results in a prize that would exceed the fixed amount the surplus would go back into the charity, so that the Act would not be broken.</P>

      <P>I regret I am unable to accept the amendment.  From the information in my Department, I am satisfied that pool promotions, which are suggested in this amendment, could lend themselves very easily to manipulation and fraud on the part of the promoters.  Lotteries with prizes, the amounts of which are fixed in advance, are being permitted under this Bill and pool promotions are prohibited. I am not prepared to have pool promotions.</P>
      <P>I am hopeful that police supervision of these lotteries will be kept at a minimum and that the police will need to act only where there are complaints of sharp practice.  If pool promotions were permitted, the need for examining accounts would be much greater and more difficult and would require to be carried out in greater detail.  We do not want to see established an elaborate State machinery for supervising lotteries.</P>

      <P>(f) after the provision of the prize money and of the expenses of promotion including commission, not less than 25 per cent. of the gross proceeds shall be available for the charitable or philanthropic purpose for which the lottery is promoted.</P>
      <P>If there is not some supervision of this kind, it might easily result that, after payment of expenses and after the provision of the prizes, there would practically be nothing left to the charity.  If these lotteries are to be safeguarded to the full extent, it is necessary to ensure that the charity will, in any event, benefit by some substantial extent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another section which deals <Col N="942" /> with the percentage of the takings which can be expended in expenses. That I could agree with.

      <P>Is it not the case that, in many small parish lotteries, less than 25 per cent. accrues to the church fund, or whatever it is?  Would this not have a bad effect on them?  I realise the desirability of a fair percentage going to the particular charity. I am not quite an expert on amendment No. 43, but I have made some inquiries about the matter.  There is quite a number of small charities where the annual income after the lottery has been concluded is less than 25 per cent.  If that has been going on for years and if it has been found to be satisfactory because they are repeated over and over again, would it not be undesirable to make them illegal particularly as they are small?</P>

      <P>To add new sub-sections as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(3)  Before granting a licence the court shall have from the trustees or other authorised agent of the purpose for which the lottery is intended to be promoted a certificate in writing verified on oath by affidavit or other evidence certifying.</P>
      <P>(a)  that the purpose of the lottery is charitable or philanthropic,</P>
      <P>(b)  that the trustees of or the company organisation persons or person constituting the object of the lottery consent to the lottery being held and to the licence being granted to the applicant, and</P>
      <P>(c)  that no other lottery is being held for the same purpose.</P>
      <P>(4)  The certificate referred to in the preceding sub-section shall be <i>prima facie</i> evidence of the contents thereof.</P>
      <P>(5)  The court may, where an applicant has previously held a licence under this Act, require the production of an auditor's certificate duly verified by affidavit or other evidence regarding the allocation of the gross proceeds of any lottery promoted under such previous licence already held and of the amount received by the charitable or philanthropic purpose therefrom: Provided always that the contents of such certificate shall not be disclosed in open court unless so ordered by the court.</P>
      <P>In view of the rejection of my previous amendment, paragraph (c) would go out.  I suggest that, when application is made to the court, there should be some evidence before the court that this is being made with the approval of the charity.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. Everett Mr. Everett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in sympathy with the purpose of this amendment as far as paragraphs (a) and (b) of the new sub-section (3) are affected but I think that the court will scarcely require to <Col N="945" /> be told what it should do in hearing an application.  <i>Prima facie,</i> the court will require some evidence to show that the purpose for which the lottery is being promoted is a genuine charity. I do not think that we should say to the court that a certificate given under sub-section (3) should be accepted as <i>prima facie</i> evidence of the contents thereof.  It is precisely on this kind of statement that the court will require to hear evidence, perhaps, so as to satisfy itself that it relates to a genuine charity.  As regards sub-section (5), I am in approval of the general idea but again I feel that we should not write into the Bill what the court should do.  If an applicant has previously held a licence, and there has been any suggestion of malpractice on the part of the promoters, the investigation of such will be a matter for the police, who are empowered under Section 51 to make regulations for the keeping of accounts, the supply of auditors' statements, etc.  I think it can safely be left to the police, and other interested parties, to inform the court of any malpractices under a previous licensed lottery, and we may assume that the court will reassure itself as to the position before issuing a licence.  I think it can safely be left to the police and the courts to decide whether the lottery is run for a genuine charity or not.</P>

      <P>To add a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(3)  This section shall not apply to any place or premises which are used by a solicitor as his offices for carrying on his profession.</P>
      <P>This is an amendment which I have been asked by the law society to bring to the notice of the Minister.  It would appear possible that, if a solicitor is defending an accused person, the provisions of Section 39 as to a search warrant would extend to a solicitor's office.  It has always been an established principle of law that there is privilege for the lawyer.  If there is no such privilege, then clearly a person against whom a charge is brought cannot be adequately defended.  Section 39, as it stands, does definitely contravene that principle, if it were to apply to a solicitor's office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RogerMcHugh" hpid="Dr. McHugh Dr. McHugh">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McHugh</NameTxt>
      <P>I think this amendment would tend to create undue privilege.  It is quite conceivable that a solicitor would act as an organiser, promoter or agent for a charitable organisation.  Consequently, I think to <Col N="948" /> exempt solicitors' premises from searches would really create undue privilege and might lead to more trouble, than would the Bill in its present form.  I should like to oppose the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. Everett Mr. Everett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>I am opposing the amendment.  The effect of the amendment, if accepted, would be to confer on solicitors a new professional privilege in relation to a particular matter, namely, lottery offences that would violate the established principle of public policy that professional privilege should not be allowed to operate as a cloak for crime.  Let me recall what the section provides, which is this, that a search warrant may be issued thereunder only on application to the court and where the court is satisfied on information on oath that there is reasonable ground for supposing that an offence is about to be committed.  Under the law as it stands, a solicitor is protected or privileged from having to disclose his client's secret or private affairs. But this protection or privilege does not extend to cases in which the client is contemplating committing crime, whether the solicitor is or is not a party to or aware of the contemplated crime.  And it is well settled that no court can be called upon to protect communications which are themselves part of a criminal or unlawful proceeding. I cannot accept the suggestion that there is anything improper or unreasonable in the Legislature putting a similar limitation on the doctrine of professional privilege and I think we would be acting very irresponsibly if we did not do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ArthurCox" hpid="Mr. Cox Mr. Cox">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>That means that an inspector may enter the office and remove any book or documents found therein. Suppose such an order is made in respect of my office and that I am defending a person accused of various offences which have nothing whatever to do with a lottery.  Apparently, the inspector may enter my office and remove all or any papers or documents he finds there.  In other words, he may apparently think that in my safe are secret documents relating to a lottery and he may remove wills.  The Minister might say that is far-fetched, but it <Col N="949" /> touches the essence of what has always been recognised.  In order that people may be properly defended and given a chance of proving their innocence, however remote the possibility may be, it is necessary that a solicitor's office be free from entry by police authorities to remove documents.  It could happen that the police might find papers dealing with matters which have nothing whatsoever to do with a lottery.</P>
      <P>This is viewed with very considerable alarm by the legal profession. There is a question of real principle involved.  What in one Bill may be innocent may be a precedent for another Bill later on.  An accused person has the protection of being able to consult his lawyers and confide in them.  If that is once attacked, it may go a very long way.  I think this matter is one of very great importance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Cox's desire to facilitate his profession&mdash;it is a very laudable desire, indeed, and the profession is a very noble one&mdash; carries him very far from the section. It rather obscures his vision of what is actually in the section.  A solicitor is an officer of the court.  No search can take place except by a named member of the Garda Síochána, not below the rank of inspector.  That member of the Garda Síochána, not below the rank of inspector, will be named by the court. Surely the Senator believes in the courts?  If he believes in solicitors, <i>a fortiori</i> in barristers, he should <i>a fortiori</i> believe in the courts, where the justices and judges are either solicitors or barristers.  Surely the justices of the District Court will not lightly give an order to any member of the Garda Síochána to go to the offices of a solicitor who is himself an officer of the court?  I am sure that is sufficient protection for the solicitors, just as it is for anyone else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First, you must have an order of the court; secondly, the power extends only to a named officer of the Garda Síochána not below the rank of inspector; thirdly, under sub-section (2) of Section 39, a named officer of the Garda Síochána can enter the place or premises, inspect any books and documents found there.  He can take <Col N="950" /> the name and address of any person and seize any gaming instrument and any books and documents appearing to relate to gaming or lotteries found there.</P>
    <P>As far as I can see, the valid part of Senator Cox's argument is that the inspector of the Garda Síochána might seize documents relating to gaming given to a solicitor in the course of his duty to defend a person charged with a crime.  Is that correct?</P>

It would surely be aware that the superintendent would be extremely careful in regard to doing anything of the kind. One would imagine by the Senator's speech that a sergeant could go in, open the safe and take away wills and bring them to the barracks. Surely that is a far-fetched idea and surely Senator Cox is playing the advocate rather than the legislator when he asks us to believe any such thing?  Unless I am greatly mistaken, are there not other cases where a search warrant may be given and the search may be made in a solicitor's office?</P>

Although I have very close connection with solicitors, and I happen to be the father of one, it seems extraordinary to single out solicitors and make them completely immune.

I think possibly less of barristers and solicitors than Senator Hayes does, but there have been times when barristers and solicitors have been the defenders of the liberties of the ordinary person.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, all legislation which removes the privileges of the profession&mdash;not of lawyers individually, but of the profession as a whole&mdash;is a serious matter.

      <P>While I admit the good work done by the legal profession, this puts them in a peculiar position.

    <P>On the literal meaning of this section, if I am defending a person who is accused of having committed an offence under this Bill, and if I am asked by a member of the Gárda Síochána not below the rank of inspector to produce any books or documents I might hold, I will commit an offence by declining to give my client away. <Col N="952" /> That seems to be a most extraordinary position.  If I am defending a person accused of murder, nothing can force me to show the documents.  If I am defending a person accused of treason, without special legislation, nothing can force me to betray my client. Under this section, if I refuse, I am liable to a fine of £25.</P>
    <P>All I can say is that if this section is passed into law and if under it any solicitor is asked to produce any of the papers, that solicitor will only have to say that he will not do it and that he will go to prison instead&mdash;because, as long as he is worthy to remain a solicitor, he will not betray his client.</P>

      <P>I should like the Minister to consider this amendment. Anything which a solicitor has to do for the purpose of giving legal advice and assistance to his client the certainly should be able to do with the greatest possible liberty.  If Section 42 appears to interfere with that, it certainly ought to be amended to make it clear to that extent, that it should not interfere in any way with the relations between solicitor and client.  Whether the amendment is entirely satisfactory or not, I do not know.  I presume that &ldquo;professional purposes&rdquo; means for the purpose of arguing the client's case. There is something there for discussion and consideration.</P>

      <P>I think Senator Cox would need to explain to us what is meant by &ldquo;professional purposes&rdquo;.  I can imagine a solicitor acting on behalf of people running a lottery which would be illegal.  He would be acting in a professional capacity other than that intended by Senator Cox, that is, where he is acting on behalf of somebody who has been charged with an offence.  I think there is merit in what he says but I really think that the amendment, as at present drawn up, is not quite what we would like to put into the Bill.  I think it would want some further elaboration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully appreciate what the Senator has said.  He should remember that, in the ordinary course of the duty of a solicitor in advising his clients, all sorts of questions may arise regarding income-tax and this, that and the other thing, in which, possibly, the client has committed an offence and that these papers are perfectly legitimately and honourably in the solicitor's office.  Is the principle going to be established&mdash;because I must remind Senators that this can spread into other Bills&mdash;that, perhaps in other branches of the law, because some inspector believes that Mr. X is offending against something and he knows that Mr. X has consulted, say, Senator Walsh, he can then go to Senator Walsh and say: &ldquo;You must hand up Mr. X's papers so that I can see whether or not he has committed an offence?&rdquo;  If that is going to be established then any standing the legal profession have had is destroyed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">

      <P>Surely the position is that if the Bill needs amendment it should be amended according to the principle that whatever privileges solicitors have in law and practice at present should be preserved and should not be interfered with in this Bill?  I suggest that that is the matter <Col N="954" /> that should be considered&mdash;to see that no privilege now enjoyed by a solicitor for his client should in any way be interfered with in the operation of this Bill when it becomes law.  If the Minister considers the matter in the light of that particular principle I think he would be bound to satisfy Senator Cox.</P>

      <P Just="Center">SECTION 50.</P>
      <P>Government amendment No. 52:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To delete sub-section (1) and substitute the following:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  The Minister for Posts and Telegraphs may detain any postal packet posted in the State and suspected of containing any document relating to an unlawful lottery and shall forward every postal packet so detained to a member of the Garda Síochána not below the rank of superintendent.</P>
      <P>(2)  The member may open and examine the packet, but, in the case of an address within the State, only in the presence of the person to whom it is addressed unless, after notice in writing requiring his attendance left at or forwarded by post to the address on the pocket, he fails to attend.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(3)  If the member finds any such document he may detain the packet and its contents for the purpose of prosecution, and if he finds no such document he shall either deliver the <Col N="955" /> packet to the person to whom it is addressed or, if he is absent, forward the packet to him by post.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. Everett Mr. Everett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>Having regard to the views expressed in various quarters on the Second Reading, I have had Section 50 redrafted so as to provide that a postal packet detained thereunder shall be opened only in the presence of the person to whom the packet is addressed, provided, of course, that his attendance for the purpose can be secured.  This, I think, should meet the objections to the section as originally drafted while preserving the power to prevent abuses of postal facilities which, if left unchecked, would make it difficult, if not impossible, to enforce the prohibition on the promotion of unlawful lotteries.</P>
      <P>There has, I think, been some misunderstanding about this section inasmuch as it has been suggested that what we are doing here is something novel which constitutes an unprecedented violation of the secrecy of the post.  Nothing, I assure you, is further from the case.  Under the law as it stands the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs is authorised (by Section 18 of the Post Office Act, 1908) to detain any postal packet suspected of containing contraband goods and forward the packet to the Revenue Commissioners to be opened by them.  There is a somewhat similar provision which applies to packets suspected of containing obscene or indecent matter.</P>
      <P>The existing law relating to the detention and opening of postal packets containing documents relating to bets which, in certain circumstances, cover pools is contained in Section 34 of the Betting Act, 1931.</P>
      <P>It will be seen, therefore, that what we propose is no more than an extension of a principle that has already been accepted by the Legislature to prevent abuses in analogous cases to cover the case of the abuse of postal facilities for the promotion of unlawful lotteries which it is one of the primary purposes of this Bill to prevent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards Senator Cox's proposal that an order of the District Court <Col N="956" /> would be necessary to enable the police to examine and open a postal packet and that the order shall not be given unless the District Justice is satisfied that there are grounds for suspecting that the packet contains a document relating to an unlawful lottery all I can say is that I regard this as an amendment designed to wreck the section.  It would not be practicable to operate the section at all if the police had to go first to the District Justice for an order.  In the case of some of the unlawful pools and lotteries there may be quite a number of postal packets addressed to various people.</P>
    <P>As regards Senator Cox's further proposal that Section 50 should not apply to postal packets addressed to a solicitor, I cannot accept that suggestion. The existing law makes no distinction as between different classes of the community and I see no good reason to change it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ArthurCox" hpid="Mr. Cox Mr. Cox">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>As I understand it, the Minister's proposal is that the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs can detain any postal packet if he says or alleges that he thinks it relates to a lottery.  I think that is exactly what the Czars used to do in Russia in previous days.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this section, we have the rather extraordinary position that it is only necessary for the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs to say: &ldquo;I think that So-and-so is in some way concerned with a lottery&rdquo;, for him to go and interfere with the whole correspondence of that person.  In dealing with some of the sections under this Bill, I am beginning to feel rather like John Hampton.  I feel this is a section which requires the most earnest consideration. It seems to me to be wholly revolutionary.  We are dealing here with what is, I think, maybe an important step.  It may deal with a relatively trivial thing here&mdash;lotteries, and so forth&mdash;but, under this, you are giving the Minister power to interfere with the post of any person whom he may have some reason to suspect. People talk of the spirit of democracy, but if Ministers are to have these kinds of powers, I think the liberty of the ordinary individual is getting rather weak.  I should like to reserve <Col N="957" /> the right to raise this again on the next stage of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister's present amendment only comes to us now.  Again, I think a real question of principle is involved. It seems to me that, in endeavouring to suppress what is perhaps an evil&mdash; perhaps one of the smallest of many evils in the country&mdash;the Minister is taking precedents of the most extraordinary nature to interfere with the ordinary rights of the ordinary worker.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>Does Senator Cox say that this is entirely unprecedented? Does he need to go as far back as the Czars of Russia in this connection? Have the British Government not got power to do this and has there not been power there, under the Post Office Act of 1908&mdash;which we took over from the British&mdash;to do this in other cases?  Has it not been in operation for 47 years?  In any event, surely it is not so unprecedented&mdash;that is, entirely apart from its merits.  It may have demerits.  The suggestion that the Minister is taking unprecedented powers and extravagant action against the ordinary citizens which was never possible before this unfortunate Minister got into the Government is surely extravagant language.  Surely it is not so.  Surely this power exists in Britain and, if I am not very much mistaken, in the great democracy of the west, the United States of America.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonKissane" hpid="Mr. Kissane Mr. Kissane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kissane</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Senator Cox, I regard this Section 50 as a very drastic one indeed, and it is because of its drastic nature that I decided to oppose it, so as to get from the Minister some information as to what circumstances have arisen in the past in connection with lotteries, or what circumstances would be likely to arise in the future, to justify the insertion of such a drastic section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Hayes has stated that this power of intercepting postal packets already exists.  I am in agreement with that, but it is for another purpose. The Revenue Commissioners have that power already, but they exercise it in a very restricted way. We know also that, in time of grave <Col N="958" /> emergency, such as a war, Governments have to take these drastic powers in order to safeguard the State against possible subversive activities on the part of individuals; but no such grave emergency exists now.  We are supposed to be living in a state of peace, and here we have the Minister taking these powers and transferring them to an officer of the Garda Síochána to enable him, if he thinks fit, to intercept a postal packet.</P>
    <P>I admit that the amendment is an improvement, in that it provides that the postal packet will be opened in the presence of the recipient, but still that does not take away from the seriousness of the encroachment on the private rights of citizens.  I should like to hear from the Minister, as I have said, what circumstances have arisen in the past in connection with lotteries which would be calculated to be inimical to the moral and economic welfare of the people, or what circumstances would be likely to arise in the future, to justify a drastic section of this nature being embodied in a Bill of this kind.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>This section, as originally drafted, appeared to me to be very objectionable and, in some ways, the amended section is still open to objection.  There is one aspect of this that has not been touched by the other speakers.  In the Minister's amendment, it is provided that the postal packet can be opened in the presence of the recipient, provided the recipient attends at the place where it is being opened, after being notified. That might create considerable difficulty for the person to whom the packet was addressed, because he might reside many miles from the superintendent's office, if it were to be in that place that the letter would be opened.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be rather unfair to expect an ordinary citizen to whom a suspected letter is addressed to travel perhaps 20 or 30 miles to the superintendent's office for the purpose of being present when the letter is opened, and I should be inclined to think that it would not be an undue hardship on the officer of the Garda to travel to the residence of the citizen to whom the letter is addressed and open it in his presence.  In a matter of this kind, we <Col N="959" /> must have respect for the rights of law-abiding citizens and every citizen must be assumed to be law-abiding, until he is proved otherwise.</P>
    <P>The point that there are, in other legislation, drastic powers to deal with letters has been mentioned, but I think there was a certain restriction on these powers, inasmuch as they related to certain types of offences which could not be presumed to be so widespread. A plausible case could be made by a superintendent or the postal authorities for opening a large number of letters under this section, even as amended, which could not be made in respect of the offences mentioned by the Minister, and I feel that the Minister is widening very drastically and substantially the powers to interfere with private letters going through the post.  I think he should consider this matter, and should consider it perhaps in the light of the amendment suggested by Senator Cox.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. Everett Mr. Everett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>If we are serious about stopping illegal lotteries, unlawful lotteries, we will require to use the power which is already in existence to prevent these illegal and unlawful lotteries using the postal services.  I think Senators will agree with that.  It is necessary to have these powers, which are merely a repetition of existing powers.  This is a very comprehensive measure which is intended to embody the law relating to lotteries, and there is no other way of preventing illegal lotteries which involve large sums of money passing out of this country to a foreign country than the use of the powers I am seeking, and I seek them for no other purpose.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>That Seanad Éireann is of opinion that in view of the substantial decrease in the total area under tillage <Col N="962" /> as a result of the reduction in the price of wheat last year and having regard to the increased cost of production it is essential that the price of next season's crop be increased.</P>
    <P>I regret very sincerely that the Minister is unable to be present.  It would be invidious, I suppose, to draw a comparison between the relative importance of the greyhound industry and wheat growing.  Both are important, I suppose.  It might also not be desirable to raise a question as to whether or not, on a motion of this kind, some Minister should be present, because, in matters of State policy, each Minister is responsible on the principle of collective responsibility, and, therefore, it would be desirable, if it were possible, that some Minister should be present when a motion of this nature is being discussed.  Having made that point, I am satisfied to proceed.  I recognise that the Government are ably represented through the Leader of the House and other members who are supporters of the Government, and I shall endeavour, therefore, to put forward the case in support of this motion, trusting that the facts which I state will be brought to the Minister's notice and will receive due consideration.</P>
    <P>Twelve months ago, a motion somewhat similar to this was before this House, and, 12 months ago, this House decided, by a vote, to support the action of the Government at that time in drastically reducing the price of wheat.  It may be that the House was influenced to a considerable extent by the views put forward by the Minister for Agriculture and by the promises then made by the Minister.  In this House, the Minister referred us to his statements in the Dáil on a wheat motion that was considered there last year.  Speaking in the Dáil on 2nd December, 1954, he said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;This day 12 months I will invite this House to judge our policy by the results.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The 12 months have elapsed, and those of us who are still alive and hale and hearty can look back upon the effects of the Government's policy in regard to wheat and judge that policy by the <Col N="963" /> results.  The results are clearly set forth in the <i>Irish Trade Journal</i> which records agricultural trends, both in regard to tillage produce and live stock, and we find, as stated in this motion, that the acreage under wheat declined during the past year by 130,000 acres.  A drop in the area under wheat of 130,000 acres is a very substantial drop, but, in addition to that, we have, as is also stated in the motion, a decline in the total acreage of tillage.  The decline of 81,000 acres in the total area under tillage means that we have an increase in the total acreage of permanent pasture of 81,000 directly as a result of Government policy in regard to wheat.  In that decline in the acreage under tillage, there is included a very serious item.  It is a drop of 20,000 acres in the area under sugar beet.  As we all know, the growing of beet and wheat go very closely together.  Many farmers find that, while the gross income from the growing of beet is high, the net income, having regard to the costs involved, is relatively low. Farmers find that, if it were not for the benefit they get from crops the following year because of the improvement in the land after growing beet, it would not be desirable for them to grow beet at all.  Therefore, we find that the decline in the acreage under beet is very closely related to the cut in the price of wheat.</P>
    <P>That is, I believe, a matter of very grave concern, because, while wheat growing involves a very substantial amount of labour on the land and in the transport of the crop, as well as in the operation of the local mills, the sugar beet industry provides even greater employment for labour on the land, in the factories and in the transport of the crop.  In striking at the price of wheat last year, the Government, in fact, struck at the acreage under sugar beet; it struck at the beet-growing industry; and eventually struck at the total agricultural output; for while the acreage under tillage is substantially reduced to the extent of 81,000 acres, there has been no compensating increase on the live-stock side of agriculture.  We find that in the past year the number of cows <Col N="964" /> declined by 24,000; the total number of cattle by 48,000; sows by 20,000; and the total number of pigs by 153,000.  Therefore, we find that not only has there been a steep downward trend in the area under tillage, but there has also been a steep decline in the numbers of live stock.  That means that the whole output of the agricultural industry has been seriously impaired.</P>
    <P>The point was made by many speakers last year, supporting the reduction in the price of wheat, that, by reducing the wheat price and the wheat acreage, they would be establishing a better proportion in agriculture. They argued that agriculture had become somewhat lopsided, because of what they alleged to be the favourable price being paid for wheat, and that, therefore, something should be done to bring agriculture into balance.  The amount of unbalance, however, in agriculture, as we all know, is, and has always been, the vast acreage we have had under grass as compared with the acreage under tillage.  The figures for the past year show that we had a reduction of 81,000 acres under tillage, bringing the area of the total ploughed land down to something like 1,713,000 acres, out of a total of 11,500,000 acres of agricultural land.  That means that we have now 9,800,000 acres under grass, as against 1,700,000 acres under tillage and surely that is not balanced agriculture. Surely the trend that took place during the past year which increased the area under grass and reduced the area under tillage is not calculated to restore, or to improve, the balance of agricultural production.</P>
    <P>Last year, we deplored the fact that there was a reduction in the price of wheat.  We all deplored it, particularly in view of the terrible season through which the farmers had passed at the time, and, on looking back over the past 12 months, everything seems to emphasise the injustice inflicted on the farmers at that time, and the injustice inflicted on them in the past year.  In that connection, I might tell a little story.  Recently, at a fair in Baltinglass, County Wicklow, I was speaking to a small farmer and asked him how things were going.  He told <Col N="965" /> me that he had a good crop of oats, but could not get rid of them, and that the wheat did fairly well, but that he would have got £50 more, if it had not been for James.  I was surprised because I did not know what he meant, when he said he would have got £50 more if it had not been for James.  I did not realise for the moment that he was referring to our distinguished and illustrious Minister for Agriculture, but that is the reaction of the average farmer to the recent cut in the price of wheat.</P>
    <P>Every man who looks to his return from the wheat crop this year has been able to see quite clearly how much money he has lost because of the cut so savagely imposed on him during the year.  The loss of that particular farmer who said that the wheat did fairly well was £50, but the total loss to the farmers of the country was something in the neighbourhood of £2,000,000.  That £2,000,000 has been taken out of the pockets of the farmers by reason of the reduced price in wheat, but who has derived the benefit of that cut?  There has been no reduction in the price of bread and, therefore, the consumers can have derived no benefit, because of the reduction in the price of wheat.  The working farmer has been hit severely by that cut and nobody, so far as I can see, has received any benefit, except perhaps the Exchequer, to the amount of something in the neighbourhood of £2,000,000.</P>
    <P>Was that cut justified?  I hold the view, as I did last year, that it was not.  The events of the past year have shown that it was not justified, because during the past year almost every section of the community, without exception, has put forward demands for increased remuneration and has had these demands met to a considerable extent, while the farmer engaged in the growing of wheat has had to meet a cut of 15 per cent., not in his net income but in his gross income.  I think that situation could not, under any circumstances, be justified.</P>
    <P>During the past week, representatives of the organised farming community met the Minister.  The grain <Col N="966" /> growers' committee, representative of the National Farmers' Association and the Irish Sugar Beet Growers' Association, have put before the Minister a very strong and well-reasoned case for an increase in the price of wheat this year.  I hope that case is being very carefully and very sympathetically considered by the Government.  Among the points which they stressed and which does support a demand for an increase, and support this motion, is the fact that production costs over the past year have increased by 5 per cent. Even if we were to forget everything said about the reduction last year, even if we were to accept that the price fixed last year was justifiable, an increase of 5 per cent. in production costs is something which must be taken serious note of and something which, in my opinion, the Government are bound to meet and to compensate the farmer for.  In the sugar beet industry, which fortunately is not controlled by any Government Department but is under the direct control of a State company, an increase has. been provided to the farmers over the price last year.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>There was no increase last year.  An increase of 3/6 has been granted this year.  I think it is worth while to consider that, in the sugar beet industry, there is machinery which provides for a careful investigation of costings and the provision of a price based on costs.  It is reasonable to ask that similar consideration should be given to the wheat grower.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have already said that the decline in the sugar beet acreage has been, in great measure, related to the reduction in the price of wheat.  Farmers cannot justify the growing of beet in the hope of getting a good price for wheat in the following year.  I made that point already.  It was also stated last year that there was a decline in the world price of wheat and that we here could not in conscience&mdash;not even in a farmer's conscience&mdash;expect to maintain the price for wheat here.  The fact of the matter is that, during the past <Col N="967" /> year, the world price of wheat, as delivered in this country, has been on the increase.  I understand that during the last harvest in many parts of the country Irish native-grown wheat could be purchased at the mills cheaper than the imported wheat.  That was due to a variety of circumstances, but it is true.  The case that was so eloquently made by the Minister that the existing guaranteed price for wheat represented a subsidy to the farmer has very little substance in it.  I hope the Minister will not turn down, without the very gravest consideration, the strong case that has been made by the farmers' association for an increase this year.</P>
    <P>It will be recognised that only within the past 48 hours&mdash;by a remarkable coincidence, it happened only after the ballot boxes in West Limerick had been closed&mdash;was it publicly announced that the price of fertilisers is being increased by 15/- per ton.  That increase of 15/- per ton represents a very substantial increase in the cost of production, particularly for the farmer whose land needs fertilisers.  I think it does strengthen the case for this motion, although this motion was put down before that increase came into operation.</P>
    <P>There has also been, over the past year, an increase in minimum agricultural wages of 5/- per week and a very substantial increase in rates. Therefore, it will be agreed, from every angle, that, even if we were to accept the fact that the price last year was fair, an unanswerable case exists for increasing the price now, having regard to the costs of production.</P>
    <P>I think it is desirable now, once and for all, to dispose of the arguments that were put forward in favour of the reduction in the price of wheat last year.  They have been dealt with by other people, but I think, however, they have been repeated over and over again, <i>ad nauseam.</i>  The case for cutting down the price of wheat in 1954 was based on four great falsehoods&mdash; and no other word can describe them: (1) it was stated that there was a danger of a wheat surplus in this country; <Col N="968" /> (2) it was stated that there was an agreement which bound us to import 270,000 tons of wheat; (3) it was stated that Fianna Fáil, while in power, agreed to a reduction at least in the acreage under wheat, and therefore it was implied they had agreed to a reduction in the price of wheat; and (4) there was the most fantastic and despicable of all the falsehoods, that is, that there was widespread speculation in the growing of wheat&mdash;as if anyone on earth could speculate successfully with regard to the growing of a crop in this country.</P>
    <P>On the question of a surplus&mdash;it is as well to dispose of that completely&mdash; I put it first because I would regard it as the most serious of the points made in favour of cutting the price of wheat last year.  It was dinned into our ears for months before the cut was announced that there was a danger we were going to be overwhelmed with supplies of wheat in this country.  It was suggested in inspired articles in the Press, prior to the announcement of the cut, that we might have to seek external markets for our wheat.  What are the facts?  The facts are that, according to the <i>Trade Journal</i> for September, which is the latest one I have at my disposal, during the first nine months of the present year, we imported into this country 2,466,000 cwt. of wheat and we paid for that wheat £3,602,000.  £3,600,000 went out of the country to import wheat at a time when it was being dinned into our ears that we would have to send our trade officials all round the world to the five Continents to look for a market for our surplus wheat.  The effect of that enormous import of wheat may be considered in relation to our trade balance.</P>
    <P>During the first nine months of the present year, the adverse trade balance reached a figure of £70,000,000.  That is a very substantial amount, and at least we should try to see if a portion of that could be used for growing our own wheat, but £3,600,000 had to be sent out to import wheat.  I assume that wheat was imported, in the main, from the dollar area, and our adverse trade balance in the dollar area, for the first nine months of the present year, was <Col N="969" /> £16,000,000.  We do not know how much it will be for the full year.  It stood at £16,000,000 in September.</P>
    <P>Surely it was fantastic for the Government and their supporters to claim that there was a danger of a surplus, having regard to those facts.  We need 450,000 tons of dried millable wheat to provide our bread needs in this State. In the present year, up to the present, I think the intake to our mills was 274,000 tons.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  But in the last year, when we hear so much about the terrible production of wheat which threatened the State, as it was said at the time, with an unsaleable surplus, the total amount of dried wheat supplied to the mills was 354,000 tons, whereas we need at least 450,000 tons, so that we were far short of the surplus.  The talk of a surplus in those circumstances is fantastic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>Were not 150,000 tons of the unmillable wheat due to the bad year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>The case was made by the Minister that there was only about 3 per cent. of the wheat proved to be unmillable.  We may take it that a very substantial amount of the wheat produced reached the mills, but let us take a five-year period and we will see that at no time did the wheat growers ever threaten to drown the consumers in Ireland with wheat.  In the year 1951/52, the total amount we produced was 168,000 tons.  It rose in 1952/53 to 182,000 tons.  It rose still higher in the year 1953/54 to 296,000 tons.  It went up to 354,000 tons in 1954/55.  It never went within a measurable distance of reaching the total we require to supply our needs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Instead of there being any danger of a surplus, the worst the wheat growers could do to the community was that they might produce almost 100 per cent.  If they did, we would have to adjust the imported admixture. There never was a danger, or a possibility in fact, at the time, that we might exceed the requirements of the <Col N="970" /> State.  Why all this panic about the surplus?  After all, is it not a good thing that we should be able to be at least reasonably self-sufficient in the matter of supplying the most essential of our foodstuffs and the raw materials for those foodstuffs?</P>
    <P>I think I have said enough to dispose of the suggestion that there was any possibility of our producing a surplus. Yet that case was made throughout the State.  I suppose that to a certain extent people were influenced by the picture which was presented of Irish ships laden down to the water's edge with surplus wheat carrying it across the Atlantic to try to sell it in the United States and Canada.  That was the fantastic future painted for us last year by the Government.  I hope we will hear no more about this surplus.</P>
    <P>It may be well to refer to the fact that the high acreage last year was due to very exceptional circumstances which I think have been set forth by the farmers' association in their case to the Minister.  In the spring of 1954, there was a guaranteed price for wheat.  We knew that that guarantee might not last beyond a year, because we knew it was very likely&mdash;almost certain&mdash;that Deputy Dillon would become Minister for Agriculture and that the Fine Gael Party would become the Government and they had always been historically antagonistic to wheat.  Therefore, farmers were naturally anxious to sow as big an acreage as possible, saying to themselves that wheat would be finished after that year because Fine Gael would come into power.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>In addition to that, we had a situation last year in which live stock were about to be decontrolled in Great Britain, and many intelligent people anticipated that decontrol would lead to a collapse of live stock prices and said this was not a good time to invest too much money in cattle; that it was better to put the land that would be under cattle under an additional acreage of wheat for which there was at the time a guaranteed price.  Those exceptional circumstances did influence the acreage of the wheat.  I stated last year and I now repeat that, even if the price of wheat had not been reduced last year, there would be some reduction in the acreage, but not a sufficient reduction to bring down the total acreage under tillage, as has happened because of the cut.  There would have been some reduction of wheat and the wheat acreage would have settled down, at a price of £4 per barrel, at a reasonable acreage which would meet our needs and which would not provide any possibility of a surplus.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have dealt with the question of a surplus and we can go on from that to another argument, which I would call falsehood No. 2.  It was that, by the wheat agreement which had been in operation for five or six years and which will remain in operation until next year, this country undertook an obligation to accept 270,000 tons of wheat from the wheat exporting countries and that at any time the wheat exporting countries could compel us to accept the 270,000 tons of wheat.  Now the facts are that there was no such provision in the wheat agreement.  There was a provision that, if the wheat exporting countries offered us the wheat at what was the <Col N="972" /> minimum price, which was a ridiculously low price, they could compel us to accept it; but there was no likelihood that they were going to do such a foolish thing.</P>
    <P>If the exporting countries were to offer us the wheat at £20 a ton, it would have meant that they were selling us the wheat at a price less than the price of maize and other coarse grains.  Therefore, there was no danger whatever from that source and every intelligent person who studied the facts was aware of that.  Yet it was a very good argument to use in favour of the cut in the price of wheat. It was a very nice thing to say that the Fianna Fáil Government had agreed to that provision in the wheat agreement.  In actual fact, it had been agreed to both by the previous Coalition Government and by the Fianna Fáil Government and it will remain in operation until next July.</P>
    <P>It did not, however, present any serious danger of our being flooded with wheat because it must be recognised that, if the exporting countries were foolish enough to sell us wheat at less than the price of coarse grains, we would refrain from importing the coarse grains and use the wheat as a feeding stuff instead; but there was no likelihood that they were going to disrupt the market in that way in normal times, so that that argument was simply put forward as an excuse for this felonious act of reducing the price of wheat.</P>
    <P>The third great falsehood which was so frequently stated in support of the reduction in the price of wheat was that Fianna Fáil had, in February of 1954, agreed to a reduction in the area under wheat, but anyone who gave the matter any attention would have seen that the decision taken by Fianna Fáil in 1954 was to aim at a target of two-thirds of our requirements.  We have not reached that target this year so far, and, even if we do, there is no danger in regard to it.  As we all know, an agricultural target is a very flexible thing.  You cannot have a precise figure of the amount you are going to get from agriculture by any settled policy of the Government.  We must remember that a Government, in <Col N="973" /> dealing with the farmers, are dealing with 350,000 very independent and individualistic people, and if every farmer in the country decided of his own volition to grow only one extra acre of wheat, it would mean an increase of over 300,000 acres, so that, in fixing an agricultural target, one has to allow for a wide margin of error.</P>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil Government very properly set out a target of two-thirds. They knew it was possible to have an error of 50 per cent. above or below that, but, in either case, no very serious danger would arise.  We have got to face the fact that, in a free enterprise, every farmer has free will and can do what he wishes with his own land and rightly so, and, therefore, it is wise to set up a target which, if reached, will be desirable; which, if it is exceeded, will not be any great danger; and which, if it is not completely reached, will not create any great embarrassment.</P>
    <P>Therefore, in fixing this as an ideal to be aimed at, the Fianna Fáil Government were taking a wise and practical step.  In making the provision they made, they knew it would have to be flexible, inasmuch as they could never be sure, to the exact ton or even 50,000 tons, what amount would come in.  But, at any rate, there was a definite declaration at the time that we were to aim at growing a very substantial portion of our requirements and that was the decision taken, which, as the former Minister stated, would have permitted the wheat acreage to fluctuate somewhere between 400,000 and 500,000 acres.</P>
    <P>It must be remembered, of course, that, in the growing of a crop of wheat, provision must be made not only for the millable wheat supplied to the mills, but for reseeding in the following year, so that the former Minister, Deputy Walsh, was quite right in saying that what he was aiming at was an acreage somewhere between 400,000 and 500,000 acres.  Remember that that is a reasonable proposition.  It represents only less than one-twentieth, less than 5 per cent., of the <Col N="974" /> total area of agricultural land, and there could be no question of excessive ranching, or huge wheat belts, or anything of that kind under such a programme.</P>
    <P>I think it was clearly recognised by the Minister, when making his case last year, that he was on very weak ground, that he really had no case, that the legs he was trying to stand on were rather rotten, that there was no real danger of a surplus, that there was no real danger that the Americans would flood this country with cheap wheat and that there was no substance whatever in the suggestion that Fianna Fáil had agreed to reduce either the acreage or the price of wheat.  Therefore, the Minister perhaps wisely decided to create a sort of diversion, so he started this cock and bull story about speculators.</P>
    <P>Could anyone imagine how it would be possible for a person to speculate in the growing of a crop or to racketeer in the growing of a crop?  You can racketeer in goods and in grain, when it is harvested, because you can buy it up and hold on to it until you get a better price, but when it comes to putting in a crop into the land and battling against climatic conditions for five, six or seven months, the scope for racketeering is very limited.  Let it be clearly understood that, in almost every case, when the Minister for Agriculture has attacked some national enterprise in this country, he has always accused some particular people of racketeering.  I remember that, when the present Minister for Agriculture was attacking the industrial policy of Fianna Fáil, he introduced into the debate on various occasions descriptions of gangs of racketeers.  I remember his attacks on the wheat-growing policy when he made the case of racketeering flour millers who, he claimed, were exploiting the Fianna Fáil wheat-growing policy.</P>
    <P>Again, seven years ago, in 1948, when the present Minister came into office, he turned down the request of oat growers for a fair price for oats.  He then&mdash;and I think I had a conflict with the Minister at that time&mdash;put up the argument that there were racketeers holding large surpluses of <Col N="975" /> oats at that time who wanted the price raised, so that they could get a substantially increased profit.  It is always easy, when you want to put forward a case you cannot defend, to raise a hue and cry against some section of the community.  Adolf Hitler in Germany raised an outcry against the Jews and started an agitation amongst the people for his particular purposes. In the same way, on another occasion, Oliver Cromwell, I think, used the same tactics to arouse mass hysteria against sections of the community for his own nefarious purposes.</P>
    <P>In the same way, the Government decided to cut the price of wheat, and, having no reasoned case to put forward in support of that reduction, decided that it would be a good thing to create an outcry against a section of the community. It is always an easy thing for an unscrupulous politician to attack a section of the community which appears to be wealthy, and so an attack was made on the large wheat growers, people growing wheat extensively. Was there any sense or justification in that attack?  The Minister gave figures of a number of large growers, but if you totalled the figures together, you found that they represented less than 2 per cent. of the total acreage under wheat.</P>
    <P>The large wheat growers of this country are found under two headings, those who are large land owners, and those who take land by conacre and grow the wheat on somebody else's land.  With regard to the first class, the large land owner, was he doing anything wrong?  Could anyone seriously say that it was a crime for a man who owns a large acreage to put a considerable portion of it under wheat?  Was he not doing an essential work for the community, if he has good land, in utilising it for the growing of the raw materials for the bread for his neighbours?  Is it not also true that the man who has a large acreage of land is doing a better service to the community by putting a large portion of it under wheat, thereby giving employment on the land, in the mills and in the haulage of the crop, than if he were to have the land <Col N="976" /> entirely under permanent pasture, and perhaps poor quality pasture?  Is he not, by putting it under wheat, doing a good service to the community generally?</P>
    <P>Then we have the other section, the people who take land by conacre and grow wheat on it.  I know several of these people who have 200, 300 or 400 acres and who grow a considerable amount of wheat on that land.  I know of one case of a man who is growing wheat by conacre to the extent of several hundred acres.  That man started as an agricultural worker and went to Britain during the war. He saved enough money to buy the machinery and to operate as a tillage contractor.  Then, finding it very difficult to make much profit at that business, having regard to the increased mechanisation of farms around him, he proceeded to take land by conacre and to grow wheat himself.  His profits, I would say, were small, but at least he was making a living in this country and showed initiative and enterprise. The Minister and others have attacked foreigners for coming in and taking land by conacre to grow wheat.  It is rather strange that this storm of denunciation was set up last year about foreigners coming in here and spending money on productive enterprise, and yet, during the present year, we have the Government appealing to foreigners everywhere to come into our country and develop our resources.</P>
    <P>We have the Minister for Industry and Commerce going through Europe with a roll of red carpet under his arm ready to lay it at the feet of any speculators who will come here and develop our resources.  Is there anything more objectionable in foreigners coming here and cultivating certain acreages of land and giving employment to workers than in foreigners coming in and taking over the mines and employing a certain number of workers there?</P>

If you take the very worst example cited by the Minister, the foreigner coming in and taking land on the 11 months system, before he would get one acre of land on which to grow wheat, he would have to pay dearly for it.  Irish farmers do not part cheaply with their land.

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;while it costs at least £25 per acre to produce wheat. That is another £25,000 expenditure incurred.  How much profit would he expect to make on that?  No racketeer, no speculator in the objectionable sense, would embark on an enterprise of that kind where he would have to spend £50,000 and he might hope, if he had an exceptionally high yield, to secure £50,000 in gross return&mdash;because I think the average output per acre over the past three or four years has been somewhere in the region of one ton per acre.  The value of that would be even at last year's prices £32.  There is an expenditure of £50,000 with a return of £32,000, so there is not very much for the speculator in that.  Of course, if he were a very wise man and a good business man, and succeeded in getting the very best type of land on <Col N="978" /> the 11 months system, he might get a yield much higher than the average and in that way might recoup himself, but there is a very big &ldquo;if&rdquo; in it, and it is not the kind of enterprise that would appeal to the speculator or racketeer who is out to make easy money.  It is, however, a type of enterprise that should appeal to the man to whom I refer, the hard-working man who has invested his money in agricultural machinery and is anxious to get some return out of it, even though it might be of a problematical nature.</P>
      <P>This whole case that there was racketeering, speculation and fraud in regard to the growing of wheat was completely and absolutely without any foundation.  Therefore, we find that every excuse that was offered for the reduction of the price last year was without validity, and it is right to advocate that we should at least go back to last year's price.  I sincerely hope the Minister is considering this matter seriously, and that he is being, and will be, influenced by the reasoned case that has been presented to him by the representatives of the farmers. I hope he will also be influenced by the views which have been expressed, not only by the farmers' associations but by the duly elected county committees of agriculture in practically every county.</P>
      <P>I have before me a report of a discussion which took place in County Offaly.  It was reported in the <i>Leinster Leader</i> of October 29th.  In that report, I read that, by a unanimous decision, the members of the Offaly County Committee of Agriculture called on the Minister for Agriculture to fix a guaranteed price of £4 per barrel for wheat.  The resolution was proposed by Mr. C. Kelly, Fianna Fáil, and seconded by Mr. R.J. Hume, Fine Gael.  It also asked that 1/- per barrel should be paid for wheat bushelling over 60, with a similar reduction where it was less than 60.  In the course of his remarks supporting that resolution, Mr. Hume, a prominent supporter of the present Government, said:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;It may seem strange for me to second this resolution, but I feel it is my duty to do so.  I know, and <Col N="979" /> my sons know, what it is to work on a farm and to try to make a living out of it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Congratulating Mr. Kelly on the sincere and unbiassed way he proposed the resolution, Mr. Hume said he knew that many farmers like himself found it as much as they could do to live after paying their way.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I call,&rdquo; said Mr. Hume, &ldquo;on every supporter of Fine Gael in Ireland to support this resolution and to press for it.  I consider that an injustice has been done to the farmer.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>These are strong, firm and fearless words, and they reflect the opinions which have been expressed at many more meetings of county committees of agriculture throughout the State. The county committee of which I am a member passed a resolution recently unanimously calling upon the Government to increase the price of wheat, notwithstanding the fact that a prominent Deputy of the Fine Gael Party is a member of that committee.  He joined in that unanimous appeal.</P>
    <P>The Government, if they adhere to the decision which was unwisely taken last year, will be flying in the face of farming opinion and of public opinion. A very worthy and distinguished member of this House, who is also a member of the Fine Gael Party, expressed his views with equal sincerity and with equal force.  As reported in the <i>Drogheda Independent</i> of the 26th February last, Senator McGee said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I am afraid that there is an anti-agricultural bias being taken up by the Government.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He said that at a meeting of the County Louth Committee of Agriculture on February 21st, 1955, and he went on to say, referring to the Government: &ldquo;They are going mad.&rdquo;  I hope that opinion was exaggerated.  I hope the Government have not gone completely mad, and that they will listen to the reasoned case put up by the entire farming community for a better price for wheat, and that they will recognise now, in the light of 12 months' experience, the evil results that have flowed from this policy.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="980" /> I also think it would be very relevant at this stage to quote a few words spoken in all sincerity by a member of this House during the debate on a wheat motion here.</P>

      <P>As reported at column 682 of the Seanad Reports for 16th December, 1954, Senator McGee said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I should like to tell the Government that, for one who has spent 40 years with them, it takes a very considerable grain of salt to help to digest the present position and I am only digesting it, because I believe that, in order to bring down the cost of living, some sacrifice must be made.  In this instance, the sacrifice is being made by the farming community.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>There was a sincere expression of opinion on the part of a supporter of the Government, that the sacrifice the farmers were being called upon to make at that time would be imitated by other sections of the community&mdash;that the farmer, having sacrificed 15 per cent. of his gross income, was setting a headline in self-sacrifice that other people might follow and that there might be a general reduction in living costs, and perhaps a stabilisation of our economic position.  That was the hope that was sincerely expressed by Senator McGee here in this House when this matter was debated last year.  Has that hope been fulfilled?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For the past year, every section of the community has demanded and secured an increase in income&mdash;every section, except the farming community. Instead of having a reduction in the cost of living over the past 12 months, we have had a very steep and substantial increase.  The farmers' sacrifice has been completely in vain.  The money that was extracted from them has ultimately gone down the drain. It has not reduced the price of bread. It has not benefited the community generally.  It has not prevented a sharp upward trend in the cost of living.  Therefore, I think it is time <Col N="981" /> for the Government seriously to consider the position as it stands now&mdash; not, perhaps, as some of them thought it stood last year, but as they realise the position to be now.</P>
    <P>The reduction in the price of wheat has brought about a steep reduction in the area under tillage and a grave unbalance in our agricultural economy. There has been a sharp decline in our live stock and in the general output of agriculture.  In the light of these facts, surely the time has come to take serious notice of this reasonable request? A Senator asked me what I said about the growing of wheat during the war.</P>

      <P>I take it the Leader of the House has given an undertaking that the case I have made will be seriously considered by the Government during the next few weeks and that, in addition, the case made by the county committees of agriculture and the farmers' associations will also be <Col N="982" /> seriously and, I hope, sympathetically considered.  I think, however, I should not allow the suggestion to pass that I was at any time antagonistic to the growing of wheat.  That suggestion was made here now.  It should not be on the records of the House that at any time in my political life I was opposed to it.  I was always an enthusiastic advocate of it in this country before I became a member of the Oireachtas and all during the time I have been a member.</P>
      <P>I am concluding now with an appeal to the Government, having heard all the arguments put forward in support of this motion, not to allow themselves to be swayed by any feeling of petty pride or by any feeling that they would be retracing their steps.  It is always statesman-like for a Government to take cognisance of the facts as they find them and to admit occasionally that they have made a mistake and, having made the admission, to rectify the mistake as speedily as possible.  There is no danger whatever that this community will be flooded with home-grown wheat or that imported wheat will be run into this country under the terms of the wheat agreement which, by the way, will expire before the next harvest. Having regard to all these facts, the Government would be well advised to meet this case in a reasonable way.</P>
      <P>I am thankful to Senator Hayes for giving us the assurance that, during the next few weeks, the matter will be considered.  I hope, as appears likely, the Minister will come into this House when this debate is resumed on 1st February next and will announce that the terms of the motion have been met in full.</P>

I should like to say that no disrespect to the House, or, indeed, to Senator Sheehy Skeffington is intended.  The Taoiseach made a comprehensive statement about this matter on the 30th ult.  He dealt with the whole question and it is the considered view of the Government that no further discussion or statement at this stage would serve any useful purpose.  Therefore, no Minister will be in attendance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>I do.  I appreciate the spirit in which that statement was made, but I note that the absence of any formal appearance on the part of the Government in relation to this motion is a considered one.</P>
      <P>In the course of his statement&mdash;I ask in this motion that its general tenor be approved&mdash;the Taoiseach said, as reported in Volume 153, No. 9, of the Official Reports of Dáil Eireann, column 1345:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;A grave responsibility rests on all of us in this matter.  It rests with special weight on Deputies of all Parties, on Senators, on members of local authorities.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>He went on in the same column:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;There is a need for public opinion to be clarified and to make itself felt, if we are not to have further incidents...&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Speaking in the same column, of Senators, T.D.s, county councillors, and so on, he said:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="984" />&ldquo;They cannot profess loyalty to the democratic institutions of the State and, at the same time, applaud minority groups which defy those institutions by word and by deed.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In my opinion, this motion gives Senators, here referred to by the Taoiseach, the opportunity to show the public and the Government just how strongly they support the Taoiseach in this matter.</P>
    <P>I welcome, as I say, the general tenor of what he said.  I welcome in particular the clear way in which he stressed the fact, once more, that, in this Republic of ours, there is but one Government, one Parliament and one Army; that it is in the spirit of democracy that we have ruled this State so far, and that we intend the ruling of this State to be continued, and that that democracy can be expressed only through the Oireachtas, and that only through the Oireachtas can force be lawfully used on behalf of this State of ours.  The Taoiseach stressed the word &ldquo;democratic&rdquo;.  I should like to quote again his words at column 1341:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Let me emphasise the word &lsquo;democratic&rsquo;.  The entire system of Government in this State is based on ultimate control by the people, &lsquo;whose right&rsquo;, in the words of the Constitution, &lsquo;it is to designate the rulers of the State and, in final appeal, to decide all questions of national policy, according to the requirements of the common good.&rsquo;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He went on to say at the end of the same column and into column 1342:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is laid down in the Constitution that: &lsquo;War shall not be declared and the State shall not participate in any war save with the assent of Dáil Éireann.&rsquo;  The right to raise and maintain military or armed forces is vested exclusively in the Oireachtas, and the Constitution expressly forbids the raising or maintaining, for any purpose whatsoever, of any armed force other than the forces raised and maintained by the Oireachtas.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In my contention that is well said, and it was clearly said, but it was said before.  It was equally well said in <Col N="985" /> October of last year&mdash;over a year ago. I particularly appreciated what the Taoiseach said on that occasion, and he repeated it this time, that even if it were possible by the lawful resort to force to remove the Border, that fact would provide no solution to the problems involved in the question of Partition, because even if we could vanquish by force of arms, we should have bitter resentment springing from civil war, which would poison our political life for years to come, with a discontented minority having to be kept down by force of arms.  Again, that was well said.</P>
    <P>The only thing I regretted was that it seemed that, a year later, that could only be repeated.  There could be no mention of a practical step, no mention of further action.  The clauses in the Constitution which the Taoiseach quoted are most apposite, and yet I suggest that, despite the fact that he quoted them and made clear his stand on that point&mdash;he referred to them a year ago&mdash;despite that fact, to-day in this Republic of ours those clauses of our Constitution are being openly defied.  I am not happy that last year's appeal, good though it was, has had a useful result in practice.</P>
    <P>I read in February, 1955, in the newspaper called <i>The United Irishman</i>, which purports to be speaking on behalf of this new body which calls itself the I.R.A., an editorial which was headed with three words, each followed by a question mark&mdash;&ldquo;Unchristian? Immoral?  Illegal?&rdquo;  In this editorial one passage says:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The second slanderous accusation was made by Mr. Costello and endorsed by Mr. de Valera in that marathon debate in Leinster House last October shortly after the battle of Omagh.  These men have little qualification for preaching to us on Christianity and morality as they only succeed in raising up the ghosts from the 20's and 30's who accuse them of killing their former comrades.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It goes on:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Again, will the men of Leinster House say that the men of Armagh <Col N="986" /> and Omagh acted against the will of the majority of the people?  In face of the facts they cannot.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It will be seen that the appeal of the Taoiseach last year, and his reference to the Constitution, have had no result at all; and those clauses of our Constitution are being openly defied, and have been equally openly defied since his last statement.</P>
    <P>In column 1339, the Taoiseach in this year's statement said: &ldquo;Our attitude requires to be stated repeatedly.&rdquo;  To that I should like to put a question mark.  I should like to ask why?  I should like to try and ascertain why it is that the Government's attitude has to be stated so repeatedly?  I should like to suggest that one reason why it has to be stated and restated is that the Government's attitude is not always easy to guess at from its actions, and so it has frequently to be reformulated since sometimes it cannot easily be guessed.</P>
    <P>I notice that county councillors, and even members of this House, have been saying recently that they support &ldquo;all nationalist movements&rdquo;, with special reference to recent happenings.  I am not satisfied that members of the Parties in the Government who make that kind of statement in public fully realise what duty they have to public opinion, and, indeed, to the Government which is in power through their support.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach said at column 1342, speaking of these illegal organisations:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;These men have no shadow of right to take decisions involving the peace of Ireland...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;No shadow of right&rdquo;&mdash;yet we hear from responsible politicians of various Parties in the country that they are going to support &ldquo;all nationalist movements&rdquo;.  If &ldquo;these men&rdquo;&mdash;in the illegal organisation&mdash;have &ldquo;no shadow of right to take decisions involving the peace of Ireland&rdquo;, what does this Government intend now, after a year of appeals, to do?  The Taoiseach rightly pointed to the risks of future suffering on the part of Nationalists in the Six Counties arising <Col N="987" /> out of the kind of attacks that have been going on.</P>
    <P>I myself referred last year in this House to the possibility, the grave possibility, as I saw it, of innocent men and women suffering in the North as a result of this kind of violent action, while the men immediately responsible for that action slip across the Border and come south into the Republic. So far, it is true that neither of the organisations&mdash;apparently there are two&mdash;has killed anybody.  They have themselves provided victims, but if they do kill someone&mdash;I hesitate to say: if and when they do&mdash;what is going to be the effect on the temper of the people, both North and South?</P>
    <P>Again, at column 1343, the Taoiseach said in a simple and effective phrase:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The very mark of a civilised State is that the guns are all under lock and key...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>To that I would say: &ldquo;Excellent!&rdquo; but I feel entitled, as a public representative, to ask when is the Government going to put these guns under lock and key?</P>
    <P>Further, at column 1344, the Taoiseach said&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I was saying, when we adjourned, that I approved of the Taoiseach's statement that &ldquo;the very mark of a civilised State is that the guns are all under lock and key,&rdquo; and I put the question as to what the Government intended to do about that, and when it was, in effect, going to put the guns under lock and key, in order to merit, in the Taoiseach's own phrase, to be considered &ldquo;a civilised state&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach, at column 1344, said: &ldquo;We cannot afford any ambiguity of thought or attitude.&rdquo;  I entirely agree, and I believe that we cannot afford <Col N="989" /> either any ambiguity of action or inaction.  I noted&mdash;I was present&mdash; that the Dáil debate was not a general debate.  In my opinion, it ought to have been.  I notice that no provision, and I know that that is in accordance with precedent, but still I mention the fact, is made for any similar statement to be made in the Seanad, and, accordingly, apart from my motion, there is no possibility of a debate at all here in the Seanad on the Taoiseach's statement. In my view, the matter is certainly one on which we cannot afford any ambiguity of thought or attitude. If we really want to avoid ambiguity of thought and attitude, let us have clear debate, in which all shades of opinion shall be clearly expressed.</P>
    <P>I am afraid the attitude in this country and in the Oireachtas is based on the slogan: &ldquo;Better say nothing.&rdquo; And apparently the attitude of the Government also is that it is better to listen to nothing either.  I had not expected the Taoiseach to be present in person here this evening, but I had expected that at least some junior member of the Government would be prepared to come here to the Seanad, and to listen, if only to what one Senator has to say.  Though I hope there will be others to follow me.</P>
    <P>Why is this slogan so popular, that it is &ldquo;better to say nothing&rdquo;?  What exactly are we afraid of?  Are we afraid of discovering the fact that there are different opinions about this whole matter?  I would suggest that, if such differences of opinions exist, then they should be made manifest in public parliamentary debate where Senators and Deputies may be taken as answerable for what they say.  Too often, resort is had in this country of ours, I am afraid, to cowardly public silence.  If, as the Taoiseach says, Senators and Deputies have a grave responsibility and duty to guide public opinion in these matters, then this responsibility and these duties are not best fulfilled by maintaining a cautious public silence.</P>
    <P>I should like to say that I deplore the attitude which is symbolised by the atmosphere of hush-hush which surrounded the recent inquest in Monaghan. I am not indicting the <Col N="990" /> authorities, but I think that the whole attitude in attempting to suppress the details of what took place, including the identity of the dead man, is wrong. It seems to me that, in fact, the corner's jury that night at the inquest, without evidence as to how the wounds were inflicted, could not have given the verdict it did, without in fact knowing how the wounds had been inflicted.  In other words, it was made possible for them to tell a public lie, because, in private, they knew the truth.  If they really had not known how this unfortunate man was shot, they could not have found such a verdict as they did.  They would have had to adjourn the inquest in order to find out what had in fact happened.</P>
    <P>There was also a burial in the middle of the night, and, no matter what way we look at it, it is an extraordinary thing to have taken place.  If we are proud of him as a soldier of the Republic, why not give him a public funeral in daylight?  If we differ from him in the view and the stand he took why should we allow silence to be our only answer in such an occurrence? Because I think, if we do that, such occurrences will recur.</P>
    <P>I should now like to turn to another point in the Taoiseach's statement.  He spoke of extradition, and I may say that I agree wholeheartedly with what he said on extradition.  I think he put the case extremely well.  He made the point, which should be obvious, that, in any extradition convention, there is always a clause which precludes the use of extradition for political offences. The Taoiseach quoted, I thought most tellingly, the opinion of Sir John Fischer Williams, the English delegate, explaining why it was that the British would not accept an extradition convention which included extradition for political offences.  I thought the Taoiseach's case on extradition was most telling and absolutely sound, for the fact is, whatever way you like to look at it, that these happenings have as their basis politics.  They are political offences and it is absurd to pretend that they are not.  And so the Taoiseach was right.</P>
    <P>I would say this, nevertheless, that there are, in my opinion, two implications in the Taoiseach's stated attitude <Col N="991" /> towards extradition.  The first of these is that it is the Government's duty to see that the Republic here is not used as a barracks and parade ground for self-chosen private armies.  If the Government does its best to stop this, its attitude on extradition will be far more solidly based.</P>
    <P>The second implication of the Government's attitude towards extradition is this, and I think it is worthy of mention, that if and when the problem here is finally being grappled, it must be recognised by our Government that these young men, however misguided they may be, are acting from political motives and consequently deserving, from those who are trying to prevent them from indulging in armed violence, of political treatment as political prisoners.  I am afraid that that is a point which has frequently been missed by many Governments, once trouble starts at home.  People who were in the past involved in similar happenings refuse to recognise that those who in the present are involved in similar happenings are in fact motivated by political concerns.</P>
    <P>In explanation of the Government's reluctance up to now to take active steps in this matter, the Taoiseach said at columns 1348 and 1349 that they had in the past.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;based our policy in this matter on a detestation of repressive measures against any section of our people and on the hope that the previous statements by myself and other members of the Government, and, I am glad to say, by the Leader of the Opposition, would have the effect which we desired.  Our detestation of repressive measures remains, but our hope of influencing the men concerned by reasoned statements has not been fulfilled.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I have, in all sincerity, every sympathy with the Government and with the Taoiseach in the present circumstances, and I would certainly share his detestation of repressive measures. But when it is his opinion that the time has come when reasoned arguments are not listened to, when the <Col N="992" /> deaf ear is turned to them, and when things continue as if no reasoned argument had been put, then I am afraid measures of repression will have to be introduced by us to stop the bearing of arms, drilling and recruiting of private armies in this part of the country.</P>
    <P>It is my belief that the Taoiseach, who is not in an easy position, is quite fundamentally and entirely a man of peace, but he now recognises that his appeals have failed.  He recognises that in the statement that he made, and which I have just quoted, and I would ask him what, then, are the Government waiting for?  Are they waiting for another act of armed violence?  Are they waiting for an act of armed violence in this part of the country?  I suggest that such a pause, such an interval, is merely an interval which allows those armed forces to grow stronger, and will render them more difficult to deal with, when eventually the Government decides to deal with them.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach also went into past history.  He referred to the 1920 Act, which was, as the House knows, and Act of the British Government.  I believe he was justified in going back, and that it would be absurd, as some English politicians try to do, to pretend that the present condition of Partition and the situation in the North and South has not been affected primarily and basically by the 1920 Act.  I think, furthermore, that we, as public men and women, should be prepared to debate publicly our history and to go back, if need be, even further than 1920.</P>
    <P>I believe, as I say, that the Taoiseach was justified in going back to the 1920 Act and in attributing a large share of blame to the then British Government; but I am afraid he was lacking in candour when, throughout his statement, he made no reference at all to the 1925 Agreement.</P>
    <P>In December, 1925, the Government of this country made an agreement with Britain.  The party of which the present Taoiseach is the Leader was the Government Party, or its then equivalent was.  The 1925 Agreement contained the following first clause, and I quote:&mdash;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="993" />&ldquo;...the extent of Northern Ireland for the purposes of the Government of Ireland Act, 1920 ... should be such as was fixed by sub-section (2) of Section 1 of that Act.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That meant of the Government of Ireland Act, 1920.  That was signed by William Cosgrave, Kevin O'Higgins and Ernest Blythe.  It was subject to ratification, and it was due to come back here to be considered by the Dáil, and by the people of Ireland.  Consequently, on the day on which it was signed in London, December 3rd, 1925, Mr. Cosgrave and Mr. O'Higgins sent a message by telegram to the people of Ireland, and they said, and I quote:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;To-day we have sown the seeds of peace...  An instrument which provides a sane and constructive solution, born of a genuine desire for peace between the two Nations has been signed.  We bring back an instrument solemnly executed by friendship.  This Agreement, accepted in the spirit in which it was negotiated and signed, provides a basis of a sure and lasting peace. We confindently recommend it to the Irish people.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I regard it as disingenuous on the Taoiseach's part to-day to go back to the 1920 Act, and to fail even to mention the 1925 Agreement, which amended it and confirmed certain of its provisions.  The signatories said at that time that it was &ldquo;solemnly executed by friendship&rdquo;.  I feel entitled to ask: had that phrase in that context any meaning?  And should we not, here, no matter what we think of that Agreement, recognise that this Agreement was in fact signed in London by an Irish Government in 1925?</P>
    <P>At that same time, another leader, on December 6th, in Dublin, Mr. de Valera made a statement as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;To-day 48 elected members, representing over one-third of the people, are carefully excluded from voice or vote.  Were they not excluded, were these Articles to be submitted to an Assembly of all representatives of the people, they would be rejected.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="994" /> That was Mr. de Valera's statement, and he spoke on behalf of 48 members of the Dáil, Republicans, who refused to take their seats because of the oath to the King, in December, 1925.  In his statement, he says that these people were &ldquo;carefully excluded&rdquo;, by which he means that they were excluded by the retention of this oath of allegiance. They were excluded, in fact, I think it is fair to say, by the fact that Mr. de Valera and his followers had not yet noticed, or had failed to notice, that this oath, which would &ldquo;carefully exclude&rdquo; them, was, in fact, nothing more than an empty formula.  So I would put a share of blame there, too, because I think that if it was worthwhile to take that oath &ldquo;as an empty formula&rdquo; and come into the Dáil 18 months later, in 1927, to avoid losing their seats, then it was worth while to take that oath and come into the Dáil earlier to avoid losing the Six Counties. The only effective opposition was offered at that time by the Labour Party.  They called it &ldquo;an unmitigated betrayal&rdquo;, and voted and acted against it constitutionally, but, on December 27th, that 1925 Agreement was ratified in Dáil Éireann by 71 votes to 20, and if the 48 votes of the Republicans had been in the Dáil, they would not, in fact, have constituted a majority.</P>
    <P>Now, 18 months later, as I say, this careful &ldquo;exclusion&rdquo; of the Republican Deputies at that time was discovered to be only an illusion, and was circumvented by the taking of the oath.  I mention, in passing, that my mother, in fact, broke with Mr. de Valera's Party on that issue, because she continued to regard an oath as a matter of some importance.  These facts, however, do suggest this, that we have not the right to go back now to 1920 and to blame solely the British Government without, at least, mentioning the 1925 Agreement, even if we regret it now and would like to see it changed.  I do not regard, personally, any agreement as being permanently sacrosanct and immutable, wholly incapable of revision.  The fact is that in Ireland to-day the situation is bedevilled by the past of our political Parties.  Each, in turn, has at one time or another advocated force and resorted to the use of force.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="995" /> I should like to consider that question, because it is the fundamental one&mdash;the unlawful use of force as considered by the Taoiseach in his statement.  I should like to quote now from an open letter to Thomas MacDonagh which was written in 1915 and printed by my father, Francis Sheehy Skeffington, the year before he was murdered by another military machine.  What he said then&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I do not want to curb the Senator in putting his case before the House, but I would ask him to look at his own motion.  The essential part of his motion is that he regrets &ldquo;the Government's failure as yet to take any active steps to stop in the Republic of Ireland open recruiting, drilling and the possession of arms by private military organisations.&rdquo; Now, in presenting his arguments, the Chair does not regard it as essential for the Senator to go back over the history of the past 35 years in this country.  The Senator has had a fair amount of latitude in this.  I do not think it is in order to go back to the history of 1916, or pre-1916, and the Senator will please try to address himself to the motion, so as to be more in order from the point of view of the Chair.</P>

      <P>I appreciate your point of view, Sir.  I justified my remarks by noting that the Taoiseach himself considered it necessary to go back to 1920 in order to blame the British Government, and, I felt, rightly so, but the relevancy of the passage I should like to quote has nothing in fact to do exclusively with 1916, but rather with the possibility that to-day some young men who feel inspired to work and sacrifice for Ireland would be inspired to do something other than to resort to force.  I believe that the passage, if the Chair will permit me to quote it, could act as an inspiration to such men to serve their country more intelligently, and with no less self-sacrifice, than they bring to military ways.</P>

      <P>I will quote:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Can you not conceive an organisation, a body of men and women, banded together to secure and maintain the rights and liberties of the people of Ireland, a body animated with a high purpose, a united bond of comradeship, trained and disciplined in the ways of self-sacrifice and true patriotism, armed and equipped with the weapons of intellect and of will that are irresistible? &mdash;an organisation of people prepared to dare all things for their object, prepared to suffer and to die rather than abandon one jot of their principles&mdash;but an organisation that will not lay it down as its fundamental principle: &lsquo;We will prepare to kill our fellow men&rsquo;?</P>
      <P>...Ireland's militarism can never be on so great a scale as that of Germany or England, but it may be equally fatal to the best interests of Ireland.  European militarism has drenched Europe in blood; Irish militarism may only crimson the fields of Ireland.  For us that would be disaster enough.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I feel that that is not just a dead message, but is truly a live message for these young men to-day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In respect to your ruling, Sir, I do not intend to say more on that point and I should like to pass now to the dangerous question which the Taoiseach and the Government are attempting to deal with, and that is the notion, the wrong-headed notion, in my opinion, that you can right a wrong by resort to military resistance, because I would suggest that military resistance, even if successful, and I know that I am at one with the Taoiseach on that, because he said the same thing in practically the same words, could not, in fact, solve the problem.  Furthermore, military resistance brings with it two major long-term dangers.  First, soldiers have frequently no notion of what, politically, <Col N="997" /> socially and economically, they really want.  They are not sure, when they have won a victory, precisely what, in economic and political terms, they have been fighting for.  Secondly, after the victory, soldiers as statesmen and as Ministers are not always the people who are best fitted to construct the State.  I believe that people who have been good, brave and heroic soldiers not infrequently make poor, cowardly, weak and ineffective Ministers and statesmen.  And I am not prepared to accept the view, therefore, that the method of violence is the only one; nor am I prepared to accept the view that it brings satisfactory results.  That is, perhaps, because I am not as satisfied with the present visible results of our own military revolt as some people are to-day.  I believe it is possible that we might have had, at this day and hour, by constitutional means, within the whole country, a more satisfactory constitution to-day, had we indulged more in the constitutional resistance of the Irish Party&mdash;which is much vilified to-day, but which, if you turn to the Parliamentary Debates in the House of Commons after 1916, you will see stood for Ireland in a very true sense&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>As I was saying&mdash;and omitting portions of my argument because they are ruled to be out of order on this motion&mdash;I should like to suggest this in connection with the statement by the Taoiseach in reply to Mr. Hanna about the &ldquo;moral responsibility&rdquo; for certain actions.  The Taoiseach suggested that there was moral responsibility upon the British Government deriving out of a past, which I do not intend to go into.  He was replying to Mr. Hanna who suggested there was a moral responsibility on our own Government here.  I believe, to some extent, that that is true by reason of our delay, our <Col N="1001" /> hesitancy, and even by our not disciplining within our own Parties representatives of Government Parties who vocally defend these actions, passing county council resolutions of vicarious heroism, without the necessity of, in fact, themselves bearing arms.  I believe, however, and I should like to be allowed to say so, that moral responsibility also clearly lies on the Stormont Government and on the British Government not only of the past but of to-day.  At column 1338 the Taoiseach says: &ldquo;Feelings of resentment and frustration among the Nationalists of the Six Counties are kept alive,&rdquo; by Government policy.  I believe that that is true.</P>
      <P>I should like now to make a revolutionary suggestion to Mr. Hanna and to Lord Brookeborough, and that is that they should make a New Year resolution that, as from 1956, they will allow British Writ to run in the Six Counties under their control.  They boast frequently that these Six Counties are an integral part of the United Kingdom, but when it comes to such matters as local elections they are not prepared to accept the British Government law, since 1946, of universal suffrage, but prefer the restricted ratepayers' vote&mdash;abolished in Britain in 1946&mdash;with the result that they give short weight democracy in local elections to the poorer sections of the community, which are mainly Catholic and Nationalist.  The English are interested in this situation at least to some extent, I hope, though in sometimes rather too detached a way.  Does no Englishman care about this mutilation of British law in the Six Counties since 1946?  Is the British Government itself indifferent to the fact that Her Majesty's Writ cannot run throughout the United Kingdom, but is prevented in the Six Counties from running in regard to universal suffrage in local elections?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I noted that recently an English writer, representing the <i>Spectator</i>, interviewed Lord Brookeborough, and said that he had been shocked and surprised, before he went to Northern Ireland, about what he had heard about gerrymandering but that, from what he had heard since he went there, <Col N="1002" /> he understood that gerrymandering might be necessary in certain circumstances. To me, that kind of attitude seems a betrayal of everything that is best in what one terms &ldquo;fair play,&rdquo; to which at least sometimes the British Government seems to attribute importance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not see how the Senator can relate that argument to his motion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to suggest that the frustration to which the Taoiseach refers is due in part to measures of this kind which, in his own phrase, &ldquo;keep alive&rdquo; this resentment and frustration among the Nationalists and Catholics in the North.  I believe that fair shares in local government by constitutional means in the Six Counties would remove at least one large source of frustration which makes some Nationalists quite understandably turn with sympathy towards those who say: &ldquo;You will never get anything out of Britain by constitutional means.&rdquo; Therefore, I suggest there is also a moral responsibility upon the Stormont Government and the British Government to remove such frustrations, and, with respect to Lord Brookeborough, I suggest that there are still some matters which &ldquo;require exploration&rdquo;. Not all of the causes of tension spring from the military organisations. I feel strongly on the matter.  We must put our own house in order, as I said, but it also devolves upon the Northern and British Governments to do the same.</P>
      <P>Further, I should like to be permitted to remark that two of the Six Counties&mdash;Fermanagh and Tyrone&mdash; never, in fact, opted out of Ireland at all.  They were pushed out by the 1920 Act.  So far from opting out, on the contrary, constitutionally, they have ever since consistently voted themselves into all Ireland by the only constitutional means open to them, the casting of votes.  Yet Lord Brookeborough speaks of his belief in self-determination!  I believe myself&mdash; though I know the view is not shared by many here&mdash;that as there are four counties in the North which do&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Senator must appreciate that, in the judgment of the Chair, if he wanted to discuss the kind of argument he advances here this evening, he should have put down an entirely different form of motion altogether.  The Senator's motion is definite and specific.  The argument which he is making is not related to the matter contained in the motion. He has not come to that yet, and he must.</P>

      <P>In deference to the ruling of the Chair, I skipped many points that I wanted to make. I accepted the ruling of the Chair that they are out of order.  In relation to our own Government's duty then to put our own house in order by taking &ldquo;active steps,&rdquo; as my motion asks, I should like to say that, in fact, as far as the emergence of this new I.R.A. is concerned, it can do nothing but delight the Government in Stormont, because they know they can handle it easily, and they now have a splendid excuse for their B Specials and their armed police.  Stormont's delight is all the more reason, I suggest, for our Government taking active steps&mdash;which is what my motion asks for&mdash;to set their own house in order, now and firmly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The present situation in this country is that we have at least two private military organisations here, arming, drilling, possessing and carrying arms and recruiting.  Speakers on their behalf are openly inciting to acts of violence.  So far what you might call the only active step that has been taken among the many possible ones is what the Taoiseach said about the printing of news about the I.R.A.  I should like to quote from what the London <i>Times</i> said in relation to that, with your permission, Sir.  On 3rd. December, 1955, the London <i>Times</i>, under the heading &ldquo;Ban on News of I.R.A.&rdquo; reports that editors and correspondents were reminded that the 1939 Act had not been revoked, and that it &ldquo;contained a provision against <Col N="1004" /> the printing or publishing of matters dealing with unlawful organisations&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The London <i>Times</i> says further:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The conference to-day came as a surprise to the newspapers.  No spokesmen for the Government would say if any of the other provisions of the Act would be put into force at the same time.  These provisions make it an offence to carry on any kind of illegal activities such as carrying arms, drilling or recruiting.</P>
    <P>I feel&mdash;and it is in the terms of my motion&mdash;that the time has come for the Government to take real active steps.  I regard this particular step without the other steps as constituting rather a danger than a safeguard, because, quite easily, a state of panic might arise in the country from rumours of what was going on, while the Press was prevented from giving a full account.</P>
    <P>I should like to mention also the fact that the body calling itself the I.R.A. referred recently in one of these statements to &ldquo;the army&rdquo;.  They said: &ldquo;No members of the army were involved at Roslea&rdquo;, and by &ldquo;the army&rdquo; apparently, they meant their own organisation!  So that we have their newspaper talking about &ldquo;the army&rdquo; as if the Republic of Ireland had no Army at all.  What does the House feel about the prestige of our own Army, in which we may feel just pride?  It is not an enormous Army, but I feel that this kind of contemptuous dismissal of the Army for which after all, we vote £7,000,000 annually, is a thing which should not be tolerated.</P>
    <P>At column 1348 of the Official Report of Dáil Éireann, the Taoiseach says that these things &ldquo;cannot be tolerated&rdquo;.  I agree.  I submit that we all must agree.  But they are being tolerated, and have been tolerated for over a year now.  I put the question, what happens next?  What is the Government's intention, apart from these appeals?  Do they intend to act or do they merely intend in a year's time again, perhaps, to appeal to the &ldquo;leaders of public opinion&rdquo;, some of whom say extremely little, even when they get an opportunity of doing so as <Col N="1005" /> on a motion such as this?  Are we waiting for the building up of a big private army before we grapple with the situation?</P>
    <P>It was because I believe our Government can no longer stand idle and be content to condemn, to objurgate, to appeal and beseech, that I put down this motion, asking for more active steps to be taken.  How can recruiting, possession of arms, drilling and inciting to violence be stopped?  How can any law be enforced?  Necessarily by arresting and charging all those who break the law.  It is quite natural that an Irish Government should be reluctand to arrest Irishmen.  Nevertheless, if you really want the law to be respected and enforced, there comes a time when you must arrest those who break the law, and charge them in the courts.</P>
    <P>I believe myself that the Government is strong enough to see that the law is respected&mdash;that the high principles, so ably enunciated by the Taoiseach in his statement, will be implemented in fact.  I have no desire to see victims in our gaols, but the Government must govern, and, in its attempt to do so, it must be backed by all of us.  My opinion is that active steps must be taken now to stop this crazy militarism, however high its ideals or self-sacrificing its adherents. When such active steps are taken, as they must be sooner or later, I am confident that the Government will have the full force of intelligent and decent public opinion behind it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1006" /> I have spoken at length.  I said I would not be much longer than a further 40 minutes, nor have I exceeded that time very much.  I have spoken as I have in Seanad Éireann because I believe the Parliament of our country is the place in which to say these things.  I hope that somebody&mdash;at least even formally&mdash;will second this motion in order to give an opportunity to other public representatives to say what they feel on the matter, whether or not they agree with me.</P>
