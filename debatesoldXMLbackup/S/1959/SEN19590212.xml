      <P>Last evening I opened with just a few brief remarks on the fact that no factual information has been placed before the voters to enable them to make a decision on this very fundamental issue that confronts us.  Personally, I have no axe to grind in this matter.  Neither has any of my fellow Senators from the universities.  Surely it gives rise to thought that the five of us who have spoken, endeavouring to live up to the academic traditions of universities, endeavouring to live up to the tradition of scientific inquiry and impartial presentation of results, are unanimous in this issue?  It is not I think that we are unanimous on the virtues of P.R. or on the case against the straight vote but that we are unanimous in the view that enough information is not available to enable the electors to make a decision on this question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We ourselves feel we are only scratching the surface.  I have spoken about this matter with quite a few of my fellow-members.  We have spent time endeavouring to go through the systems in other countries, endeavouring to see the pros and cons.  We are only beginning.  We feel it is absolutely vital that this important issue of changing the Constitution should be approached on a non-Party <Col N="602" /> and impartial basis.  Nothing can establish that more than to have before us a White Paper of 40 to 50 or maybe 100 pages giving a whole factual analysis of systems in other countries and making reasonable predictions as to how changes here might react on our system.</P>
    <P>We have made some excellent beginnings.  We have got the Capital Investment Advisory Committee which has done excellent work.  We have all accepted their recommendations in the non-Party and impartial spirit in which they have been given.  I might refer to the recent White Paper by the Government. My first reaction on reading it through was that it was more political window-dressing and that we had heard all that before&mdash;until I got Mr. Whitaker's excellent Survey on Economic Development.  Then the whole thing took on a completely new outlook.  Here were the facts and figures that led up to the recommendation in that excellent book.  Besides, I and everybody else reading it had confidence in the objectivity of the man who produced that work and the machinery behind the production of the work.</P>
    <P>That, I submit, is what we need here and until it comes I feel that, far from being criticised for trying to deny voters their rights, we, the independent Senators here, should be praised for standing for the rights of voters, that is, the rights of voters to know intelligently and to be told impartially where they are going and where they are being led and to ensure that they are not simply being led by catch cries about a Coalition Centre Party or a Coalition inter-Party or being told that Hitler did this and Mussolini did something else.  In this scientific day and age, our people demand something better.  The young men of Ireland demand it&mdash;the young men on whom the future rests and, please God, if they do not get what they demand they will at least observe the well-known principle in liturgy.  As a priest said to me recently: &ldquo;In liturgy, if you do not know where you are going then stay where you are.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I want to proceed briefly to illustrate some of the many ideas and the many <Col N="603" /> things which it is necessary to ascertain.  I have some tentative facts here; I am not satisfied completely with them but they show that this question is a far bigger one than its treatment by many speakers would suggest.  You just cannot reduce it down to the position that one is right and the other is wrong.  As seen by all thinkers on the subject there are two functions in an election.  One is to ensure a Government that can carry on; the other is to ensure representation. There is quite a conflict as to which deserves the most emphasis.  It is claimed that the straight vote will ensure a stronger form of Government, exaggerating majorities.  To that extent, if that claim is correct, where a country needs absolutely resolute Government, because of a disturbed condition, perhaps the straight vote has quite a bit on its side.  On the other hand, P.R. gives all reasonable shades of opinion a chance of expression in Parliament so that Parliament can bring the very best ideas to bear on its problems and as far as possible strive for what is the wish of the majority.</P>
    <P>That is the problem of representation and I think here we have a vital factor that seems to have been missed &mdash;at least I have not seen it referred to up to now, namely, that we are calling for two Parties, a Government and an Opposition who can take over when we get tired of the Government. I think there is nearly agreement on that on all sides &mdash; to have at least a Government and an alternative Government. In other countries the lines of division are sharper than here.  In France, Italy and so on, very often the issue is clerical or anti-clerical, a question of, &ldquo;shall we banish religion from the schools or not; shall we drive out the religious schools?&rdquo;  Thank God we have not got those issues here.  We are all united on that.  We all have the Christian tradition and the Christian outlook on such matters.</P>
    <P>Other countries are divided on the question as to whether they shall have Socialism or not.  Again, thank God, we have been spared a great deal of that.  In addition, you would find other points of diversion such as <Col N="604" /> the pros and cons of monarchy, and all the rest but here we found the point of division in the civil war&mdash;the question of which side you were on. That has acted for a number of years to give us two groups and in the language of students of politics it polarises the electorate, draws them to two poles.  The young Ireland of to-day is not, however, going to have such out-dated polarisation.  Young Ireland recognises that the civil war was an unfortunate and unhappy period of our existence and that the best we can do is draw a veil over it and proceed on to the future.</P>
    <P>We cannot use the civil war as a means of polarisation of Parties but this issue has blown up &mdash; Coalition or single-Party Government.  You have had the Taoiseach's violent denunciation of the idea of Coalition Government; yet the electorate has seen fit to replace one by the other.  You had a single-Party Government up to 1948; inter-Party, or Coalition Govment, from 1948 to 1951; back again to the single-Party Government, on to the Coalition and back again to single-Party Government.  Would it not be a happy day for this country if you could polarise the political thinking of this country for the next 20 years in that way?  By all means let Fianna Fáil hold on to their conception of single-Party Government &mdash; and they do a great deal of good for the country by that&mdash;but equally let them recognise that Coalition, or inter-Party Government, is quite an alternative type of Government and forms the other pole of our electoral systems.  If we do that we may get what we are seeking, something that will polarise our electorate and give us stability and a reasonable amount of continuity in our electoral systems.</P>
    <P>I want to establish now the case that there are many things that we do not know about systems in other countries.  Many false analogies that have come into the debate call for an impartial study.  To begin with I shall take this question of P.R. Listening to many of the speeches here, and <Col N="605" /> reading many of the speeches in the other House, one could be pardoned for concluding that the idea of proportion, and P.R., had escaped many of the members.  In fact, there are no fewer than 300 variations of P.R.  We in our present system are nearer to the majority form of government than we are to the true ideal of P.R.</P>
    <P>P.R. springs from the mathematical idea of giving all groups a say in the government, or at least getting their voices heard in Parliament.  The earlier advocates of this measure were idealists.  They wanted to ensure that no group whatsoever was excluded. That meant that, in very many cases, the country as a whole was treated as one single constituency so that any candidate in this country, if elections were held on that basis, who could command around 1 per cent. of the vote could be elected to Parliament. That system is at present in operation in Holland and in Israel, to which I shall come back later.  We are far from that here with our preponderance of three-seat constituencies.  After all, in a three-seat constituency the quota is one quarter, or 25 per cent. of the vote.  To get elected you must get 25 per cent. of the vote in a fair-sized region.  Certainly you are no longer representing a weak minority when you get that.  In fact, you have quite a sizable following in your locality.</P>
    <P>I want now to take the various countries and make just a few remarks on each.  I might mention that that excellent study was completed less than two years ago in the University of London by a distinguished student of University College, Cork, Dr. Cornelius O'Leary.  He did an excellent study of electoral systems and on it he was rewarded with the highest honour the university could confer.  It followed from the previous work of Professor James Hogan on election and representation.  I think it is almost essential for anybody to discuss this intelligently to have at least read and digested Professor Hogan's book and, if possible, to have read Dr. O'Leary's excellent work.  It is the only way that one can see the issues that are at stake.</P>
    <P>The country to introduce P.R. first <Col N="606" /> was Belgium, in 1899.  It was followed by Sweden in 1907, by Denmark in 1915 and Holland in 1917.  Germany and Italy followed in 1919, and so on.  It is of comparatively recent growth.  It came at the same time as two other distinct happenings, universal suffrage and the rise of Socialism, the days of Labour banding together to advance its rights.  We come then to study the history of Europe at that period without making full allowance for those two factors. The opening of the franchise, in fact, is one of the most unpredictable of all things in a country, because you may have a large number who had been deprived of the vote in many cases, or who were illiterate, suddenly having this weapon of recording their votes thrust into their hands.  How would they use it?  It takes years to develop political sense and it is no wonder that there have been erratic happenings in the working of the system.</P>
    <P>Let us take the first-mentioned country, Belguim.  Prior to 1899, Belgium operated the usual type of majority system.  It was a list system and they had a second ballot which gave a chance for those at the bottom of the poll to drop out, thereby releasing the voters to transfer their votes to some other candidate more likely to be elected.  That, after all, is the forerunner of the transferable vote in P.R.  In fact, I had a rather interesting session with a strong exponent of the majority system recently.  I discussed with him this election of candidates at a Party convention where the object is to select three candidates from, say, six in the field.  He was quite adamant that it was done by straight voting.  &ldquo;What do you do?&rdquo; I asked?  &ldquo;We vote, and then we eliminate the sixth man and vote-again.&rdquo;&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;and then you eliminate the fifth man?&rdquo;&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;and we vote again.&rdquo;  What is that but the transferable vote you have in P.R., except that you do not go back to the voter?  You simply ask-him the question: &ldquo;If your first choice is to be eliminated, what will we do with your vote?&rdquo;  And he tells you there and then what to do with his vote.  What is the difference between <Col N="607" /> that and the system of election used at Party conventions?  I take it that you have such a system in the national Party executives and in the county councils, as the system by which you select rate collectors and make any other appointments that still remain with the county councils.</P>
    <P>To go on &mdash; Belgium had two Parties, Catholics and Liberals.  These continued after P.R., except for the rise of a Socialist Party which would have come in any case.  These three Parties continued right through to 1918 when the Catholics and Liberals combined.  After the First World War, the Catholic Party lost its majority and never regained it, but it has continued ever since in coalitions. There have been coalitions of the three major Parties, the Catholics, Liberals and Socialists, or else coalitions of two of the major Parties, usually Catholics and Liberals.  By all accounts, Belgium has prospered and has got on quite well.</P>
    <P>The test of government is not the power of the Taoiseach or the Prime Minister; it is the development in the country itself.  It is the increase in its population, the development of its resources, the place it holds in the world; and who are we to criticise countries like Belgium, Holland, Denmark or Norway?  They have done what we could not do.  They have increased their population; they have been able to provide bread and work for anyone who wished to stay in his native country, something which we, after 30 years, have not been able to do.  Of course, anyone experienced in government&mdash;in fact, anybody in any committee &mdash; would like to get his own way all the time and would like to be able to count on an absolute majority but &ldquo;by their fruits you shall know them.&rdquo;  That is the only way we can judge how a Government will carry on in the future.  Let us take the yardsticks of unemployment, emigration and education.  Let us compare the advance in education in Belgium and Holland with what we have done in 30 years.  We subscribe to the fact that education is the key to development of a modern nation; yet we can get <Col N="608" /> £1,000,000 at the drop of a hat for the extension of the runways at Shannon Airport, while we cannot get an extra £1,000 a year to provide adult education for the young farmers of Munster. That is our progress and that is what we have got with majority government.</P>
    <P>I am just making the point that we must be careful; we can judge Governments only by their fruits and by their impact on the country as a whole and, taken by those standards, Belgium has achieved considerable success.  Since pre-war &mdash; and pre-war the issue was the same &mdash; there are three Parties in Belgium and the Communist Party has not made any significant advance there.</P>
    <P>We go on to Scandinavia, Norway, Sweden and Denmark and the main outstanding feature there has been the gradual rise of Socialism.  It has largely been tempered by coalitions. Perhaps, that has been very distasteful to the Socialists as a group.  They would like to be able to push ahead with all their nationalisation and other Socialist acts.  They have been held back by P.R. and Western Europe may thank God for having done that for us, because the Socialism of to-day is much more conservative and staid than the Socialism of 20 or 30 years ago.  They see now that nationalisation by itself is not a panacea and they have been tempered by the other Parties in Europe.  If we ever have a Socialist Government here, although I, for one, have no desire whatever to see it, I pray it will have to spend many years in apprenticeship in coalitions before it ever emerges as an overall majority Government, and I think everybody here who is interested in the welfare of the country will pray with me in that.</P>
    <P>In Sweden the rise of the Socialist Party was through coalition with the Agrarian Party in the 1930's, but even then, when the Socialist Party attained an overall majority, it continued in coalition with the Agrarian Party, proving that it was in no way dissatisfied with the results of the previous years.  It was mentioned here quite a lot that they are thinking about changing their system in Sweden.  In fact they did change it in 1952.  They took <Col N="609" /> the first essential step to change; they established an impartial, unbiassed commission to review the whole question, and it was only on the results of that report that they acted.  They were worried.  What were they worried about?  They were worried about the fact that they thought P.R., as they had it with relatively small constituencies, was rather unfair to the smaller Parties, that the quotas were being set too high and that the smaller Parties were not getting sufficient representation.  The report suggested going more proportional, so that smaller Parties could get better representation.  When the report was furnished Parliament did not go the whole way with it but went part of the way.  They reduced the quotas and arranged for the utilisation of surpluses. They also arranged for preferential voting within the Party list.</P>
    <P>That is really an outstanding thing. We have that type of preferential voting here in our multiple-member constituencies.  The Party puts up three members and the electorate proceed to elect maybe one, maybe two from the Party list.  That was their reform in 1952.  We understand they have another commission sitting at present &mdash; a proper, logical, scientific, rational approach &mdash; and we shall see the outcome of that, too.  However, one thing you can certainly bet is that it is not a question of jumping from a fair measure of P.R. to the straight majority in single-member constituencies.</P>
    <P>We go on to Norway.  P.R. was first introduced around 1917 and from then until 1927 some of the Parties were split and you got several Parties in that period.  The split healed in 1927 and since then Socialism has increased in Norway so that it has had a hand in most Norwegian Governments and it actually attained a majority representation of 85 seats out of 152 in 1949, and that with 48 per cent. of the electorate.</P>
    <P>We have heard a great deal about Denmark as a wonderful example to us in agriculture, and rightly so.  For years we have heard about the Danish production figures.  We have heard about the Danish advisory service but, <Col N="610" /> above all, we have heard about the Danish co-operative movement and the fact that the Danish Government knows exactly where to draw the line, that it knows what to leave to the people to do for themselves.  Its function is, you might say, to encourage the people to do the job for themselves. Their co-operatives have done that and I need not give fact or figure to prove their tremendous success in that.  Yet Denmark has four nation-wide Parties; it has since 1918 had P.R. and has been ruled by various types of Coalition Governments since then and, judged by their performance, highly successful Governments.  I only wish our Governments since 1918 could match the record of the Danish Governments since then.</P>
    <P>To make things more extreme, in Denmark so anxious are they for representation, that they allot 44 additional seats to those that failed to get representation in the elections.  In other words they have a far more extreme form of P.R. than we have here to-day and yet they are perfectly happy with it.  The secret of their success is that every parliamentarian in Denmark is a Dane first.  He is for the welfare of his country and he assumes that the other members, whatever Party they are in, are actuated by the best motives for the welfare of the country.  They agree on ends, ends for the prosperity and welfare of Denmark and its people.  They differ in means and that should be our approach, too.</P>
    <P>Speaking of coalitions themselves, the greatest coalition in the whole country is the Civil Service and it is doing a very good job.  You have the various Departments all trying to get their own schemes through, trying to get money for their own projects, and the Department of Finance is like the Taoiseach sitting in the centre coordinating them and getting them to compromise.  The word &ldquo;compromise&rdquo; is used as if it were an intrinsically evil word whereas the whole business of life and living here is one of compromise.</P>

      <P>Within the family, the local parish council, anywhere you go, and rightly so.  We do not want the bully at any level, whether it is in the family, the town council or in the university council.  We are coalitions there and we compromise, and I think it is the best possible form of working at any level in the life of the community.</P>
      <P>Now we come to Holland which has the most extreme form of P.R.  The country is one single constituency so that, if anything, that is asking for trouble.  Added to that is the fact that the country is organised quite a bit on sectarian lines.  You have the Catholic Party, the Protestant Party, the Catholic Trade Union, the Protestant Trade Union, and so on.  If any country was set to go to pieces, you might say it was Holland.  Yet, judged by their production and rise in population, they have been the most successful country in Europe over the past 25 years.</P>
      <P>No doubt, the leader of the Catholic Party there would love to have an overall majority.  But would the rest of the citizens in the country like that?  And if the pendulum swung the other way and if the leader of the Protestant Party had an overall majority, would the Catholics like that?  In such a situation, the healthiest possible thing is compromise and coalition government.  The Dutch have worked out an excellent form of coalition based on what looks like the unpromising foundation of sectarian Parties.  They have drawn these groups closer together by emphasising all they have in common, and starting from that as a point of departure.  I only wish we could have a little more of that realisation between our various groups here.  Take the Catholic and non-Catholic groups in our community. Why not let us concentrate in the future on all we have in common? In any other country, we would be the closest allies, due to what we have in common.  Let us not exaggerate differences, but let us rather agree to respect those differences and to emphasise the great amount we have in common.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These are countries that began with <Col N="612" /> their P.R. after the First World War. But most revealing of all is the State of Israel, founded in 1947.  If any State was founded to a blueprint, it is Israel.  More thought and effort were put into the founding of that State than any other, because the people were coming together from various parts of the world to have what they had looked for for centuries &mdash; a homeland. They had lived in many countries, suffering in some and prospering in others, under various forms of government.  We can take it that they knew exactly from first hand experience what the different forms of government meant and what they could accomplish.</P>
    <P>What form of government did Israel take in 1947?  They took the form that any enthusiastic young people with confidence and hope in the future would take.  They took the most extreme form of P.R.  The whole country is one single constituency, so that you get all shades and types of opinion in that Parliament.  I have seen recently a film showing the enormous strides forward that Israel has made in the past ten years.  I doubt if we can compare with what they have done in that period.  I do say that their form is the most extreme form.  Perhaps, with the passage of years, they will modify it and find they will have to exclude minorities of, say, 1, 2 or 3 per cent.  They may even get as far as we have got at present and exclude minorities up to 20 per cent., as we do with our four seat constituencies, or minorities up to 25 per cent., as we do with our three seat constituencies.  But the fact is that, in the absence of a commission report for this country, I or any other scientist looking at the facts cannot dismiss what has happened in the latest and most carefully thought out investigation into a system of government.</P>
    <P>In regard to P.R., we have had Germany and Italy trotted out very much.  First of all, let us be fair and face the facts.  Any scientist cannot possibly accept a comparison of a nation of 3,000,000 with a nation of 40,000,000 or 50,000,000, a straggling nation with all different types of <Col N="613" /> peoples, a buffer between various &ldquo;isms&rdquo;.  You just cannot regiment or put straitjackets on groups like that, except the straitjacket of dictatorship. And they did that.</P>
    <P>Go back after the First World War to the Weimar Republic in 1918.  First of all, you had universal suffrage for the first time.  That, in itself, was a tremendous gamble at the period.  How would it go?  As well as that, you had the discontent of the defeated nation in the war.  All that was added together. Is it any wonder that you just could not mould such a nation into one or two Parties?  Things were all right up to 1928.  Then the economic crisis hit them.  The Government were unable to cope with the situation which deteriorated and became worse and worse, but a few years afterwards, in the United States, you had a single Party Government trying to cope with the same situation; and did they do any better?  You had bread lines and bread queues.  The depths of collapse in America were even worse than in Germany.</P>
    <P>Is it any wonder that the people in Germany turned to somebody promising?  The reason Hitler came to power is relatively simple.  It was not P.R.  The reason given by Dr. O'Leary was &ldquo;Party bossism, ageing leadership and the election of mediocrities&rdquo;.  That is why Hitler came to power.  The youth of Germany had become tired of the older generation prescribing remedies for them.  On the one hand, they were behind Hitler; and on the other hand, were the military groups, the ex-soldiers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  That was the explosive combination.  It is ridiculous to suggest that P.R. brought Hitler to power.  Certainly no scientist will ever accept such a simple generalisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then in Italy in 1919 you had two Parties &mdash; the Socialists who were rabid anti-clericals and the Popular Party led by Don Sturgo.  To these were added, as one would expect normally <Col N="614" /> in the aftermath of war, the Democrats and the Fascists.  In 1921 and 1922 you had Mussolini emerging as the only strong man in the country.  Now, he would have emerged whatever system they had in Italy at that period. He just could not be stopped in the chaos and aftermath of war.  Remembering that we place so much reliance here on the majority vote of the people and so forth, we ought to realise that Mussolini commanded a large majority of the Italian voters right through the '20s and the '30s.  There is no denying that fact and, had Mussolini played a different hand in the war, we might be taking a different view of him to-day.</P>
    <P>With regard to Hitler, there is no denying the fact that he had the German nation behind him all through the '30s.  He won support by propaganda and every other means, but the fact is he had the people behind him. For a large part of the period he was producing enough food for the people and helping to alleviate the economic crisis of the time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite so.  Senator Ó Maoláin quoted from Professor Hogan's book &mdash; quotations which, divorced from their context, might lead one to believe that Professor Hogan was anti-P.R.  The quotations are convincing because Professor Hogan, approaching the problem as a scientist, analysed each system and fearlessly exposed the faults and shortcomings of each system. Naturally he was very conscious of the shortcomings in P.R.  As I said before, there are 300 varieties of P.R. and I, for one, would vote to the bitter end against any attempt to extend our P.R. here; that is, to extend it and make the whole country into six, seven or eight seat constituencies.  That would be a retrograde step.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Professor Hogan also analysed the straight vote system.  Now, what seems to have escaped the notice of those reading his book is the fact that he actually wrote a whole chapter in it &mdash;&ldquo;Conclusions&rdquo;.  Perhaps I shall <Col N="615" /> be forgiven for reading just a few of the conclusions:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It will be apparent from the general trend of our argument that there are strong reasons, reasons especially relevant in the case of Ireland, for seeking a solution for the problem of election and representation in a fresh compromise between P.R., and the majority system rather than reverting violently to the former.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is what Professor Hogan wrote in 1945.</P>
    <P>Last week I had the privilege of having a session with him and he told me that nothing that has happened since has altered his view; he would at the moment go more in the direction of the majority system; in other words, he would take the four and five seat constituencies and break them down into three seat constituencies, giving more power, if you wish, to the Party getting a majority.  In the light of the last election that would increase the present Government's representation by at least five or six additional seats. Does anybody contend that, if we put another six on to the impressive tally gained by the present Government in the last election, they would not have ample power?  I would go so far as to say they would have too much power and too many representatives.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>But Professor Hogan goes further and he suggests that, having broken down the five and six seat constituencies, we might make a start and experiment with a few single seat transferable vote constituencies; but the idea of a non-transferable vote is something that is absolutely anathema to him.  With gradual progress and gradual development one knows where one is going and one can make one's changes gradually. Professor Hogan says:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The majority system is good where a community is least homogeneous, where, like in America, you have different racial groups that <Col N="616" /> need to be brought together and integrated into the community.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It has a certain effect there, but in a country like ours, a country as homogeneous as ours, we have no such problem.  In many ways, in fact, we have too much uniformity.</P>
    <P>I would recommend all Senators, before drawing conclusions from what Professor Hogan has written, to read Professor Hogan's conclusions.  They are the most important part of what he has written.  He says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is probable that, for example, in Ireland an outright return to the majority system would enable the present Government Party not merely to survive to a ripe old age but to go on governing even after a decline into a state of dotage.  In these unhappy circumstances, there is much to be said for having in Parliament at least a few Independents who, because they have minds of their own and are free to speak them, can become the mediums for expressing unpalatable but salutary truths and opinions.  However bitter in the mouths for Party leaders and however unpopular with large sections of the electorate, such plain speaking is essential to the elasticity of thought which is an indispensable condition of an alert, fearless and freely developing public opinion.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I want to analyse now some of the countries in which the straight vote system operates and to show that their conditions do not apply to us.  But, remember, all the time I am trying to show that this problem is much bigger than we think it is.  The Minister does not know the answer.  We do not know the answer.  Nobody knows the answer.  We must study the systems and find out in the light of cold, scientific investigation where we are going. What do we want to do in the future? Do we want to create Parties or do we want to create majorities in the House? No.  We want to develop the country; that is our problem.</P>
    <P>I shall go on now to the English system which has been so praised here. Under the English system, I find that, <Col N="617" /> in 1951, the Conservative Party polled 250,000 votes less than the Labour Party and got 25 seats more than the Labour Party, so that is an example of the straight vote system of election.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I just want to draw a deduction which has not been drawn.  So far from representing the will of the majority, the result of the 1951 election distorted it in England.  In 1955, the Labour Party polled 12,400,000 votes and got 277 seats and the Conservatives polled 13,300,000 and got 345 seats.  Perhaps that looks all right to us, but in applying the British system here, the real fallacy is in the number of safe seats that are to be found in England.  In fact, it is estimated at present in as reliable a journal as <i>The Economist,</i> that 500 of the 600 seats are safe.  It is that that keeps the balance in the English electoral system and not any merit of their majority vote.</P>
      <P>The 100 seats that are not safe swing violently from one election to another and what would happen if the whole 600 seats in England could swing in the same way?  Apply that to our situation here.  We have no safe seats in this country.  A few seats may appear to be safe, but, by and large, taking our election results over the past 15 years, we find we cannot point to any essentially safe seats.  Why?  Because we are not divided on any fundamental issue and that is the only type of division that will create safe seats. If we take the British system here, we face violent oscillations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Going through the electoral results for the previous election, it is very hard to see how any Opposition candidates could be elected.  I take it that it is not the wish of the Taoiseach or the wish of the Minister for External Affairs that we should have a lopsided Dáil.  In fact, I think both of them would settle for the present majority as being workable, not excessive and giving plenty of Opposition views in the House.  At least any democrat would settle for that.  If we <Col N="618" /> swing the other way, it is quite certain, on the last results, that if the Opposition got 20 seats, that is the very maximum they could hope for, because in those areas where Fianna Fáil polled less than 50 per cent., as in the Galway region and so on, the Opposition was very neatly divided between Labour, Fine Gael and the Farmers, so that even though Fianna Fáil got 48 per cent. and none of the others got anywhere near that vote, it is certain that under the non-transferable vote, such a seat would go to the majority Party, the 48 per cent.  Party.</P>
    <P>That is all very well, as the Government know.  It may be all very well for their returns, but the pendulum will swing and the pendulum can swing just as easily the other way, and you could have another Government elected and 20 Fianna Fáil seats in the House.  If that happens, we will find that the casualties will mainly be the outstanding men of the previous Government Party because in a single seat constituency, if there is a big man standing for one Party, usually what is done is you either concede the election or you mark him with an equally big man.  Even if the Opposition fails, its turn is coming in the next election, and in the next election they will naturally see to it that they oppose the big man of the outgoing Government with a big man from their group, and unfortunately these are the people who will be missing from the Opposition in the following Dáil.</P>
    <P>Take it another way.  The incoming Government with its 100 or 120 members will be composed of people who are new to the Dáil and completely inexperienced in the government. That is a very bad thing.  In fact, it was one of the major causes of the excesses that occurred in the French Revolution&mdash;the 1789 law which made outgoing members ineligible for reelection. We know what happened then when a completely new and inexperienced group tried to handle what must be regarded as one of the most delicate and ticklish of operations, that of running a Government.</P>
    <P>While the English system, the straight vote, might help the Government Party in one election it might <Col N="619" /> just as clearly and definitely obliterate them at the following election.  We do not want that to happen nor does the Taoiseach or anybody else.  I am convinced from my reading and from what study I can do on it that the conditions here are so dissimilar from conditions in England that it will happen here.  I do not want to be dogmatic but I do feel that this is one very vital point on which a proper, impartial commission can give a very valuable opinion.</P>
    <P>For my part I would regard even that one objection as far too grave and serious to justify a change unless I could be assured that this would not happen here.  In fact, you might sum up the present position in England as being that 46 per cent. of the people are irrevocably committed to Labour; another 46 per cent. to Conservative and 2½ per cent. or 2 per cent. to Liberal, leaving a balance of 6 per cent.  It is the votes of this 6 per cent. that make or unmake Governments and here we are devoting all our time to attacking the lunatic fringe and trying to exclude them from control, and the very division in England depends on the votes of that lunatic fringe, or in-between fringe, which wants to know whether the Conservatives will give them more or the Labour Party can afford to buy them better or give them more so that they will swing the vote.</P>
    <P>As I say, that very closeness of the English system would not repeat itself here.  The danger here is not in that type of oscillation but in the violent swing.  In Professor Hogan's book, very convincing facts and figures are given to show that the Spanish Civil War was caused by the direct vote which brought the four Parties in and swung eventually to the Popular Front Government, but I do not wish to weary the House by quoting it.</P>
    <P>Coming nearer home we come to the Six Counties.</P>

      <P>We are discussing electoral systems and I hope I <Col N="620" /> am discussing the matter in a completely impartial and scientific manner. At least I am endeavouring to do that.  What I am saying will be printed in the Official Report and if anybody can produce facts to contradict what I am saying, I shall be only too pleased to get them.  That, after all, should be the outlook of any scientist.</P>
      <P>Let us take the elections to Westminster in 1955.  You find that in the four Belfast constituencies you had the straight vote and the non-transferable and it worked so well that the Unionist poll totalled 127,000 votes.  The Labour Party got 52,000 and the Sinn Féin or Nationalist Opposition got 18,000.  The Unionist Party, of course, walked off with the four seats.  Can Labour or Nationalists in Belfast tell us they consider it an equitable scheme that denies them any one of those four places in Westminster?  Can we ask their advice as to whether they think what we are doing here is just or fair? The total Opposition represented 70,000 electors or 36 per cent. of the votes, yet they did not get a single seat of the four to Westminster.</P>
      <P>Then we come to the October, 1953 elections in which in Central Belfast you had a result something like this: Independent Labour, 3,900; Unionists, 3,300; Unofficial Irish Labour, 2,400; Irish Labour, 1,400.  Independent Labour was elected with 34 per cent. of the vote.  Again, I could quote many other examples but I do not wish to take too much time on the matter except to quote the present distribution of Parties there, which is: Unionist, 38: Nationalists, seven; National North of Ireland Labour, four; Representative Labour, one; Independent Labour, one; and Independent Nationalist, one. Surely no one holds that that reflects the views of the people in Northern Ireland or that it represents a suitable Government for the people of Northern Ireland?</P>

    <P>When I was a student in America after the war, I was confronted with the problem of Partition.  I was asked about it.  I wrote home for information and pamphlets and everything else. With great gusto I described the gerrymandering and gave figures such as I am giving now.  What am I to say in <Col N="621" /> future?  What can any of us say? We have to withdraw all our charges.</P>
    <P>Again, let us take the fact that at the last election there were only 21 contests and 27 seats were not contested.  That is a travesty of democracy.  Is that what we want here&mdash;a development where three-quarters of the country are held by safe seats?</P>

      <P>Eighteen seats were contested.  The total poll by the Unionist Party there was 102,000 votes out of a total of 235,000 votes.  They got 45 per cent. of the vote where the contest took place and with that they walked off with 75 per cent. of the seats.  You might as well have a lottery and draw a Government as to have it done by a system such as that. These are grave charges and we have got to investigate them.  Are we satisfied that there is not something wrong in it?</P>
      <P>Believe it or not but 13 Parties contested the last election there&mdash;all splintered in various directions with Labour represented by at least four groups.  The Nationalists were split in all sections because the majority system there has that splintering effect and because everybody who goes up for election with you is against you.  Consequently, there is no co-ordination or coming together or saying: &ldquo;Vote No. 1 for Labour and vote No. 2 for the Nationalists&rdquo;.  We have no cementing influence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been said that the introduction of the straight vote did not cause much of a change in the North and that the representation in the 1929 election was not very widely different from the one that went before.  That may be conceded but does anybody concede that if they had P.R. in the North since 1929 those various groups would not have been acting together and getting their representation and eventually have formed a Government? They would have split the existing Government.  I think that is an absolute certainty but the longer you have the straight vote there at every election you have more and more <Col N="622" /> splintering with more and more uncontested seats.</P>
    <P>I come now to the American system which has been held up in such great detail to us.  Fortunately, I had three years' experience of that system and I tried to learn a share about it.  If the Government proposal were to introduce the American system here I would be wholeheartedly in favour of the straight vote, but there is no comparison between the American system and our system here because, first of all, the House of Representatives is elected every two years, so that even if you have a swing that swing cannot do any untold damage before the next election.  Besides, you have safe regions in America, regions whose history goes back to the American Civil War.  Their number to-day is declining but all the South is held traditionally safe for the democrats.</P>
    <P>As well as that, the real power in America lies in the American Senate which is elected for six years, one third of the members retiring every two years.  They are elected by the straight vote, but you can see quite obviously that in such a system you cannot get any violent swings.  The swing you get is a composite of three swings in 1952, 1954 and 1956.  Over and above all, you have the President who is elected independently by the people and he, as we have seen, can very often hold an opposite viewpoint to both the majorities in his House.</P>
    <P>There you have your pattern of corrective and stable democracy.  Again, the President draws his Cabinet not from the two existing Houses but from the country at large.  In fact, Mr. Benson&mdash;he is Secretary for Agriculture&mdash;was an outstanding county agricultural officer.  That is the type of men you get there.  Above all, they have a highly developed committee system which is, of course, the greatest lack we have in this country.</P>
    <P>I, for one, have been totally disillusioned by the little we contribute to-day in this Seanad.  In fact, what we can do here is merely talk.  The committees should function in any democratic country.  I have not seen our Committee for Education, our <Col N="623" /> Committee for Agriculture or our Committee for Industry.  Surely those of us who are elected here are able and willing to play our part on these committees.  It must be for the betterment of the nation that we have such committees and that we should play our part on them.</P>
    <P>So much then for the American system.  There is absolutely no comparison.  The straight vote system there is purely incidental, but the whole process of progressive democracy can be seen in every corrective step of the way.  Also, all their committees are very highly representative. They are representative both of the majority Party and the minority Party.  I, for one, was appalled yesterday to hear some of the accusations made by Senator L'Estrange.  I hope they are not true.  I am waiting for the Senator from Clare to refute what he said about the Clare County Council.</P>

      <P>A commission should settle those questions.  A thing cannot be true and untrue at the same time; and that is what we are being told here.  Now we come to the classic example of the straight vote.  That is South Africa.  As shown in the May, 1958, returns in South Africa, the Nationalist Party got 103 seats; the United Party, 53; Labour, nothing; Independents, nothing; Native Representatives, three, and Cape Colony <Col N="624" /> representatives, four.  In a contest for 132 seats, the Nationalists got 647,000 votes and the United Party 520,000. In other words, there was only a matter of 140,000 votes between them. Actually, it is more significant because 31 of the seats were not contested. Again, it is another feature of majority government that, in the North of Ireland and in South Africa, the Government will not expose their hands; where they know they will be defeated, they will give a walk over to the Opposition.</P>
      <P>They did that in South Africa in 31 of the seats, so that actually the contested seats there were 132 and of those the Nationalist got 103, the Opposition got 22 and others seven. It took 6,000 votes to elect a representative for the Government and it took 26,000 votes to elect one for the Opposition.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>Again, I am making the point simply and solely as an experiment related to something that is happening and to something which we want to see analysed coolly, factually and scientifically, before the people are asked to make their choice. It seems to me that the people should be told there are grounds why that cannot happen here, that what happens in the North cannot happen here, that what happens in England cannot happen here because this does not give the majority that the proposers of this Bill say is needed.  I make the point <Col N="625" /> that we have a lot to remember; we have a lot to investigate.</P>
      <P>To make things more ridiculous in South Africa, in the 31 seats that were not contested, they were not contested because the Opposition Party had an 80 per cent. or 90 per cent. majority in each of those cases.  Two of the leading papers in South Africa have dealt with that.  The <i>Cape Times</i> estimates that if all the seats were contested the Government Party would have got 654,000 votes and the Opposition 687,000 votes.  In other words, the Opposition would have won on a majority poll.  Another paper, the <i>Der Burgher</i> does not say that.  It says that the Government would have got 703,000 votes and the Opposition 671,000 votes&mdash;in other words, a very narrow Government majority, but they get 103 seats in Parliament as against 53 for the Opposition.</P>
      <P>We come now to France.  Again, this is a very large country with various deep-seated differences&mdash; radicialism, anti-clericalism and everything else&mdash;and with all those differences we cannot compare ourselves to France.  I should like to see what advice we could get from some Frenchmen whom we could look up to.  For instance, if we had a commission I would love to see ex-Premier Schumann on it.  You might say he has been the outstanding parliamentary figure in Europe during that period.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure he could give us much advice and I, for one, would place tremendous weight on everything he would have to say. We have other friends in all countries, men we look up to.  If we want to know something about the English system, why not have Lord Pakenham's advice, which could be supplied to a commission?  Surely, he is ever so partial to Ireland and to everything Irish and he would be as keen as we are to see that our country is preserved and that everything we value in Ireland, its traditions and its customs, is preserved.  We could rely on his viewpoint.  He has, beyond all <Col N="626" /> others, first-hand experience of the working of the two-Party system in England.  He knows precisely what weight the Party bosses carry in England. He knows whether the accusations made by the economists are factual or not, though it does seem remarkably strange that the candidates for the next election have been picked long ago and, of course, it is accepted that the safe seats are simply to carry the candidates imposed by the Party bosses.  Surely we do not wish that situation to arise here?</P>
      <P>We come now to the various things we have heard about the injustice of P.R.  I might quote Senator Colley who said that the more freakish the candidate, the more votes he gets.  I might also take the various speeches made by the Minister for External Affairs on irresponsible candidates and those who vote for them.  Perhaps I could also take the mathematical gymnastics carried out by the Minister for Defence.  We could go through all of those but they just simply go to prove that we have not got the facts.  Anybody who understands the system&mdash;I say this without fear of contradiction as a scientist&mdash;could not possibly make those charges against it.  It reminds me of the Irish proverb: &ldquo;Cionn sé an chuileog i súile a dhearbrathar ach ni fheiceann sé í ina shúile féin.&rdquo;  We are conscious of the defects in others and we cannot see the glaring defects in ourselves.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am claiming there is a point of view put forward after a cold, scientific analysis of the facts.  All I am asking is that we have an authoritative White Paper drawn up by an impartial commission to give us the facts in this, to tell us where we are going.  If we had that commission I for one would be only too happy to accept its recommendations, just as I am only too happy to support in every way possible the White Paper presented by the Government when I have <Col N="627" /> seen the facts behind it, and when I am confident in the facts as given in that excellent publication on economic development by Mr. Whitaker.  That, after all, is the only way we can make progress.  At least, I do not know of any other.</P>
      <P>As I say, you can find injustices in P.R.  Let us take a three seat constituency or a five seat constituency.</P>

      <P>Where the quota is 16 per cent. you may have a candidate just missing the last seat, and 15 per cent. of the voters then find that their votes go for nothing.  I admit that is bad and it is something which complete P.R. strives to avoid, but it is necessary to give an edge to the majority Party.  It accounts for giving you your parliamentary majority but what is that compared to the glaring examples of what happens under the straight vote, when 49 per cent. of the people in a constituency can be deprived of having any candidate? You have got to judge these injustices in comparison with the injustices in the system which you are now introducing. What we want to know from the point of view of choosing is: will the injustices be greater under the system we are going to introduce than under the present system?  Obviously, they will be greater under the system that is proposed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The whole question of the transfer of votes and everything else shows again a complete lack of understanding of what are really the basic facts.  As I pointed out, in a Party convention you eliminate the last man and you vote again between the remaining four, if there are five candidates.  You do that four times before you get a result but, obviously, you cannot do that for the country as a whole, or for a constituency as a whole.  Say there are six candidates for three seats then you would hold one election to-day and, after the count, eliminate the last man.  Then you would hold a second election and carry on in that way until you had eliminated five candidates, but <Col N="628" /> that is precisely what, in this enlightened and intelligent age, P.R. does.</P>
    <P>You ask the voter if his first choice is eliminated what is to be done with his vote.  You ask him also: &ldquo;If your second choice is also eliminated, what do we do with your vote?&rdquo;  The plain fact is that the election is simply a rearrangement by which a quota of voters gets one representative.  That is the simple fact behind it and every vote is actualised only once.  After all, there is no great pleasure in playing as a child, voting for candidates, if you get no further satisfaction.  What you want when you vote is that someone will be elected whom you can regard as being the one nearest to your choice.  That is the simple fact and the various transfers of votes, and so on, are just mathematical expedients.</P>
    <P>Any good engineer, when designing a house, has to know when a further calculation is insignificant or not.  He cannot spend years and years doing all forms of advanced calculations on his house.  He has got to start building and he has got to know what approximations, what short cuts, he can take and in an election some of the processes especially in the transfer of distributions, the transfer of surpluses, are short cuts&mdash;short cuts that may make no difference whatsoever.</P>
    <P>I would suggest to those putting this measure to us that they should at least let us have the facts and place them before the community.  Let us face the fact that the case you are making for this is simply that it will ensure a greater majority, but do not ever try to suggest that you are removing injustices created by P.R. by imposing greater injustices.  That is only insulting the intelligence of the electorate.</P>
    <P>One hears about harebrained candidates, and all the rest, who are eliminated. If one takes the election results in previous times one finds that most of them were the third and fourth choices, that they were members of a Party but happened to fall at the end of the Party's preferences.  One does not call those freakish.</P>
    <P>One other very serious aspect of this is the fact that, unfortunately, in the past, Party politics have been brought <Col N="629" /> into our local elections, into our county councils.  That has been a very retrograde step, one which there seems to be some move at present to get over. At least, we find corporations and county councils acting more as a team for the welfare of the county or the city and we see the rise of ratepayers' representatives and various other groups.  That is all to the good because many of us agree that the introduction of Party politics has been very much to the detriment of local government.</P>
    <P>What will happen if this measure gets through?  A large majority will be returned to the Dáil and that majority, by the simple expedient of passing a Bill, can alter the whole basis of local elections, get back to what was foreshadowed in some of the speeches in the last day or two&mdash;the single-seat type of county council representative&mdash;and we will be back then to counties being divided into wards with a ward boss in charge and, certainly, any of us does not want that.  If the present measure gets under way there is a grave temptation that the Party in power will feel the urge to bring about that position.  At least, I should like a very candid declaration from the Taoiseach and his Government that they have no such intention, which might help to allay some of the uneasiness that we feel about this.</P>
    <P>We come to the question of whether there should be three seats or one, in other words, reduce the size of our constituencies, but should we get down to the single-seat constituency?  There is a certain case to be made for it in the idea of the representative being in his area and having a smaller area to work, and so on but, if we analyse that, it carries its own dangers because in that case it will be the man who is really the best messenger-boy who will get elected.  If we value representative government, we do not want too many in that category.  There are too many other things to be done besides doing too much needless work of that kind. In fact, in future there will have to be some type of trade union to save the representatives from all the unnecessary work, whether it is filling in income-tax forms or anything else, that <Col N="630" /> is thrust on them.  For that reason, I feel that to have single-member constituencies would be retrograde.</P>
    <P>Also, of course, there is the fact that those who are closely identified with one political Party or another do not feel happy or at ease going to the member of the other Party who has been elected and asking him to do something for the region.  Will Senators take their own case?  As Fianna Fáil supporters, how would they like to have to go to the Fine Gael T.D. for everything for their region, except that it would be a means of piling up credit for the next election?</P>

      <P>If you do a favour for a man he is expected to remember it at the next election.  Now take the case of young representatives. We are all adamant that the future of the country lies with the young men, Sinn Féin, 1918-21, was a young men's organisation.  In fact, it must have been glorious and wonderful to be alive at that time to see all the young men in the country marching together and able to do things.  Think of the generations that have come since then and how they have been held down and what men of mine or a younger generation can do. Even I am getting old at this stage.</P>
      <P>In a three-seat constituency, take the approach in selecting candidates to represent the Party.  First of all, there is No. 1.  He must be selected; he is old and wise.  No. 2 is wise and less old and he must be selected.  There is a twinge of conscience and it is felt that they must put up a young man, so that there is at least one young man amongst the three candidates and then it is up to the electorate.  They have a choice; they can vote for him if they wish and he can be elected if he gets sufficient votes.  In that way the door is open to youth in the multi-member constituency but that door will be closed for many years if we revert to the single-seat constituency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again there is the question of ex-Ministers or Ministers of the outgoing Government.  I have made the point already that they are the first people <Col N="631" /> who will be displaced in this new system.  Do you, who are devoting your lives to political work, want to have a see-saw?  Do you want to be out and in, out and in?  You may get stability of government in that way.  You will not get stability of representation, which is of far more vital concern to the country as a whole.</P>
    <P>Also, of course, the single-seat constituency encourages the return of the inexperienced T.D. when a new Government takes over.  In a three-seat constituency any ex-Minister, a Minister of the outgoing Government, is almost certain of being returned but in a single-seat constituency, once the swing goes over against him, it is not sufficient to get 49 per cent. of the vote.  In a three-seat constituency, as long as he can hold his third of the vote he can be sure of being returned.</P>
    <P>The non-transferable vote puts a premium on nuisance factions because a constituency now is much smaller and it costs much less to conduct an election campaign in it.  Therefore, any Independent is at liberty to contest the election.</P>

      <P>He will not get elected but he will have a nuisance value.  We can take the four splinter groups formed from Labour in the North, all competing for the one seat. If his leanings are towards Labour, he will take off sufficient votes to make it impossible for the official Labour man to be elected.  The next time the Labour Party or any other Party have to think twice.  They must consider that this man got 1,000 votes and that if they could put a Party label on him that 1,000 votes give material for electing a candidate.  I am afraid that type of election campaign blackmail is a thing that could happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally, let us take the question of coalition government.  As I have shown, the Governments in Europe could not be anything else but coalitions for the good of their countries.  The way the divisions run <Col N="632" /> there they should thank God they have coalitions and that no one Party is left to hold unbridled sway.  We should recognise here that the term coalition is an honourable term for work that we do.  In every walk of life we compromise, we meet together, we work together, and the suggestion that I made earlier might be considered, namely, to polarise our electors between the single Party and the coalition.  Let one be the alternative of the other.  If we keep our national life on that level we will retain a sound middle of the road policy that will give stability.  What stability? The stability of policy, relative continuity from one Government to another.  Surely that is more important than what is held up as stability, the power of a Government simply to ride roughshod through opposition.</P>
    <P>Finally, I should like to end on a note of appeal to the Taoiseach as a scientist&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;to let us have this independent commission and not to let the Constitution become a football of Party politics&mdash;especially a football of Party politics when provision has already been made to ensure that the Constitution can be changed by a simple majority.  In fact, if anything should be changed in the Constitution right now I think it is that provision.  You can look through various Constitutions but I doubt if any of them can be changed that simply&mdash;certainly not the Constitution of the United States or of any of the others I have examined.  I am sure there would be a great measure of co-operation and unanimity all round in removing the defect&mdash;the 50 per cent. clause&mdash;from our Constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no doubt that we will get a watering-down of the present system as a recommendation from such a commission&mdash;probably a reversion to all three-seat constituencies.  If it comes from the commission, I do not see that any Party could go to the country and oppose it, especially if that commission is made up of men we respect.  I was challenged only last <Col N="633" /> evening to say what commission could possibly be better than the Government of the day.  We must discount that because we have two sets of people experienced in Government. We have two sets of people who have served in Government&mdash;the present Government and the previous Government. They both recommend two different things to us.  Therefore, we cannot possibly give to any one of these two groups the right of having their viewpoint accepted as if infallible. That is what we are asked to do.</P>
    <P>Let us have this commission.  I have been challenged to say what men should be put on it.  I am only making suggestions as to various people who would seem to commend themselves for their absolute integrity and knowledge and sympathetic understanding of our country.  Take Lord Pakenham of England with his wonderful insight into, and experience of, British politics and, above all, his sincere sympathy with and wish for this country.  Take Monsieur Schumann of France who has been the architect of most of the democratic revival in Western Europe.  De Gaspari of Italy, Adenauer of Germany and Schumann stand as the three greatest statesmen that have emerged in Western Europe since the war.</P>
    <P>Schumann should be able to see any obvious defects in our existing system and make recommendations for its amendment.  The real work of Government is to get the voluntary and outside organisations to play their part. The function of Government is rather to help the people to help themselves rather than to baby the people along. From that point of view, we should not have such a commission completely overloaded with active politicians. I should like to see some outstanding representative connected with extra-Government organisations.  I can think at present of no better person than Dr. Hoflstee of Holland who was here last summer as a guest of Muintir na Tíre and who lectured at their annual rural week in Roscrea. He is now chairman of the European Sociology Union where the concern is not merely with the government of man but with the whole life of man. <Col N="634" /> No doubt he would be a tremendous asset to us.</P>
    <P>I think I have sketched and shown that we need not be insular in this matter or so smug as to think that we ourselves are the only ones with the answers.  Let us learn from the others. I appeal to the Government to let us have such an impartial commission. We cannot ask the people of Ireland to vote without information.  If the Government do not concede this simple and democratic request then we shall have to table a motion here in the Seanad to ask the Seanad to do the job.</P>
    <P>I think it is a job the Seanad could very well do but, if they do not, some other group will have to do it.  The information will have to be obtained by hook or by crook, if the voters are to judge the issue democratically.</P>
    <P>I have been out two nights a week to rural organisations since Christmas. At every one of the meetings I have been asked: &ldquo;What is it all about?&rdquo; They have not the faintest idea.  It is degenerating at present into a series of clichés.  Surely that is not the way to treat our sacred Constitution? Therefore, I heartily and anxiously appeal to the Taoiseach to take steps to have the commission set up.  We do not need the results of this for another two or three years.  There is accordingly plenty of time to do the work leisurely and calmly.</P>
    <P>In the name of goodness, let us get straightaway back to discussing economic development on which there will be unanimity between us all, since the whole subject has been shorn of Party politics as a result of the excellent document produced by Mr. Whitaker. In this case, we are acting on what the doctor has ordered.  I know we can make contributions here.  We can suggest even more rapid progress than was indicated in that document. Far more can be done than is outlined in &ldquo;Economic Development&rdquo;. However, it is a foundation and a tremendous step forward by the Government to produce that document.  We all highly appreciate the work of the Government in letting that document come before us.  It shows quite clearly that the White <Col N="635" /> Paper is an effort to develop our economy exactly as the doctor has ordered.  It has not and should not in any way be tied to any political Party, be it Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael, Labour or inter-Party.  We are at last moving, we hope, steadily ahead on the firm foundation of fact.  Again, we can take our experience with the Capital Investment Advisory Committee and the excellent work they have done.  We are largely accepting their recommendations.</P>
    <P>The Agricultural Institute Commission did the same.  In that case, I was associated with rural organisations which were not satisfied that the proper steps had been taken to find the best scheme.  I was associated with universities who felt they had been ridden roughshod over by two Governments&mdash;both by the present Opposition when they were in office and by the present Government.  Facts were not produced and all the universities and the farmers wanted was facts.  I had the high privilege of being associated with the efforts of Macra na Feirme and the National Farmers' Association in carrying out an independent investigation&mdash;the greatest work those organisations ever did.  It had a profound influence on the Agricultural Institute.  As it emerged, it is an excellent institute and one on which the present Government has to be heartily congratulated in their handling and on their appointments both of director and chairman.  However, it was the work of the independent organisations that produced the factual basis that could not be ignored.</P>
    <P>There is nothing in the Bill before the House about the commission which is contrary to what has happened in the case of the institute.  We are proceeding steadily ahead.  We pledged ourselves at that time that we were doing a scientific job.  We also had the unpleasant job for scientists at that period of holding the Government of the day at bay and carrying on with the investigation.  However, we carried it out.  Something like that is necessary in this case.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Government to take <Col N="636" /> the necessary steps to let us have the facts.  I feel I could speak for the independent Senators of both universities in saying that we will heartily cooperate with and welcome any effort to make possible such an approach.</P>

I have no desire to cavil at that or to delay his intervention but, heretofore, ministerial rights have been exercised in accordance with the precedents established and prevailing here in my experience for over 20 years under different Governments. The House has had good relations with Ministers and we all want that situation to continue. What is proposed now is an innovation.  If it were extended merely in accordance with a constitutional right, we might have the position in which 12 Ministers could attend and speak, as distinct from the Minister who opens the debate and concludes.  I presume that is not the intention, but it is possible, and I feel attention should be drawn to it.  At the same time in the case of the Minister who has attended very faithfully since the start of this debate, I have no objection to his being heard, apart altogether from his constitutional right.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>This debate has not differed very greatly from the debate which we had in the Dáil for a couple of months.  We have had a commission of 147 men sitting on the proposed change for almost three months in the Dáil and I do not know how long it is going to take here.  I think that is the best type of commission. The scientists, the atomic scientists and technical people are very good in their own trade, but when it comes to a question of what type of electoral system is likely to give the best system of government, I think the people to ask are the men who have been practising that particular art for a great number of years.  Not only can we consult the men in this country who have been responsible for government for many years, but we have the opinion of people in other countries, statesmen who have seen the effects of various electoral systems.  If the Senators are prepared to go through the Dáil debates, they will see quoted, by many speakers, what a number of German statesmen said about P.R., what a number of Italian statesmen said about it, men who had the experience of seeing the dictatorial groups creeping in, expanding their influence in Parliament and finally taking it over.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I heard&mdash;I do not know how true it is&mdash;that in the Duma at the time of the Kerensky Government, they were busily engaged in instituting P.R. when Lenin took the matter somewhat out of their hands.  The whole basis, the whole object of any electoral system in a democratic country should be to get <Col N="638" /> an effective system of government, in the first instance; secondly, a Government that can be held responsible by the people for their action or inaction during their term of office.  In my belief, and in the belief of practically every one of the Fine Gael people who were in power during the period from 1922 to 1932, the system of P.R. tends to lead to a multiplicity of small Parties, making coalitions inevitable and making instability and all that goes with it also inevitable.</P>
    <P>The quotations from these Cumann na nGaedheal people are to be found in the Dáil debates.  I need not go through them all.  I would not go so far as some of the leaders of Fine Gael go in denouncing P.R., as being the creature of the brains of all the cranks of the world, as Deputy Dillon said, but it was an effort by the people who were really hoping to get the fairest system of election, fair representation, so that there would be fair and reasonable Government for all sections of the community.  The whole question is what is the best way to get effective Government and fair and just Government for all sections of the community?</P>
    <P>In our belief, the best way is the straight vote system.  I have listened to a number of Senators speaking and there is no one here, and there was no one in the Dáil, who would propose that we should carry the system of representation, the principle of having representation, to the extent that would turn the country into a single constituency and where anyone who could get one vote in 147 could come into the Dáil.  No one has done that so there is a limit to the representation. It is all very well for Senator Quinlan to nod his head, but there have been others who have been talking as if what they wanted was that every identifiable minority in the country should have the possibility of having its own candidate returned to the Dáil.  If you go through the list of members of the Dáil at the present time&mdash;there is a book on the subject by Mr. McCracken&mdash;you see that the Deputies represent about 50 occupations and trades.  If you are to take the number of groups that gave evidence to the vocational commission, <Col N="639" /> there were 200 or 300, and we could get a system of election which would make it possible for any one of those 200 or 300 groups if they had three-quarter per cent. of the voters in their favour to return a candidate.</P>

      <P>That is one system that has obtained in other countries.  We heard Senator Quinlan describing it and he said that country was &ldquo;streets ahead&rdquo; of us in economic development, but I do not think Senator Quinlan will try to argue that this is because it has that system.  But it has that system as he described it, and nobody else wants it even though, associated with P.R. in that system, there is the great economic development described by Senator Quinlan.</P>
      <P>We must discuss these matters in relation to our own needs.  Somebody asked one of the seven wise men of Greece&mdash;I forget which of them it was: &ldquo;What is the best constitution?&rdquo;  The reply was: &ldquo;For whom?  At what time?&rdquo;  The question for us is: What is the best electoral system for Ireland in the last half of the 20th century. One of the characteristics of our people for a long time is that we are individualists; we like to hold to our own point of view through thick and thin and against the world.</P>
      <P>It is a very valuable characteristic and one we should hate to see being hampered in any way, but it is a characteristic that has disadvantages when you want unity for a common purpose.  We can get such unity.  We have got it under outside pressure from time to time.  We had it during the Black and Tan war because we had to have unity &ldquo;or else&rdquo;.  The Power that occupied this country, as in the case of Powers occupying other countries, fostered divisions among the occupied people so as to make them easier to control.</P>
      <P>As far back as Elizabeth's day, her representative, Sir George Carew, reported to her:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It was thought no ill policy to make the Irish draw blood one upon the other whereby their private quarrels might advance the public service.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That was nothing peculiar at that day and age, and it was the approach of all occupying Powers.  It was the method by which they weakened opposition.  They promoted civil strife, quarrels, divisions and disunity, <Col N="641" /> and if we want to make pro-progress in our time, we must have an electoral system that reverses that trend completely.</P>
    <P>No one will deny any minority, even a minority of one, its right to promote its point of view, but a minority of one can promote its point of view in a manner that will not obstruct national progress.  We have the Press, the radio, the public meeting, the small broadsheet, the pamphlet, the leaflet, the small book&mdash;all these methods by which the individual, the minority of one, can promote his ideas, if he has good ideas to promote. But at some time or other we must cease merely listening to ideas if we want to make progress; we must take decisions and the question is: how are we to get decisions taken that will result in the best possible progress for the 3,000,000 people for whom we are responsible?</P>
    <P>We believe that the straight vote system is better than P.R. for that purpose.  Let us first of all get rid of an idea that may be brought forward or promulgated when nobody is listening down the country as to what Fine Gael is standing for.  If we have this single constituency for the whole of the State and if we have a majority of 7 per cent. we can get ten seats.  All sorts of small Parties could get 7 per cent.; indeed even the embryonic anti-Tory Party, if it tried hard enough, might get 7 per cent. and if they got 7 per cent., they would obtain ten seats in the Dáil.</P>
    <P>If we had the Dáil divided into 20 Parties or 80 Parties, as they had in Germany before the advent of Hitler, how would we do the work of the country?  After the election we would have to compose our differences.  We would have to make the compromises that everybody agrees are necessary if people are to live in the one world. Our opinion is that, in order that we should have effective action and decisions taken in the Dáil, as many of these compromises as possible should be made between the Parties before the election and the nature of the compromises announced so that the people can vote on them. <Col N="642" /> We object strongly to coalitions&mdash; and I think we have given proof of our sincerity&mdash;because we believe they are disastrous.  We believe that if the coalition system came in here, with our divisive background, with our strong tendency to individualism as a nation, it would produce as many Parties as it ever produced in any other country with each of these small Parties defending its little point of view as violently as any small Party in any other country.</P>
    <P>It may be that coalition is inevitable. Under any system of election there is no guarantee that there always will be one Party with a majority and a couple of smaller Parties.  But is it not better, if democracy is to work, that the compromises, the deals, as Deputy Norton put it, should be made before the election and that the people should know what the Parties intend to do? Is it anything but the height of hypocrisy that half a dozen Parties that have agreed before the election that they will coalesce if the result gives them a combined majority should each go forward to the people for their votes, denounce the other five violently, saying they will never coalesce with them and then immediately after the election get together and form a coalition?</P>
    <P>It would have been much easier for Fianna Fáil, on the occasions on which we walked across the floor, to form a coalition than it was for Fine Gael.  The reason that Fianna Fáil has gone up in strength while Fine Gael has gone down is that we were prepared to take the knock and say: &ldquo;If we are going to carry the responsibility of Government, you must give us the power to carry out our duties. We are not going to take responsibility without having power of decision.&rdquo; Fine Gael was prepared to form a coalition.  It had not the power of decision and it had to take responsibility for queer things.</P>
    <P>I need only refer to Deputy Costello's election address in his constituency in 1948 when he spoke about the External Relations Act, and we know what happened afterwards.  He also had to forgo his constitutional <Col N="643" /> right, indeed his constitutional duty, to appoint Ministers.  He had to take whatever Ministers were given to him. These Ministers did not measure up to the beautiful conception of the intellectual discussion at the Cabinet Table.  Each of the members of the Cabinet had to take instructions from the small Party behind him.</P>
    <P>Senator Murphy spoke at length and denounced the straight vote system but he did not answer a question that I notice was put to him by Senator Sheehy Skeffington and, I think, by Senator Fearon.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>This question occurred to me when I read a report of the Labour Party conference on 20th June, 1957, in which they solemnly decided:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Labour Party will not again take part in an inter-Party Government but will remain in opposition until it achieves a parliamentary majority.  This is to be the basis of a statement...&rdquo;</P>
      <P>But it was not the basis of the statement Deputy Norton made because he made no statement.  I could not get from Deputy Norton an answer as to whether after the next general election, if Fianna Fáil failed to secure a majority and Labour and Fine Gael were in a position to elect a Taoiseach, they would, in fact, coalesce.</P>
      <P>It boils down to this: should the people not know?  Should they not have a right to decide whether they want to vote for a coalition or not? Why should the Labour Party come out and denounce Fine Gael and all its works and pomps, saying it was outdated, outworn and a Tory Party, and then, having got those votes, sell out to the Tory Party?  What I like about the straight vote is that it will force the Labour Party and Fine Gael to give straight answers to straight questions.  While they can bamboozle me and fool me, they cannot fool the straight voter who gets his ballot paper, reads all the election addresses and says: &ldquo;Which of these do I want?&rdquo;  He will have to get the answer under the straight vote.  He need not under the other system because he can fool around with his pencil all over the paper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one further advantage in <Col N="646" /> it.  If the people do not want Party &ldquo;A&rdquo; and it is the larger party, Parties &ldquo;B&rdquo; and &ldquo;C&rdquo; will have to announce their decision about a coalition before an election and give the people an effective opportunity of selecting a new policy.  After the burst up of the last Coalition we had Deputy Larkin letting the cat out of the bag about what went on.  We know he said that: &ldquo;Fine Gael utilised every opportunity that came, not only in the open light of day but in the dark of night.  Next time we may know better.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>It is 20th April, 1952. It did not prevent the Labour Party joining again in 1954.  I would say the people will make them join ahead of time if the straight vote comes along.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To get back to what is the best electoral system for us in this day and age, let me say this.  We cannot go back to the old Greek system and consult every voter on every issue.  We cannot have a referendum or a plebiscite or a mass meeting in the Park to decide each question.  We have to select representatives of some kind and trust them.  We propose that the people in the country should so organise themselves that they will produce a few Parties, so that they will be able to elect one Party or a traditional group of two associated Parties. I am not a prophet and I cannot tell you exactly how it will work out.  But in the countries in which it operates it has worked this way.  You have two groups, one in Government and the other the alternative group.  Either of the groups may be a traditional Coalition, one that has been at work for years.  They are two associated groups.  They have no great differences of opinion.  They are quite different from the Coalition formed here in 1948 in which the extreme Empire Party, at one side, and the extreme Republican Party, at the other side, came together.  No one could tell ahead of time what would happen as a result of the union.  In these other <Col N="647" /> countries you have two fairly well allied groups of Parties with policies very closely associated indeed.  They merely divide themselves into two Parties for the sake of having a more attractive label going to certain parts of the country.  Take the Country Party and the Liberal Party in Australia, for example.  We believe this system of election has had the effect in other countries, and will have the effect here, of having these two groups, maybe composed of a single Party or of two Parties which are traditionally associated.  You have the Government on one side and the alternative Government on the other.</P>
    <P>For those who want complete representation of all groups, direct representation, each with his label in his coat, for all the groups in the country, I want to point out that the function of a Parliament is not to be a debating society.  Something more must happen at the end of a debate than that the chairman gets up and gives an interesting résumé of the very interesting contributions made and disagreements registered.  Decisions have to be made and put into effect.  The more clear cut the alternative before the House when coming to a decision, the quicker it can take its decision, and the more effective and penetrating can be the debate.  But when there are 101 people arguing each for something completely different from the other 100, then it is hard to get a conclusion and the nearer you come to the two, the proposition and the amendment, the better it is for effective work.  Now, we want effective work.  We want to be able to take effective decisions.  I would say to Senator Quinlan that one of the reasons why we have not made more progress is that we have never really had a Government that knew far enough ahead that it would remain in power sufficiently long to be able to take really effective decisions.</P>

      <P>Just a moment now.  I am not giving that as an excuse.  This country has done marvellous work in <Col N="648" /> its time.  When we took over from the British, we were the worst housed white race in the world.  We are now one of the best.  We have done many other things.  When we were in a position to organise ourselves&mdash;a great deal was done, admittedly, with State capital because private enterprise would not do the job&mdash;our people went to the top in efficiency and in certain cases they can hold their own with anybody to-day.  There was one small sugar beet factory in 1932; there was a very small acreage of beet grown in 1932.  The factory was run by a foreign combine and was on its last legs.  We took over.  We built four more factories and, of these four, three of them are now in the first five for sugar conversion.  We developed our bogs.</P>

      <P>That would be a nice kettle of fish.  Have no opposition! Muzzle everybody!  And the Government will have their own way.  Fine Gael are all for unity except when it comes to declaring that unity before an election.  They do not like to say then that they will unite with Labour; but after the election they are all for unity.  We want them to come right out and be straight with the people and tell them, before the election, with whom they will unite.</P>
      <P>With regard to minority representation, minorities have developed into huge majorities in countries under the straight vote system where the minorities believed in themselves, were prepared to make sacrifices and had the leadership to attact support.  The Labour Party in England in 1918 commanded a mere handful of votes. Within five years it was the Government. It increased from 60 representatives to 300 plus.  It was not afraid of the straight vote.  It still wants it. In the same period here, the Labour Party representation went down.  I remember when the Labour Party here had 23 seats.  Now they have 11.  P.R. has not served them very well.  Does the Labour Party merely want to go on meandering along with ten or 11 seats, content if they get two or three seats in the Cabinet from Fine Gael? Is that the height of their ambition? Have they a policy?  Do they believe in it?  The Labour Party in England had a policy.  They believed in it.  I do not subscribe to all their policy, but they had a policy and they put it through.</P>
      <P>Fine Gael went down, too.  I remember when they had 63 seats. Now they have 40 and, if they do not behave themselves, I am sure they will lose the nought, because they do not deserve to win.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;That is the idea; you must bargain beforehand, give individuals power to blackmail.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, the point is we want to give them power to blackmail beforehand, <Col N="651" /> and not after, not during the course of government, not when they are supposed to be doing the work they were elected to do and when we cannot discover whether or not the work is being done.  That is the difference. It is when the bargaining begins afterwards that the blackmail starts, and the people have then no power to curb it.  A Party says: &ldquo;Do this, or you will not have our support.&rdquo;&ldquo;Give us these Ministries or you will not get your majority.&rdquo;&ldquo;Do what we want you to do, or we go out and burst the Government.&rdquo;  And they did burst the Government twice.  We all know that.  We do not have to go to these other countries and analyse the position there, interesting and informative as Senator Quinlan's speech was.  But there was really nothing new in it.

      <P>In conclusion, I should like to say that there is no system of election which can make an immature or foolish people successful and the people have given the greatest proof of their political maturity in the past 20 years.  They rendered harmless the worst effects of P.R.; they made their slips for a couple of years, but finally they pulled themselves together and exacted a sound vengeance on the people who were trying to play the P.R. Game for the destruction of the country.  They gave those people a very salutary lesson and the reason we are in a position to put this proposition to the people and ask them to consider it, is that the people decided at the previous election that they would have no more coalitions if they could help it.</P>

      <P>As a matter of fact, I have the information here for him.  It was not because of Arthur Griffith's blue eyes that the British imposed P.R. or gave P.R. to Ireland.  Arthur Griffith, like a number of liberal-minded people back in 1910, was led away by the idea of P.R.  He had not the experience of Government and he <Col N="654" /> did not know what it was in fact that a successful Government required.  He supported P.R. back in 1910 and it was not until 1919 that the British gave it to us&mdash;if you want to call it giving.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>1919.  In February, 1919, they introduced it in the British Parliament and that was just two months after Sinn Féin had achieved a smashing victory under the straight vote system.  At that time, the British Attorney General, winding up the debate&mdash;Senators can get it by taking this reference; they can see the whole of the debate, but I shall only read a short extract&mdash;said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;In the general election, 75 per cent. of the representation has gone over to the Sinn Féin Party...&rdquo;</P>
      <P>He looked across at Carson, who was against his Bill and said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Are you going to throw the administration of the local authorities, elected on the present franchise, bodies which have been absolutely captured by people who call the rest of the United Kingdom the &lsquo;enemy&rsquo;...&rdquo;</P>
      <P>He thought that would settle Carson and that was the only reason they imposed it.  There has been foolish talk about Sligo having asked for P.R. The people of the town of Sligo would not be allowed to get a loan to do some work they wanted to do unless they passed a resolution approving the Bill for this loan into which P.R. was shoved.  They would not get one without the other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fact that the British imposed P.R. upon us does not say it might not be the best system in the world, but they did it for the purpose of dividing us.  They did not adopt it for themselves because they knew it would divide them.  In this day and age, and we must make up our minds about it, in order to be successful and in order that we should reach that standard or that rate of increase in our production which will enable us to do all the things, or some of the things we want to do in the line of education and so on and so forth, we <Col N="655" /> shall have to be reasonably efficient. At the moment, democratic countries are in competition with systems of government which, no matter what else you may say about them&mdash;they are disastrous in every way for the happiness of the people&mdash;can turn out goods.</P>
    <P>We unfortunately are in that position and we are proposing a system of election that will make our people more efficient, that will help them to get rid of a number of divisions within their Parties and that will give them two effective Parties or groups of Parties in the Dáil, one of which, when it is in Government, can carry through its policy, a policy that it has told to the people, and the other that can propose amendments to the Government's policy&mdash;policies which they will be expected by the people to put into operation if they are selected in their turn.</P>
    <P>In answer to the question as to what is the best constitution, I say that for the Irish people in the second half of the 20th century the straight vote system is the best electoral system.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>What I propose to say on this matter I propose to divide into two parts.  First of all, I want to answer, as best I may, the arguments made by the Minister just before the adjournment.  The Minister, I feel, was brought in because there was no member among the nominated members of the Seanad prepared to deal with this matter in the way the Taoiseach would like it dealt with. I think that the nature of the Minister's speech might suggest, as some people will say, that we might also bring down Lord Brookeborough to add to the team.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister's suggestion in the other House that France had been brought to her knees by P.R.&mdash;that matter was dealt with by Senator Hayes&mdash;was both false and inappropriate. I do not think it is appropriate for people in a small country like our own to make remarks of that kind about a country which, even if <Col N="656" /> it is not in the first four or five Powers in the world, is still a very much more powerful and prosperous country than ours.</P>
    <P>Anybody who cares to look up statistics&mdash;and I do not feel that they tell the whole story&mdash;will see that, before the war, our income per head of the population was rather better than the French income.  Despite this business of France being brought to her knees and so forth, French income per head of the population&mdash;the real income and that is the only thing that counts&mdash;is now about 30 per cent. to 40 per cent. better than ours.  It is a peculiar way of going on your knees when you are continuously becoming people are better off, have more food to eat and more facilities and services of all sorts.  I do not think it was a very appropriate remark to make.</P>
    <P>The Minister based one part of his case on the effect which P.R. had in bringing dictatorship into existence on the Continent.  When the Constitution of 1937 was being prepared, all that information was available.  It was much more readily available at the time and nearer to hand than it is now, 25 years later.  I do not think that anybody believes for a moment what the Minister for Defence said in Kerry, that it was because the Constitution might be defeated if P.R. were taken out of it.  I think that is an <i>argumentum ad hominem</i> long after the day.</P>
    <P>The Minister for External Affairs also said: &ldquo;The debate has not differed greatly from the debate which took place in the Dáil.&rdquo;  I do not agree at all.  Many of the speeches here were on an entirely different basis.  There was the speech made by Senator Professor George O'Brien; there was the speech to-day by Senator Professor Quinlan and there was the speech yesterday of Senator L'Estrange.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will come back to that.  If Senators would read <Col N="657" /> Senator L'Estrange's speech when printed, they might be surprised at the effectiveness of the material in it. Then there was the speech of Senator Professor Stanford, an analytical speech of a different kind.  These were all different from the speeches made in the Dáil.</P>
      <P>I was also a bit perturbed on another point.  This is a matter to which I have referred here before; it is not particular to this Minister and it is not in any way personal.  I was a bit perturbed when the Minister talked about scientists being &ldquo;good at their trade&rdquo;.  I have protested in this House about that idea, which seems to be deeply ingrained in the Fianna Fáil Party, that tradesmen are the same as technologists, that a technician is the same as a technologist.  They are not. The use of a word like &ldquo;trade&rdquo;&mdash;and that was the word the Minister used, &ldquo;they are good at their trade&rdquo;&mdash;is not right.  It is not a trade.  They do not ply a trade, they do not think like tradesmen and they are not engaged to think like tradesmen; they are engaged to try to do original thought on serious problems.  It has nothing whatever to do with trading or the practice of craftsmanship.</P>
      <P>He said that, in the belief of practically everyone in the Fine Gael Party from 1921 to 1932, &ldquo;P.R. leads to the growth of small Parties and to coalitions with all that goes with it&rdquo;.  Let us take the evidence.  We have it in the elections.  If anyone examines the history of this country since 1923, when the first election took place&mdash;we will come back to the figures later&mdash; he will find that there is approximately the same number of Parties now as there was then.  Is it possible that the Taoiseach feels that when his great presence leaves the scene of action things will be different?  Is it possible that he believes that his own Party may have a fission measure in operation subsequent to his leaving the scene?  Is it possible that there is something like that at the back of his thoughts?  I do not know.  The evidence is that there are as few Parties to-day in Dáil Eireann as there were in the very first election held in this country since this part of Ireland obtained a Government of its own from 1922 onwards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="658" /> The Minister said: &ldquo;We are concerned with the best way to get effective Government; that is where the difference comes in.&rdquo;  The problem was phrased well and posed well by Senator Stanford.  I think the purpose of elections is to get representation and that the purpose of Dáil Éireann is, when these people are elected, to elect a Taoiseach, who forms a Government. That is the system.  The purpose of elections is to get people into Dáil Éireann who will represent the population of the country.  As I said at the time, the Minister put up an Aunt Sally: &ldquo;Would you go and have one constituency in the country?&rdquo;  There was, of course, one election for the Seanad on one occasion, where the whole country was one constituency. That was never tried again.  There is this difference.  Under P.R., if there is a minority of 1 per cent. of the population in one county, they would get a seat&mdash;that is to say one out of 147. If they were in one county, under P.R. they would get the seat.  They would need to be in one small area to get a seat under the system which is proposed now.  There is a very big difference there.</P>
    <P>The Minister says: &ldquo;We have to discuss these matters in relation to our own needs.&rdquo;  I quite agree with him, of course.  He asks: &ldquo;What is the best electoral system for Ireland, in the second half of the 20th century?&rdquo; With other members here, I think that the best electoral system is to secure representation for different points of view in the community.  The Minister suggests: &ldquo;P.R. will promote civil strife and we do not want that here; we want an electoral system which reverses that trend.&rdquo;  This has become an open question in the course of the debate. When this matter was first mooted, I did not profess to know a great deal about it; but I was surprised when a rather conservative member of my own Party mentioned this possibility; and then, when I thought about it I realised that he was speaking the truth.</P>
    <P>There is a serious possibility that people who will not get representation in the House will adopt other methods of furthering their ends.  In that connection, <Col N="659" /> we all think of one particular Party; but one can think of other Parties.  Suppose the Labour Party were obliterated altogether, one could consider them adopting other means to present their views.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Lenihan should grow up.  If we had no problems to deal with in this country, one might say it was incitement, but the problems are there and there is no incitement in the fact that I advert to the possibility that certain results may follow.  The Minister said: &ldquo;We must take decisions, we must cease listening to ideas.&rdquo;  If one listens to ideas, one must at some stage, of course, decide what one is going to do. The Minister is the man who, on one occasion, asked about something rather serious, said: &ldquo;You cannot make omelettes without breaking eggs.&rdquo;  That seems to me to be the same idea; one must cease listening to ideas.  You cannot make omelettes without breaking eggs.  It all depends on whether the omelettes are good or bad, and it all depends on whether it might not be better to keep the eggs.</P>
      <P>The Minister put up another Aunt Sally: &ldquo;If we had a Dáil divided into 20 Parties, how would we do the work of the country?&rdquo;  This is an unreal question, which has no relation to the present position in the country.  We all know there are three big Parties and a couple of relatively small Parties who have maintained their position because they represent a certain point of view in their own areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said: &ldquo;We object to Coalitions because we believe they are disastrous.&rdquo;  As evidence of this, the Minister did not produce any item whatever.  Let us take another matter to which he referred in relation to that, that the Taoiseach in an inter-Party Government had to take responsibility for queer things; and the instance which was given was the declaration of the Republic.  I believe that the real reason why the Fianna Fáil Party boycotted <Col N="660" /> the declaration of the Republic when it happened, and subsequently pretended that it had been there all the time, was that if Deputy John A. Costello had not declared the Republic it would have been the ace of trumps for Deputy de Valera in the 1951 general election.  He would have played it, that he was going to declare it.  He would have phrased it very carefully, but it would have been his ace of trumps.  The fact is that it was taken out of politics, just the same as the gun was taken out of politics in this country.  These were two worthwhile political efforts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall come back to the 1951 break up.  That is the second part of my own speech.  I am answering the Minister now.  The Minister made an oblique reference&mdash; perhaps he did not mean it&mdash;when he talked about &ldquo;deals, as Deputy Norton put it.&rdquo;  I read the report of the debates in the Dáil and I do not think that Deputy Norton meant it in that way.  It was an oblique reference.  I do not know if Deputy Norton used the word &ldquo;deals&rdquo; and it seemed rather as if the Minister is suggesting that he had said in the Dáil that there were some kind of deals made.  The Minister's phrase was just a phrase and it may have had no particular significance.</P>
      <P>The Minister said that it would have been easier for Fianna Fáil to form a coalition but that they went across the House instead.  When the 1948 election occurred, I had no great interest in politics; I was working at my job. But I did see one thing.  I had been often in the Dáil, as an official, and the question intrigued me: would the Fianna Fáil Party be able to make a junction with the five National Labour Deputies?  I had my own opinion about that.  I had often seen Deputy James Hickey, Deputy Everett and Deputy O'Leary&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I said to myself that Deputy James Hickey would be nothing if he went in with Fianna Fáil, after the line he had taken with them over the years he was a member of the Dáil, and my point of view was vindicated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy James Hickey did not get a Ministry; that is the answer to that.  I had particularly thought of his line of approach to economic matters.  During the period the inter-Party Government were in office, the cost of living rose 14 points in Britain, but it did not rise at all here until the outbreak of the Korean War.  Deputy Hickey's point of view, therefore, was also vindicated because it had been forecast, before the inter-Party Government took office, that we were facing four of the most difficult years we would ever have to face.</P>

      <P>The Fianna Fáil Party knew just enough economics to be able to back the certainty that the Korean War would raise the cost of living.  The Minister to-day asked what would Parties do in certain circumstances in the future.  Suppose they do not say anything?  I think in politics that is more honest and straighter than saying you will do one thing and then go on to do something else.</P>

      <P>The Parties can say nothing about the subject.  He who reads may run.  Anyone can draw his own conclusions about it.  Let me put the practical side of the problem, if this country is divided into single member constituencies.  In the last election only 288 candidates, representing all points of view in the country, went forward.  Of that number 112 were Fianna Fáil and there were 146 seats contested.  That meant that only 176 candidates contested those seats on behalf of all the rest of the Parties, including Independents.  The fact of the matter is that none of the other Parties has the resources to throw in two or three candidates to contest each constituency.  The Fine Gael Party, which was the biggest Party, had 82 candidates in that election in which there were 146 seats under contest.</P>
      <P>I do not think you will need to make many bargains to ensure that there will be only a couple of candidates contesting each seat if you have the kind of situation built up that the Government are envisaging.  There is no question about it.  This particular kind of approach has led to a situation where there is not the same respect for parliamentary democracy in this country as there was in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said that he had not the gift of prophecy but he went on to talk about two groups.  Suppose this ends up with three groups?  Even in that direction the Minister's gift of prophecy is gone.  He has talked about 101 people arguing for a different conclusion and that again is <Col N="663" /> really an exaggeration, just the same as when the Minister was talking about Governments being able to see far enough ahead.  All I can say is that the Fianna Fáil Party came in as a Radical Party and what has worried most people is that, though they did certain things in the 1930s, more things were not done.</P>
    <P>The things they did were quite common to the whole world at that time.  There was a major world problem of unemployment but it did not hit this country as much as it did other countries.  It did, however, hit us, and we had certain social welfare services brought in, the same as elsewhere. It is true that the Fianna Fáil Party did a certain amount of land division but, if we look back now, the impression one gets is that all the capital expenditure which has been so high in real terms since the war, the forestry programme, the housing and rural electrification programme, all could have been done for a fraction of the cost in the 1930s. At that time Fianna Fáil were in office with an overall majority and they made no effort whatever.  Even if they had planted a few trees this country would be infinitely better off than it is to-day.</P>
    <P>Towards the end of his speech the Minister talked about the period when Comhlucht Siúicre Teo. was set up. He said we had a foreign combine here which was on its last legs.  It was paying a 15 per cent. dividend to the shareholders and they were paid, by the Minister's Government, £2 for every £1 they had invested.  From that it does not seem as if it was on its last legs.</P>

      <P>We have had quotations about the suggestion that bargains are made after elections but I wish to give only one quotation tonight. I went down to the Library to get it out yesterday.  It is a quotation taken from underneath the picture of the Taoiseach which was printed in the <i>Irish Press</i> of May 21st, 1954.  This <Col N="664" /> is what he said in one important paragraph:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The battle is over.  The people have given their decision.  The Coalition Parties have a majority and they can form a Government.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That was what he said the day after the election but, five days later, when he had time to think it over he said: &ldquo;All the bargaining is on.&rdquo;  The day after the election, when the count had just finished, he had nothing to say about bargaining.  &ldquo;The Coalition Parties have a majority and they can form a Government&rdquo;&mdash;does that sound as if there was any question of bargaining or that there was any doubt in anybody's mind about the nature of the election?  I do not think it does.</P>

      <P>The Minister also made a point that certain Parties might do reasonably well, some of them better than others, and so on.  If anybody has any doubt about it he has only to look at the election in Dublin South-Central last year, but there is no doubt in anybody's mind that, if this goes through, the Opposition Parties will be reduced substantially, reduced to very small proportions, for two reasons.  The Labour Party has really got no newspaper support&mdash;that is literally true&mdash;and the Fine Gael Party has no money.  The Fine Gael Party is not backed by the millers or other people.  That is a fact.</P>

      <P>There was a suggestion by the Minister that some phrase like this was used at the end <Col N="665" /> of the last inter-Party Government: &ldquo;If you do not do this, we will go out and burst the Government&rdquo;.

      <P>He met the executive of Clann na Poblachta and they decided that a motion of no confidence in the Government was to be put down by the Clann na Poblachta Party and the Government's majority was gone.  &ldquo;If you do not do this, we will go out and burst the Government&rdquo;.  There was no question of the &ldquo;this&rdquo;.  The motion of no confidence was put down.  I was in a position to know whether there were any discussions or not about it.  There were no discussions.  The Clann na Poblachta executive were quite entitled to do it that way.</P>

      <P>The Minister said subsequently that he was concerned at a suggestion that, as Parties grow in strength, they grow in arrogance.  He went on to justify that.  His argument was that often the bigger the majority the more attention they have to pay to the public, that they feel they are representative of the whole public.  Is that borne out by the facts anywhere in the world?  If you take the ultimate in the size of Parties you have the Fascist State or the Communist State. They have a form of election there and there you have the complete Party. Is there any suggestion or are we suggesting that these Parties are not more arrogant than Parties can be in a democratic State?  We all believe they are more arrogant.  We know they are more arrogant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="666" /> Finally, the Minister made a suggestion that P.R. was an instrument imposed on us for our destruction and division.  The Minister suggested that in the case of Sligo that was brought forward in relation to that town although the British at the time would not build a road for them.  Let me say this: Does the Minister know whether, in fact, the people in Sligo asked for it or not?  I believe from the surrounding evidence the people of Sligo did ask for it.  The Minister by-passed that and slid by that point. He kind of hinted that they did not ask for it.  At the same time, I think it was fairly obvious that there was some approach by the people of Sligo about it.</P>

      <P>The sequence of events was that the Sligo Corporation got into financial trouble.  They wanted to increase the rate, to increase their borrowing, so that they could keep the ordinary services going.  They had not got the money.  They were told that they could get these increased powers if in the same Bill they asked for P.R.  The two things were linked. They could not get one without the other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not paid much attention to this controversy.  I understand it has been widespread in the Sligo papers.  I did see one letter, in the <i>Sunday Press</i>, I think it was, which said that there was a meeting in the town of Sligo of the citizenry and that it was agreed by the citizenry that they would approach the Government of the day, that is, they would make an approach to Parliament to get a P.R. system in the town.  I read that letter and that is what that letter said, that they would approach the British Government and ask them.  I can well see why in the town of Sligo they wanted to have the business interest represented on the corporation and agreed to this.  If the Minister says that they wanted money, I will accept the Minister's word for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a quotation, again in relation to the British: &ldquo;They did it for <Col N="667" /> he purpose of dividing us.&rdquo;  First of all, you ask yourself did it divide us? Has P.R. ever, in fact, divided us or had any influence on the people?</P>
    <P>One final point in relation to the Constitution.  The first Constitution of this country said the following about the matter&mdash;I think this is germane&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Listen to it carefully:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The members shall be elected upon principles of P.R.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That was implemented in the Electoral Act, 1923.  What was put into the 1937 Constitution was:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The members shall be elected on the system of P.R. by means of the single transferable vote.&rdquo;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I might say that it was with some reluctance that I was prevailed on to intervene in this debate.  It is not because I have not the view that the Bill should be opposed.  I have the view that the Bill should be opposed but I do not like speaking about problems that I do not profess are my territory. I attended many courses of lectures on the subject, politics, in a number of universities.  Anywhere I went I attended the course on politics but I always felt that it was an extremely nebulous subject&mdash;nebulous, very difficult to get hold of.  I must say that at 8 o'clock last night Senator L'Estrange had improved my education considerably.  He brought the practice of politics in this country to ground level, something that my mind could grasp, in his account of five county councils where the Fianna Fáil <Col N="668" /> people have a majority and they exclude everybody else, all the other councillors, from every association with the operation of the county council and the administration of services. That was something I could understand. That was arithmetical.  That was totalitarian arithmetic and that was a piece of political action that I could understand all right.</P>

      <P>I think&mdash;and I am now going to speak for myself&mdash;that this Bill is the political last will and testament of the present Taoiseach, Éamon de Valera.  It is an attempt to bestow this nation on his own Party, if he can do it.  We all know by experience what happens in many cases in relation to harsh and unfair wills.  In the first case, it may not be upheld in the courts.  In this case, the lower courts are the Dáil and the Seanad, so, even if they find their way through these courts, there is a final immediate court of appeal&mdash;appeal to the people.  It is more than an appeal: it is a court to which the case must go but there is, in fact, no finality about the matter.  If it goes through this time it will come up for judgment at each election subsequently; it will come up again and again until, in my opinion, it will inevitably result perhaps in the complete obliteration of the Fianna Fáil Party at a time when it might be desirable that they should remain perhaps as the main Opposition in the Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have not the gift of prophecy but <Col N="669" /> let us not forget what happened to the Irish Party: I shall come back to the Irish Party and its methods of selection, and so on, later on.  On a number of occasions the Taoiseach spoke in the Dáil about meeting people between 1948 and 1951 who were in accord with his view that P.R. should be abolished.  One asks oneself how is it that he did not mention it until 1958?  Is it not obvious that the Taoiseach is using his imagination in that or did he expect people to say to him, when he drew down the question of P.R.: &ldquo;I disagree with you entirely, Chief&rdquo; or &ldquo;Mr. de Valera&rdquo;, depending on the person?  If it was a Fine Gael person he would say &ldquo;Mr. de Valera&rdquo;&mdash;he was then the Leader of the Opposition. If it was a member of the Fianna Fáil Party he would say &ldquo;Chief&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamOBuachalla" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am stating a fact.  I have referred to him as &ldquo;the Taoiseach, Mr. de Valera.&rdquo;  I mentioned his name once.  I am talking about the conversation that would have taken place when he was not Taoiseach.  I think I am quite within my rights to speak that way.</P>
      <P>I think it would occur to anybody, in relation to the statesmanship of this matter, that, in any other democracy in Western Europe, if a serious constitutional change of this sort were about to be made, there would be consultation with the Opposition Parties before bringing it forward.  I think there is no doubt whatsoever about that.  If there had been such an approach, I think a compromise solution might have been possible. The Senators can think of the compromise solution for themselves.</P>

      <P>We have had a number of commissions in this country on various problems.  For example, we had a very big commission which reported on the track performances of greyhounds and other performances in relation to greyhounds and a Bill was <Col N="670" /> introduced.  Yet, we have an amendment to the Constitution and there is no question of setting up any group of people to study it or advise the Government about it.</P>
      <P>In his speech when introducing this Bill here the Taoiseach said, as reported at column 251 of Volume 50 of the Official Report of Seanad Eireann: &ldquo;We have a system of representative democracy here.&rdquo;  That is perfectly true.  What has he set out to do?  In this Bill, he is setting out to make it less representative.  At the foot of column 251 and the top of column 252 we read this statement by the Taoiseach in relation to inter-Party Governments: &ldquo;It is a game of poker at the Government meetings instead of frank discussion.&rdquo;  How does the Taoiseach know that?  I sat at Government meetings for three years and I never saw a game of poker played at them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>Since questions of card games have been introduced, there are stories which most of us have heard in our lifetime about the innocent young fellow coming back from abroad with some money and being caught out by a group of card sharpers.  If he turned out to be a good card player what did the card sharpers do?  They tried to vary the rules.  They would say: &ldquo;You can have only one straight flush in a game&rdquo;, or: &ldquo;You can get fours only once.&rdquo;  I think there is a little bit of a card game in this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to come back to the suggestions about those words that are used.  The first words I noticed in relation to this matter were that it was a &ldquo;national question&rdquo;.  Every matter which becomes of importance to the Fianna Fáil Party, by that very fact, becomes a national question in this country.  If it becomes of importance to the Fianna Fáil Party&mdash;it does not matter whether it is the starting of a new newspaper, an evening or a Sunday paper, or whatever it is&mdash;it is a national question.  I could add in this sense, using the words &ldquo;national question&rdquo;, if we accept my definition, <Col N="671" /> what is the Irish nation in this sense? Is it the 600,000 people who voted for Fianna Fáil&mdash;one-seventh of the population? After all, if that is what a national question means in this country and in this context I am prepared to accept that.</P>
    <P>I think, again, that there is in all this an element of the &ldquo;bread and circuses&rdquo; but do not forget that there can be no bread in it, whether free bread or cheap bread, because the price of bread has gone up 60 per cent. since Fianna Fáil came into office. Therefore, we are to have one circus&mdash; not circuses but one circus.  I will give the Taoiseach credit; he is an excellent ringmaster in the matter.  Genuinely, I am not saying that cynically or anything else: I think the Taoiseach does understand how to handle those problems very well.</P>
    <P>The other word used, which has been adverted to by Senator Stanford, a word I used to notice a great deal from Mr. Lemass in 1953 and which, strangely enough, he used at a meeting of some association on the very night on which Senator Stanford used it here, is the word &ldquo;stability&rdquo;. Mr. Lemass kept talking about stability during the whole of the year 1953 although the cost of living had gone up 17 points the previous year through his Government's action.  He said: &ldquo;We now have stability&rdquo;, on the very night that the word was used here by Senator Stanford.  In other words, you are on a different plane.  If that is the meaning of it, I am quite prepared to accept it.</P>
    <P>But when you get down to the pure political side of the thing, we must admit that we have had only three Prime Minister in this country since 1922.  If that is instability, I do not know where stability exists.  I think there is an extreme form of Party egotism in this matter, the essence of which is: &ldquo;Who is to replace us?&rdquo; as if the mould only existed between 1880-1900 and was then broken or lost with the turn of the century.  In fact, when we think about stability&mdash;I will not dilate on it&mdash;I would say that we have had a drop of 150,000 persons in the population of this country in the past few years.  We have stability <Col N="672" /> there on a different plane.  We knock 5 per cent. off the population and there is not quite so much unemployment.</P>
    <P>Another term that I hear in this matter is &ldquo;the people&rdquo;.  Senator Ted O'Sullivan referred to the matter and I can paraphrase his words.  He said, extremely well I thought, in different ways, that Fine Gael are trying to keep this Bill from the people.  The fact that the Fine Gael Party opposed the First Reading in the Dáil was indicative of their serious objection to the proposals in the Bill.  It had nothing to do with keeping it from the people.  Nothing that they could do would keep it from the people as they are in a minority in the Dáil.  Why were they not entitled to object to the First Reading if in fact they did not like what was in the Bill?</P>

      <P>They had a duty, of course.  I think that this Bill is a blatant attempt to take away a certain part of the people's liberty.  These liberties and powers have been gradually chipped off.  Let me give as an example the way in which the powers of the local councils were chipped away down the years until the last Coalition Government came into power.  The powers of the representatives in the local bodies were chipped away and reduced to very limited proportions.  That had a certain effect on the working of those bodies and the last inter-Party Government did attempt to do something about it.</P>
      <P>Another word which has been used is &ldquo;democracy&rdquo;.  Let us not forget that the Soviet people have used this word in their propaganda since the war, all over the world.  I notice that a Deputy in the Dáil recently spoke about &ldquo;their system of democracy&rdquo; in relation to Soviet Russia.  I do not understand that kind of usage in relation to words, and I do not pretend to understand it.  I do not understand the word as applied in Italy during the Fascist régime, and in Germany during the Nazi régime, and it was used in both places.</P>

      <Col N="673" /> Now, the question is&mdash;the Fianna Fáil Party suggest&mdash;that you should have effective Government.  All modern Governments have plenty of power.  Technological developments, communications of all sorts, starting with the railways and going on to the roads, the telephone and wireless, all result in a centralisation of power in the central Government of any country. It is a completely different situation to what it was 100 years ago. Anybody who suggests that the Government in a country have not got ample powers already is fooling himself for one thing.  Once you have a Government established, if you have a system, as in France, where they did not have to go back to the people but just kept chopping Ministries around&mdash;not under P.R.; it had nothing to do with P.R.; it was because they did not have to go back to the people again, and even did without a Government for a period&mdash; I think that is quite an abnormal situation.  If the French Deputies had to go back to their constituencies again they would not have had these <i>lacunae</i> Governments which they did have.</P>
    <P>I think Senator O'Brien put the matter extremely well when he said, as reported at column 317, that the powers of the Seanad should be strengthened. The problem now in modern States, with which most representatives should concern themselves, is the problem of the filching away by the central Government of the natural rights of the citizens, and that is being constantly done.  In relation to Government, I agree with the view that there is greater danger of tyranny than of anarchy.  If we like we can take the phrase&mdash;&ldquo;Government of the people, by the people, for the people.&rdquo;  Who are the people in this context?  What does the essence of the problem mean? Does it mean the 45 per cent. of the people who have been voting for Fianna Fáil, and who really are only 30 per cent. at most of the population&mdash;that is to say, about three adults out of every ten?  Are they &ldquo;the people&rdquo; in this context?  I do not understand the phrase &ldquo;the people&rdquo; in that way.  Every man has the same natural rights and the other <Col N="674" /> seven people have just as many rights as the three who vote for the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>
    <P>I should like to advert to a point about statistics.  I have noticed in the little book by Mr. Ross about the Irish election system, that, from the point of view of the Fianna Fáil Party, the results have been excellent.  In every election since 1923 they got more than their proper proportion of seats.  In 1943, they got 9 seats more than they should have got.  That was the election in which they were shaken. In the last election, in 1957, the Fianna Fáil Party got seven seats more than they should have got.  That means that under the present system the bigger Parties get their seats at a cheaper price than small Parties.</P>
    <P>There has been a good deal of talk throughout the debate&mdash;and the matter was adverted to by the Taoiseach&mdash;about the question of duplication of elections.  Somebody asked, I think very appropriately, why was there not a second election in 1952.  There are various explanations for that.  It is suggested&mdash;I am not making the suggestion&mdash;that it was because agreement was made with the Independent Deputies that there would be no election for three years.  I have a different explanation for it.  I believe, and it would take a good deal to shake my belief, that the real reason was that the reaction to Deputy MacEntee's Budget was so severe that the Taoiseach knew he would be in for a heavy defeat if there was another election.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>Nothing will shake my belief that the Taoiseach knew he would be heavily defeated and he kept on postponing an election for as long as he could on a very shaky majority until he was in the position when he had no longer any majority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we talk about the American election system we must remember it is not the same as the British system. What is proposed here is the British election system and, I am reminded, it is also the system in the Six Counties.  In the American election system there are what are called <Col N="675" /> primary elections.  You register as a Democrat, or as a Republican, and you are then entitled to vote in the primary elections.  That leads to a certain amount of hoofling for this reason, that many Republicans can register as Democrats and put in a less strong candidate as a Democrat than the man who might be elected. They can vote for the candidate they would like to see up, the man they can more easily defeat in the main election.  I think it is a defective system in that way.</P>
    <P>Senator Lenihan asked me a question earlier this evening and I promised to reply to it.  I come to it now.  He asked how it was that the first inter-Party Government came to an end in June, 1951.  The circumstances are quite plain to anybody who reads the debate.  The popular opinion about the matter is, in my view, all wrong. The break-up took place on quite a simple issue, on the Vote for Agriculture when certain Independent Deputies, Deputy Cogan, Deputy O'Reilly of Cavan, and Deputy Lehane of Cork, said they were going to vote against the Estimate.  There were discussions on the matter and the inter-Party Government at that time were not prepared to pay the price those Deputies wanted.  Therefore, there was no bargaining.</P>

      <P>Yes, and they have had to cut it when the cost of living has gone up 20 per cent.  Having paid the price in 1951, they had to cut it in 1958, seven years later when the cost of living had risen about 20 per cent. That is the history of the matter.  There had been difficulties, certainly, about a <Col N="676" /> Clann na Poblachta Minister earlier but they were over for three months at that time.  Senators can go back to that time and they will find that these are the facts.  They are quite easy to check. Deputy Dr. Browne had resigned three months earlier.  In fact, as anybody might point out the inter-Party Government won that election.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall come back on it later.  We have three daily papers one of which, according to Senator Ó Maoláin, is the organ of the Fine Gael Party.  I must say I have never noticed it.  To my mind, the <i>Irish Press</i> represents two things: the Fianna Fáil Party personified by the Taoiseach and the new industrialists. The <i>Irish Independent</i> represents politically the older established order of society here.  Let me put a name to it and say it represents the old Nationalist Party, the old Irish Party.  It is closer to representing that than it is to representing Fine Gael.  I believe in being fair and it is a fact that the <i>Independent</i> has taken a very specific line on this matter.</P>
      <P>Senator Ó Maoláin complained that they did not publish letters.  The Senator's letters are not the only ones that were not published by the <i>Independent.</i></P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasMullins" hpid="Tomás Ó Maoláin Tomás Ó Maoláin">

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, I sent them one myself and they did not publish it.  At the end of his speech Senator Carter referred to the transfer of votes in Longford-Westmeath in the last general election.  I did not check up on it; I take his word that 1,000 Fine Gael votes were transferred to the Sinn Féin candidate who is now Deputy Rory Brady.  I do not know Deputy Brady but a colleague of mine who was concerned with his education spoke to me very highly about him.  Is it not possible that these Fine Gael supporters preferred to give their second or third preferences, or whatever it was, to Deputy Brady rather than to Senator Carter?  I am not <Col N="678" /> saying that if I were there I would do it, knowing Senator Carter&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCarter" hpid="Mr. Carter Mr. Carter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carter</NameTxt>
      <P>Are we to take it that the Front Bench in the Seanad, representing Fine Gael, are advocating votes for unconstitutional candidates? Are we to infer that from the Senator's argument?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I am simply giving a possible explanation of why the transfers did not all go to Senator Carter.  Let me advert to an incident that happened in a constituency which I know well.  One of the Fianna Fáil supporters said to me: &ldquo;We would rather so-and-so was elected than another person.&rdquo;  I had been at the election and I was watching the transfer of votes and I said to a Fianna Fáil supporter: &ldquo;Your votes went one, two; two, one; one, two; and they did not show much evidence of that preference&rdquo;.  The man said to me: &ldquo;That is an entirely different matter. We had to survive ourselves.&rdquo;  In other words, he was just indulging in a piece of palaver and there was no serious intention of a real preference to one candidate rather than another.</P>
      <P>When people talk about the transfer of votes they should realise that for people who are not Fianna Fáil, the voting goes: One, two, three, four, five, six; but I see the Fianna Fáil papers marked: One, two; two, one; where there are two Fianna Fáil candidates, or if there are four Fianna Fáil candidates: One, two, three, four; three, two, one, four and so on.  If there are only two candidates, the voting goes: One, two, two, one, two, one&mdash;if the voters are given equal instructions&mdash;and never a vote for anybody else.  So that anybody in the Fianna Fáil Party who says that the Fine Gael voters should have voted for himself or anybody else in any constituency&mdash;well, all I can say is they must expect completely different treatment from what they give to other people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCarter" hpid="Mr. Carter Mr. Carter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carter</NameTxt>

      <P>I should like to advert to a few points in conclusion. Senator Lenihan adverted to this point &mdash;and I would not refer to it now except that he made the same statement on the Finance Bill last year.  In speaking about the Government White Paper, he said: &ldquo;The banks have confidence in the Government of the day.&rdquo; Are we to take it that this is a continuance of Deputy MacEntee's vicious campaign in 1956 to the effect that the country was bust, a campaign which he engineered underground and in relation to which he came out in the open only on the debate on the second lot of levies?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>&ldquo;The banks have confidence in the Government of the day.&rdquo;  We all know that the commercial banks' liquid assets in London began to go down and gradually were reduced until they reached a level that the banks thought required attention from them.  I did not agree with the opinion of the banks and I do not agree to-day with the opinion of the banks, but they were entitled to have that opinion.  They were operating a certain system, but there was no question of the banks having confidence in the Government of the day.  That is very close to being an unconstitutional remark also.</P>
      <P>I have one or two other points.  In this House, there are 11 nominees of the Taoiseach.  We all know what the position is.  Every independent Senator, except perhaps Senator Cole who was nominated by the Taoiseach, has spoken about this measure.</P>

Senator Colley when speaking last night about the way P.R. works, said that if there are 7,000 first preference votes cast and those voters have a candidate elected, they get no second, third or fourth choice. Why should they?  Have they not had their full vote?

      <P>Votes which have received full value are not transferable and are allowed to have no further effect in the election.  There may be people who do not understand the system.  That does not prevent their using it perfectly well.  There are many operations in industry, in every walk of life, in which people engage every day while not understanding the reasons for them.  I think that Senator Quinlan, who appealed to the Taoiseach at the end of his speech, to think about this matter again, will get a very dusty answer.</P>
      <P>It has become fashionable to read quotations.  I have a few quotations from <i>Parnell and his Party</i> by Conor Cruise O'Brien, which show the effect through time of the highly centralised Party.  The author speaks about the élite as it came into existence in 1883. It consisted of about half the Party.  I am quoting from page 146:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;This body was too cumbrous for the effective manipulation of power, and there was a tendency for an informal inner managerial clique to grow up consisting of &lsquo;the Lieutenants&rsquo; as they were called, that is men who were politically close to Parnell and trusted by him (and who were not necessarily officers of the Party).  This group consisted initially <Col N="682" /> of Healy, Sexton and J.J. O'Kelly; later elections added Dr. J.E. Kenny, Timothy Harrington and William O'Brien.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It goes on to describe how they operated in relation to the 1885 election, to show how they went around the country attending the conventions. O'Kelly attended the 14; Sexton, 10; Healy, 9; Bigger, 9; Parnell, 6; Harrington, 6; T.D. Sullivan, 6; William O'Brien, 9; Dillon, 4; and John Redmond, 4.  It then refers to John Redmond being a young man, and the footnote ends as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;As for Dillon, who had just returned to public life after an absence of over three years, it is probable that he was still in some degree suspect for his earlier tendency to pursue an independent policy.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>This is my final point on this Bill.  I am quoting now from page 147:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The lamentations of men like F.H. O'Donnell about the rising power of the Party machine were futile.  A united Party was essential if anything practical was to be achieved, and a united Party was necessarily a disciplined one and therefore machine-controlled.  The <Col N="683" /> sacrifices involved&mdash;including often the rejection of individuals of high integrity and ability in favour of pliant henchmen&mdash;had to be accepted if political effectiveness was to be secured.  Similarly, it is not necessary to cite Mitchel's iron law of oligarchy' in order to show that the rise of some sort of Party directorate, intermediate between the leader and the rank and file, is bound to come with any high degree of organisation.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It goes on to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The type of machine finally adopted in Ireland seems to have been more powerful in its limited sphere than the liberal one.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>&mdash;that is the Liberal Party in England&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;No Irish &lsquo;county convention&rsquo;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>&mdash;this is how it becomes germane to the present situation&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;could stand up to Parnellite dictation in the way the liberal association of, say, Bradford or Liverpool could, if necessary, resist the liberal executive.  Ostrogorski regarded it as a rare occurrence for the liberal central organisation to bring &lsquo;regular pressure to bear&rsquo; on a local association in favour of a candidate....  On the whole the comment of the <i>Irish Times</i> (2nd October, 1885) on the working of the convention system seems justified: &lsquo;This process of finding a parliamentary representation is unique.  There has not been anything like it&rsquo;.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>&mdash;the Party grew very largely after this 1885 election&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The new members, as we have seen, were hand-picked, pledge-bound, and paid out of Party funds. The &lsquo;policy of the Party&rsquo; came down to them from above, from the leader and his lieutenants, and they had no choice but to obey.  But the party policy was still, in essentials, the Kilmainham policy, i.e., a strictly constitutional anti-revolutionary policy, which could probably only <Col N="684" /> have been framed at a period when the social make-up of the party was relatively upper class, and its political make-up contained large conservative elements.  That it was possible to continue this policy smoothly through and after the general election of 1885 with the greatly widened suffrage and consequent choice of more plebeian representatives, was due in a large measure to the development of the Party machine in the years between the Kilmainham treaty and the general election.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>&mdash;the Kilmainham treaty being the treaty between the Liberal Party and the Parnellite Party&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Throughout that period the Healys and the Harringtons, the engineers of the party, had been hard at work, so that, when the flood of mass-democracy rose, it did not sweep away the Kilmainham edifice, but was held in new and solid dykes.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>One final word from the book:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is notable that not one of the 50-odd new members of the Irish Party returned in the 1885-1886 elections under the National League system of managed conventions, ever rose to any sort of leadership in the Party, although many of them had very long parliamentary careers. By their selection the &lsquo;lieutenants&rsquo; ensured not merely the provision of a solid block of votes for any Parnellite policy, but their own continued predominance in the councils of the party.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan2" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>As we are dealing with constitutional matters, I should like to draw the attention of the House to the very significant remark made by Senator O'Donovan when making a rather savage attack on Mr. Blythe, because Mr. Blythe was no longer willing to <Col N="685" /> toe the Party line.  One of the many criticisms made of the Coalition Government was the fact that they were unable, or unwilling, to abide by the principle of collective responsibility. Most people regarded that as arising from the nature of the Coalition Governments, but apparently as far as Fine Gael are concerned, that failure to abide by the principle of collective responsibility goes back much further, because Senator O'Donovan named Mr. Blythe for the terrible financial blunders he made, which apparently were responsible for Cumann na nGaedheal's misfortune.  Apparently, even at that time, the Cumann na nGaedheal Government did not conform to the principle of collective responsibility.  The blame is put on Mr. Blythe only; the remaining members of the Cabinet, apparently, are taking no responsibility whatever for what he did.</P>
      <P>One of the points made in the course of this debate was that no reference to the proposed amendment of the Constitution was made in the last general election.  It was suggested by a number of speakers that we should have told the people in the last general election that we proposed to make this change.  But I am sure Senators are all well aware that the only way in which an amendment to the Constitution can take place is by a referendum.  So that, even if Fianna Fáil had said at the last election that they proposed to make this change, or even if the people had given them an overwhelming majority on that issue, it would have had no effect whatever.  It would still have been necessary to introduce this Bill and to have a referendum to ascertain the wishes of the people on this point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, it is of no consequence whatever, and it is not a valid point, to say that Fianna Fáil are in some way to blame because they did not mention this at the last election.  As a matter of fact, Fianna Fáil would have been wrong to mention it at the last election, because the Constitution lays down that when a Bill is being introduced to hold a referendum in connection with an amendment of the Constitution, that Bill should contain no other proposal.  In other words, <Col N="686" /> the issue should not be mixed up with any other issue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DominickMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan2" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>In the same way it would have been quite wrong for the Fianna Fáil Party to mix up the question of an amendment of the Constitution with the various other issues, the economic position and so on, which were mentioned in the general election.  Therefore, I suggest that Fianna Fáil were quite right and were acting very properly in refusing to allow this issue to be confused with the various other issues which were dealt with during the general election.</P>
      <P>The Government are approaching this amendment in the way in which the Constitution says it should be approached.  In doing that, they are approaching it in a very responsible and very proper manner.  It has been suggested also that quite apart from the last general election nobody in the country, none of the Fianna Fáil leaders or anybody else, mentioned P.R. or discussed it during the past ten or 15 years.  It has been suggested that the Taoiseach did not become a convert to the straight vote and certainly did not express any views about it until the last two years.  A number of quotations have been given in the Dáil&mdash;quotations not only from the Taoiseach but from a number of other people on both sides of the House&mdash;giving their views on P.R. I shall not give the House these quotations which have been given before, but I shall quote from a very interesting article I have here.  It is an article by the late Sir B.N. Rawle who was constitutional adviser to the Indian Constituent Assembly. The article, for those who would like to check up on it, to see if I am quoting it accurately, appeared in a paper called <i>The Hindu</i> published in Madras on 23rd January, 1958.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Sir B.N. Rawle describes his visit to Dublin in November, 1947.  He says: &ldquo;I had the privilege of an interview with Mr. de Valera, who was most cordial and considerate.  He remarked that if he had a chance of rewriting the <Col N="687" /> Irish Constitution he would make three changes, and the first of the three changes that he would make&mdash; he would do away with P.R. in any shape or form.  He preferred the British system as it made for strong Government.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DominickMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Was that published in India or in Ireland?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan2" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It was published in India.  Now, it is clear from that that, in 1947, the Taoiseach had the very strong and very definite view that P.R. was a system of which he no longer approved.  I would once again remind those who mention 1948 as a vital date governing the Taoiseach's change of mind that that was in 1947.</P>
      <P>The issue of P.R. and the straight vote is now being put to the people. What is before us at the moment? The Bill before us is not any piece of permanent legislation.  We are not proposing to do anything; we are not proposing to amend the Constitution. We are merely attempting to give the people an opportunity of giving us their view on it.  I find it difficult to understand the attitude of Senators who propose to vote against this Bill. I understand fully the attitude of Senators who have spoken against the Bill, who have objected to the Bill and who have said some very extravagant things about the Bill.  They are perfectly entitled to do that.  But it is difficult to understand the attitude of a Senator who does not want the people to have an opportunity of expressing their view.  I think it can only be concluded that a Senator who does not want to have the view of the people is himself taking the view that the people are not entitled to give their view, that they are not capable of giving their view; or possibly&mdash;it is just possible&mdash;the Senator concerned is afraid that the people might express their view in a way the Senator would not like.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There have been strong protests from Fine Gael against our trying to put through something now without consulting the people, meaning without consulting the people in the course of the last general election.  That <Col N="688" /> comes rather strangely from Fine Gael, or from any member of the Coalition, having regard to the way in which the Republic of Ireland Bill was put through in 1949, not only without consulting the people, but in the teeth of the professed policy of Fine Gael.  A referendum at that time would have been a very useful means of ascertaining whether or not the people wanted that Bill; but Fine Gael, at that time, not having consulted the people in the previous general election and not having given the people an opportunity of expressing their wishes by way of referendum, put the Bill through regardless of what the wishes of the people were.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, the Opposition at that time never asked for that.  We are asking for it now.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan2" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>One other point made is that the demand for this Bill is not there, that nobody wants it.  First of all, it is unlikely that the man in the street will take the initiative in introducing a change of this kind.  Any reform of the electoral system is, in the natural course of events, likely to come from one or other of the Parties. It is likely to come from those who are interested in politics and interested in the mechanics of politics.  It is only natural that some Party should take the lead in introducing a Bill of this kind.  Fianna Fáil believe that the demand is there.  From my own experience, I believe a great many people want a change to the straight vote, but I am quite willing to admit that I may be wrong.  I am quite willing to admit that Fianna Fáil may be wrong.  Perhaps we are wrong.  The referendum which we propose to hold, and which we are asking this House to allow us to hold, is to find out whether or not we are wrong.  We may be wrong.  Where is the use in asking whether or not there is a demand or whether or not we may be wrong in thinking there is a demand?  There is a very easy way to find out whether or not the demand is there.  The referendum <Col N="689" /> is the way to do it.  Why not, therefore, see whether there is a demand by way of referendum?</P>
      <P>Another point made is that the Bill is a distraction, that there are so many other things that should be done, we should not be worrying about this issue at the moment.  The implications in that is that perhaps the Bill is a good one, that perhaps the change to the straight vote would be a good idea, but at the moment it is a distraction: that we have not time to deal with it at the moment; but, if there is any truth in the suggestion that it is a good one, then surely it is a good one now at this moment, just as good as it would be two or three years hence.  It may be that the Bill is badly timed.  I am not admitting that it is, but it may be that the Government are showing bad timing in attempting to introduce the change now.  Be that as it may, the Bill is before the House now, the proposal is on its way to the country now and, if it is ever to be a good idea, if there is any truth in the suggestion or the implication that it may be a good thing, then it may be a good thing now just as well as at any other time.</P>
      <P>There is a further point with regard to the argument that the Bill is a distraction. It might be better to have one good distraction now rather than have a series of distractions in the future.  In the past, quite apart from the Coalition days, it was necessary to hold second elections.  During the Fianna Fáil term of office, there was a second election in 1933, in 1938 and in 1944.  These were all serious distractions. They were all distractions at a time when great work was being done to develop the country.  Had it not been necessary to hold these second elections in those years, more work would have been done, and it would have been done more quickly.  They were serious distractions.  The elections held during the time of the Coalition were also serious distractions.  I suggest it may be well worth while to have a good distraction now, if you choose to regard it as a distraction, rather than have many distractions in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that if P.R. continues and if the Party structure and the developments <Col N="690" /> which have been taking place continue under P.R. it is almost certain there will be many distractions in the future, many attempts to form Governments, many failures to form Governments and frequent elections.  Therefore, if it is a distractions, I suggest it is well worth while having the distraction now, getting it over with and looking forward to a future in which we shall not have many distractions of a similar kind.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested by Senator Quinlan and, I think, by Senator O'Donovan, that we should be set up a commission.  I should be very interested to know who would be on that commission and where we are to look for the experts for the commission. What kind of experts can we hope to find outside the Houses of the Oireachtas who would be so much better qualified to deal with an electoral system than we?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan2" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite clear that in the Dáil and Seanad there are people who are best qualified to deal with that problem, both from the theoretical and the practical point of view. We have, from time to time in the past, been severely criticised when Bills were introduced dealing with agriculture, industry, the professions, and so on, because it was suggested we were attempting to deal with subjects we knew nothing about.  It was suggested that we were interfering in vocational matters and so on, and attempting to dictate to those spheres of society on something about which we could not be expected to know anything.  Surely if there is one thing that we can expected to know something about, one type of subject on which we can claim to be experts, it is anything to do with the electoral system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="691" /> The suggestion of setting up a commission is the purest nonsense and although I was not here when Senator Quinlan claims he answered the question which I put, I just cannot imagine who he suggested should be on that commission, who would be better qualified to deal with that subject than the members of the Oireachtas.</P>

      <P>If a commission of both Houses were set up, bringing in experts, we would almost certainly end up with a commission of theorists and amateur politicians who would almost certainly bring in recommendations which would be quite impracticable and in saying that there is a possibility that this kind of commission of outside experts might bring in impracticable suggestions, I should like to quote the words of a man known to us all, a man who is very quotable.  Possibly Senators may have heard this quotation before on a number of occasions but it is very relevant.  The quotation is part of what Deputy Dillon said on 12th November, 1947.  He said:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;P.R. is, in fact, as we all know in our hearts, the child of the brains of all the cranks in creation. So far as this country is concerned, it was tried out on the dog.  I doubt <Col N="692" /> if any other sane democratic country in the world has put it into operation in regard to its Parliament... it is true to say that the kind of P.R. that we have operating in this country has not been adopted in any other country.  It was foisted upon us by a collection of half-lunatics who believed that they had something lovely that would work on paper like a jig-saw puzzle, but like all these crank ideas in operation, it has resulted here in an election in 1931, an election in 1932, an election in 1938, an election in 1939, an election in 1943, and an election in 1944.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>That is the kind of crank recommendation which we are likely to get from the commission and, therefore, I am completely against the suggestion.  I think it would not work out in practice to be nearly so good, or so practical, or so fruitful, as the discussions on this proposal have been in the Dáil and the Seanad.</P>
      <P>I believe an electoral system should conform to three rules.  First, it should provide effective government; secondly, it should provide the machinery whereby the Government can be changed at regular intervals; thirdly&mdash;and I put them in that order &mdash;it should provide a Dáil which is broadly representative.</P>
      <P>The first essential is effective government. Far too much emphasis is being placed in these debates on representation, on mathematical representation, on attempting to give every minority the exact proportion of representation to which it would be entitled according to the proportion of the population it represents.  Fundamentally, the electoral system has to provide a Government and there is no use in providing a Dáil, no matter how representative it is, if it cannot carry on the business of the country. The Dáil is not a place where we can be satisfied to have Deputies who glory in the fact that they represent an exact section of the population.  It is not merely a place where Deputies can be satisfied to discuss matters and to achieve nothing.  Unless the Dáil gives effect to the wishes of the people whom the Deputies represent, then it is useless and will certainly, in due course, deteriorate into some kind of anarchy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The present system of what is referred to as P.R., is defended on its merits as a representative system.  In fact, it is not P.R. because it does not give representation to minorities.  At present, the Dáil consists of Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael, Labour, Clann na Talmhan and a few other Independents and small Parties.  Do any of these <Col N="694" /> Parties represent minorities?  Neither Fianna Fáil nor Fine Gael purport to represent minorities; they both purport to represent all sections of the community. Clann na Talmhan does, I think, make a claim, though not a very strong one, to represent the farmers of the country.  But even if they do make the claim, it is quite clear that they have not succeeded in acting as the spokesmen of the farmers so that they do not represent the minority here.</P>
    <P>Labour purports to speak on behalf of the trade unions.  Labour to some extent does represent the minority.  It comes nearer to representing a minority than any other Party in the Dáil but, even so, it does not get anything like the position which it should have if it represented, in fact, the unions or labour so that if you look at the Dáil at the moment the position is that the present system has not given us a Dáil in which minorities are represented.  It has failed to do that and, consequently, it is not deserving of our support or our confidence.</P>
    <P>Deputy Sheldon, when speaking on this Bill in the Dáil, said that one of the reasons he was voting for the amendment&mdash;and I quote him&mdash;was that: &ldquo;the present system appears to be doing something which it is not doing.&rdquo;  That, I believe, is one of the principal arguments against the present system.  It purports to be P.R.  It purports to give representation to minorities but if you look at the Dáil at the moment the fact of the matter is that it is not doing that.</P>
    <P>Of course, as has already been said, the system is not P.R. in its proper form because if it were we would have one big constituency.  If we had one big constituency, which the members opposite have hastened to assure us they do not want, the position, assuming for the moment a Dáil of 100 members, would be that anybody with 1 per cent. or fewer of the votes could have a member.  That would mean that we would have everybody represented in the Dáil.  We would have tinkers, tailors, soldiers, sailors, rich men, poor men, beggarmen and thieves. Everybody would be represented.  You would have splendid representation then but it is quite clear that it would <Col N="695" /> be quite impossible to form a Government and, consequently, I do not think anybody would want that system.  To that extent nobody really wants P.R. although many people at the moment are saying they are fighting for its retention.</P>
    <P>I should like just to quote a few words to the House from page 20 of Professor Hogan's book, <i>Election and Representation:</i>&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Therefore the nearer the approach to proportionality, that is the larger the size of the constituency, the easier it is for all sorts of minorities to elect their own candidates with their own votes, and so the easier it becomes for them to set up separate political Parties without having to accommodate their points of view and policies to those of other Parties, or without concerning themselves with the interests of the community at large.  Hence the tendency of P.R. to act as an instrument of dissociation, to release minorities from the framework of the major political Parties into which they would have had to fit themselves under the majority system.  In short, P.R. not merely reflects existing minorities, but tends to manufacture them, producing separate political Parties at the expense of the major political Parties.</P>
    <P>One incidental but most important result in view of the revolutionary ferment prevailing in the world to-day is that not merely is a new stimulus thereby given to the legitimate ambition of minorities to assert themselves politically but new possibilities of representation are opened up for the illicit ambitions of those minority groups of an extremist and revolutionary character, which under the majority system would have little hope of finding their way into Parliament in order to use it as a platform for disseminating anti-democratic and anti-parliamentary ideas and policies.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>In dealing with the rights of minorities Senator Stanford, in a rather restrained way, and Senator L'Estrange in anything but a restrained way, dealt with the question of those groups which might be denied representation under the new system and who would as a result resort to unconstitutional means.  I think it is not a very good practice to suggest to these groups that if they do not get representation under the new system they are more or less justified in resorting to unconstitutional means.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest that it is a very dangerous doctrine to propose, that any minority&mdash;and I am not talking merely about minorities which are likely to resort to violence&mdash;unable to get representation is entitled, or may or could resort to other means.  Is every minority, no matter how small, to take it that if they cannot get representation they can look for other means of achieving their object? Where do you stop with minorities? What minority, of what size, has a right to representation and what minority has no right to representation and no right to take other means of achieving its objects?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is very easy to say that at the present time we should keep the <i>status quo.</i>  It is very convenient for the members of the smaller Parties who <Col N="697" /> are represented at the moment to say that things are all right as they are now, that minorities are getting due representation as things stand at the moment because the particular Party concerned is getting representation. Senator Murphy, speaking on this subject, said that it was only right and fair that a Party the size of the Labour Party should be represented and it was only right, he said, with some reluctance, that a Party of the size of Clann na Talmhan should get representation.  Then be referred to Clann na Poblachta and said that perhaps a few years ago they were entitled to representation.  It is clear that Senator Murphy was looking at it from his own point of view.  He was judging who should get representation on this basis: &ldquo;My Party is entitled to it, anyhow, and possibly a Party a little smaller than my Party, just in case my Party goes down a little at any time, but we must have a limit&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>When is a minority not a minority? Who is to decide at what stage a minority no longer has any rights of representation?  Who is to decide that a minority in the country with the support of 50,000 people is entitled to representation, but a minority with 49,000 people is not entitled to any representation?  I suggest that when one begins to examine that problem it is impossible to find an answer.  It has been said about peace that &ldquo;one cannot divide peace,&rdquo; that it is indivisible. Much the same goes for representation.  One cannot say that one minority is entitled and another minority a little smaller is not entitled.</P>
    <P>I believe there is no need for Parties in this country representing minorities as such.  There is no section of this community, no part of the community, which because of language, because of race, because of some other characteristic of that kind, is set apart from the rest of the country, such as there is in Switzerland, where there are the Italian Swiss, the French Swiss and the German Swiss.  Possibly Parties and minorities are necessary there.  In this country, however, there is a homogeneous population.  There is no need for separate Parties representing Parties as such.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="698" /> Where one small group wants some particular thing achieved, the best way of achieving it is by working through one of the larger Parties. There may be a group which wants to achieve one particular object.  For example, fishermen may decide they want to start a movement to extend the fishing limit to 12 miles, or a group may want some particular form of land division; but is is quite unnecessary to form a Party to achieve that one object.  Not only is that unnecessary but it is undersirable, since the members of that Party in the Dáil will contribute little or nothing on other matters, but will concentrate on one particular object.  They will have little or no views to offer on other matters. As soon as the object in which they are interested is achieved, or on the other hand as soon as it is clear that their particular object cannot be achieved, that Party will have outlived its usefulness and it will gradually fade away.  In the meantime, it may have done serious damage to the structure of the Parties in the Dáil.  Two or three votes may have held up a Government for several months; it may have put out a Government or it may have caused several elections.</P>
    <P>It is a much better and more efficient and more desirable way of approaching it, where a minority has a particular object to achieve, that it should approach the existing Parties to get the support of one or other of those Parties and, having got the undertaking of that big Party to put their policy into operation, to promise to support that Party in whatever election comes next.  The alternative to that&mdash;what has been happening to some extent in the past&mdash;is that a small Party like that gets elected at a general election and after the election, without indicating to the people what they intend to do, they promise some Party or group of Parties that, in return for putting their policy into operation, they will support that group of Parties and form a Coalition.  It is much better that the pressure group should approach the Parties before the general election and pledge its support to a particular Party so that that Party could have stated in the general election what their policy was on this matter.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="699" /> It has been suggested that it would not be possible to form a new Party under the straight vote system.  I think it is quite clear that, if the existing Parties refuse to listen to a group which gradually gets bigger and bigger, that new movement will eventually form a Party and will eventually be able to take over the government of the country. That has been clearly proved by the fact that the Labour Party in Britain, which started from nothing, when there were just Liberal and Conservative Parties, was able to build itself up gradually, because the two existing Parties would not conform to their wishes and would not put their policy into operation.  The Labour Party was a completely new Party, but it eventually reached the stage where it was able to take over the government of the country.</P>
    <P>I should like to quote to the House an example of the way in which some of the members here present have agreed with me that it is sometimes desirable for smaller pressure groups or Parties to try to get their wishes achieved by working with one of the bigger Parties.  When Senator L'Estrange was talking about minorities, he said: &ldquo;I see no reason why farmers should not be represented in Parliament as a Party.&rdquo;  I wonder why Senator L'Estrange did not live up to this belief in the past.  He was in Clann na Talmhan in 1947 and he could have stayed with Clann na Talmhan and sought representation for Clann na Talmhan, representing a particular section of the farmers' point of view.  He did not do so and I will tell the House in his own words why he did not do so.  In the <i>Westmeath Examiner</i> for 13th December, 1947, there is a report of the Fine Gael Convention in Mullingar, which took place on the 8th December, 1947.  At that convention, Senator L'Estrange said&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I would like to refer to another matter.  Senator L'Estrange, speaking here yesterday&mdash;this time as a Senator&mdash;quoted Frank Gallagher's book <i>The Indivisible Island</i> and he gave the following quotation:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;One of the greatest wrongs that can be done to a minority in a democratic State is to deprive it of its political rights, particularly of its electoral rights, for these are so often a shield for the rest.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Senator L'Estrange did not go on to say what Frank Gallagher was talking about.  Further down, the author says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The denial in the case of the North is achieved by an arrangement of the electoral boundaries.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">

    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan2" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not what the Senator implied by this quotation.  It is quite clear that it was nothing to do with the system of election that operated in Northern Ireland, that that was the way in which the minorities were being denied their rights.  It was because they were being gerrymandered. That is the way the author referred to the matter.  In relation to Northern Ireland, it has been said by, amongst other members of this House, Senator Quinlan, that the minority in the North of Ireland suffered because of the change to the straight vote.</P>

      <P>In dealing with that question, I should like to quote from Senator Quinlan's favourite chapter, the conclusions in Professor Hogan's book <i>Election and Representation.</i> Professor Hogan says, on page 91, in the chapter showing his conclusions:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It can be shown that, in fact, neither the adoption of P.R. in 1920, nor its replacement by the majority system in 1929 materially affected the balance of power as between the Unionist majority and the National minority.  It is only when national minorities are spread in small groups over a wide area that they will elect more deputies under P.R. than they would under the majority system. If they are geographically concentrated, which tends to be the case with the Nationalist minorities of the Six Counties, they will in fact, enjoy all the advantages which majorities ordinarily acquire under the majority system.  In these circumstances, national minorities are likely to fare better under the majority system.  It is well to be clear that, as regards either the minority or majority in the Six Counties, P.R. has told neither in favour of one nor the other.&rdquo;</P>

I would say, if that is the fruit of Senator Quinlan's examination of the system in Northern Ireland, if that is the fruit of his examination as a scientist of the position in Northern Ireland, then I am strongly of the opinion that the sooner the scientists get back to their science and allow the politicians to deal with politics and the electoral system, the better it will be for this country.</P>

      <P>The second point to which I referred earlier on, to which an electoral system must conform, is that it must be such as to enable the people to change the Government at regular intervals, if they wish to do so. It is important that the system provides that that can be done in an effective way and, in that respect, the straight vote system with the single seat constituency is much more effective than the present one, because, under that system, when a Government have lost the confidence of the people, the swing against them is almost always stronger than under the system which we have here.  The swing towards the alternative Government is stronger and the changing of the Government, which is the wish of the people, is carried out more effectively.</P>
      <P>Under the system we have here, there has been, on a number of occasions, a stalemate, where the people apparently did not want the Government which they had before the election, but they produced a Dáil in which it was very difficult to form a new Government.  That was the position in this country in 1932, 1937, 1943, 1948, 1951 and 1954.  I believe that a system which will give a strong swing, which will put out a Government that do not govern effectively and put in the Parties that the people want is a much better electoral system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The necessity to have second elections in 1933, 1938 and 1944 shows the shortcomings of the system we have.  Professor Hogan says that if we had the straight vote between 1922 and the time that he wrote the book, which was 1945, the only difference it would have made in regard to the Governments which we have had is that the Governments both before 1932 and after 1932 would have been much stronger and more stable ones.  According to the figures, between 1922 and 1945, the change would have come just the same in 1932 but the Governments both before and after, many of which were extremely precarious ones, would have been stronger Governments.  In that way, the will of the people would have been achieved just the same.  We would have had the same Governments but <Col N="705" /> we would have had better Governments, Governments which were more stable and more effective.</P>
    <P>There has been talk of dictatorship which it is rather difficult to take seriously, that this is an effort to introduce dictatorship into this country, the dictatorship of Fianna Fáil, the dictatorship of the big Party.  First of all, I should like to say that the people of England, the United States of America, Canada, New Zealand and various other countries, all of them very successful democracies of long standing, would be very surprised to hear that they are living under what amounts to dictatorship, that they are living under a system in which the people are not permitted to have their way, not permitted to have the Government they want or the representation they want.  That is complete nonsense.  It is contributing very little to this debate to exaggerate to that extent the position that would exist under the new system.  There is nothing surer under the straight vote than that the people will put in the Government they want and will put out the Government they do not want, and will do that much more effectively than under the present system.</P>
    <P>It is suggested that this change is being introduced in order to keep Fianna Fáil in office indefinitely.  I am willing to admit that, if the change does take place, Fianna Fáil probably will do well in the next general election, but, no matter how good a Government is, the public eventually swing against it and sooner or later, no matter how good Fianna Fáil Governments you may have in future&mdash;&mdash;</P>

To suggest that Fianna Fáil will remain in office indefinitely means that the people want Fianna Fáil and will want Fianna Fáil to remain in office indefinitely or, alternatively, it means that the Opposition to Fianna Fáil will be so poor, so weak, that the people could not contemplate putting in the alternative.</P>

      <P>I would make one point, that there is no future for them under the straight vote, under the present system or under any other system, unless they have a policy and leadership.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The third point I mentioned was that the Dáil and the Government should be broadly representative.  In a single seat constituency which would approximate to about one-fourth of the average county, the Deputy would be elected in most cases by a cross-section of the community. A Deputy elected by and representative of a cross-section of the community would be much better qualified to deal with national issues than a representative of a minority group. In considering legislation, policy, and so on, such a person would have to have regard to all sections of the community and not allow himself to be dominated by any particular section. This House in particular should remember <Col N="707" /> that, in so far as the voicing of the view of a particular minority in the sense of a vocational minority is concerned, the Seanad is available and is here specifically to fulfil that need, if it is merely a question of having the view of a particular vocation, a particular section of the community which forms one particular occupation or profession, expressed.</P>
    <P>There have been many references in the Dáil and Seanad to the various European countries which suffered under P.R.  I shall not go into the details of the various countries which it is usual to mention.  The countries mentioned include Italy, Germany, France, Austria and Greece.  It is possible to argue, on the one hand, that the fact that they had trouble in forming Government was due to a different type of P.R. from the type that we have here and on the other, that the fact that they had trouble had nothing whatever to do with P.R. but was due to particular circumstances in each particular country; but I think it is true to say that all these countries experienced multiplicity of Parties, that all these countries, sooner or later, found difficulty in forming a Government, and that most of these countries ended up eventually with a dictatorship of one kind or another.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinlan, in dealing with Germany and Italy, said that, of course, the position in Germany had nothing to do with P.R.  I am not purporting to quote him exactly.</P>

      <P>I take it that, in giving that quotation, Senator Quinlan approved of it and, in so doing, was satisfied, as far as we know, that the situation in Germany and the coming into power of Hitler was due not to P.R. but to these few points which I have mentioned.  It seems clear&mdash;a matter he did not refer to&mdash;that these circumstances, these reasons which he mentioned&mdash;ageing leadership, election of mediocrities, and so on&mdash;had been caused by the system of P.R., that it was the P.R. system which led to the situation in Germany which allowed Hitler to come into power.  I have heard some rather superficial references to some of these European countries and to the fact that they did or did not owe their misfortune to P.R. but I must confess that the most facile and the least scientific, I have heard was that given to us by Senator Quinlan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Quinlan also referred to the fact that the difficulties in the early <Col N="709" /> 1930s, the difficulties in Europe, were matched by the difficulties in America and that, even though there had been difficulties in Europe, economic difficulties and so on, the people of the United States fared no better, that they had the bread lines too and that they had a very difficult time.  But what Senator Quinlan did not mention and what is the essential difference is that, in these very different circumstances which existed in these European countries and in America at the same time, the American system stood up to those difficulties and managed eventually to deal with them under the system of Government which they had whereas the most of these European countries, under the particular type of P.R. Government they had, were not able to stand up to their difficulties and collapsed and most of them ended in dictatorship of one kind or another.</P>

      <P>It think it is fair to say that the lesson of these countries, including most of the countries in Europe which I have mentioned&mdash; Italy, Germany, France, Austria, Greece, and so on&mdash;is that by trying for too much representation they ended up by undermining the democratic system.  They tried for too much.  They tried for a system that was too perfect in giving representation and, in so doing, they undermined the whole democratic system and the system collapsed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It may be said that the system of P.R. worked here and that consequently we should retain it.  I think it fair to say that the fact that P.R. worked here in the past 30 years is no proof that it will work here in the future.  There were very special circumstances in the country over the years which made it possible for that system to carry on.  The Civil War and the aftermath of the Civil War divided the country into two parts. That produced a type of two-Party system which resulted in a situation in this country of half the country supporting Fianna Fáil and roughly half against it.  Consequently, the system which we had worked reasonably well not by any means as well as some people have suggested it worked but it did manage to survive because of these particular circumstances.</P>
      <P>These issues are no longer dominating the political system.  Consequently, it is almost certain that the structure of Parliament, the structure of the Parties, would change in the future. That being so, there is a very real danger that we would have a multiplicity of Parties, that we would have a situation in due course very similar to the situation which existed in these European countries to which I have referred.</P>
      <P>I should like to make one final quotation from <i>Election and Representation</i> by James Hogan, D.Litt., Professor of History, University College, Cork, which is on page 44 and onwards.  He says there:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;On a broad view of the character of representative democracy, there are, at all times and in all conditions, certain factors which it is essential to take into account.  There are the shifts and changes in public opinion which introduce into the succession of political power an element of hazard from which the traditional political régimes of the hereditary type were relatively free, and, on the other hand, there is the tendency to faction and oligarchy which would appear to be inseparable <Col N="711" /> from the existence of permanent party organisations.  There can be little doubt that these factors tend in their general result to expose parliamentary democracy in a greater measure than any other type of constitutional régime to the particular peril of anarchy.  As anarchy, the parent of tyranny, is the malady to which representative democracy is most characteristically susceptible, and as impotence in government is invariably the immediate author or occasion of anarchy, it follows that representative democracy can afford, in less measure than any other type of political régime, to dispense with the conditions of self-reliant, firm, consecutive government.  The great complexity of the economic, social, and international conditions to which a modern democracy has to adapt itself, if it is to survive, calls for increased government action in very many directions.  Hence, far from having decreased, the need for strengthening the function of government has greatly increased.  No one who has fairly studied the evidence can doubt that one of the major factors in the decline of the parliamentary system has been its failure to develop itself as efficiently on the executive as on the legislative side.</P>
    <P>If we may accept as universally valid a political proposition which in effect is directly challenged by those who repudiate the principle of government as such, that is to say, if we acknowledge that government to be good must be effective, then it follows that democratic government, like any other form of government, must needs possess within its assigned constitutional and legal limits a real freedom of judgment, initiative, and action in all matters where the ordering of the affairs of the community is concerned.  When, furthermore, we have to concede, whether we like it or not, that there is no other practical way of avoiding under modern conditions the extremes of chaos or dictatorship than to accept a considerable extension of the functions and activities of government, it will be <Col N="712" /> evident that there could be no fallacy more disastrous in its consequences than to think of the representative process as primarily designed to neutralise, checkmate, or obstruct the activities of government.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Finally he says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;There are the strongest reasons why we should welcome, under almost any conceivable circumstances, the possession of a strong and constant majority in Parliament by whatever properly-constituted Government happens to be in office.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is the end of the quote.</P>
    <P>In case it should be suggested that I am not having regard to the chapter on &ldquo;Conclusions&rdquo; or that I was not being fair to Professor Hogan, I should mention that he says on page 93:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;While we have been convinced by our investigation into the working of P.R. in Éire that it requires a further shift towards the majority system, if we are asked how far this process should go, we feel bound to admit that we could only offer some tentative suggestions.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Professor Hogan is not prepared to come down definitely and say exactly what we should have.  He says that he is convinced that there should be a further shift towards the majority system, and, after that, all he is prepared to do is to make tentative suggestions.  Finally, I should like to say that if we do arrive at the position that we have multiplicity of Parties these various Parties will have a vested interest in the system of P.R. and if we are in that situation it is quite clear that they will never agree to any change which would eliminate them.  We have the opportunity now.</P>
    <P>It has been asked why this Bill is being introduced now.  One of the reasons is that we have an opportunity now to test public opinion on it. Public opinion will be able to say whether or not they want it but the situation may never arise again when you will have a Dáil which will be willing to allow public opinion to decide, one way or the other, for P.R. or for the straight vote.  That is an opportunity which I believe the <Col N="713" /> people are entitled to have.  It is an opportunity which the Dáil has voted to give them and it is an opportunity which, whether you agree with the amendment or not, should be given to the people.  I believe that whether you are right or wrong about this, whether or not you represent the views of the people on this, you should have sufficient confidence in your own point of view and in the wisdom of the people, to allow the people to express their opinion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>In rising to speak against this Bill one is dumbfounded by the amount of ground that has been covered.  I should like first to refer to the contribution of the Minister for External Affairs and his reference to the Seven Wise Men of Greece.  My view is that this measure has not been referred to any group of wise men in this country.  It has been referred simply to the Oracle.  The system in Greece was to refer matters to the Oracle of Delphi and I think the suggestion of the Minister for External Affairs is rather ludicrous.</P>
      <P>Senator Ryan in the case made for the abolition of P.R. has given a great deal of <i>post factum</i> information.  He has made a great case to bolster a decision already taken and the speeches in the other House would suggest and make that abundantly clear.  As a person elected to this House on the Commercial and Industrial Panel it behoves me to look at the matter from a certain angle.  I think this Bill is brought in here as a new disturbance, a new source of agitation and irritation in public life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the last few months a series of the most learned, informative and valuable contributions and suggestions as to what ought to be done for our economy and as to what form our economy should take, have emanated from official and semi-official organs of government.  It behoves us no matter what our political affiliations, to devote our energies to the practical application of these invaluable suggestions. The most important of these was that which has been edited and produced by Mr. T.K. Whitaker, who has had the assistance of all the best <Col N="714" /> brains in the various Government Departments and many of the best authorities outside this country.  He has thanked university professors from the North of Ireland and various other people who have studied our economy, for helping him with this work.</P>
    <P>As a businessman, having a businessman's approach to this problem, I ask would it not be well to get together to have something done about this matter?  I am running a business; it has been in our family for nearly 100 years and, thank God, we never had a strike.  To-day we talk about works' councils and working arrangements and lectures in summer schools. Various pamphlets and books have been written on social problems, how to reconcile business problems and to safeguard our economy, so that the units in our economy may progress. The present idea of a large dominant Party is repugnant to that philosophical tenet, that we should all work in co-operation.</P>
    <P>I believe that what we require is a new dynamic spirit in Irish affairs.  It is not altogether a political solution that is required in Ireland.  If we speak to any of our young men who have graduated recently from our universities, will any of them say that a mere change of one of the laws of our State is adequate to produce this dynamic spirit that will light up the minds, and enthusiasm, of the youth to do something about our problems?</P>
    <P>Anything we won here we won by firing the imagination and enthusiasm of all the people.  That is why I oppose this Bill.  It will drive underground a variety of opinions and ideas and variety of ideas is one of the greatest things one can have in any country, the feeling that you might be able to do something different and better and with more imagination than anybody else has ever been able to do it.  By this measure you will kill, stifle or destroy imagination and anybody who wants to do anything different will be regimented in one dominant political Party.  If that Party changes, it may change because of ill-considered catch-cries bandied round at the time of an election rather than because of <Col N="715" /> any ability to reason or adopt a commonsense approach to proposals. A greater measure of agreement must be reached between us.  If this Government, the strongest since the establishment of the State, suggested a closer working arrangement with a view to seeing what is the best system of promoting the development of the country, one would understand it.</P>
    <P>It has been said that no one can better see what form of Government we should have than those who have represented us democratically in the Oireachtas.  If that is so, why was a commission not set up composed of a selected number from the Dáil and Seanad and asked to get information from our civil servants and university authorities and to consider all the evidence fairly and objectively and conclusively and then each and every one of us asked to abide by the decision reached by the best brains in a most thorough inquiry and accept the report produced by such a commission? We did not get that type of suggestion.  We were told this was to be done for the good of the country, by a political Party that has by no means a monopoly of political wisdom. The very thing they enshrined in the Constitution they will not now tolerate.</P>
    <P>I do not want to quote very much but I should like to refer to paragraphs 13 and 14 of <i>Economic Development.</i>  Paragraph 14, page 5, says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;For all these reasons the importance of the next five to ten years for the economic and political future of Ireland cannot be over-stressed.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>At paragraph 13, it says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;A concerted and comprehensive programme aimed at a steady progress in material welfare, even though supported by the Churches and other leaders of opinion, could only be successful if the individual members of the community were realistic and patriotic enough to accept the standard of living produced by their own exertions here, even if it should continue for some time to be lower than the <Col N="716" /> standard available abroad.  Otherwise, the possibility of economic progress scarcely exists.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Is not the only way we can get that accepted and the only way we can declare war on this problem of our economy progress, the way of general agreement?  Does anyone think the views of the trade unionists, the farmers, the professional people can be reconciled in any other way?  We have evidence of the difficulty of that daily; we have statements from the Information Bureau giving the results of various inquiries and arbitration proceedings; we have people saying they can get better pay in the North or in Britain.  Those interests cannot be reconciled by a strong, dominant government; it can be done only by getting these groups to work in harmony with the Government, by making them feel they are part of the Government and that if they all put their shoulders to the wheel, a better standard of living will be secured.  To-day, the <i>per capita</i> wealth of everybody in this country is only 55 per cent. of that of the people of the neighbouring island and our people can move freely to Britain.  Should it not be the aim of each one of us, no matter what group he represents, to try to reduce this gap and in that way help to solve our greatest economic problem, emigration, and the many other problems we have here?</P>
    <P>In Britain, they have all the welfare provisions, facilities for education and research and so on because the individual incomes and output are higher. It is not a matter for the Government or Parliament to try to produce measures that will improve our situation in that regard; that improvement will come only from the people.  All the people want is a lead and co-operation. They want to be asked to give their patriotic effort in a wholehearted manner, but they will not do that, in my opinion, through the abolition of P.R.  They will give it if we move in the reverse direction.</P>
    <P>I was just about to leave school when the Civil War came and I knew many people engaged in the epics that led up to the freedom of this country. One man I knew often said to me that <Col N="717" /> if the first decade of our freedom had not been wasted, who knows to what extent we would have advanced?  I believe we want to get the benefit of that decade, that we want agreed objectives.  The young men and women who are leaving our universities and who are unfortunately cynical about what we can do, could be given that leadership they look for if there was something akin to complete co-operation, something on the lines of all-Party government here.</P>
    <P>We must look back on our history in order to draw the proper conclusions when asked to decide on this measure. I mention the Civil War, in no spirit of attributing blame to anyone for it. <Col N="718" /> Many countries have had episodes in their history from which they are able to derive good results through the application of appropriate remedies to ensure that such episodes will not recur.  The Civil War was part of the growing pains of the nation and in many respects we acquitted ourselves better, with more intelligence and more credit, as our institutions which have since developed show, than many other countries.</P>
