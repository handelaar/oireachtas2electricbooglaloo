      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to appeal to the Government, even at this late stage, to withdraw this highly controversial Bill and to set up a commission to inquire into the changes that are necessary in our electoral system and in our Government organisation so as to make our Government more effective in grappling with our real national problems of emigration and unemployment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the most significant features of the present debate, which should lead the Government to reconsider the whole Bill, has been what I might call the devastating criticisms of all the six representatives of the universities as to the ill-effects that are likely to follow the proposed change from a <Col N="1250" /> system of three, four or five seat constituencies to single member constituencies.  Such criticisms should be taken very seriously.  I am proud that the members of the universities have at all times in this House behaved as befits independent university men.  We have come to this problem with open minds. We have studied it carefully.  The results of our study are available in the debates.  They add up to the fact that we are convinced that the proposed change will be disastrous.  We are convinced that a great deal of study should be done before steps are taken to change the present system.</P>
    <P>I cannot help commenting on the abuse and the catch cries which have been heaped on the independent members of this House since we attempted to do our duty to those who sent us here, the graduates of our universities, and also to do our duty to the Irish nation by which we have been appointed to this Seanad.  Party abuse and catch cries are no substitute for reasoned argument.  The people of the country will see that when they read the debates.  They will see that the case made by the university representatives against the abolition of multiple seat constituencies is strengthened considerably by the abuse heaped on our heads for daring to speak our minds.</P>
    <P>In this we have shown&mdash;and shown conclusively&mdash;that there is no difference between the Government's proposal in relation to the single nontransferable vote and the system in operation in Belfast at present.  Consequently, our people have but to look across the Border to see the bad effects there of the system and the change that is proposed here.  After all, gerrymandering has a wider field than merely altering the boundaries of constituencies.  Any system which requires that the Opposition must get at least twice as many votes as the Government before they can elect a member is fundamentally wrong, undemocratic and deserves the name of gerrymandering in the highest degree.</P>
    <P>I asked a question.  I should like to repeat it.  We have shown by <Col N="1251" /> figures that in the single seat constituency it takes twice as many votes to elect a member to the Six Counties Parliament for the Opposition than it takes for the Unionists.  I ask the House in all sincerity if that is a fair or just system?  Are we condoning that system of election in the North?</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach mentioned this week the fact that even in Belfast itself at least 25 per cent. of the people in the city are Nationalist.  One would never have thought of that looking at the representation they have got in Westminster. 128,000 Unionist votes have elected four representatives to Westminster from the four single seat constituencies in Belfast.  The 52,000 Labour votes have been unable to elect anybody and the 18,000 Nationalist votes have been unable to elect anybody.  For a vote of 65 per cent. the Unionist Party gets all the representation for Belfast City.  We cannot condone that.</P>
    <P>Let us take the British system.  I have given those devastating figures where 487 out of 1,000 gave a mandate to nationalise everything in England and put in the strongest Labour Government ever to get in in 1945 and 486 votes out of 1,000 put them out in 1951 and sent the Conservatives in to denationalise everything. Surely we must wholeheartedly agree with the considered judgment of Mr. James Middleton, the Secretary of the British Labour Party, who in 1936 said: &ldquo;There is no greater gamble on earth than a British general election.&rdquo; Is that what we want to introduce here?  If it is, then it will lead in the single seat constituencies to frustration and divided effort and will prevent us from tackling our real economic problems.</P>
    <P>At the moment the country calls for leadership.  It calls for unity.  It calls us to put our shoulders to the wheel to get the country out of the economic difficulties in which we find ourselves. It takes the efforts of everyone to achieve that.  What are we giving here but a prescription for disunity?  For that reason alone I feel that the single seat constituency is an abhorrent approach to the Irish mentality which <Col N="1252" /> has always recognised fair play and the necessity for a good Opposition as well as a good Government.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, we should ask the Government at this late stage, in view of all those considerations, to withdraw the Bill.  Let us get back to discuss our economic development.  Let us all unite and go forward on the sound road of economic progress and let us calmly and dispassionately within the next six months, a year or more, investigate those electoral and governmental problems that need investigation.  If that is done in a reasonable and openhanded manner, please God, we will be all united in advising the Irish people to carry out the reasonable changes that a reasonable commission would recommend to a reasonable Dáil and Seanad.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCrowe" hpid="Mr. Crowe Mr. Crowe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowe</NameTxt>
      <P>We have already heard the views of a great many Senators from this side of the House.  We have also heard the views of the different professors, men of independent views with no political Party affiliations.  It may be no harm for the House to hear my views and the views of a great many people whom I have met up and down the country.  They all seem to be unanimous that P.R. had worked out well for almost 40 years.  Could we not do better with the money at the present time than plunge this country into a general election&mdash;something which the people of this country do not want?</P>
      <P>There are over 80,000 unemployed. Emigration is startling.  The people are going out on every tide.  No one appears to be anxious to abolish P.R. except the Taoiseach and his Party both here and in the Dáil.  It is rather amusing to hear them say what a horrible thing it is now.  Yet, they never said a word about it until the Taoiseach dreamt about it, I suppose. He was afraid that there might be another inter-Party Government in the Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having listened to and read a great many of the speeches, I have come to the conclusion that the idea underlying this referendum is to get rid of all opposition in the Dáil.  The idea is not merely to wipe out the small Parties, but to wipe out all Parties and so pave <Col N="1253" /> the way for a dictatorial Government. The Fianna Fáil majority at the present time is ten or 12.  Is not that good enough for anyone?  Or is it a case of history repeating itself, as was the case in 1947, when the Taoiseach plunged the country into a general election although he had a majority of 11 at the time?</P>
    <P>When P.R. was enshrined in the 1937 Constitution, Deputy de Valera, the Taoiseach, believed in it.  What harm has it done since?  Could not money be put to better advantage today? The farmers have experienced one of the worst years in living memory.  Business people are complaining. They are doing nothing in the towns or villages.  Unemployment and emigration are rampant.  Would it not be better to do something for the economy of the country?  We are asked to abolish a system that has worked well for almost 40 years and to substitute a system by which a Party getting 40 per cent. of the votes may get 80 per cent. of the seats.  P.R. is the fairest electoral system there can be.  There can be no possibility of gerrymandering. The people can choose the public representatives they want, and it protects them from the intolerant and dictatorial attitude of a single Party Government with an inflated artificial majority.</P>
    <P>I was charmed at the speeches of the professors and independent men.  I would agree with Senator Professor Quinlan and, even at this very late hour, I would appeal to the Taoiseach to withdraw this Bill.  If he did so he would be doing a good job for the people and for the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonKissane" hpid="Éamon Ó Ciosáin Éamon Ó Ciosáin">
      <NameTxt>Éamon Ó Ciosáin</NameTxt>
      <P>So much has been said on this section already that I do not propose to make a long speech on it at this juncture.  There have been several contributions from Senator Professor Quinlan, and he seems to resent the idea that we have not paid more attention to the advice that has been given to us by the six university professors who are members of this House.  It is right and proper to attach due weight to the opinions expressed by these members because of their education and training, but at the same time other members of the House have <Col N="1254" /> as much experience, and probably more, of the working and the results of elections in this country over a number of years.  We have had practical experience, indeed.</P>
      <P>The Senator drew an analogy between the system of election that is in operation in the six north-eastern counties and what it is proposed to have here.  Everybody knows, of course, that that is not a valid analogy. The system in the Six Counties is based on sectarian considerations which have no place in the life of this part of the country.  We ought to be thankful for that, and I hope that it will always be so and that there will never be, as far as the political and public life of the country is concerned, any distinction between one religious section and another.  We are all Irishmen and should all be proud to call ourselves Irishmen whatever denomination we belong to, and we should work for the country accordingly.  Therefore, as I said, it is entirely wrong to refer in this way to the electoral system in operation in the Six Counties.  First of all, we were told that we were adopting the British system.  Now it appears that Senators have jumped from that to the Six Counties to try to make their case stronger, as they think; but throughout the debate we have heard very little about the system in operation in the United States of America and the system in operation in Canada, because it is the self-same system.  It is the same electoral principle that they have in those countries and, under that system, the true principles of democracy have been upheld.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One would think from the way the members of the Opposition Parties in the Dáil and Seanad have been opposing this Bill that they have a vested interest in the P.R. system of election.  One would imagine by the tenacity with which they have clung to the system that it had been kind to them over the years.  It has been nothing of the kind.  It has been very unkind to the Opposition Parties who are now trying to persuade the people that they should continue it, and the reason, I suggest, that the system has been unkind to these Opposition Parties is that these Parties have been <Col N="1255" /> unkind to themselves and to their followers.  It is a well-known fact that when candidates are presented for election by certain Parties it is expected that, when they are elected, they will represent the views and ideas of the people who elected them, and retain their independence in their representation of their followers.  That has not been the case on the part of some of these Opposition Parties, because it seems that in order to keep Fianna Fáil out of office they were prepared to throw away their independence.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael did that, and they gained nothing by it.  They threw away their independence to get the support of the smaller Parties in the Dáil to form a Government, and they firmly believed that their supporters in the country did not want them to do that, that they wanted them to stand on their own feet.  As I have said, because they did not retain their independence as a political Party they did not gain anything by the change over.  As for the other Parties, they have definitely suffered as a result of throwing away their independence as political parliamentary units.</P>
    <P>As has been pointed out in this House already, since 1948 the Fine Gael Party have not improved their position, but the position of the Labour Party has disimproved considerably. In 1948 they had 19 Deputies in the Dáil and now they have only 11.  Similarly, Clann na Talmhan had seven seats in Dáil Éireann, plus one Independent Farmer, and now they have three. Clann na Poblachta had ten in 1948 and now they have one.  Let it be noted also that the Independents in the Dáil have gained seats; they had 11 in 1948 as against 16 now.</P>
    <P>All that goes to show that it is better, in the long run, for political Parties to retain their independence as Parties, to work for the future, lay down a policy for themselves and stick to it.  It is that more than anything else that has been responsible for the success of Fianna Fáil down through the years.  The system of P.R., of which the Parties opposite are the <Col N="1256" /> great champions now, has not worked too well for them due to the fact that they gave the impression as time went on that they had no definite policy. That, in present day political life, will not be accepted by the people.  The people require leadership.  They require to be presented with a constructive policy, not a negative policy, by the Parties who go before them for election. The time is gone when the adoption of fancy names and political catch-cries would capture their imagination. Even the change of a name from Cumann na nGaedheal to Fine Gael would not do.</P>
    <P>What is required from political Parties is a sound constructive policy based on the long-term welfare of the community, a policy that will have regard to the overall national interest and in which all sections of the people are likely to have confidence.  If these conditions were not fulfilled it would not matter to the Parties concerned what electoral system would be in operation here, whether it would be one of the many kinds of P.R. or the single, non-transferable vote system.  The reason why we are advising the people to change over from the P.R. system of election to that of the straight vote is that we believe that that is likely to give them more effective Government and pave the way towards a sound, constructive policy for the future.</P>
    <P>Some of the Senators opposite, especially Senator Professor Quinlan, gave the impression that they attached very little importance to the examples we gave of how P.R. militated against the welfare of certain European countries.  We have given those examples already and I do not wish to delay the House by repeating them. However, I want to emphasise that what has happened in the France, Germany and Italy has certainly a relationship to P.R.  Were it not for the fact that they had P.R. in those countries the undesirable events that occurred would probably never have happened.  P.R. paved the way towards the unsettled conditions that crept into those countries and for the confusions attendant on those unsettled conditions so that in the end the people did not know where they were as regards <Col N="1257" /> leadership.  They had Governments composed of a multiplicity of Parties, and that played so much havoc with their political and economic life that the people were prepared to clutch at anything so as to have the situation clarified.  It was because of that that dictatorships sprang up; otherwise those dictatorships would not have appeared at all on the political horizon.</P>
    <P>These, of course, are larger countries than our own and it may be argued that the conditions in those countries would not be exactly parallel to those in Ireland.  But, at the same time, it is true to say that human nature is much the same whether you are dealing with a large country or a small country.</P>
    <P>If Senators want examples of small countries on the Continent of Europe that also have suffered as a result of P.R., they can be given.  There are the examples of Finland and Iceland which had a system of P.R. and where, when the respective Governments were confronted with a crisis, they failed.  That is inherent in the P.R. system of election.  It gives rise to coalition Government or a multiplicity of Parties and there is an inherent weakness in that type of Government.  When it is presented with a crisis, it fails.  That is the very time that the Government should be able to stand, overcome the crisis and give the people the leadership to which they are entitled.</P>
    <P>One thing certainly emerges from the debates in the Dáil and Seanad. It is that the political Parties opposed to Fianna Fáil at present, including Fine Gael, seem to have no confidence in their future.  They have taken up a defeatist attitude on this measure. There is nothing as bad as that.  I do not know why they have given way to such defeatism and pessimism.  After all, if the Irish electorate change the system of voting, the new system&mdash;the majority system as it is called&mdash;will give these Parties the same opportunities as any other Party.  They will have the same opportunity of achieving success because they will be operating under the same electoral conditions.  It is like people who take part in a race. If the same conditions obtain for everybody, then everybody must be <Col N="1258" /> presumed to have the same chance of success.  But it is the person who is trained, determined to win, and who has confidence in himself, who is likely to win.  The same applies in the case of political Parties.</P>
    <P>There are three requisites for the success of political Parties.  First, they must have good leadership; secondly, they must have a good, sound, constructive policy; and, thirdly, they must believe in the effectiveness of that policy.  If members of the Opposition Parties took these things to heart, if they adopted these principles, which are necessary for progress, they could have a future too under the system we are proposing to substitute for P.R. here.</P>
    <P>The all-important question is: why are we advising the Irish people to do away with P.R.?  I have already given many of the reasons.  The all-important one is that under the straight vote you are likely at all times to have settled conditions in the country.  I make use of the term &ldquo;settled conditions&rdquo; because when I mentioned another word before, some of the members opposite seemed to take a dislike to it.  If you have not settled conditions in the country, there is no chance of making progress with the solution of the many problems that will confront the people from time to time.</P>
    <P>I have given reasons before why I believe the single seat constituency is preferable to the three seat constituency, the five seat constituency or any other.  One reason is that the T.D. who will be elected for that constituency will be able to concentrate his efforts more effectively in doing the things he will be expected to do for the people of the constituency. He will have less territory to cover and he will be better able to become an fait with the problems of his constituency.  Indeed, it is a well-known fact that when a T.D. is elected, he realises that he is not a T.D. for his own Party alone but is a T.D. for all sections of the people of his constituency.  When it is a case of one T.D. representing a constituency, he will have a stronger realisation of <Col N="1259" /> that.  He will be the T.D. for all the Parties.</P>

      <P>Yes, that is the idea.  If anybody else can come along and put his case before the people so well that he is able, to oust this T.D., there is nothing to prevent him doing so under the system of free elections we have here.</P>

      <P>There could be several under the new system.  All we want to make sure of is that there will always be a Party&mdash;if not one Party, at least a combination of two &mdash;that will be able to carry on the Government of the country effectively. What we are trying to safeguard against is a Government of splinter Parties, where the members of that Government speak with different voices and where all sense of the collective responsibility of Government will be relegated to the background and made subservient to Party wishes. That is one of the major weaknesses in a Coalition Government, and the more Parties there are in it, the worse it is.</P>
      <P>One would also imagine from listening to the speeches of the Opposition members that the system of P.R. had its roots in the traditions of this country.  Nothing, of course, could be further from the truth and it has no such thing.  P.R. does not belong to this country and, in point of fact, the 1918 election was fought under the other system and so were the succeeding elections.  The First Dáil was elected under the single non-transferable vote system.  There is no doubt about that.  So, when Senators opposite try to create the impression that the P.R. system of election is tied up with our traditions, they are on the wrong ground.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I made my first contribution to the debate on this Bill I mentioned that this whole position was examined by a Royal Commission in Britain in the early years of the century.  No doubt, the members of that commission <Col N="1260" /> examined the electoral systems all over the world and after their deliberations they were very careful that they made no changes themselves.  They were very careful that they did not adopt the P.R. system themselves but they did not mind lending the system to this country.  I shall not mention what their motives were because they have already been referred to on former occasions.  It should be remembered, however, and it should be brought home to the people, that the system that operates here at present is not our own but a system that has been lent to us by the British and a system which they themselves were careful not to adopt.</P>

      <P>I have used the word &ldquo;lend&rdquo; intentionally because I think that is the attitude that the people will take up in regard to this measure when they get an opportunity of voting on it.  They will be made well aware, in fact they are well aware already, that the system is not theirs and that anybody who tries to persuade them to the contrary is not on firm ground.</P>
      <P>Níl a fhios agam cad é fáth an ruaille buaille go léir mar gheall ar an mBille seo.  Níl á dhéanamh againn ach caoi a thabhairt do na daoine breith a dhéanamh ar cad é an módh toghcháin is fearr leo, cad é an gléas toghcháin is dóigh leo a bheidh oiriúnach dóibh féin san aimsir atá le teacht.</P>

Tá sé buailte isteach inár n-aigne gur cheart dóibh an ionadaíocht chionúire a chur ar ceal agus an ionadaíocht chruinn ar an bhóta singil neamh-aistrithe a chur ina háit.  Is é an fáth atá againn leis an dtuairim sin ná go bhfuil buailte <Col N="1261" /> isteach inár n-aigne go bhfuil baol ann gur droch-thoradh a thiocfadh as an ionadaíocht chionúire le himeacht aimsire, go mbeadh an iomad dreamanna polaitíochta ann agus go mbeadh Rialtas lag ann dá réir sin.</P>

Tá a fhios againn go léir cad a thuit amach i dtíortha áirithe ar Roinn na hEorpa de dheascaibh na hionadaíochta chionúire. Ní toradh fónta a tháinig aisti.

Dá mba é a mhalairt a bheadh ann ní bheadh aon rath ar an dtir.  Ní fhéadfadh aon dul chun cinn a bheith ann nuair ná féadfadh na daoine, lucht gnótha agus uile, féachaint rómpu.</P>

    <P>Tá cainteoirí anso ag iarraidh a chur ina luí orainn gur tábhachtaí an Dáil ná Rialtas.  Ní thagaimse leo sa mhéid sin agus ní thiocfainn leo go deo. Tuigim go maith gur tábhachtach an rud é Dáil mhaith a bheith ann tar éis toghcháin ach dá mba Dáil mhaith í gan Rialtas bheith taobh thiár dí dob olc an mhaise againn é.  Obair in aisce ab ea é Dáil a bheith ann in aon chor gan Rialtas seasmhach a bheith ann chomh maith, Rialtas go mbeidh fios a bheartais ag na daoine roimh ré.  Ní hé sin an saghas Rialtais a thiocfadh de dheascaibh an teacht le chéile a dhéanfadh dreamanna éagsúla polaitíochta <Col N="1262" /> ta éis toghcháin, dreamanna ná beadh fios fátha a scéil ag na daoine roimh ré.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of all the time being devoted to this measure one would think it was related to some political situation which started overnight. That is how my friends on the other side of the House seem to regard it.  I have examined how the people living along the seaboard counties regard this matter and the single seat constituency problem.  Here and there, say, from Kerry to Donegal, I have discovered that at least 95 per cent. of the Deputies are Fianna Fáil, and equally so with the rest of the country.</P>
      <P>I do not believe this Bill will be passed by the Oireachtas.  We have had the P.R. system of election for the past 40 years and nobody had anything to say against it until the present time. Was it P.R. that was the cause of the civil war, of the economic war, of emigration and others of our ills?  If so, why did the Taoiseach not condemn it long ago?  I have a cutting here from the <i>Irish Independent</i> of 7th instant, which reads as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P Just="Center">&ldquo;THEIR MASTER'S VOICE</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As we have already shown by extracts from the Fianna Fáil speeches, the purpose of the abolition of P.R. is to get rid of all opposition in the Dáil.  We repeat&mdash;all opposition.  It is not merely to wipe out the smaller Parties&mdash;as has been candidly admitted by the Government spokesmen&mdash;but also to get rid of the chief Opposition Party.  As one Minister admitted, the intention is to ensure that Fine Gael also will have had it'.  Let there be no misunderstanding about it: the purpose is to wipe out all parliamentary opposition and to create the position in which there will be no parliamentary opposition. This is, in plain language, the creation of the totalitarian State.  It <Col N="1263" /> is the antithesis of democracy.</P>
    <P>It goes very much further.  It is not merely one Party Government, but one man Government.  It is a notorious and incontrovertible fact that only one politician in the State, Mr. de Valera, has ever, until last year, said a word against the system of P.R.  It is true that even he highly praised the system when he was advocating its introduction into his Constitution in 1937.  After that he changed his mind.  Of late he purports to have discovered its iniquities.</P>
    <P>How complete is the dominance of Mr. de Valera over his own Party is clear from the attitude of his parliamentary followers.  Every one of them has suddenly discovered a dozen reasons why P.R. should at once be abandoned.  They never discovered those reasons before.  We invite their constituents to ask them the day and date on which they previously drew attention publicly to the iniquities of the system.  The truth is that they had not a word to say against it&mdash;until it suited their master's political designs to denounce it.  Now they are just reechoing their master's voice.  The slave mind has taken a new meaning in Ireland.  What Mr. de Valera says to-day all his followers must say tomorrow; even if it contradicts what they said yesterday.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If this Bill goes through then, as surely as night follows day and day follows night, it will lead to circumstances similar to those we had in 1922 &mdash;another civil war.  It will place the country in chaos, so we had better look out.  We should bear in mind what lies ahead of us as a result of the enactment of this Bill.  You may succeed in keeping down small Parties for five or ten years.  They may have to go underground and revert to other means in order to make their voices heard and that could easily create a very serious and dangerous situation. The Taoiseach should give this Bill further thought before going to the country.  The people did not ask for this Bill or for the proposed new system of election and at least 75 per <Col N="1264" /> cent. of the voters do not understand its implications.</P>
    <P>I know the people up and down the country.  The voting system is not fully explained to them.  It will be a long time before they will understand the real meaning of the change in our system of election which it is intended to bring about through the enactment of this Bill.  The Taoiseach should examine his conscience before creating a dictatorship under the cloak of democracy because, in my view, that is what will happen.  The whole trouble is that, before the Taoiseach goes to the Park, he wants to impart his blessing on us by abolishing the P.R. electoral system and by demoralising politically all small Parties.</P>
    <P>It might be a very good idea to set up a commission to inquire into our electoral system and to have the assistance of some distinguished foreign experts, as Senator Quinlan suggested.  If there are men in this country suitable for such a commission some people might feel that they could not be trusted by reason of their being too politically-minded.  Therefore, many people consider that it would be better to get experts from abroad, such as those whom we have heard about, to study our problem. However, I am afraid it cannot be done.</P>
    <P>I am firmly convinced that, before this Bill is rushed through the Oireachtas and the country, the people should be made fully aware of all the implications of the proposed change in our electoral system.  They should be given time to think about the matter and digest it fully.  Our Constitution is one of the things each and every one of us holds most sacred.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;P.R.&rdquo; stands for proportional representation. &ldquo;P.R.&rdquo; also has another meaning&mdash;political racket by Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>So much has been said during the course of this debate by Senator Quinlan that I wish to refer for a few minutes to some of the statements made by that learned gentleman. Before he got on to the criticism of this Bill he took great care to explain to the House that he is not a member <Col N="1265" /> of any political Party&mdash;that he criticises Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael, Labour, and so on, whenever he considers it necessary to do so but that he is a re-representative of a university and that, as such, he sets himself up above politics, if you like.  I have heard people make such statements.  If there is any section of people in this country whom I despise it is those people who have neither the courage nor the conviction to say openly and honestly that they belong to a particular Party or to a particular way of thinking.  I do not care what their way of thinking may be.  I do not care whether it be Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael, Labour, or anything else.</P>
      <P>There is that small section in this country who try to pretend they are too good, in fact; that they know too much to be attached to any political organisation and that they are above all political organisations.  Thank God, there are not too many such people and it is a good job.  If they were in other countries, which I will not name, their rights and liberty would be interfered with by the State.  I do not wish to go too far but there is one thing which always amuses me about this type of people.  If there was any job of a monetary value given away by a Government or a Party you would see how quickly they would be attached to that Party then or be attached to two Parties if it suited them.</P>
      <P>In connection with the Bill before the House he made a most convincing statement.  It is the only convincing part of his speech.  It was that he held the principles of the Opposition to the last inch.  He quoted every chapter and verse that was ever quoted and went back 40 years for some of them.  In fact, the leading article in the <i>Sunday Independent</i> before an election would cover all he said and all the points he made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I heard him state in the House what the result in any constituency would be after the next general election. In fact, he set himself up as a fortune teller.  The man who would attempt, three years before an election is due to be held, to give the result of it very definitely should be with Old Moore.  That is the place <Col N="1266" /> where his information would be of benefit.  I did not believe that anybody in this House would be so silly as to attempt to guess what the people will do three years hence.  If this Bill goes &mdash;and it will go&mdash;to the people and they accept the principles contained in it, the people will have an opportunity in three years' time of making an honest and silent decision and one which will not be influenced by any particular Party.  Every Party will get a fair hearing and the people will make a fair decision.</P>
    <P>When speaking on this Bill before I said I believed that no matter what system you put into operation so long as it is administered fairly to every candidate and every Party in the election the people will make their choice and nothing can prevent them from doing it.  No matter what system you have the people will get the candidate they want.  There is no doubt about that.  It can be said that in the last general election out of 146 members of the Dáil 134 of them were those who got the highest number of votes in each constituency.  Nine-tenths of the whole Dáil was elected, one might say, on first preference votes.</P>

      <P>I have offered most of the criticism I want to make.  There was one thing which I resented more than anything else and that was Senator Quinlan's reference to the ageing leadership of the present Government and his suggestion that that was the cause of many of our ills.  I should like to remind Senator Quinlan that when he has travelled as long a road and as honourable a path as the Leader of our Party has he will have more grey hairs in his head and if he is able to stand up in the same way as the Leader of our Party can to-day, I will give him more credit than I would give him at the present time.</P>

      <P>The speech made by Senator Kissane reminded me of something I want to say.  The last speaker repeated what has now become monotonous in this debate and that is attacks on Senator Quinlan.  He is being attacked now because of his independence.  It would be an interesting thing to read to-morrow, if it is printed.  Deputy Russell and Deputy Sheldon got front page reports of their speeches on this Bill in the other House and what they said in those speeches was referred to many times afterwards in speeches in the Dáil and in this chamber.  I assume that Senator Hogan's idea of an Independent is an Independent who does not criticise Fianna Fáil.  He is not an objective Independent if he does criticise them.  If he is not opposed to Fianna Fáil, his independence would be of a better quality.</P>

      <P>On a point of explanation. For the benefit of the Senator I never mentioned the word &ldquo;Independent&rdquo;. As far as I remember, I did not refer to Senator Quinlan as an Independent Senator.  I do not believe he is and I did not refer to him as such.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TonyBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to make a speech of that kind.  I merely stood up because of the speech made by my friend, Senator Kissane.  He has gone beyond this fetish of stability about which we have been hearing so much. It is a fetish, of course.  He used the phrase that we would have settled conditions.  We have settled conditions in Glasnevin.  Surely, fermentation and disputation are much more flexible and fruitful things for a Parliament to have.  Anything which is done to cut out that disputation will lead to stagnation.  We should get away from that kind of thinking.  We should not be afraid of having argument in the Parliament House.  We should keep our Parliament alive but, above all, we should try to keep the Parties alive. This idea will not do it.</P>
      <P>Many Fianna Fáil Deputies and Senators are somewhat unhappy about this legislation but I also think they are becoming very docile.  The present system is an insurance against excess and excess is bound to produce the stagnation I mean both in Parliament and inside the Parties.  The present system gives promise of proper discussion.  That is desirable.  Above all, it gives the assurance of gross control by the people and we should keep it.</P>
      <P>If I want to say anything else, I want to say this to Senator Kissane: He should not worry about Fine Gael or the Labour Party.  We will look after ourselves.  He should not worry about them.  He would possibly concede to us that we might be opposing the proposed system because we think it is bad.  He would possibly concede that we could possibly be thinking along these lines.  Even if we have done badly under P.R. and if we still think it is a bad thing to change it, we would be bad public representatives if we did not make that kind of case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are two extracts I should like to read to the House from Frank <Col N="1269" /> Gallagher's book, <i>The Indivisible Island.</i>  He referred to the passage through the Northern Ireland Parliament of similar legislation.  He wrote:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;When the Bill was going through Stormont in March and April, 1929, W. McMullan (Labour) said P.R. was abolished to deprive Labour of seats in Belfast. T. Henderson (Independent Unionist) said the Government had called for an Opposition and when they got it they gerrymandered and abolished P.R. to drive them out.  Sam Kyle and J. Beattie (Labour) instanced the unfairness of the Bill to working class candidates who would no longer have even the meagre representation they had secured under P.R.  T.W. Gyle (Independent Unionist) protested against the Bill, which, he said, destroyed the only real safeguard for minorities.&rdquo;</P>

This is the second time I have intervened in this debate, and I want to assure the Government and the Minister now present that this debate is only starting, because when this Bill leaves this House we will go to work in the country, and I promise Fianna Fáil that the Taoiseach was quite right when he said at the Fianna Fáil Árd-Fheis that they would have to take off their coats because it was going to be a very hard struggle to get it through. We will see to that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeOBrien" hpid="Professor O'Brien Professor O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make one short point only.  I made it before on the Second Reading and I do not believe that the Government have given a satisfactory reply.  The Taoiseach was asked specifically by <Col N="1270" /> Senator Barry at the end of his speech to address himself to the question of the transferable vote, assuming single member constituencies.  I say with all due respect that I thought the Taoiseach's reply was singularly unconvincing. He said that it was one of those things that looked all right on paper but would not work out in practice. A very large number of people in England to-day are in favour of altering their electoral system and having the single transferable vote in single member constituencies.  The reason is that the present system of election in England, which we are being asked to adopt, does allow a minority to get the Government&mdash;a minority of votes to return a Party that can form the Government&mdash;and that means that the wishes of the people are not reflected in Parliament and also that a very large number of votes go to waste.  It is a quite conceivable situation in any English constituency at a by-election or at the coming general election, and it has been drawing a good deal of attention in English papers to-day and causing a good deal of dissatisfaction in large circles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We ought to consider the possibility of a similar situation here when, if we do, we have the single member constituency with the non-transferable vote.  Let us assume that there is a constituency with, for simplicity, 100 votes, that Labour polls 40, the Conservative Party 35, and the Liberals 25.  In England to-day, and under the system we are being asked to adopt, the Labour candidate would be returned. It looks on the face of it as though he represents a minority in the constituency, but that could be tested out by the Liberal vote being distributed amongst the Labour and Conservative Parties.  This may be purely a matter of speculation.  I would have thought that people in England going to vote Labour would vote Labour on the first preference and therefore if the Liberal vote was transferred the majority of the Liberal votes would go to the Conservative practically in every case.  This would mean that the Conservative would be returned with possibly 50 or 60 per cent. of the votes in the constituency.  It does seem to me that that is a very desirable improvement <Col N="1271" /> on the non-transferable vote.  Of course, I know the answer is that all the Parties could make pre-election pacts, but that is asking a large Party to eliminate itself and its own future.</P>
    <P>I was greatly impressed by Senator Mullins's speech on the history of the rise of the Labour Party in England, the way in which Labour was able in single member constituencies by perseverance through 50 years to rise from a Party of no importance to being a Party with a majority in the House of Commons.  If the Labour Party had been taking the advice being offered now in this House, instead of standing against the Liberals and others in the early part of the century, it would have made pre-election pacts.  That is asking a great Party with a great future to eliminate itself, and it does not seem to me to be the answer.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister for External Affairs or the Taoiseach or whoever is replying to this debate to attempt to justify the non-transferable vote in the single member constituency as compared with the single transferable vote.  There is a very considerable body of informed opinion in England at the present moment who believe that it would be a desirable change in the English parliamentary system, and if desirable there I would like to know why it is not desirable here.</P>

      <P>I intervene in this debate again for the purpose of correcting some distortions of history which if allowed to go unchallenged may be the instrument by which people who do not know the story of what happened at the time may be misled further than they have been misled.  Senator Professor Hayes speaking here on March 5th referred in column 1064, Volume 50 of the Official Report to the arguments adduced from this side about the grave danger of Coalition's, and he said: &ldquo;The Minister's leader and the Minister himself were in favour of a Coalition in 1922, but they were beaten by some small Parties.&rdquo; Senator Professor Hayes knows very well that the Coalition of 1922 had <Col N="1272" /> no relation whatsoever to the type of Coalition Government which almost wrecked this country in its two periods of office in the last ten years.  Senator Professor Hayes should know better than most other members here that the Coalition which was arranged in 1922 was arranged between the two wings of the Sinn Féin Party for the purpose of preserving peace and order in the country and for the purpose of allowing the country to settle down so that the big issue of the Treaty at that time could be considered in a calm and peaceful atmosphere at the right moment.  Senator Professor Hayes knows also that that Coalition was arrived at by agreement between General Collins and the present Taoiseach, Éamon de Valera, that it was ratified by Dáil Éireann, which was the Government of the Republic at the time, that it was ratified unanimously by the Árd-Fheis of Sinn Féin, which had within it delegates who supported and who opposed the Treaty settlement.  He should not attempt to make the comparison which he made, nor attempt to insinuate that that Coalition had in any way any relation to the Coalitions which we had experience of here in recent years.</P>
      <P>I would like, also, for the purposes of the record, to make it quite clear that the further statement of Senator Professor Hayes on this same occasion that: &ldquo;They thought they would smash the Treaty in 1922 by a Coalition but it did not work out that way&rdquo; is without any truth whatever. There is no truth whatever in that statement because the Coalition was, by the unanimous decree of Dáil Éireann, the Government of the Republic, and there was no question whatsoever of anybody trying to smash anything.  Senator Hayes also knows that the Coalition was not beaten by some small Parties.  He knows how and why it was beaten, why it never came into operation and what happened subsequently.  If we are to have a continuance of this one-sided distortion of history&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Senator Murphy in his speech here the other night adduced, as a point in favour of the propaganda that Fianna Fáil in a straight vote election would get the majority of the seats, the argument that if Fianna Fáil could get together all the anti-Treaty supporters which it had since 1922 it would gain such a majority.  He based his theory on the fact that the people who were against the Treaty in 1922 were still against it.  Many of the people who were for it possibly had changed&mdash;&mdash;</P>

In 1923 the vote was 288,062, an increase of 150,000 in a year.  In 1927 thousands and thousands of people who had opposed what we stood for came to the conclusion that we were right and 350,277 voted for the Fianna Fáil Party in June of that year.  Two months later many more people were convinced and 411,833 voted for the Fianna Fáil candidates and, by 1932, 537,963 people had come to the conclusion that we were right.</P>

      <P>At column 1093 of the same Volume, Senator Murphy, having painted a doleful picture of the complete elimination of any Labour representatives in the Dáil as a consequence of the straight vote electoral victory of Fianna Fáil, asked:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;What will be the reaction of the organised trade union movement which at the moment has a political arm?&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my Second Reading speech I recommended something for the consideration of Senator Murphy and those who talk like him.  It was that if the Labour Party ever had any serious intention of being anything but the tail <Col N="1276" /> end of one of the big Parties, they should not be hanging around the banqueting table for the crumbs that fall. They should provide the necessary number of candidates to form an alternative Government, go out like men and look for a majority.  I repeat that advice to Senator Murphy and to those who speak like him.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>They think it is gratuitous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasMullins" hpid="Tomás Ó Maoláin Tomás Ó Maoláin">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Ó Maoláin</NameTxt>
      <P>I also mentioned in the course of that speech that Deputy Larkin had given the answer to that question but apparently Senator Murphy, who is treasurer of the united trade union movement now, was not aware that Deputy Larkin had given such an answer and settled all doubts as to the future political attitude of the movement for which he spoke.  The future political attitude, as described by Deputy Larkin, was that the trade union movement, now reunited, and representing a solid body of 500,000 workers, would not be content any longer to look for the crumbs from the tables of the big Parties.  It would go out as a political movement, not on the lines of the United States Labour Party, which backs one or other of the big Parties, but on the lines of the British Labour Party&mdash;the history of whose success I gave here&mdash;and that it would seek to take its place in, the political life of this country in accordance with the strength to which that prestige entitled it.</P>
      <P>Senator Murphy need have no fear that the Labour Party will be compelled to use political strike weapons or to go underground, as he suggested. There is the same opportunity for the Labour Party in political action as there is for Fine Gael, Fianna Fáil or any other Party, if they have any confidence in themselves, if they have any policy, or if they really mean business. I commend the attitude of the trade union leaders to Senator Murphy and those who think like him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to refer again to the statement of Senator Stanford, as reported at column 1037 of the Seanad Debates of March 5th.  Senator Stanford returned to his original proposition that under the straight vote <Col N="1277" /> system it would be almost impossible for members of the religious minority, if they wished to elect their own members by themselves, to voice their opinions in the Dáil.  I should like to reiterate my own view of that position. It is that there should be no need whatever for anybody even to consider that such action is necessary on the part of any religious minority here. The time has surely come, after almost 40 years of self-government and with a new generation, of young Protestants growing up, when they should take their full place in the political Parties and in the economic life of the country, when they should stand on their feet as Irish citizens and stop using the religious denominational terms we have heard during this debate.</P>
    <P>Misfortune has come to this country many times through sectarianism used in certain critical moments to upset national endeavour and progress.  The history of the treatment of religious minorities here during all those centuries has been such as would inspire sufficient confidence in Professor Stanford and those for whom he speaks to warrant acceptance of the view I put forward that the time has come when there should be no more talk of the political representation of religious minorities.  As to the reference the Senator made to my remarks about paper guarantees, I should like to tell him that unless the paper guarantees are backed by the outlook, the conscience and the sense of fair play of the general mass of the people, then it is very easy to circumvent any constitutional guarantees or any laws.</P>
    <P>The experience here of one member of the smallest religious minority in this country&mdash;the minority whose people in every country in Europe, except Ireland, have at some time or other been persecuted&mdash;should be a shining light to the members of every other faith to go forward into political life under political banners.  I refer to the small Jewish community here, one of whose members was elected to Dáil Éireann 32 years ago and who has been elected in 14 general elections since.  He is elected not as a member of a religious minority but as a member of a political Party standing in a constituency in which the <Col N="1278" /> members of his faith have little or no effect on the outcome of the vote.  If that attitude were generally adopted, it would make things much more pleasant and better for everybody concerned.</P>
    <P>I hesitate to deal with Senator Quinlan at length, in view of his thin-skinned attitude to any criticism and the squeamish way in which he described anybody who attempted to correct his misstatements or, on occasion, his lack of knowledge.  But I feel I must draw attention to his statement here to-day that abuse and catch-cries were heaped on the Independent members because they attempted to do their duty.  Nobody heaped abuse or catch-cries on the Independent members because they attempted to do their duty.  If Senator Quinlan received tit for tat in repartee, he gave as good as he got. He should learn that in politics it is good business to take a wallop, stand up to it and give one back.</P>
    <P>I might also say that as far as the reference to science goes, Senator Quinlan may be a scientist&mdash;I have no doubt that he is&mdash;but that does not mean he is the most valuable person in the world to come in here and talk political science to men whose business it has been for 25 or 30 years to deal with political problems every day of the week.  There is a difference between a scientist as we know him and a political scientist.  I would recommend to Senator Quinlan that when men of long experience of Government here, of running political Parties and of dealing with everyday affairs, say something that appears to him not to be in accordance with his strictly scientific outlook, there may be other reasons which even he, with his scientific qualifications, has failed to understand.  He should give to them a little credit for having even a little of the intelligence he claims for himself.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinlan spoke of the desirability of having a Labour Party grow up in the Six Counties.  He seems to think that if a Labour Party grew up there, it would be the ultimate solution of everything.  A Labour Party has grown up in the Six Counties, but, like everything else there, it is a peculiar <Col N="1279" /> type of Labour Party.  In case Senator Quinlan has any hope in its programme, I should like to read for him the first item in the programme of this Labour Party, which, mark you, is the type of Party to which he referred&mdash;a Unionist Labour Party.  Here is paragraph 1 of its Constitution:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We reaffirm our unshakable support for the link with Britain. Northern Ireland Labour will seek at all times to preserve and strengthen that link.  Those who vote for the Ulster Labour candidates in the elections will be supporting candidates pledged to the permanent maintenance of the union with Britain.  This is our pledge and we give it without qualification.&rdquo;</P>

According to Senator Quinlan also, it was debasing public life to make pre-elections bargains but he seems to think post-election arrangements, or as the Leader of the Labour Party in the Dáil called them, deals&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Quinlan should think a little more carefully and I recommend to him that in thinking he should <Col N="1281" /> realise that the people of this part of Ireland have had experience of the post-election bargaining which went on in 1948 and that they are not likely to approve of that type of public conduct again.</P>

I should like to give him a quotation from the leading article of the <i>Irish Independent</i> of Friday, March 8th, 1957, on the result of the election here:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;. . . while Fianna Fáil won much more than half the total number of seats it achieved this on considerably less than half the number of first preferences.

      <P>How can he allege that there is any attempt to foster dictatorship when even the Fine Gael Presidential candidate has stated that he does not believe for one moment all the &ldquo;bunkum&rdquo; spoken on that subject by some very learned Senators here?  I do not think that the people will be deceived.  All this welter of hostility to the proposal in this Bill is on a line with the hostility organised and engendered against the Constitution in 1937.  The Constitution was passed in spite of the campaign, and it is now accepted by all our citizens.  This Bill also will result <Col N="1282" /> in a referendum by the people, which, in my belief, will be approved by the people, and perhaps in ten or 15 years' time if Senator Quinlan is still in the Seanad and has become, by that time, an elder statesman, he will be justifying what happened this year in the same way as many ex-opponents of the Constitution are now defending it to the death.</P>

      <P>I suppose it is not safe for me to say that I only want to say a few words.  As a preliminary to the few remarks I wish to make I should like to protest&mdash;and it is not because I am necessarily personally interested in the matter&mdash;against the line which Senator Hogan took this evening in a certain part of his speech. I noticed afterwards that Senator Ó Maoláin said that Senator Quinlan was deprecating that the Fianna Fáil side had heaped abuse on him.  I really thought that some remarks made by Senator Hogan were not just abuse and I made a note of them at the time.  As I understood it, Senator Quinlan's position was that he is elected in a non-political way.  We are all in politics here.  This is a political House, and that is elementary.</P>
      <P>Senator Hogan went on to say that if people like Senator Quinlan were in certain places their rights and liberties would be interfered with by the State. What kind of mentality does that show?  I will not dilate on it.  I know the kind of mentality which it shows.  Even that, although it is a peculiar kind of statement, I would allow.  He went on to speak about jobs for which remuneration is available and about people, who say they are above politics, calling on the political Parties.  I have no more regard for such people than Senator Hogan has, but at the same time in the relation in which it was put to a speech which related entirely to an individual, I thought it was even a shade worse than heaping abuse.  Let me say this and anybody who does not like it can object&mdash;I wonder if the kind of individual Senator Hogan would like to see in this House is someone like Senator John D. Sheridan?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had a question which I wished to put to the Taoiseach but by accident <Col N="1283" /> he has not been in the House on either occasion when I spoke.  I should like to refer to the specific statement by the Taoiseach that there was poker-playing at the Government meetings.  If one wished to make an offensive kind of political point about that one could very easily do so.  It is the kind of thing that might lead to very recriminatory statements involving people who should not be involved in the matter.  It was the way the Taoiseach said it.  He said that there is poker-playing at the Government meetings.  That is not true.</P>
    <P>If the Taoiseach had said that the atmosphere at the Government meetings is such that it involves something very like a game of poker, it might be different but that was not the reference. The reference was: &ldquo;there is poker-playing at the Government meetings.&rdquo;  I think it was just a statement of the Taoiseach.  I do not think he has any evidence whatsoever of it on which to base that statement.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to one other statement by the Taoiseach which is reported in the Official Report, column 874, of 19th February, 1959.  He said that, in the election of 1948, Fianna Fáil got a majority of the votes.  I went to the trouble of taking out the result of the 1948 election.  Is it suggested that, in the circumstances in which the 1948 election was held, the Fianna Fáil Party should have remained in the office?  Here are the figures: The organised Parties got 657,100.  The Fianna Fáil Party got 554,000 votes&mdash;that is a little better than they did, actually.  The Independents got 113,000 votes.  Is it seriously suggested that, in these circumstances, the Fianna Fáil Party should have stayed in office?  The Taoiseach started off by stating specifically: We got a greater number of seats than all the Parties put together.  Then he said: We got more votes than all the organised Parties put together.  That statement is not correct.  It is just as inaccurate as the reference to poker-playing.</P>
    <P>A great deal of play has been made about the fact that this is an amendment of the Constitution which is <Col N="1284" /> being carried out in a constitutional way.  I should like to draw attention to a fact which has not been mentioned in the debate.  Certainly, not more than a passing reference has been made to it by anybody.  It is that this Constitution could have been amended by ordinary legislation for a period of some years after it was first passed and that at that time&mdash;subsequent to the election of 1938&mdash;the Fianna Fáil Party had 72 members in the Dáil out of a total of 131.  You may ask yourselves why was it not done at that time?  Do not forget that that was well before the war.  If it had been the late spring or summer of 1939 one might say there was good reason then and that the Government were concerned about other matters but, in fact, the Government Party at that time had that opportunity.  I submit that the real reason why it was not done then was that the Fianna Fáil Party thought they were safe.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to a statement by Senator Hayes made 12 years ago; to a statement by Deputy J.A. Costello made 22 years ago; to an advertisement issued by the Cumann na nGaedheal Party 32 years ago and he talked about Deputy J.A. Costello's experience going back for 37 years.  It reminded me of the song about the <i>Old Shako:</i>&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Ten, 20, 30, 40, 50 years ago,</P>
    <P>We didn't care a button if the odds were on the foe.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It all had as much relevance as the words of that song.</P>
    <P>The Minister made a good deal of play on the proposition that our concern with minorities is not such that we want tiny minorities to be represented. He suggested we would not be inclined to put down an amendment that there should be only one constituency in the country.  That was merely playacting, really.  However, I would point out something in relation to that proposition.  Article 16 (6) of the existing Constitution provides:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;No law shall be enacted whereby the number of members to be returned for any constituency shall be less than three.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Therefore, if the Government so wished or if anybody so wished, under <Col N="1285" /> the existing Constitution you could have each province as a constituency. The only other restriction is in relation to population and areas.  You could have the whole City of Dublin as one constituency.  You could have the Province of Leinster, the whole Province of Munster, and so on.</P>
    <P>What is the Minister doing when he pin-points a situation where we would not go to the extent of giving representation to a minority of 1 per cent. of the people?  He is drawing attention to the alteration the Government are, in fact, making.  They are transferring the situation in this country from a situation where each constituency could be a whole province and you could then, if you wished, give representation to any minority that was, say, 2 per cent. or 2½ per cent. of the people.  That kind of minority would get representation.  The Minister is transferring that section of the electorate into a system of election where a minority consisting of 40 per cent. of the people need get no seat at all.</P>
    <P>In essence, that is what the Minister's Party are doing in this matter. They know the situation.  With reference to Senator Hogan's remark that a person cannot forecast an election three years ahead, I think I could make a guess as to the result of the next election if the present system were in operation.  I could make this much of a guess, namely, that Fianna Fáil would be out of office after it.  I do not know if Senator Hogan would like to put me into <i>Old Moore</i> for that.</P>

      <P>You can be quite certain that, if the present system of election remains in operation in this country, Fianna Fáil will be out of office after the next election, be it near or far.  That is the one thing that is certain.  What, then, does the Bill really propose to acheive?  It was put in a nutshell: the figures for South Africa are the real thing that point the direction.  In other words, that, with 40 per cent. of the votes, you get 80 per cent. of the seats. That is the system that is attempted <Col N="1286" /> to be brought into operation in this country by this Bill.</P>
      <P>I would say, in regard to much of the criticism from the Government side of the House of the argument put up from the Opposition Benches, that some of it has been facetious and that some of it has been rather innocent, I thought, to-day.  The people who were speaking seemed to me to be taking a line of great innocence. I do not like to see people exaggerating their case.  Senator Carter, the last day, referred to the average life of a Government in this country, since 1948, as two years and seven months.  That is not correct. The average length was something over three years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCarter" hpid="Mr. Carter Mr. Carter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carter</NameTxt>
      <P>Not &ldquo;since 1948&rdquo;.  I said: &ldquo;The average life of a Government.&rdquo; I did not say &ldquo;since 1948&rdquo;, though.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I understood the Senator to say &ldquo;since 1948&rdquo;.  The point I want to make is that, if you take Governments as appointments after elections, the average length since 1948 has been just as long as previously, if you take it in that sense.  If you take it in the sense that we have had only three Prime Ministers in this country since 1922, then, of course, the Governments here are very long indeed.  The Governments prior to 1948 were, indeed, very long-lived&mdash;one of them lasted ten years and the other 16 years. These are very lengthy figures by comparison with what one finds in any other country.  The point I would like to make is that if any Government came into office with an extreme revolutionary policy it might not be able to do very much towards getting its policy going in a period of three years.  It might well be that it would require from five to seven years to do it.  If we think just of policy, on the whole there have been substantial changes in policy.  The most substantial, of course, were brought about on two occasions&mdash;in 1932 by the Government which then came in or&mdash;if you want to be technical&mdash; following the 1933 election.  When the Government had an overall majority, they made certain changes and put <Col N="1287" /> through a considerable amount of legislation if one considers the volume of legislation alone for the following year.</P>
      <P>Similarly, there was an extremely radical change of policy, not in 1948, but primarily in 1949.  Again, the Government was about a year in office before it did that.  I must say that I was surprised at the Minister referring, as he did, to the Supplementary Budget of 1947.  The Minister must be fond of cold water.  Every tax that he imposed in that Budget was taken off by the new Government when they came in.  They were able to finance an enormous expansion of the economy of this country.  The Minister must be extremely fond of cold water in bringing that in as an issue into this debate. I do not understand why he referred to the matter.</P>
      <P>I promised that I would not be very long.  Accordingly, I want to refer to a statement by one of the Fianna Fáil Senators.  He spoke about the kind of policy put by the Opposition between 1951 and 1954 and which was decided in the election of 1954.  The Fianna Fáil Senators are not codding either themselves or the people when they say that there were bargains after the election of 1954.  The people knew what they were voting for in 1954.  Anybody might make the case in connection with the 1948 election.  The Fianna Fáil Party's case at that time was that there was no alternative to them.  That was fundamentally their case.  Or, let us put it this way &mdash; that the only alternative to them was that wild man, MacBride.  In fact, it was found that there was another alternative.  I think that Mr. Seán MacBride deserved great credit for that.</P>
      <P>The situation was entirely different in 1954.  There was no question about that.  Look at the statements of the leaders of the biggest Opposition Party at that time.  Look at their statements that they intended to form another inter-Party Government, particularly that they did not have the same outlook as the Fianna Fáil Party &mdash; what we are considering at the moment &mdash; on these matters; that they were prepared to work with other people and do certain things.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1288" /> In the same connotation as the Minister's Budget of 1947, there was in the background &mdash; it is still in the background &mdash; this idea of the standstill Order on wages.  The Bill was drafted in 1947.  It is still in the background.</P>
    <P>There are certain minor injustices in the present system&mdash;the injustice, for example, that the Fianna Fáil Party get their seats a bit cheaper than the other Parties.  That is a minor injustice.  It is a very minor injustice compared with the kind of injustice which will be put into operation in relation to representation in Parliament if this Bill goes through. There is no doubt about it that in many of the western constituencies the Fianna Fáil Party will gain the great majority of the seats.  Finally, I believe that what you want to get out of elections is representation.  If you have a reasonable number of Parties and if, as in this country, when a Government finds they cannot function any longer, they have to go to the country, I do not see what objection there is to the present system.  I cannot see any fault whatever in it in that context.</P>
    <P>I know that we have people like Deputy Erskine Childers, the Minister for Lands, who spoke last year about resolute government &mdash; a phrase which was first used 50 years ago by Arthur Balfour.  I am not saying anything different from what I said already.  It is the kind of thing I said in 1954.  I believe that the powers to-day are in the hands of the central Government in every country.  Senator George O'Brien on one occasion here in a disputation with the Tánaiste, Deputy Lemass, on a personal point, said that he was for the ordinary man against the Government.  It is said that we have a tradition in this country of being against the Government.  You would want to have that tradition nowadays.</P>
    <P>The kind of powers the Government have are obvious in such things as, for example, the number of cases that go into the courts where private individuals take action against the Government.  They seldom happen now.  They used to be very frequent.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1289" /> There is one other small point I should like to make.  I am again back to this use of words.  Senator O'Reilly was guilty.  He referred on a number of occasions to Senator Hayes having accused the Fianna Fáil Party of perverting history.  I thought of the word &ldquo;pervert&rdquo; and I went to the trouble of looking up the debates.  I found that what Senator Hayes said was that Fianna Fáil had distorted history.  There is a very big difference between distorting history and perverting it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFirmullaghOReilly" hpid="Mr. O'Reilly Mr. O'Reilly">

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>That would be quite all right.  Distortion is something you see in a bad mirror.  The final point I want to make is this: In my speech on Second Reading I quoted from the book <i>Parnell and his Party.</i>  I quoted it purely in relation to what will happen when there is a Party with a small group of people dominating it. What did they do on that occasion? The quotation shows that although there was that change in the system of election and widespread use of the vote, the number of members of the Party increased from 16 to 65 or 70, but not one of the extra 50 members ever got to any office in the Party though, as we know, the Party lasted until 1918.  From 1885 to 1918 is 33 years.  Senator O'Reilly may have misunderstood my reason for quoting, but there is no point in his suggesting that I did so because I was against the late Charles Stewart Parnell or was in favour of the Bantry Band or something of that kind.  It is true that, like Senator Ted Sullivan, I was born not so far from Bantry, and one has a certain amount of local pride.  I do not think that the Bantry Band had in their conduct anything to apologise for. They represented this country well and were a fine group of men, perhaps a little bit more positive in their opinions than we are inclined to be nowadays in politics but at the same time they fought a clean fight.  Certainly I have no connection whatsoever with them except that geographical connection, which Senator Ted Sullivan also has.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Dr. O'Donovan and, earlier, Senator Barry suggested that the purpose of the Government in bringing in this measure was to give more stability to governments.  They suggested that there was quite enough stability, and that there was no necessity for more, but they agreed that the measure probably would give more stability.  Earlier speakers, however, suggested that quite the opposite would occur, that instead of having more stability we were in danger under the straight vote system of having violent swings back and forward. The danger of these violent swings was very much overemphasised, and in fact that danger does not exist.  Undoubtedly there will be swings, because if the people want a change in Government and if the wishes of the people are to be put into effect under the system of government that exists there must be a swing of one kind or another.  But, if there is not a swing, or if there is a very small swing, then there will be no real change in the Government. There will be the kind of things that happens in continental countries where six parties of the Left combine with four of the Centre to form a Government and when the change comes, it is four of the Left and six of the Centre &mdash; a kind of reshuffle of the Government, in other words, a new mixture with the same ingredients, which is not really a change, or there will be the kind of change which occurred here on a number of occasions when there was a change of Government but the new Government did not have sufficient strength to carry on effectively, and it was necessary to have a second election, or alternatively, the new Government just did not carry on effectively and lasted for two or three years, as happened in the case of both Coalition Governments.</P>

      <P>They eventually collapsed, having failed to put into operation much of the policy they wished to put into operation.  As I say, I believe there is no real danger of swings which would affect the stability of Government. That danger was very much <Col N="1291" /> overestimated.  Because we have advocated an electoral system which would give effective Government, which would give strong Government, comparisons have been made with totalitarian States.  It has been suggested that we want that kind of Government. We have been asked why we do not introduce a system which will give one Party and that that will solve all our problems.  Senators, of course, are well aware, or should be if they have studied the subject, that there is all the difference in the world between a dictatorship which intends to stay in power indefinitely, as long as it can, and a democratic Government which will and can stay in power for only five years or whatever the length of office may be.  There is all the difference in the world between the two.  There is the difference, in the first place, that if the Government is doing something which the people do not want there is a time-limit and after a certain number of years they will have to go out and the people can put in a Government which will redress the wrongs and do what the people want them to do. There is the further fact that a democratic Government which knows that it will have to face the people at the end of a number of years will act in accordance with that fact and, no matter how strong it is, will not abuse its powers because it knows that it must sooner or later face the people.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to say a few words about the question of by-elections in so far as they are affected by the electoral system which is proposed as compared with the present system. Under the existing system by-elections are quite unfair in the sense that they have no relationship to the election which took place in the particular constituencies at the previous general <Col N="1292" /> election.  In the by-election the seat goes to the candidate getting the highest vote, whereas a Party which held that seat in the previous general election may have held it with 25 per cent. of the votes and, even though they get 25 per cent. of the votes in the by-election, the seat goes to the person getting the highest vote which, naturally, in most cases will not be to the same Party.  The by-election under the present system is, therefore, quite unfair and is not a test of the people's opinion comparable with the general election.  Under the single seat system the Party which won the seat in the general election will win it in the by-election if the people wish to support them to the same extent as they supported them in the general election.  Consequently the by-election under the system proposed is very much fairer and a much more accurate reflection of the mood of the people as compared with the general election.</P>
    <P>Another point which has been raised is the fact that under the straight vote the people will not have the same choice of candidates as they have under P.R.  That must be conceded, that under the present system a voter has a choice between two or more candidates representing the same Party.  However, it must be emphasised that in 99 cases out of 100, the elector votes on questions of policy.  He votes because he wants a policy put into operation or because he wants a policy taken out of operation.  An election is not a popularity poll and the vast majority of the people will be quite satisfied provided they have a choice between candidates who represent the different points of policy put before them, and will not be unduly disturbed by the fact that they have not two, three or more candidates before them representing the same policy.  If the voter does take the view that policy is not the important thing&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Again and again we have had reference to the minorities who will be deprived of representation under the new system.  I would ask the Seanad to consider seriously who are these minorities who will be deprived of representation. It has been made plain to us that no religious group wants representation as such.  It is clear from the present composition of the Dáil and from the votes in the last election that neither Labour nor farmers want to be separately represented in the Dáil. It is clear that none of the other sections of the community, such as industry, professions, and so on, wish to be separately represented.  They are not represented in the Dáil at the moment.</P>

      <P>It is only a catch cry being used by those who oppose this legislation in the hope that the people will not look into the matter and realise that that is the position, in the hope that the people will not realise that the existing system has not, in fact, given representation to minorities. The only system which would give representation to minorities is the system, which we have already discussed here, of one constituency for the whole country.  The Opposition Parties are not willing to promote or to support that system and, of course, they are quite right because it would lead to chaos.</P>
      <P>Senator Burke said that it was the duty of Senators of the Parties generally to inform the people as to exactly what was before them, what the issues were, and as to how they should vote on this question.  I believe it is the duty of those people who are sincere about putting the matter clearly before the people to explain to them that the present system is not P.R. in the true sense of the term, that the present system does not give representation to minorities, and that those Parties who oppose the change to the straight vote are not willing to introduce the system which would give representation to minorities.  In relation to this point, I should like to quote a short passage at page 24 of Professor Hogan's book on <i>Election and Representation:</i>&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Enthusiasts for P.R. are fond of pointing to its success in Ireland and in the Scandinavian countries. Eire is often represented as furnishing a perfect demonstration of the virtue of P.R.: it has worked; it has proved compatible with the parliamentary system of government and with the formation of the stable governments upon which successful parliamentary democracy ultimately depends.  If it has not cut down parliamentary majorities <Col N="1295" /> below the margin of safey, neither has it multiplied minority groups&mdash; the consequences which are usually attributed to P.R., and which, in fact, have followed from its operation in most other countries.  These are considerations which seem, at a first glance, to constitute an unequivocal vindication of P.R.  But a reflection is enough to suggest that we should be on our guard against generalising from the experience of Eire.  What the advocates of P.R. generally choose to pass over in silence is the very considerable extent to which lack of proportionality has been responsible for the success of P.R. in Ireland.  It is no exaggeration to say that P.R. has succeeded precisely in so far as it has not been what it logically ought and claims to be, a system of proportionality. A system of representation which requires to be periodically revised in principle can hardly be described as a perfect system.  If the relative success of P.R. in Ireland is due to its approximation to a majority or plurality system, it might equally well be argued that we should return outright to the majority system of single member constituency.</P>
    <P>As to the question whether we should retain P.R. in its present form, or whether it would be well still further to curtail its proportionality, or whether the logical and sensible thing would be simply to revert to the majority or plurality system, it is clear that the decisive test in all these matters must be our actual experience of the working of P.R. during the past 24 years.</P>
    <P>One point becomes abundantly clear when the various election results are examined.  P.R. came within a hair's-breadth of precipitating a breakdown in parliamentary government on two separate occasions, first in 1927, and again in 1932.  There was a real danger of the country reverting to conditions akin to those of the civil war years, with this difference that anti-parliamentary forces were now to be found within as well as without Parliament.  The entire system of <Col N="1296" /> parliamentary democracy was presented with a challege which it was difficult to meet and overcome within the limits of the parliamentary system.  The crises of the years 1927 and 1932-1937 would certainly not have arisen with the same degree of acuteness under the majority or plurality system of election&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I submit there is no need for minority Parties as such in this country.  That has been proved by our experience over the last 30 years.  There may be a need for minority Parties in a country such as Switzerland, which has several different sections of the community, with different racial backgrounds, and so on.  It is not necessary or desirable in this country.</P>
    <P>When people talk of a minority, sometimes they may be confusing it with a group having a special object. For example, if the fishermen of the country decided they wanted to have the three-mile limit extended to 12 miles, under P.R. a group of that kind would probably form a small Party, get a few members elected, and agitate for their objects in the Dáil.  They might join a Coalition and more than likely they would end up by failing to achieve their object.  This small group would have very little to contribute to the general business of the Dáil.  They would soon outlive their usefulness, because they would either achieve their purpose or fail to do so.</P>
    <P>It is neither necessary nor desirable for such a group to form a minority Party, but that is what they probably would do under the P.R. system.  On the other hand, under the straight vote system, a group of that kind would probably realise the futility of trying to get two or three members elected for their particular object.  They would approach one of the larger Parties and offer their support to that Party in return for the adoption by them of the group's particular object.  When the Party they ask for support is returned to power as, under the straight vote system, they would be, sooner or later, they could then put the group's object into operation.</P>
    <P>I suggest that that is a far more effective way for a group of that kind <Col N="1297" /> to put their object into operation.  It is much better for them to achieve their object through one of the larger Parties than by trying to form a Party of their own.  By all means let us have representation for minorities in this country, but let us have representation for them in the larger Parties and not in small splinter Parties, which will be ineffective and of no benefit in running the affairs of the country generally.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that one of the dangers of the new system is that there might be a Government which did not have the support of the majority of the people.  It is suggested that one of the essentials of an electoral system is that it should give a Government that had the support of the majority of the people, in other words, that no Government should go into office without having the support of the majority of the people.  It is quite unrealistic to expect that more than half the people will support a particular Party or group of Parties in normal times.  They may do so occasionally when the issues are very important, but it is unrealistic to expect it in normal times; and more than that, it is a dangerous principle.  If an electoral system is adopted which insists that a Government may not go into power until it has the support of the majority of the people, then the country may very often find itself in the position that no Government can be elected and that society will break down.</P>
    <P>A recent survey has shown that during the last 25 or 30 years in the whole of Western Europe only three Governments had the support of more than 50 per cent. of the people.  In discussing the present system and the proposed system, to suggest that it should be regarded as an important factor that the new system should be capable of producing Governments having the support of more than 50 per cent. of the people is, as I have said, quite unrealistic and, in fact, a dangerous principle.</P>
    <P>When Senator Quinlan was talking in this debate last Thursday, at column 1115, Volume 50, No. 12, he <Col N="1298" /> quoted from a book called <i>The Irish Election System</i> by J.F.S. Ross, published by the Pall Mall Press, London.  He held it out to us as a book which was objective and deserving of our consideration.  He said the reputation of the author was first-class and that he was acknowledged as an expert in his sphere.  I asked Senator Quinlan on that occasion to read what was on the first page of this book, because I believed it was important and that it would indicate the partisan nature of the book.  But he was very reluctant to do so.  Consequently, in order to show the manner in which this book is being published and the financial assistance it received, I propose to read the first page:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;This book is published with financial assistance provided by the Arthur McDougall Trust.  The Arthur McDougall Trust was formed from a bequest made by the late Sir Robert McDougall, who was born in 1871 and died in 1938.... He was deeply interested in national and world politics.  He took part himself in the campaign for P.R., and only a month before he died, wrote: &lsquo;Democracy should have the fairest and most efficient means of expressing public opinion.&rsquo;  By his will he gave part of his estate to the Proportional Representation Society after the death of his wife, Lady McDougall, and requested that the fund should be known as &lsquo;The Arthur McDougall Fund&rsquo; in memory of his father.  The Proportional Representation Society decided in 1948 that the testator's memory and intentions would be best served by creating a charitable trust.  The trust in general exists to &lsquo;advance and encourage education in connection with the art or science of government or other branches of political or economic science and to encourage the study of methods of government or civic, commercial or social organisations.&rdquo;&rsquo;</P>
    <P>That is the end of the quotation.  If that book had been quoted to us as providing good arguments in favour of P.R. then it would have been perfectly proper to quote from it, but to <Col N="1299" /> suggest that it was an objective book, to suggest that it had no bias, to suggest that it was not a partisan book, was quite improper.  I leave it to the members of the Seanad to decide whether a book of that kind, published with the financial assistance of a trust which was made by a man who was in favour of, and had worked all his life, apparently, for P.R. is or is not an objective book.</P>

      <P>It seems to me that the second main principle in this Bill, the abolition of the transferable vote, should get some separate debate.  We have been debating the single seat constituency.  It is quite conceivable that we could have the single seat constituency with a transferable or a non-transferable vote.  I would welcome the possibility of saying something about the value of the transferable vote, whether or not we have the single seat constituency.  I do not think the debate on that should be suppressed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OwenSkeffington" hpid="Dr. Sheehy Skeffington Dr. Sheehy Skeffington">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>On this sub-section which is the sub-section which prescribes that members &ldquo;shall be elected on the system of the single non-transferable vote&rdquo;, I should like to say something about the whole principle involved here: on the non-transferable as opposed to the transferable vote.  It is obvious that if you have the non-transferable vote the voter gets no second choice.  I am avoiding the use of the phrase &ldquo;straight vote&rdquo; because I think it is ambiguous, unless you take the word &ldquo;straight&rdquo; in the same sense in which it is applied in the phrase &ldquo;a strait jacket&rdquo;; it might be regarded as the &ldquo;strait jacket&rdquo; vote because, in fact, the voter's hands are virtually tied.  He gets one choice and after that no more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In fact, this clause, when it is referred to the people under the referendum, will, in effect, be asking the voters to allow their hands to be tied. The non-transferable vote allows for a far cruder expression of the voter's preference.  All a voter can do is just &ldquo;plump&rdquo; for one candidate and, consequently, for one Party.  That gives an expression to his vote which is far less subtle, less intelligent and less discriminating than under the transferable <Col N="1304" /> vote, even with a single seat constituency. At present in a by-election where the single seat constituency is the rule with the transferable vote, the voter can vote first for his first choice even if that first choice has, as yet, in his opinion, no chance of being elected but he can cast his No. 1 vote for his first choice, without the fear of the vote being wasted.  He knows that if his candidate is eliminated his No. 2 vote will be transformed into a No. 1 vote.</P>
    <P>Consequently, even in a single seat constituency under the present by-election system with the transferable vote, the voter is enabled to vote (a) for a particular tendency within a Party&mdash;to vote for a candidate more closely representing his views within a Party, or he can vote (b) for a young man as opposed to an old man, or a young man, as the case may be, as opposed to an older woman candidate, within the same Party.  In other words he can express a choice as between the tendencies or age groups or (c) the voter can vote for a small Party or an Independent, with which or with whom he is in sympathy.</P>
    <P>In Britain to-day, where they have not got this transferable vote, a voter might well like to vote for the Liberal candidate without having thereby to lose the right, if the Liberal candidate cannot be elected, to express a preference as between the Labour candidate and the Conservative candidate.  I say that a voter in Britain to-day might like to register a vote for the Liberals without having thereby to lose the right to express a preference as between the other two.  Without the transferable vote that cannot be done.</P>
    <P>I would suggest, furthermore, that by such expressions of preference an election constitutes a much more sensitive indicator of shades of public opinion, and of incipient changes in public opinion, than under a system where you can just vote for one candidate and one candidate only, with the non-transferable vote.  Even with the one-seat constituency, there would be a possibility of having two or three candidates presented by one Party for the purpose of attracting <Col N="1305" /> the elector by different tendencies within that Party.</P>
    <P>I would see a value even in relation to a single seat constituency of having two candidates, or perhaps more, for the one seat, from the same Party, because I would see a value attaching to the electoral work for a team of Party candidates, rather than simply for one single candidate.  I myself, and all those who have had anything to do with election campaigning, have felt the sense of teamwork, the spirit of solidarity, which springs from working for a team of Party candidates.  Senator Lenihan&mdash; I am glad to see he is here &mdash; made the point himself in reply to a point that Senator Professor Quinlan made. Senator Lenihan said, if I remember correctly, that he had the privilege of going forward for election and being a candidate in harness with an older politician of the same Party.  He said in column 1000, Volume 50 of the Official Report:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;A lot of play has been made by Senator Quinlan about young men.  I happen to be a fairly young fellow.  I faced the people in two elections as a member of a political Party with older members of my Party fighting the campaign with me.  I see nothing wrong with the joining of the older and younger people in the major political Parties.  Surely it is in that direction we can progress in the future.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I interjected at that point: &ldquo;You will not be able to in the single-seat constituency&rdquo;, meaning, of course, that he would not be able to run in harness with a senior politician if there was only a one-seat constituency with a non-transferable vote.</P>
    <P>Senator Lenihan replied: &ldquo;I can assure the Senator that I have the utmost confidence in my ability to deal with that situation.&rdquo;  I interjected again and said: &ldquo;You cannot go forward with other members of your Party any more.&rdquo;  Senator Lenihan replied: &ldquo;I have the greatest confidence in my ability to deal with that.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I should like to underline the Senator's attitude there, because <Col N="1306" /> Senator Lenihan in the first place points out, in relation to what I am now saying, the great value of presenting two or three candidates together, the value to the younger people of such a situation, and when I said that if he had not got the transferable vote in the multiple seat constituency, he would not be able to do that any more, his answer was to the effect that he will be able to look after himself!  It seems to me that he is saying that he can now manage by himself, and that therefore the system of going before the electorate as a team is no longer necessary or valuable.  The British army motto, something to the effect: &ldquo;Rot you, Jack, I'm bombproof&rdquo; seems to be the attitude of Senator Lenihan.  He has had the advantage of this political apprenticeship, and now he has no further use for that ladder and is prepared to kick it away for others.  I think that that is not quite fair to the younger members of his own Party and of other Parties, and I do not think that the whole purpose of running as a team has been served once Senator Lenihan has got the advantage of it. I feel it would also be an advantage for other people, and should therefore be retained.</P>
    <P>I should now like to make the point that even if we have the transferable vote no second preference votes come into play at all, unless no candidate gets more than half the votes at the first count.  If any candidate does get half the valid votes cast plus one, he is elected, and no second preference votes come into play.  It is only if the candidate does not get more than half the votes that the second preferences will be counted.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask whether we really think that a person failing to get more than half the votes should be elected, without any regard to the second preferences among the electorate? France has been quoted a good deal both here and in the Dáil.  France is now supposed to have a system under which we are asked to believe that things are going well.  Now, actually the French system to-day is that they hold two separate elections &mdash;one in one week and the other a week later.  The way it goes is, that if <Col N="1307" /> any candidate at the first election gets more than half the votes he or she is declared elected and there is no second election.  But if no candidate gets more than half, the following Sunday&mdash;they hold all their elections on Sundays&mdash; there is a fresh election in which all the candidates can stand again if they want to, but in which a number of those who have not done well at the first election usually stand down, saying that they are standing down in favour of certain other candidates. The electorate then vote once more on the slightly restricted number of candidates, and at the second election whether or not the top candidate gets half, or more than half the votes, he or she is declared elected.</P>
    <P>The necessity for holding such a double election would be removed if they simply had, with their single seat constituencies the transferable vote, because second preferances need be counted only in the event of no candidate getting more than half the votes.</P>
    <P>I should like to emphasise the fact, therefore, that in single seat constituencies the transferable and the non-transferable vote have exactly the same effect and result whenever more than half the electorate vote for one candidate.  It is only when no candidate commands an absolute majority that the transferable vote comes into play at all.</P>
    <P>I should like to give an example of the classic three or four-cornered contests in single seat constituencies. If you imagine, for instance, a single seat constituency in which 9,000 valid votes have been cast, the quota will be 4,501, and, supposing one candidate in the first count gets that quota he is declared elected and the election is over.  There is no counting of second preferences at all, and there should not be, because he commands a true majority.</P>
    <P>But supposing, as is far more likely to happen, that the Fianna Fáil candidate, say, out of those 9,000 votes gets 3,000, Fine Gael, 2,500, Labour, 2,000 and Independents, 1,500.  Now if you have the non-transferable vote the top candidate there, the Fianna Fáil man with 3,000 votes in my imaginary example, is declared elected.  Under <Col N="1308" /> this non-transferable vote system the candidate with the most votes, even though he does not reach more than half the votes, is declared elected, irrespective, in the case I cite, of the 6,000 people who voted against him as first choice.  Under the transferable vote system, if even 1,501 of those 6,000 people want him as their second choice, then he is elected anyway, and he has nothing to complain about.  It is only if they do not want him, even as their second choice, that he is rejected.</P>
    <P>Surely such a result is the essence of justice.  Consequently, I suggest that what the opponents of the transferable vote want is that a candidate in command of only minority support can slip into Parliament with considerably less votes than what constitute a true electoral mandate.  In refusing the transferable vote system, therefore, it would appear to me that this kind of contest, the three-cornered or four-cornered one, is precisely what is wanted by the opponents of the transferable vote, by the supporters of this sub-section and by the Government.  That is what is wanted by the Government, by Fianna Fáil for that very reason; that under such a system candidates without a true majority mandate will be able to slide into Parliament.</P>
    <P>It has been said and I should like to take it up as a separate point&mdash;that the system of P.R. with a single transferable vote was foisted upon Ireland by Britain, because the transferable vote was supposed to give more representation to the Unionists at that time.  It so happened that the other day I was sorting some of my father's papers, and I came across a document published in 1912 which seemed to me to be relevant to the suggestion that the single transferable vote system of P.R. was imposed upon a reluctant country by Britain.  This publication is the Journal of the Proportional Representation Society for July, 1912.  I found here mention of the fact that a deputation was sent from Ireland by the Irish Proportional Representation Society to British Ministers, and to leaders of various Opposition Parties in the House of Commons with a view to persuading them to include the P.R. system with the single transferable vote in our Home Rule Bill, <Col N="1309" /> and I quote page 49 of this document:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The members of the deputation were Professor Sir William Barrett and Dr. O'Connell (Dublin), the Rev. J.O. Hannay, well known as &lsquo;George Birmingham,&rsquo; Mr. Alec Wilson, J.P. (Belfast), Mr. J.J. Horgan (Cork) and Mr. E.A. Aston, Honorary Secretary of the Irish Society.  Mr. John H. Humphreys accompanied the deputation on behalf of the English Society.  The Lord Mayor of Dublin, who expected to be present, sent a letter regretting his inability to attend, in which he wrote:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&lsquo;I am in favour of the principle because in the first place it will be possible to safeguard sections of the community who may fear hurtful legislation by an Irish Parliament, and, secondly, because by giving representation to every minority in the country we could secure a Parliament which would be the best possible reflex of public opinion, and the personnel of the Legislature would be the best the country could secure.&rsquo;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Commenting on the proposal Mr. John Redmond said, and I quote:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;What we want is that the Irish Parliament shall be representative of every element in the country.  We want every class represented.  We want every creed represented.  We want equal justice.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is true to say that Mr. Redmond was subsequently a little bit cagey. There were, in fact, two leading politicians at the time who made slightly cagey speeches, such as one sometimes hears from leading politicians to-day. I quote again from page 49 of this document:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Mr. Redmond in replying to the deputation assured them that he had in no way receded from the position he took in Dublin in expressing his desire that minorities should be safeguarded. He was not prepared to commit either himself or his Party to acceptance or rejection of the scheme, but he could not object to <Col N="1310" /> P.R., if it was demanded by Irish opinion.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The other slightly cagey politician on this issue was Sir Edward Carson who said at page 57:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;He was quite ready to consider these amendments on their merits, and if he was convinced that P.R. actually provided in practice for the representation of minorities, he, whose sympathies were always with minorities, would support it.  He was not prepared, however, at this juncture to commit himself&rdquo;</P>
    <P>&mdash;he used the same phrase, the same politician's safeguard&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;as to what action he would take. He would carefully examine the working of the system, and his attitude would be determined by the consideration to which he had referred.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>He seems to echo certain modern politicians in that, too.  Now, I have quoted two politicians who were hedging in this regard, but I should like to quote what three representative Irish newspapers said.</P>
      <P>The <i>Freeman's Journal</i> of April 21st, 1911, said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;P.R. has two undoubted advantages over other schemes for protecting minorities; it is thoroughly democratic and it is automatic in its working.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The <i>Belfast Newsletter</i> of May 21st, 1912, said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;If it were adopted in Ireland, it might go far to remove the injustice which the Protestant minorities in Leinster, Munster and Connaught labour under just now.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>
        <i>Sinn Féin</i> said on January, 21st, 1911:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;P.R. would invest every voter with absolute equality.  It is the only equitable system of representation based on numerical strength.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1311" /> In the light of such quotations it becomes impossible to say that this was a system imposed upon an unwilling people by the wicked British.  Large sections of the people here were asking for it, and I have quoted a sufficiently representative cross-section to indicate that there was at least a large amount of opinion in Ireland which regarded it as desirable even under the Home Rule Bill.</P>
    <P>Senator Lenihan expressed disappointment at the way in which the university representatives had come to the Seanad, and I quote from column 1003 of the Seanad Debates of the 4th March, 1959:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;...I would have expected university representatives to come to the Seanad and to put the pros and cons, in respect of this proposal.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He went on to say at column 1004:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;...There is a definite philosophical issue and they made no attempt to analyse it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I do not wish to dwell at length on that, but I do sympathise with Senator Lenihan in his disappointment.  We have heard a lot about the professors of this House, and I should like hotly to deny that I am a professor.  I am, indeed, the only representative of the university here who is not a professor but a mere lecturer.  However, I do not accept the suggestion that the university representatives&mdash; Senator Lenihan did not use the words &ldquo;professors&rdquo;&mdash;did not attempt to present the pros and cons and did not attempt to analyse.  In point of fact if he will turn to columns 453 and 454 he will find that I in particular&mdash;and the same applies to the other university representatives&mdash;made at least an effort to analyse the case against P.R. and the transferable vote.  I grant you that Senator Lenihan was more concerned at the time to discover whether or not I was reading my speech, and possibly he had not sufficient concentration to listen to what I was actually saying. However, if he has the time he might notice that at column 453 I stated:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The case against P.R. seems to fall under three main heads.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I gave the heads: first, a multiplicity <Col N="1312" /> of Parties; second, Coalitions, and third, weak and unstable Government. I shall not quote what I said, but I made an attempt to rebut each of these charges, to weigh in the balance their validity, and I said in relation to the formation of Coalition Governments that there was some truth in the Government's contention that there might be, under P.R., under the single transferable vote, a tendency to form such coalitions.  I conceded the point, and I endeavoured to analyse it, perhaps imperfectly; but it is not quite fair to express total disappointment.  I should not like to feel that Senator Lenihan was supremely and dejectedly disappointed, because we did not attempt to analyse the case against.  We endeavoured to analyse it, even if our analysis was not satisfactory from his point of view.</P>
    <P>I want therefore to suggest, in relation to this sub-section, that it is a bad sub-section.  I want to suggest that by abolishing the transferable vote it seeks to withdraw a measure of the power that is at present vested in the ordinary voter.  The ordinary voter has got a certain measure of power now.  Some of that power will be filched from him by this sub-section, which will give him, in place of the transferable vote, in which he can express his preferences, a single vote in which he can merely plump for one candidate and do nothing else.  Under this section he will be robbed of the right to express a preferential opinion, the right to express a graded choice, the right to register an effectively balanced and discriminating vote.  By this sub-section, therefore, and indeed by the whole Bill which the people are being asked to approve of, the people are in fact being asked docilely to deprive themselves of those voting powers, this voting strength and this discriminatory voting right.  Therefore, I say &ldquo;no&rdquo; personally to this sub-section, and I hope that the Seanad will say &ldquo;no&rdquo;, and that the people will say &ldquo;no&rdquo; in the Referendum.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>This section concerns the non-transferable vote, and Senator <Col N="1313" /> Sheehy Skeffington rightly confined himself to that issue.  The allegation has been made throughout this debate that the proposal for the non-transferable vote is designed to suit the partisan purposes of the Fianna Fáil Party.  It is my concern to rebut that suggestion.  The only practicably way in which it can be done is by examining the results of the by-elections in recent years to see how far the non-transferable vote in those bye-elections helped the Fianna Fáil Party.  With that end in view, I propose to deal with the results of by-elections in which there were only two candidates, a Fianna Fáil candidate and a non-Fianna Fáil candidate.  I do not think it is relevant to the argument to go through all the other by-elections in which there were more than one candidate opposed to Fianna Fáil.  We will see how this proposed system of the non-transferable vote has worked in practice and how far it has helped to perpetuate Fianna Fáil.</P>
      <P>The first by-election I shall take is the by-election in the constituency of Dublin North-East on 30th April, 1956. The total valid poll was 32,079. Already the swing was starting against the then Government and towards the Fianna Fáil alternative Government in Opposition.  There were two candidates in that by-election, Patrick Byrne, Independent, and Charles J. Haughey, Fianna Fáil.  The result was, Patrick Byrne, 18,129; Charles J. Haughey, 13,950&mdash;election of Patrick Byrne, Independent.  An Independent, anti-Fianna Fáil candidate, with the non-transferable vote operating, succeeded in beating the Fianna Fáil candidate, despite the fact that the swing was already moving against the then Coalition Government and towards the alternative Fianna Fáil Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I shall be fair about this.  On 14th November, 1956, in Dublin South-West, Deputy Noel Lemass, Fianna Fáil, beat the Fine Gael candidate on the result 14,416 to 9,682.  Within two months there was an Independent beating a Fianna Fáil candidate and a Fianna Fáil candidate beating a Fine Gael candidate under the non-transferable vote system.  My only concern is to present in all fairness what is likely to <Col N="1314" /> happen under the single transferable vote system.  Shortly afterwards, in the constituency of Leix-Offaly, Fianna Fáil beat Labour.  The Labour candidate, Davin, was beaten by Egan, Fianna Fáil, by 23,500 votes to 18,500. That was evened up in the following by-election in February, 1957, when Moloney of Fianna Fáil was beaten by Kathleen O'Connor, Clann na Poblachta, by 18, 176 votes to 15,828.</P>
    <P>There you have it.  In the four by-elections held in the year immediately prior to the last general election where the non-transferable vote operated, and where there were only two candidates seeking election, the Fianna Fáil Party won two seats and were beaten for another two seats.  Could anything be fairer?  Surely the most unbiassed Senator, particularly, the Senators who have no Party ties, must admit that that analysis of the operation of the non-transferable vote should lead them to the view that under the new system there will be no perpetuation of Fianna Fáil or anything like it.  Surely it will result, as it has in Britain, in certain areas, that tend to support Fianna Fáil putting in Fianna Fáil candidates, and other areas that tend to be against Fianna Fáil putting in other candidates. That analysis should lead any rational person to the conclusion that the logical development of the system we are proposing is that the people can accept or reject the candidate put forward by either the Government or the alternative Government in opposition.</P>
    <P>Even since the last general election there have been by-elections.  In particular, in the Dublin North-Central constituency, on the 14th November, 1957, there was a candidate who got in, not thanks to P.R., although eventually he got in because P.R. was in operation, but who in fact headed the poll. Sherwin, F. headed the poll on that date with 4,077 votes.  He got in by various transfers because he had not reached the quota on the first count. If that was an election on the straight vote system, Sherwin, F. would have been returned in that area, in that particular by-election.  Surely the case is unanswerable from the point of view that no particular Party will be particularly <Col N="1315" /> favoured by the deletion of that particular requirement.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect of it to which I did not refer in my previous remarks on this Bill, that is, the question of these transfers of which everybody is so enamoured.  First of all, it might be no harm to mention that while there are 200 to 300 variations of P.R. all over the world&mdash;this principle of giving exact statistical representation&mdash;there are very few that conform to our peculiar system.  In fact, I think it can be categorically stated that our system of election, involving the multi-seat arrangement, with the transferable vote, does not operate for any major Parliament in the world, apart from our own.  That is a statement over which I can stand scientifically.</P>
    <P>I have conducted an examination into this matter and the position is, that you have lists systems of P.R., and all sorts of other systems, but the transferable vote system in the multi-seat constituency only operates in the method of election to three provincial Parliaments.  One is Tasmania, somewhere at the toe-end of Australia; the other is Gibraltar, at the toe-end of Spain; and the third is Malta, at the toe-end of Italy.  Beyond being used as a means of election to those three provincial Parliaments, the system of the multi-seat constituency does not operate in the method of election to any major Parliament.</P>

      <P>I am coming to the point.  It is a peculiar system.  I would say a very peculiar system.  One has only to look at how votes are transferred, the process by which they are transferred, to see what I mean.  For simplicity, we will assume that there are three candidates in the field in an election.  A gets 6,000 votes, B gets 5,000 votes and C gets 4,000 votes.  C's votes are transferred.  He is eliminated. He gives 3,000 votes to B and <Col N="1316" /> 1,000 votes to A and B is elected over A.</P>

      <P>I would, with the aid of other scientifically minded people here, be able to work out a system whereby you could have a second count by which the second preferences from A, B and C could be allocated appropriately to the particular candidates to whom the second preferences should go.

      <P>We will take the situation where somebody votes for candidate A, who just reaches the quota on the first count.  Assuming he just reaches the quota under the present system, a large section of the people must have voted for him.  In a three-seat constituency then he must have received at least 25 per cent. of the votes on the first count, without any transfer of preferences and he got there on his own ability.  With the support of the people who voted for him, he topped the poll in the constituency. In the case of this man who has topped the poll, who is the man most highly regarded by the people in the constituency and for whom their majority have voted No. 1, his second preference votes are absolutely wasted. If he just reaches the quota, not one of his second preference votes is transferred. If he gets a few votes over the quota, they are distributed.  Assuming he gets 11,000 votes and that exceeds the quota by 1,000 votes, each second preference vote counts as one-tenth of <Col N="1318" /> a vote in the distribution of the surplus.</P>

The most practical way of designating any person to represent any area is for the people to decide who comes first.  No matter what some of the intellectuals opposite may think, it is very practical and sensible.  The first horse past the post wins the race.  The first man to breast the tape wins the sprint race, and so on.  The man at the top of the poll, in the ordinary man's way of looking at it&mdash;he may be of no consequence&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I think it was Senator Ted O'Sullivan who mentioned a specific example that brought that out.

      <P>One of the hecklers on the other side of the House has induced me to come to a point I nearly forgot in the welter of notes that I have here about me.  The question of the British system has been bandied about.  Senator Quinlan has been calling it the &ldquo;Belfast system&rdquo;&mdash;that is, the straight system of voting in the single seat constituency that operates in the U.S.A., Britain, Canada, and New Zealand.  People opposite are concerned to call that system the <Col N="1321" />&ldquo;British&rdquo; system.  It might be no harm to reiterate that the idea of P.R. originated in the middle of the last century with certain extreme liberal British thinkers.  Thomas Hare, notably, and also a gentleman called John Stuart Mill were two prominent persons involved.  These people, in a minority of one in 100 in Britain, started this notion of P.R.  The Proportional Representation Society of Great Britain was founded.  The whole idea did not originate in Britain or anywhere else.  It started in Britain as the cult of individualistic liberal thinkers of a sect.  They founded the Proportional Representation Society of Great Britain.  That cannot be stated often enough.  Their whole cult was that the Government and even Parliament exercising an executive function was a waste of time.  The idea was to curb the power of the executive. That idea is completely outdated and is 100 years old.  It comes from the <i>laissez faire</i> era when people were concerned with the individual and individual rights at the expense of the community. It is outdated and dead.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would say the Labour Party and Senator Sheehy Skeffington would agree with me that we welcome the intrusion of government into public affairs, which has been a feature of government and public affairs over the past two generations. I certainly deplore the whole attitude of <i>laissez faire</i> of the Victorian era in Britain when nobody bothered a hoot about anybody and where the best horse jumped the ditch and, if not, he lay there.  That was exactly the nation to which these extreme liberal thinkers who formed the Proportional Representation Society subscribed.  Things have changed a lot, and rightly so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The emphasis to-day is on government. The emphasis is on an effective executive.  That has developed largely out of those Victorian days in Britain when you had people who were in an unrepresented class, the working class, without any rights or privileges or any way to move their point of view.  The <Col N="1322" /> result is that to-day the State largely accepts a measure of responsibility for the economics welfare of the community. That is a very good thing.</P>
    <P>In that context the emphasis must be on effective government rather than on excessive representation.  Excessive representation in the form of representation of every shade and colour of opinion in Parliament is as dead as the Dodo.  It is not relevant to to-day's attitude and to the needs of this era. For that reason I think that a very bad day's work was done for this country when, in 1920, the views of the Proportional Representation Society of Great Britain were listened to by Lloyd George, not for the benefit of the society, but for some devious reason of his own and were incorporated in the Government of Ireland Act, 1920, from whence we have P.R.</P>
    <P>The Minister has already quoted the real reason behind the introduction of this measure.  In that particular Act of Parliament it is quite clear from Lord Samuel's remarks in the Westminster Parliament at the time what the idea was.  It was to curb the Party that had secured a broad flow of support in the community of the day here&mdash;the Sinn Féin Party, in the 1918 election.  That challenge is still open to any other Party who want to find support in the community.</P>
    <P>The present system, which is unique in this country and peculiar by virtue of being imposed by Lloyd George and peculiar for other reasons, has given rise to a system where, if you look forward to the future, there appears to be nothing but stagnation. Just look ahead to the future and try to envisage things over the next ten, 15 or 20 years.  It was mentioned in a sneering attitude in the Dáil that we were looking ahead to the future.  I am glad that we are. There is nothing wrong with that. Indeed, there is something fine and noble about it.  If anyone looks to the future of this country it seems to be inevitable that you could very easily have a situation where you would have five, six, seven or eight Parties none of which would be able to govern the country.  We have had instances of that in the past few <Col N="1323" /> years.  I do not wish to go over the failures of the Coalition Governments. We would have that sort of thing in a more aggravated form in future elections.</P>
    <P>At the moment in this popular Parliament, Dáil Éireann, where is the alternative Government functioning? Do the people know to-day that there is in opposition to the present Government an alternative Government functioning for the people?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1943" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>They know they have been doing nothing since they got in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking about alternative Government.  Surely, people who have the mind and the community at heart would agree with me that it would be a very good thing for our community if in our Parliament to-day there was functioning an alternative Government and if the people could see in opposition to the Fianna Fáil Party an alternative Government to which the people could swing in a general election?  The Bill before the House essentially enshrines the idea of the alternative Government.  That is the essential ingredient in it&mdash;an alternative Government which the people can see functioning in our Parliament and to whom they could turn if they decided to reject the Government in power.  I said on Second Reading that they could do something positive as well as negative.  By negatively rejecting the Government in office they can positively put into power the Government they see functioning as an Opposition to the Government.  That is the essential ingredient in this measure.</P>
      <P>It is essential, for that reason, to have the non-transferable vote.  The transferable vote will merely give the power to a minority group to hold the gun to the head of majority national Parties.  I do not see why any majority national Party should be subjected to that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was a lot of talk about bargains. If the transferable vote is operating in the future, assuming even <Col N="1324" /> what Senator Barry postulated in regard to the single seat constituency, does it not give an undue emphasis&mdash; having regard to the figures I quoted in respect of three candidates going forward&mdash;to the minority Party that comes at the bottom of the poll? Surely that Party is in the position to hold the gun to either of the two major Parties?  Does it not give undue power to that minority group to hold the gun to either Party A or Party B and to say: &ldquo;Give us this; give us that and do not do this or do not do that?&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the major evil in the transferable vote idea.  The inherent weakness in the transferable vote idea is the undue power given to a small group.  It would be a better idea if that small group were wedded to or integrated into one of the major national Parties and could push its own point of view there.  It was mentioned <Col N="1325" /> here that this idea is a British idea.  I could pursue that argument <i>ad nauseam</i> and point out that the Seanad and Dáil are British ideas also.  I will not go into that because this whole notion of being in a British system is such a weak point.  I will not go into it because I have already dealt sufficiently well with the whole idea of P.R. having developed from certain minority thinkers in England.  I should prefer to quote from a famous Catholic and Thomist philosopher, Jacques Maritain, who wrote in the <i>New Republic</i> of 1942, published in Paris, and was treating of this question of electoral systems and methods of election in politics in a higher sense than probably would be appreciated by people on the other side of the House.  Treating of this question, he wrote:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;In order to eliminate, in addition, every attempt to introduce the Trojan horse of P.R. into the democratic structure, let us note that just as the common good is not a simple sum of individual goods, so the common will is not a simple sum of individual wills.  Universal suffrage does not have the aim to represent simply atomic wills and opinions, but to give form and expression, according to their respective importance, to the common currents of opinion and of will which exist in the nation.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>In other words, the whole idea behind all systems of election in our Christian concept of things surely should be that it should not have a disintegrating effect.  Surely in any Christian community our objective should be to see that the system is such as to bring people together towards the middle and, if you like, have your Government in office and, in Opposition, an alternative Government, both moving towards the middle rather than disintegrating towards the extremities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The emphasis there is on an electoral system that should not be what he calls there &ldquo;the Trojan horse of P.R.,&rdquo; should not be all that kind of emphasising of individual wills, but an electoral system rather that, instead of emphasising individual wills and individual opinions, should reflect the common current of opinion and bring people together; in other words, an electoral system that will give you a Government and an Opposition, a two-Party or three-Party electoral system that can always give the people a Government.  Inherent in the idea which Maritain states there about the common good is the same thing, about how effectively the common good can be achieved.  Can it be done more effectively by this measure or by the system we have had here in the past?</P>

        <i>The New Republic, 1942.</i>  This is an annual review published in Paris.  It is a quotation which is very stimulating and very important in that it should lead us to the conclusion that what we should do in this community is to see that we develop an electoral system that will tend towards integrating rather than disintegrating our community.</P>
      <P>That has, of course, a particular emphasis in this country where, as I have already said, there is no great philosophical difference between 95 per cent. of the people in this part of the island.  I am firmly of opinion that the only minority in the real sense of the word in the island is the Unionist minority in the North-East part of the country in the racial or sectarian sense.

There is no difference between them in regard to economic status and their objects, their objectives in life and their whole attitude towards living.  The particular people I am thinking of are all Catholics of the same way of thinking, roughly of the same economic status. Why should we encourage them to create more and more small Parties to facilitate the encouragement of minority splinter groups?  What is the point of it?  Why should we in this community of 2,900,000 in the Twenty-Six Counties be concerned about creating a number of small minority splinter groups?</P>

The argument that that will lead to the freezing of the national purpose has been dealt with already and Senator Ó Maoláin in particular pointed out the rise of the Labour Party in Britain.  The change proposed by the Government presents a similar challenge to the Labour Party in this country.  They can always supersede the existing national Parties and become the Government of this country if they broaden their policy from being merely sectarian.  I do not think that the Labour Party as at present constituted in this part of the country has any great claim to being a Labour Party in the real sense of the word, but if they were such a Labour Party the simple fact of the matter is that they would command a far higher representation in Dáil Éireann than they have at present.</P>

In Dublin City and County at the moment, under the P.R. system that it is sought to preserve for all time in Irish public life, the Irish Labour Party has one seat out of 30.  That is sufficient condemnation of their opportunistic attitude in regard to this matter as to everything else.  From my own personal association with a great many trade union people I know that some of the more far-thinking of them are opposed to the attitude adopted by their present Oireachtas representatives. I know many prominent Fine <Col N="1329" /> Gael people who are opposed to the attitude adopted by certain of the Oireachtas representatives in this regard.</P>

      <P>We know also that a large section of the Fine Gael Oireachtas representatives were in favour of this measure and that a large segment of their supporters in the country, people who have standing in the community are also in favour of it.  Unfortunately, the political wing of the trade union movement and the Fine Gael political wing have decided to pursue in the Oireachtas a purely opportunistic line of country.  Their one aim at the moment would appear to be: oppose Fianna Fáil and you have got them. That attitude is being followed by the political wings in the Oireachtas purely for the purpose, to put it crudely, of &ldquo;having a go&rdquo; at Fianna Fáil without regard to the national interests at stake.</P>
      <P>I hold no brief for the Six County gerrymandering arrangements but, despite gerrymandering, the electoral system there manages to produce a result whereby in Belfast City, with 16 seats, there are four Labour, one Republican Labour and one Independent Labour out of the 16; in other words, of the 16 seats in the constituencies of Belfast, Labour has six in the Stormont Parliament.  In Dublin City Labour has one out of 30 seats.</P>
      <P>I quoted the following passage on the Second Stage but it might be apposite again in this context.  To envisage a national Party development does not mean that the situation would be frozen so that there would be only two Parties of a certain calibre, say, A and B.  There is always the challenge to the third Party to come up and sweep the other two out.  I see nothing wrong with that.  In 1924, at Volume 172 of <i>Hansard</i>, Mr. Herbert Morrison said:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;P.R. is a philosophy which is not unnatural to small new Parties struggling to get a footing on the <Col N="1330" /> electoral field, and not having much staying power or pluck to fight.  It is also perfectly natural to decaying political Parties, who are doomed to extinction in the course of time, and can only retain their position by elevating the power of the minority and subjecting the power of the majority.  It is perfectly natural to them, but it is not natural to strong men and women who want their country to be governed wisely and firmly, and I hope, therefore, that the House will not accept that type of Government.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Herbert Morrison took that line in 1924.  In 1948 he saw such a minority Party come to power and he became a Government Minister for five years. That's the approach that should guide Fine Gael and Labour.  We want to ask these people who are so cowardly to come in and accept our challenge and not to mind &ldquo;isms&rdquo; of any kind. Why can we all not work together?</P>

      <P>I ask the favour of this House to continue speaking despite the opposition of Senator Quinlan.  If anyone conducted a slight perusal of the Seanad Debates on the Second and Committee Stages of this question, they would find I am columns, or, perhaps, volumes behind Senator Quinlan.  The Seanad has been bemused by the repetition and quotations <i>ad nauseam</i> of Senator Quinlan.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not a question of quoting the number of columns Senator Quinlan's speech occupies, but a question of enumeration, which would take some considerable time.  I do not propose to spend the time of <Col N="1332" /> the House upon that odious endeavour.</P>
      <P>In regard to this question of the development of the two-Party system we desire, I should like to quote from a book referred to by Senator Burke. It is <i>Can Parliament Survive</i>?  by Christopher Hollis, M.P. Of course, at the time Hollis was a Conservative M.P. in Britain.  He has also contributed to the Fine Gael monthly periodical, <i>The National Observer.</i>  At page 48, he talks about the classic argument for Party Government and says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It is a strong argument.  The argument is that, provided that both sides tacitly agree to respect the essential continuity of the nation's life, provided that controversy between them is confined to issues that are real indeed but secondary and the basically important issues are either left to other hands than those of the politicians or else settled by the politicians on non-party lines, then it is a great advantage to a nation that there should be two rival teams.  The rule of neither of the teams would be wholly calamitous and between them the people can make their choice.  A profound human instinct demands every now and again a change of rulers.  It is the great merit of parliamentary government that it provides a method by which this instinct for change can be satisfied harmlessly, constitutionally and peacefully.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>In other words, Hollis is concerned to emphasise that the development of two major national Parties is a very desirable thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I submit that such development in this country would be very desirable. I cannot foresee whether it would be major national Party A or major national Party B but it will be a group of major national Parties agreeing basically on fundamental issues but disagreeing on secondary issues. It comes back to this point of the essentially integrating nature of our community.  Most of us think about the same things, and have the same objectives in life.  If there are two major national Parties cutting through <Col N="1333" /> all strata of society, there can be a Government and an alternative Government in opposition, producing a policy every time before an election. That will lead to a progression, whereas, at present, there are Parties more or less in a static position; there is no great change or swing and there is no chance of there being something dynamic or forward.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinlan adopted a rather contradictory attitude on this.  He said the weakness of democracy here was that aged men perpetuated themselves. He said that that was the cause of the destruction of democracy in Germany rather than what we say, the P.R. system.  Surely nothing is better designed to perpetuate aged men than the P.R. system.  Surely that very system ensures that there will be perpetuation of the people in office, no rejection of them and no introduction of more dynamic ideas.  I have no objection to old men with progressive ideas.  Dr. Adenauer is the classic example in the world of an old man young in mentality.  We have plenty of old men young in mentality and ideas.  Anybody young in ideas and mentality will always secure election under the straight vote system. That system will put them on their mettle, whereas the P.R. system tends to stagnation and to perpetuate things without any change or striking development.</P>
    <P>I regarded Senator Quinlan's argument as an argument designed for the common good.  In many ways he was concerned with pushing a certain point of view, but in that particular aspect he was contradictory.  If he feels that Germany's destruction resulted from aged politicians, my reply is that that is a development more likely to occur under P.R. than under the system of the straight vote.  In the straight vote system there will always be a dynamic to enable things to swing one way or the other, and the people will be able to exercise their choice decisively.</P>
    <P>I shall conclude by emphasising once again that the idea of the non-transferable vote does not affect one way or other the fortunes of the Fianna Fáil organisation.  I have shown that clearly in the election results I quoted.  In fact, if you have <Col N="1334" /> the non-transferable vote in the single seat constituency, it will lead to the development of major national Parties.  If Fianna Fáil do not do their stuff, they will be rejected by the people the same as any other Party.  We are glad to say, as a major national Party, that we are not afraid to face up to the challenge to which Fine Gael and Labour are similarly asked to face up.  If the people decide to reject us, that is the people's privilege; but we have the utmost confidence in ourselves and we feel the people will support us as they have in the past because we have always taken a national rather than a sectional or opportunist view of matters.</P>

In view of the time taken up by Senator Lenihan, I want to say the Labour group here are not being a party to the agreement to take the vote at ten o'clock.

      <P>I wish to draw attention to the phrase &ldquo;make every endeavour&rdquo;.  Senator Lenihan has raised so many points on P.R. that have to be answered that I feel that I, and other Senators on this side of the House, would not be doing our duty if we did not answer those points.  I believe we have a duty to do so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I, of course, was a party to this agreement.  I said in this House:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;That is a very desirable programme <Col N="1336" /> ...We would be prepared to do our best to carry it out.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think I did my best to-day to carry out the first part of the agreement, to have the division at 6 o'clock, and I specifically mentioned, after the division and before we adjourned&mdash;at the suggestion of the Cathaoirleach until 7.30&mdash;the point that we agreed to have the second question put at 10 o'clock. But the bare making of the agreement does not mean that everybody can do as he likes.  If, for example, I had allowed some of my people to speak here this afternoon for an hour, as Senator Ryan spoke, I could be told I was breaking the agreement.  At the same time, I entirely agreed with the Cathaoirleach's suggestion that we should adjourn until 7.30.  That gave us two and a half hours.</P>
    <P>Surely it is unreasonable that a member on the Government side should take more than one and a quarter hours to debate the question over and over again.  It is obviously unfair, when you consider that before the division Senator Murphy rose, and I understood that the Minister wanted to speak also.  I thought the Minister would have spoken this afternoon and that would have been the main speech for the Government.  That was not so. If Senator Lenihan desires to take up time he is perfectly entitled to do so, but I think it is quite clear that he is not entitled to do it and at the same time have an agreement carried out which was subject, of course, in the nature of things, to time being fairly evenly divided.  That is clear.</P>

I have called on Senator Murphy now, from other Senators who offered to speak, because he failed to get the opportunity before. He has voiced a certain opinion and I have no control over that, unless the leaders resolve this argument.  I am making no comment on the length of time taken by Senator Lenihan.  He was within his rights, I agree, but I agree also with the Leader of the Opposition that if somebody spoke for a long time it upsets the agreement.</P>

You cannot do that.  Any arrangement of this kind is subject to fair play all round and if in a two and a half hour debate a member of the Government Party, in the presence of the Minister, whom I understood wanted to speak, takes more than half the time, that bursts the agreement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not like it to be taken that we are breaking an agreement because what Senator Ó Maoláin quoted was an arrangement <Col N="1339" /> that &ldquo;every endeavour would be made&rdquo; and certainly it is not our fault that the endeavour on the other side was to keep the debate on, to keep talking.  I would be tempted in those circumstances to adopt a similar line, to keep on talking up to ten o'clock and resume to-morrow, but I do not want to deprive any Senator of an opportunity of expressing his viewpoint on this section of the Bill. What I have to say will be to the point.  I do not intend to delay the Seanad.  I must say, however, that if the arrangement has been broken, it has been broken by the other side and it is not fair to charge us with breaking it.</P>
      <P>We are dealing in this section with the abolition of the transferable vote and the substitution of the non-transferable vote.  In that we are arranging that the candidate securing the highest number of votes in an election, irrespective of whether or not that represents a majority of the votes cast, will be declared elected.  That means, in effect, that one of the methods of operating P.R. is being abolished.</P>
      <P>I have noticed that the speakers on the Government side have been concentrating to a great extent on the benefits of the proposed new system of the single non-transferable vote in one-member constituencies.  It is a pity, however, they cannot agree among themselves as to what exactly the benefits are supposed to be.  They attempt to sell one line to Fine Gael, another line to Labour and yet another line again to their own supporters.  Their first responsibility should have been to show that P.R. has failed in this country, that it has been ineffective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have not any great experience in politics but I know that P.R., the method of election in operation in this State since its foundation and deliberately retained in the 1937 Constitution, has permitted and has resulted in effective Governments being formed.  We have no instance where elections under the P.R. system have resulted in a deadlock, in a stalemate, in the inability of the Dáil to elect a Taoiseach and in the Taoiseach being unable <Col N="1340" /> to select, and have approved, a Government.</P>
    <P>In spite of the objection from the other side, I say that P.R. has given representation for minorities and has given effective Governments in this country.  Indeed, judging from the figures that have been quoted of the number of Prime Ministers in Great Britain&mdash;the number of changes of Government there&mdash;P.R. seems to have given us better overall stability than the British system has produced in Great Britain and which is now proposed to be introduced here.</P>
    <P>What is wrong with the P.R. method of election?  I am afraid that when we ask ourselves that question the only obvious answer is that twice in the last decade it has disappointed Fianna Fáil. That has been explained by the Taoiseach and I can understand his viewpoint. He has explained that on those two occasions Fianna Fáil were, by the votes of the electors, the largest Party in the Dáil but, because of the combination of other Parties, were not allowed to form a Government.  They are, therefore, disappointed in P.R. Let them be honest enough to admit that is the reason why, in their opinion, P.R. should be abolished.</P>
    <P>What we are told about that situation is that it represented bargaining between minority groups after the election.  That can be termed only political abuse.  It is not a political argument.  It is simply a form of political abuse.  I cannot see what is wrong in Parties, separate and distinct Parties, agreeing to sit down and to work together in their own and in the common interest.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil, in proposing the abolition of the P.R. system of election, want to prevent such a situation from arising in the future and, by so doing, are depriving minorities of representation in Dáil Éireann.  I do not think I would be quite honest in saying Fianna Fáil are deliberately embarking on an effort to wipe out minority political Parties.  What they are doing is deliberately embarking on an effort to change the system so that they can be the political Party in power and that these minority Parties cannot combine against them in the future. <Col N="1341" /> The result is that minority Parties, such as the Labour Party, would tend to be wiped out of the Dáil, thereby depriving their supporters of their representation.</P>
    <P>Can we say, as was said by the people on the opposite side, that the proposed new system&mdash;the single non-transferable vote in one-member constituencies&mdash;will produce more stability than has existed up to now?  Can any of us really say that there has been serious or, indeed, any instability in this State since the 1930s?  We were told from the other side about the disaster of P.R. in France.  We were told how France, to save itself, abolished P.R. and has a new system of election.  The de Gaulle supporters were returned, in the last general election there, with an overwhelming majority by some system that they now have in operation there.  Is that stability?  I notice by to-day's papers that already, in the space of a few months, there has been a swing in public opinion.  Recent municipal elections in France have resulted in some cities and towns, under this new system of election, in all the seats being given to the Communist Party simply because they got an overall majority and, by this new system of election, they got all the seats.  What sort of stability does that produce? What sort of stability will it produce in this country?</P>
    <P>If we consider the results of the last general election, the way the votes were cast for each Party, we shall see that in practically every constituency Fianna Fáil got more first preference votes than other organised Parties. They did not get 50 per cent. or anything like it but they got more than other Parties.  Therefore, it is logical to argue from that that when those constituencies are divided up into smaller segments it is very probable that, in those smaller segments, Fianna Fáil would have the majority over other Parties&mdash;not over other Parties organised together&mdash;and that that is why Fianna Fáil do not want the transferable vote.  On the basis of first preferences, with their present support, they will have more votes than Fine Gael, Labour or Sinn Féin.  We can expect in that situation, if they get the <Col N="1342" /> same measure of support at the next general election, that they would capture practically all the seats in the new Dáil.</P>
    <P>What sort of stability will that give? What sort of stability will it give to democracy in this country?  What sort of an Opposition can there be? Figures have been used by people who know more about politics than I which show that it would probably result in Fianna Fáil getting 120 seats and Fine Gael and perhaps an odd Independent or Labour 20 between them.  How can 20 Opposition Deputies form an effective Opposition?  How can they build up experience in Parliament to produce an alternative Government?</P>
    <P>Senator Lenihan said a while ago that there would be a natural swing; that some other Party would be elected at some future date with an overall majority and would form a Government. What sort of stability would it produce if, after a general election, Fine Gael, with probably 20 in the previous Dáil, were returned with 120, probably 100 of those inexperienced Deputies, with the task of forming and supporting a Government?  I do not think that would be good for democracy in this country.  Suppose it resulted later on in Labour coming in with a similar big majority with Deputies inexperienced in Parliament, again I do not think that it would be good for democracy.  I do not think it would be good for any of the Parties concerned. Certainly, if there were such swings, it would not result in stability but that is the sort of sales talk that Fianna Fáil use to Fine Gael and Labour: &ldquo;There is this system and the chances are that it will benefit you when your turn comes and you will go in with a big sweeping overall majority and be able to form a Government independent of anybody else&mdash;a strong Government.&rdquo;  They tell Fine Gael that that is the prospect for them.  They tell Labour that that is the prospect ultimately for them, also, but do they really believe that that is what they are selling to their own supporters?  I do not think so.  What they really believe themselves and what they are selling to their own supporters is that the new system will result in Fianna Fáil having <Col N="1343" /> a permanent overall majority in the Dáil for the next 50 years at least, that they will be so dug in with such a strong majority that there can be no hope of ousting them out of office in the foreseeable future.</P>
    <P>Which tale is right?  Which do they expect to happen now?  They are not innocently sleeping.  The Fianna Fáil people must have studied the election results.  They must have studied the constituencies.  They must have an idea of how the constituencies will be broken up and they must know whether it is for their benefit, the benefit of Fine Gael or Labour.  It cannot be for the benefit of the three Parties. They are quite dishonest in suggesting that this will be good for the Labour Party or the Fine Gael Party.  What they are designing is that it will be good for the Fianna Fáil Party in perpetuity.</P>
    <P>Again, there is the question as to whether or not the smaller Parties will be completely wiped out.  Some Fianna Fáil speakers say: &ldquo;No, it will encourage the growth of the small Parties.  If they produce policies acceptable to the people they will naturally grow and eventually become the Government.&rdquo;  But, a Minister of this Government, the Minister for Health, who has his head screwed on very tightly whatever else one may say about him, says it is designed to produce only two major Parties in this country&mdash;one slightly to the left and one slightly to the right of centre.</P>
    <P>Surely that is what Fianna Fáil have in mind.  Let them cease trying to sell to the Labour Party or the Labour Party supporters the idea that this is being introduced out of the goodness of the Fianna Fáil heart to help Labour get more representation and more support under this new system of election.</P>
    <P>There is one further point I should like to make.  It is in answer to the charge made by Senator Lenihan.  I did not get his words down exactly but I think the sense of them was that many thinking members of the executives of the trade unions were opposed to the attitude of the Labour Party, presumably in regard to the Amendment of the Constitution Bill.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1344" /> The easy answer to that is to refer Senator Lenihan to the two resolutions adopted by the congress representing the organised trade unions of this country.  I have already read them to the House.  They are unambiguous in opposing this change in the Constitution&mdash;the resolutions adopted by the T.U.C. and by the Congress of Irish Unions.  That is the answer to Senator Lenihan.  It is plainly mischievous to suggest that the executives of the trade unions are opposed to the Labour Party stand in this matter because the competent people to speak in regard to the trade unions are these two congresses. They have passed resolutions and I have already read them to the House.</P>
    <P>I hope that the Seanad will defeat this section of the Bill as it defeated the first paragraph because I do not think it is good for democracy in this country.  It would lead to Fianna Fáil being returned with an overall majority that they would be determined never to lose and to their continuing for the next 50 years or more as the Government of this country, which would be, if I may borrow Fianna Fáil's term, a national disaster.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Listening to the debates from the other side of the House for some days past, I have become more convinced that what Fianna Fáil will give us by this measure is complete and entire Party domination.  Senator Lenihan was put up to-night to speak for about an hour &mdash;someone says nearer an hour and a half.  He tried to persuade us that black was white.  One of the things which shiver my timbers is they will be able to persuade the people down the country that what they are saying is right.  If Fianna Fáil are ten or 15 years in Government it will be a Government of domination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some Senators may look shocked but I happened to get a cutting out of two local papers last week.  Fianna Fáil in theory in the Upper House is a different proposition from Fianna Fáil being the dominant Party in practice in the country.  I want to bring that out very much into the open because I am a practical politician. I have to live with them.  I shall tell <Col N="1345" /> the House the sort of thing that happens.  They will dominate every council and everything in Parliament if they are allowed to do it.  These are the things they are doing in a practical manner, such as happened in Tipperary last week.  Here is a quotation from the <i>Tipperary Star:</i>&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Vacant seat should go to Fianna Fáil, says Fine Gael Councillor.  At their next meeting, 6th April, Tipperary Urban Council are to co-opt a new member to fill the vacancy caused by the death of Mr. R. Costigan, the former Chairman of the Council.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>We want to talk on the high national level to-day, but I want to talk on the application stage and that is what we are interested in.  The <i>Tipperary Star</i> went on to say:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;This was stated at Monday's meeting.  The Chairman, Mr. T. O'Donohue, Fine Gael, said: That the seat was held in this chamber by Fianna Fáil and I think it is only right and fitting that it should go to the same Party.  There was a lot of trouble through the country over these co-options.  Mr. O'Donnell: I think it is only fair and just.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>On the same day the <i>Clonmel Nationalist</i> of the 7th March says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Tipperary Council will co-opt from late member's Party.  To fill the vacancy caused by the recent death of Mr. R. Costigan, Tipperary Urban Council will at their next monthly meeting co-opt a Fianna Fáil nominee on to the council.  At Monday's meeting Mr. B. O'Donnell (Labour) said that it was only right that the vacant seat should go to the Party which was represented by the late councillor.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is our experience in Tipperary that any time Fianna Fáil get an opportunity they try to take the cooption, <Col N="1346" /> and the chairman of the urban council said that although they did that he did not want to stand for it.  That is one of the things I am afraid of here, that if Fianna Fáil get dominance in Parliament they will try to do the same thing as they are doing in the urban councils and county councils almost every time they get a chance, because they do not speak the same language about fairness as the rest of the people in the country seem to speak.</P>
    <P>Senator Lenihan told us that we were going to get the type of <i>laissez faire</i> Parliament that John Stuart Mill was talking about, but I am afraid that he has forgotten to fill in the gap in the last 100 years of thought and that we are to get the type of new serfdom that Professor Hagan, who read a paper at the National University a few years ago spoke about.  The thinkers are afraid to-day that the power of the Executive will be made so great that the ordinary individual will have no rights and no responsibilities.  All this idea seems to be to give us a form of managerial Government, of State boards where the private individual has little or no rights and where the State boards will be largely creatures of the ruling Government and of the dominant class.  These are the things that are troubling and will continue to trouble people.  That is the practical application about which we will tell the people up and down the country, in the cities and towns and at the parish pumps.  That is the sort of things that are happening.  These are the applications of a dominant Party rather than the theory that has been expounded here by this political Party.  I am afraid that they want no Labour Party, no Fine Gael Party and very little opposition.</P>
    <P>Senator Dominick Murphy made a very interesting contribution to tonight's debate when he asked, if the Fine Gael Party come back in two or three years' time, or seven or eight years' time, not with 20 members but with 120 members, where are the members who will have the experience of running a Government? They cannot possibly have the experience.  This Bill which it is attempted to steamroll through the country is a most irresponsible <Col N="1347" /> measure.  Will any big powerful Government be able to control themselves if there is no Opposition in existence to bring the cold water of public opinion to bear on them?  It is strong, vital and intelligent opposition that keeps political Parties in their places and makes a Government do its job in the proper way.</P>
    <P>Take the parliamentary question in which the Government Department is brought to task and to book.  Will there be sufficient Deputies able to frame the searching and intelligent questions that will get the sort of information democracy demands from the Executive?  I doubt it.  This measure is fraught with real danger for the future of the country.  Even at this hour I hope that in some way or another we will be able to get the Government to drop it and if not we will fight them in the referendum.  It is a real challenge to each and every one of us, and we will not be stopped from saying that.</P>

      <P>I have been listening to the speeches made here and to the great concern expressed by the Fianna Fáil Senators for the Labour Party, and the attacks that they have made on the Labour Party.  When they attack the Labour Party in this House they attack the general labour people outside the House and the trade unions.  We are told by the Taoiseach and some of his henchmen that we will not put this to the people.  There is no other way of deciding it, because in the end the Government must put it to the people.  If they had the power it would not go to the people, as we can see by the attitude to-night.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Figures have been quoted for every election, but Senators did not quote the figures for the people who are not in the House.  Why was this Bill brought in the year 1958-59?  It is very easy to know.  I have the figures here for the people who stayed out of the House and were put into camp: McGirl, 7,007; Sean Rice, Kerry, 5,582; Rory Brady, 5,506; and McNamara in Cork, 4,789.  Are these people represented in the House?  No. They will not get any chance to be <Col N="1348" /> represented in the House if the people vote to do away with P.R.  We are heading for dictatorship right away, and let no one talk about anything else. There was not a word in the general election from any platform about doing away with P.R., but because Fianna Fáil got a majority on false promises, and saw the danger of a new Party coming up, this Bill was introduced. Let us be honest about the Sinn Féin men.  We admire them for their courage but no one mentioned it to-night or gave them any credit.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party is attacked because we put the Government out in 1948.  What else would we do?  The present Minister for External Affairs put the Fianna Fáil Party out in 1947 with his Supplementary Budget.  That was the decision of the people in 1948, and the Labour Party were attacked left, right and centre because we formed the Coalition Government.</P>
    <P>The internees have been released because the people in America and in London would not give the Irish representatives a very good reception, nor did we get it last St. Patrick's Day.</P>

      <P>That is the reason they are released.  The Taoiseach is putting the whole country into the category of illiterate voters.  They will cast their vote by writing an &ldquo;X&rdquo; instead of the figures 1, 2 and 3.  The Taoiseach is adopting this attitude now despite the fact that he put P.R. into the Constitution in 1937.  Of course the man is getting old.  There is an excuse for him.  He is not in touch with the people.  The Taoiseach has been defeated in this House and that is a Government defeat.  He should dissolve the Dáil as he did in 1944 when he was defeated on the Transport Bill by one vote, and give the people a chance of expressing their wishes.  We know what has happened since 1944. The Transport Bill is a failure.  Fianna Fáil told the people they would have faster trains, brighter stations and cheaper fares.  We have none of these things.  We have railway men being sacked, lines being abandoned and stations being closed&mdash;Lemass's plan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1349" /> There is no doubt the people have been lured away by the catch-cries about stability, believing that that will cause a reduction in rates, in unemployment and in emigration.  The straight vote will heal none of those ills.  I met a man down the country during the week who said he had been listening to reports on the radio about the discussion on P.R. in Leinster House, and he asked me if that would mean anything to him or the old and poor people in the country.  It is a shame to see a Government with an overall majority ignoring the pressing problems which face us.  I ask any Senator here: Do you think the country is all right?  Do you think there is no starvation here?  Do you think it is right that old age pensioners have to go to bed in the daytime and early at night because they have no fire, not being able to afford to buy fuel out of 25/- a week?  Connolly died that the workers might live and I am sure neither he nor Michael Collins visualised that there would be such destitution under a native Government. The people were asked in the last election to vote for Fianna Fáil so as to put husbands back to work, so as to bring down the cost of living. Fianna Fáil deceived the people, but I do not think they will deceive them this time.  The people will remember that the Leader of that Party repudiated what the Labour representatives were saying about the withdrawal of the food subsidies, but when Fianna Fáil got a majority in the Dáil they removed the food subsidies and raised the cost of living to the highest figure <Col N="1350" /> it ever reached.  The people do not want to hear talk about referendums.  The people I represent want work if they can get it.  The Government have failed them.  In the St. Patrick's parade abroad there will be more Irish than English or Americans, due to emigration. Yet, by this measure, Fianna Fáil are seeking an even greater majority so as to keep themselves in power for all time.  Fianna Fáil can sneer at Fine Gael and Labour but both of these Parties were in Government before Fianna Fáil ever assumed office.</P>
