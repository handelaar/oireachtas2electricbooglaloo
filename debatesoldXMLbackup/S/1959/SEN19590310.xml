    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. S. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>The main purpose of this Bill is to authorise an increase of £5,000,000 in the amount which Bord na Móna may borrow from the Central Fund or other sources for the performance of its functions.  This increase will permit the board to borrow up to a maximum of £19,000,000.  The Bill also removes the limit of £2,000,000 on the amount which the board may borrow from sources other than the Central Fund.  Total borrowings will, of course, be limited to £19,000,000.</P>
      <P>During the past year discussions have been taking place regarding the electricity generating capacity which will be required subsequent to the commissioning of the North Mayo station which was reinstated in the E.S.B. generation programme of last year.  As a result of these discussions the E.S.B. have decided to install an additional 40 MW. at Rhode in 1964 and an additional 20 MW. at Ferbane some time prior to 1965-66.  To meet the requirements of the E.S.B., Bord na Móna propose to develop new areas of bog at Boora, for the Ferbane station, and Derrygreenagh, for the Rhode station, to produce 550,000 tons of milled peat per annum.  I will shortly be introducing a Bill to provide amongst other things for increased capital for the E.S.B.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Bord na Móna must also plan to <Col N="1134" /> supply milled peat for the proposed nitrogenous fertiliser factory.</P>
    <P>In the course of their discussions with the E.S.B., Bord na Móna undertook to make available 350,000 tons of milled peat per annum from 1965-66 onwards in the Garryduff group of bogs which are situated on the opposite side of the Shannon from Blackwater bog, close to which the proposed nitrogenous fertiliser factory will be located.  It is intended that the two bogs should be developed as one unit to supply the power-station and the fertiliser factory.  When the E.S.B. erect this station, the total production of Bord na Móna will amount to 3,000,000 tons of milled peat in 1965-66, of which 2.1 million tons will be used for electricity generation, 750,000 tons for the production of briquettes in the three factories, and 150,000 tons for the nitrogenous fertiliser factory which will then be in operation, in addition to 1,000,000 tons of sod peat, of which 500,000 tons will be used for electricity generation.</P>
    <P>In the exercise of their powers under the Turf Development Acts, Bord na Móna will, it is estimated, have borrowed a total of not less than £13,928,000 by the end of this month, of which £500,000 will have been borrowed from sources other than the Central Fund.  To carry out the development programme envisaged up to 1965-66 it is estimated that Bord na Móna would require to borrow up to £22,000,000, apart from capital, estimated at £2.5 million, which they expect to obtain from their own resources.  It is considered, however, that the limit of the board's borrowing powers need not be raised at this stage beyond £19,000,000 which will assure adequate capital for the board during 1959-60 and 1960-61.  It is anticipated that further legislation making additional provision will be required in 1961.</P>
    <P>The second, minor, purpose of the Bill is to remove the limitation of £2,000,000 on the amount which Bord na Móna may borrow from sources other than the Central Fund.  The retention of this limitation is not necessary and, should an opportunity for borrowing other than from the Central Fund arise at any time, the <Col N="1135" /> board should be in a position to avail itself of it, with, of course, the consents of the Ministers for Finance and Industry and Commerce.  I shall say, however, that it unlikely that the board will be able to effect such borrowing in excess of £2,000,000.</P>
    <P>An aspect of the operations of Bord na Móna which is also deserving of mention is their production of peat moss.  Sales of this commodity were £51,000 in the year ended 31st March, 1953.  In the year ended 31st March, 1958, sales had risen to almost £120,000, about three-quarters of which were export sales.  Last year, owing to adverse weather, production fell by about 50 per cent.  The board, however, have been greatly encouraged by the steady demand for this product, and they have enlarged the Kilberry factory and are at present erecting a second factory based on allen Bog. The peat moss bog in Coolnamona, Laois, has been acquired by Bord na Móna and a third peat moss factory based on that bog is intended.  I recommend the Bill for the approval of the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>In our community, with large scale unemployment and the almost complete absence in recent years of private enterprise on any large scale in the industrial sphere, we are not inclined to be critical of proposals from the State for the expenditure of additional moneys to try to develop part of the natural resources of the country.  However, it is time somebody in this Oireachtas uttered some word about the finances of Bord na Móna and the stage it has reached.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Originally, the Turf Development Board took over certain works that had been developed by Sir John Purcell Griffith, to whom great credit is due. But when we have the kind of statement made in recent times about the financial resources of the present organisation&mdash;I shall refer to statements by the Minister later&mdash;it is really going a bit too far.  The main part of the Minister's speech to-day was in relation to the development of further generating capacity.  We all know <Col N="1136" /> what the position about generating capacity is.  It is to be seen in the programme for economic expansion issued with the approval of the Government by the Department of Finance. But I went to the trouble of making a slight calculation.  In the accounts of the E.S.B. the generating capacity of the board represents £50,000,000.  At the time the last report of the E.S.B. was issued, a quarter of that was surplus to requirements&mdash;over and above what was ever required in this country to generate ample electricity for the demand.  We know where that originated; it originated with the Minister himself.  That represents £12,000,000 of capital lying idle; it does not matter what veneer of words one puts on it.</P>
    <P>When the new capital programme was issued, there were certain parts of it which nobody could query.  I am now speaking about the new programme&mdash;the £50,000,000 which is being added to the present programme.</P>
    <P>As I said, nobody could object to it, particularly a person interested in the development of agriculture financially. I notice that the Minister for Finance promised that that was still on the stocks in relation to the Agricultural Credit Corporation.  We may take it that it is to be implemented; in any event, the commercial banks have done something in that direction.  I said at the time that the Tánaiste will spend his money but the Minister for Agriculture will not.  Nothing that has happened up to the present has caused me to change that opinion.  On the contrary, that opinion has been very much vindicated in the past few weeks by the addition to the Tánaiste's part of the programme of items which were not in the original programme.</P>
    <P>In the Dáil Debates, Volume 173, column 474, the Tánaiste said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The board has shown a substantial surplus up to 1958 and has repaid a large part of its indebtedness to the State.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Has it indeed?  It got free money, free of interest for five years, through legislation passed, I think, in 1946.  If I am out a year or so, the Minister can correct me.  The Minister says it has repaid a large part of its indebtedness <Col N="1137" /> to the State.  From the last report of Bord na Móna I find its outstanding indebtedness to the State was £11,803,607 19s. 7d. Advances from the State under the Turf Development Act repaid to the 31st March, 1957, totalled £513,586 3s. 0d.  During that year, which was the best turf year up to the present, they repaid £141,278 5s., making a total of £656,000 odd out of £12,000,000.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;A large part of its indebtedness to the State&rdquo;&mdash;my idea of a large part of something is certainly quite different from the Minister's.  I do not think 5 per cent. of something is a large part of it.  Let us not forget that some of these bogs&mdash;Clonsast, for instance&mdash;have been in operation for a long time.  The Minister went on to say: &ldquo;I am afraid 1958 will turn out to be a bad year.&rdquo;  Of course, I am not making any point about that.  We all know the kind of year last year was but we will have years like last year.  In our climate only about three years out of every ten are outstanding years, and two years out of ten you get extremely bad years like last year.  There certainly will be no repayment of capital in respect of the year 1957-58 unless it comes about in some unusual way.  It certainly will not come about from the operations of the board in the ordinary way.</P>
    <P>There is no reasonable person but will have sympathy with Sir John Purcell Griffith and the work carried on by the Turf Development Board but this kind of thing is going on for far too long.  It is not like the ground nut scheme in East Africa, which was in and out for three or four years.  If my recollection is right, the Turf Development Board were in existence for a decade.  They certainly did their best in difficult circumstances.  But the present Bord na Móna&mdash;which everybody, because of a complete lack of employment in these areas and the weakness of our rural economy, praises morning, noon and night&mdash;are to be praised for only one thing: they give a certain amount of employment.  Dividing the capital expenditure by the number of employees gives a certain <Col N="1138" /> figure.  It is much the same as the cost of industrial employment elsewhere. I do not cavil on that ground but I do cavil on the ground that if industrial employment elsewhere gives a certain turn-out per year in relation to the capital, this company does not.</P>
    <P>Whatever hope this company might have of repaying its advances, it will be completely submerged if it is to be faced with the provision of a commodity which is not required; unless it is that the E.S.B. is to be instructed by the Government to take this commodity in preference to the generating capacity already in existence.  It is time somebody said these things about this particular company.  It is not as if it were born yesterday or had not ample opportunity to develop.  I particularly object to the Minister saying it has repaid a large part of its indebtedness to the State.  It certainly has done nothing of the sort.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister should welcome the kind of criticism we have heard from Senator O'Donovan.  I should like to explain my attitude in regard to this whole legislation.  I have given it all the support I could and I believe in it.  Any confidence we have in the scheme or any desire we have for its success should not blind us to the defects of the scheme or to the defects in any of the operations connected with the scheme.  Bord na Móna has been sufficiently long in existence now to bear the light of critical examination and the more it gets of that, if it is helpful, the better.  All of these State institutions would be the better for helpful criticism where that is demanded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Quite frankly, I should have liked the Minister to have dealt more widely with the whole policy of turf development in the future, and not only turf development itself but every operation ancillary to it.  He should have availed of the fact that he is asking for extended financial facilities to give us broader outlines of what is envisaged for the future.  The development of our peat resources has progressed under great difficulties.  It has faced a good deal of scepticism and there were many doubting Thomases, but it has gone on and there is no doubt about <Col N="1139" /> that.  I am quite sure it did not satisfy all the people who were driving along in a chariot doing their utmost to make the scheme a success.  There is no doubt that there are many defects in the organisation to-day and it may be that the time has come for an appraisal of the shortcomings of the organisation by an outsider.</P>
    <P>In relation to any State schemes, it would be wise and courageous for a Minister to have an examination of them, how they function, and how they are administered, in order to see what might be done to improve them.  The truth is that they will command the confidence of the country only by the value of the service which they give. The area of peat bogs that has been out away must be very considerable. On various occasions I have raised the question as to how we are to use the residue of cutaway bog, what fields and forests we will get from that residue.  I should like to hear from the Minister what area of bog has been cut away and what plans there are for development in that regard, which is even more essential than peat production.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Donovan raised a vital point.  This country has only a limited amount of capital for investment and we all know how difficult it is to get money for the most worthwhile objectives. It does not seem desirable that we should have double investment and the Minister should feel obliged to explain to the fullest his view in regard to the point raised by Senator O'Donovan.</P>
    <P>The Minister made one point rather briefly, so briefly and in such a low voice, that I felt he was rather inclined not to let us hear or know its full implications.  It was in relation to an aspect of this peat development problem.  I did not quite hear what he said, and I will ask him to explain it further, but it was in relation to a nitrogenous manure plant.  I do not think the Minister should deal with this, and I am not at all influenced by what anyone else has said on this anywhere; I am giving my own opinion. If we are to have a nitrogenous manure industry we ought to know <Col N="1140" /> what it will entail so far as the farmer is concerned.  We have enough loads on our shoulders at the moment.  This is a point which I used to make in the other House in 1924, 1925, 1926 and so on, when other people were not there.  It is not a point on which I like to dwell, but the truth is that the farmers feel that the burdens that they have to carry, in regard to industrial development, are of such a nature that they are a definite handicap in meeting competition from abroad.  There is nothing more vital to the farmers' economy than the purchase and proper utilisation of artificial manures.  If we are to have an artificial manure plant producing nitrogenous fertiliser let us know beforehand, and let us make certain that we will not have to pay more for the product than we have to pay at the moment.  If it means that the farmers have to pay more, the factory will be closed down before it has been declared open.</P>
    <P>It is very difficult to get farmers to apply artificial fertiliser to the extent required by the soil and we have to give them all sorts of encouragement, &ldquo;pep&rdquo; talks, newspaper advertisements and so on, and, with all that, we are not very successful compared with what is being done across the water, across the Border, and in Western Europe.  I put it to my farmer friends on the other side of the House&mdash;what will happen if we have to pay 5/- or 6/- a hundredweight more for nitrogenous manure here than we would have to pay if it were not manufactured by ourselves?  We will not use it at all and we will close up the factory before it is opened.</P>
    <P>The Minister must have goodwill on this, goodwill based on informed and authentic knowledge which will satisfy the people that they will not have to carry an additional burden.  I suggest that before the Minister takes steps to make it concrete he should go to the utmost limits to establish the fact that the product will not cost the farmers more than they pay for artificial manures at the moment.  If he does not do that, he will reduce agricultural production instead of increasing it and deter people from using an essential commodity.  That is not the sort of development that anyone wants to see <Col N="1141" /> in agriculture.  It is the Minister's problem and I am warning him of that aspect as I see it.  At the same time, I stand for the development of any type of progressive enterprise in this country which will be profitable for the country, and when I speak of its being profitable, I take into account the benefits derived from the use of the product.  The use of nitrogenous manure is vital for the country.  To put up another industry merely for the sake of putting up another industry, will be an unwise action.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanODonovan" hpid="Seán Ó Donnabháin Seán Ó Donnabháin">
      <NameTxt>Seán Ó Donnabháin</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to join in this debate mainly for the purpose of congratulating ourselves on the fact that the development of our peat resources has been such a success, mainly through the efforts of Bord na Móna.  It has not, as predicted, &ldquo;gone up the spout&rdquo; any more than wheat or beet.  The future development of this industry is something we should all work for and we should not formulate opposition as Senator Baxter has done.  I do not think that any Government, Minister, or the Oireachtas will favour the innovation of a big industry, such as the manufacture of nitrogenous fertiliser, without adequate investigation and information as to its probable success.  There may be doubting Thomases to say it will go up some spout or other but there will not be a <i>fait accompli</i> without adequate investigation.</P>
      <P>I want to refer to the interesting subsidiaries that have been developed as a consequence of the success of the peat industry.  Senator Baxter referred to a few of them.  I should like the Minister to give the Seanad an outline of what the silviculture position will be as a result of the removal of peat from the bogs.  I understand that some investigations and experiments have taken place.  The utilisation of the waste lands, subsequent to the removal of the greater part of the peat, will redound to the credit of the country and to the success of forestry.  Apart from that, there is the matter of the agricultural utilisation of the cutaway bogs but, as I understand the position at the moment, the silviculture side is the more important one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1142" /> There are the three developments&mdash; silviculture, agriculture and horticulture&mdash;as a sequel to the development of the peat industry.  After the emergency, there were ricks of peat mould in the Phoenix Park and St. Anne's and nobody would do anything with it or take it away.  It now transpires that much greater use of it could have been made in horticulture. When I was a youngster, the only thing we knew about development from the bogs was the peat moss which, to some extent, was used for animal bedding.  It was scarcely thought of except in a few country places as little for poultry.  Now, peat moss is used to a great extent for horticultural purposes, for bedding for animals and for deep litter for poultry. These are great developments and are the sequel to the success of the peat industry as a result of the activity of Bord na Móna.</P>
    <P>If milled peat can satisfactorily be utilised to produce nitrogenous manure, that is the ideal use to which it can be put.  I understand from some published documents that the production of electricity from peat at some of our E.S.B. stations is the cheapest system. I may be wrong but that is the position as I understand it.  If it is not the cheapest but if it is cheap enough to be economically satisfactory for the country, it would be the best system to adopt.  With the exception of our having atomic energy, it would be the best system to utilise in the meantime, for the new nitrogenous fertiliser factory.</P>
    <P>I should like to know if there has been any progress and, if so, to what extent, in connection with the utilisation of the heat generated in the turf-burning stations.  One sees these immense cooling towers.  It has often struck me as a pity that there should be this waste of energy.  Heat is purposely being dissapated for the purpose, I understand, of conserving the water supply.  Would it be possible &mdash;through, I presume, an extended pipeline&mdash;to use that heat for the heating of glasshouses or any house requiring a high temperature to grow horticultural products or even agricultural products?  Could we grow a <Col N="1143" /> large amount of agricultural or horticultural products under glass through the utilisation of the heat which we try to reduce at present by way of these cooling towers?</P>
    <P>There is also the possibility of using that heat for drying lofts.  I can anticipate immediately the objection: &ldquo;You would have to transport your corn into the bog areas in which the turf-burning stations are situated.&rdquo;  In view of the bad year we experienced last year, there is a possibility that there could be mass transportation of wet, saturated wheat to a drying-loft.  All we are doing at the moment is trying to dissipate that heat.  Has any progress been made in that regard?  It would be a great advance if that heat could be used for agricultural and, certainly, for horticultural purposes and, possibly, for the purpose of storing many products.  What occurs to me at present is the storing of grain.  If there were an excess some year, it could be stored in safe conditions in the vicinity of these turf-burning stations where heat is available for nothing, so to speak.</P>
    <P>The Seanad should not stand in the way of increasing the capital of a board which has done such magnificent work for the country during the emergency and post-emergency years and which, I hope, will do good work in the future.  One could not expect a private industry to undertake this work.  In such a case, the State must necessarily step in.  If we look back at the history of the country since the emergency we will see that, if we were not all cutting turf ourselves, Bord na Móna were helping us out and, to a tremendous extent, lessening the hardships which the people would have had to bear as a result of the fuel shortage at that period.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOQuigley" hpid="Mr. O'Quigley Mr. O'Quigley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Seán Ó Donnabháin adopts the attitude that criticism should not be made from this side of the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>He rather suggests that somebody will stand in the way of this Bill.</P>
      <P>I take it that that means the people on this side of the House.  At the same time, Senator Seán O'Donovan had some very useful suggestions to make. He asked a number of questions.  The general tone of the earlier part of his speech was resentment that any criticism should be expressed or any question as to progress or cost should be asked by Senators on this side of the House.  It is probably the best tribute to Bord na Móna and indeed, to the Minister, that intelligent criticism of the board's functioning is made by speakers on all sides of the House. Senator Seán O'Donovan also referred to the attitude of the doubting Thomases when Bord na Móna was being established but, apparently, he does not recollect that there was a great deal more doubt at the time when the Shannon scheme was being established and that were it not for the E.S.B. of modern times the functions of Bord na Móna would be a great deal more restricted than they are.</P>
      <P>When reading the Minister's speech on the Second Reading of this Bill in the Dáil and listening to him this afternoon, it struck me that Bord na Móna was something in the nature of a subsidiary of the E.S.B.  Indeed, the Minister in the Dáil stated that practically all the increased production would be sold to the E.S.B. and the aim of the board was to keep the cost of the E.S.B. as low as possible and to remunerate their own capital.</P>
      <P>The ordinary people have some interest in the functions of Bord na Móna.  In particular, housewives have some interest in the activities of Bord na Móna.  My information is that briquettes are not available in anything like the quantity which is necessary to meet the demand for domestic purposes.  I understand that there is some difficulty among fuel merchants in getting stocks of turf and briquettes. I remember on one occasion about a year ago looking for briquettes from a fuel merchant.  I was told at that time that briquettes were not sold to fuel merchants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1145" /> I see briquettes on sale in most undesirable places&mdash;in grocers' shops &mdash;and if I understand anything about the hygiene regulations it is very contrary to the hygiene regulations to allow turf to be sold in a place where ice-cream, butter and tea are exposed for sale.  I hold no brief for the fuel merchants but if briquettes are available they should not be made available in a manner which does not do the community at large any good.</P>
    <P>I have been wondering in relation to this particular Bill to what extent the Minister or Bord na Móna have in mind popularising the use of turf among householders generally.  There is a great deal of advertising, including sponsored programmes on the radio, for the use of electricity and it does seem to me to be a pity that since the prejudice against the use of turf was broken down, of necessity, during the war years, greater effort is not being made by Bord na Móna to popularise the use of turf for household purposes.</P>
    <P>Many people prefer to burn turf rather than coal in their living room grates, particularly in view of the increasing prices of coal in recent times.  There is one deficiency which turf has as against coal for domestic purposes and I wonder whether any experiments are being carried out in relation to it, namely, the amount of soot which is caused by turf in the narrow chimneys of modern houses, which increases the risk of fire.</P>
    <P>I understand from the Press that Bord na Móna have developed, through their scientists, certain types of uses for turf which have not been developed in other countries where turf is used.  It is probably within the capacity of the board's scientists to discover ways and means of eliminating the dangers inherent in the use of turf in modern houses.  There should be emphasis on turf production, not merely for the purpose of supplying the E.S.B. with fuel, but for domestic purposes, in order to reduce our bill for imported coal.</P>
    <P>There was a point raised by Senator Seán O'Donovan and Senator Baxter in relation to the activities and functions <Col N="1146" /> of Bord na Móna which also occurred to me in a different connection. There are very few opportunities for commenting upon the functions of a body like Bord na Móna.  This Bill raises the question as to the relationship between a statutory body and the Legislature or the Minister and the public in general.</P>
    <P>No doubt, the board is obliged to render certain accounts and to make a report but, beyond that, it does not seem that anybody in particular can influence in any direction the policy of a body such as this&mdash;perhaps the Minister may be able to do it&mdash;but there are useful suggestions which might be made from time to time, suggestions such as Senator Seán O'Donovan has made, to a body like this but there does not seem to be any machinery whatever for making such suggestions in an effective fashion to these semi-State bodies nor is there any way of dealing with any maladministration that might possibly arise in relation to them.</P>
    <P>As the Minister said, Bord na Móna is creating a certain amount of employment and will create more employment. Indeed, as a person who came from an area where there was a great deal of bog and nothing but gloom about it, I have always welcomed the development of the activities of this particular body.  I hope that further use of the land which is left free by Bord na Móna will be possible and that, as a result of investigations undertaken by this body or some other State Department, the use of cutaway bog can be made an economic proposition for the people living in the vicinity.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFirmullaghOReilly" hpid="Mr. O'Reilly Mr. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>We should not be so hardboiled in our reception of this measure.  This Bill, in so far as it proposes to increase the capital of Bord na Móna to the tune of £5,000,000, should be welcomed as indicating further development by Bord na Móna. In the past Bord na Móna have given great national service.  If it had not been for the activities of this organisation from 1940 to 1945 this country would have been in grave difficulty. In those years Bord na Móna had to <Col N="1147" /> carry on in circumstances which prevented them from making the progress they might have made in normal circumstances.  We were all very loud in our praise of the work of Bord na Móna at that time.  It is, therefore, surprising to note an overcautious financial outlook on the part of Senator O'Donovan.  The changing value of money has necessitated a steep increase in the capital requirements of the board in view of the developments that are planned.  If that over-cautious attitude were carried too far very little could be achieved.  In all things in life there must be a calculated risk.</P>
      <P>When legislative provision was being made for the cement industry there was caustic criticism in Dáil Éireann because that commodity could be dumped in this country at a price cheaper than it was being sold in the country of origin because there was a surplus to be disposed of.  However, once the initial difficulties were overcome the Irish cement industry was able to give to our people a product cheaper and better than could be imported. I hope we shall be able to make the same statement in regard to the nitrogenous fertiliser industry which it is proposed to start.</P>
      <P>It must be appreciated that an undertaking of this nature is bound to have growing pains.  Undertakings outside the country could create difficulties for it.  However, I feel sure the farming community would not expect that nitrogenous fertiliser could be sold cheaper than it could be dumped, if there was a world surplus, by foreign combines, or disapprove of giving protection to this new industry in such circumstances.  I am confident that this concern will be able to supply this commodity to Irish agriculture at a competitive price so as to expand Irish agriculture and the national wealth.</P>

      <P>May I ask the Minister a question on a subject to which Senator O'Quigley alluded? The Minister is aware that in Dublin city briquettes from Bord na Móna are very welcome because Dublin <Col N="1148" /> householders prefer briquettes to ordinary turf from the point of view of storage, heat and economy.  I should like the Minister to tell the House when it could be expected that a reasonable supply would be available again in Dublin city, when the new factories will be established and when they will be actually in production and able to deliver in the city.</P>

      <P>I should like to add my voice to those who have already expressed their welcome for this development. One of the chief criticisms we hear is about the concentration of our industries in the capital city.  Everybody deplores the fall in population in rural Ireland and advocates the development of industries there.  We need a few more industries such as those operated by Bord na Móna who, in my opinion, have performed miracles.  We all know the state the bogs were in all over the country.  Very few people visualised the progress that has been made.  It is a fact, I understand, that electricity is now being produced by the use of peat more cheaply than it could be produced by other means. That has been a very useful addition to our resources particularly, as has been stated, during the years of the emergency.</P>
      <P>Turf has helped the development of industries.  I was amazed to hear any criticism of this Bill.  I thought the measure would have been welcomed by all sides of the House.  It is all very well to point to the risks involved in the expenditure of capital for development but if the Minister had taken a pessimistic view of the various projects he has undertaken very little progress would have been made.</P>

      <P>Coming from a county where Bord na Móna have been actively engaged for 20 years and having seen what they have done, I could not but support this proposal to give them more capital and allow them to expand their great industry.  I come from County Offaly.  I remember 25 years ago when about one-third of the <Col N="1149" /> county was waste bogland.  From Shannonbridge to County Kildare, the whole heart of the Midlands was a derelict waste known as the Bog of Allen.  If members went down across the Bog of Allen to Shannonbridge, saw the men employed there and the transformation that has taken place in that derelict waste over the past 20 years, nobody would oppose the suggestion to give Bord na Móna more money to proceed with their great work.</P>
      <P>Bord na Móna are the greatest organised employment agency in this country.  They made a very modest beginning but against all odds and insults advanced steadily over the years until to-day they produce light and power to compete with oil, petrol and other imported fuels.  It is a wonderful achievement.  It is a wonderful thing to go across that vast plain of the Midlands and see thousands of men working round the clock.  I certainly would like to add my voice to those who have spoken on the Bill and to say that this House should be unanimous in giving them the concession asked for in this Bill to allow them to expand in the future.  If they make half the progress they made in the past, they are entitled to the full support of the House.</P>

      <P>They had to build up a new organisation, devise new techniques and design machines to exploit the bogs of Ireland for the production of fuel for generating stations and they have done so with amazing success&mdash;such success that it is now clear that milled peat from these Irish bogs can be supplied to the stations at much less cost than any other solid fuels available to this country.</P>
      <P>In doing so they have, as Senator Hogan and others pointed out, brought new life to what were the most difficult parts of the country from an employment and social point of view. Indeed, in the new towns and old towns surrounding the boglands, there is now a completely different outlook from that which prevailed a few years ago.  It is satisfactory to know that further progress in that connection is possible&mdash;not a great deal of further progress unfortunately because we are reaching the point at which we can see the end of the development, at least as far as concerns the production of peat for fuel purposes by the processes which Bord na Móna have developed, as the larger bogs for which these processes are suitable will be all fully developed in the course of the next six or seven years.  Whether Bord na Móna will be able to devise methods by which the blanket bogs of the West can be utilised or whether other developments in these areas will enable them to benefit to the same extent as the Midland areas benefited from Bord na Móna, I cannot say.  But it is clear that the establishment and progress of Bord na Móna is one of the great achievements of which the country can be proud.  I can only hope we will be able to discover other forms of development equally beneficial in the years immediately ahead of us.</P>
      <P>Apart, however, from the board's success in a technical and national sense, they have been equally successful in a financial sense.  Personally, I am always a bit apprehensive when Senator John O'Donovan starts quoting figures, because he can produce the most amazing results.</P>

      <P>The apprehensions were often felt by the Senator's colleagues as well as by myself.  As far as Bord na Móna are concerned, they have repaid completely the liability to the Exchequer they took over from the Turf Development Board and they have met their obligations to the Exchequer in respect of new advances as they fell due.  The entire debt taken over from the old Turf Development Board has been discharged.  The amount of money remitted by the Act of 1946 was £31,000&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and no subtantial difference in the board's accounts resulted therefrom.  In respect of advances to the board for their subsequent development programmes, the payment to the Exchequer is on an annuity basis and these annuities have been paid as they became due.  Indeed, the board have a respectable sum on reserve.  They have had a bad year however and the accounts for 1958 will be very different from those of the previous year because of the exceptional weather circumstances which prevailed and which are bound to involve them in considerable losses of output not offset by any diminution in costs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The statement that the E.S.B. has generating capacity in excess of its requirements is nonsense.  I think it is desirable that that nonsense should be disposed of as quickly as possible.  In the circumstances of this year we would have had to cut off some power users if the generating capacity of the E.S.B. had been any less than it was. I can see that this year is an exceptional year.  The board must necessarily have stand-by plant because circumstances will arise which will reduce the output of its power stations based on peat, or its water-powered stations, or the stations which are equipped to use only imported oil and coal.  In any event when one talks about surplus generating capacity one must look at the picture of the demand for current, which rises to a peak in every week and every month and every year.  Capacity must be sufficient to <Col N="1152" /> meet the yearly peak demand which means that for a large part of the year some of it will be standing idle.  Also, any intelligent plan for national development must provide that there will always be power available to meet any industrial requirements that may arise.</P>
    <P>The slump in the demand for electricity which was recorded in 1956 has passed and in the last two years the growth in the demand for power has proceeded at the rate of 7 per cent. per year.  The board is now planning its future generating programme on the assumption that the demand for power will continue to increase at that rate which is in accordance with European experience generally.  It is because of that assumption that new stations are now being included in the E.S.B. programme.  These new stations will not be in production until 1964 or 1965.  It takes about five years from the date of the decision to put in a new power station to the day on which that station comes into commission, so that it is now that the programme for 1964, 1965 and 1966 must be prepared.  It takes perhaps even longer for Bord na Móna to organise its side of the activities so as to ensure that reserve stocks of fuel will be available for a new station when it is brought into commission.</P>
    <P>The new programme which I mentioned in my introductory speech is being fulfilled and Bord na Móna have now to proceed with the capital investments involved in the extension of their operations to meet the full requirements of the E.S.B. as they arise.  It is perfectly true that the E.S.B. is Bord na Móna's main customer. In addition to fuel for the E.S.B. is Bord na Móna are aiming to produce about 500,000 tons of sod peat for use in industry and for domestic purposes.  They are producing substantial quantities of peat moss mainly for export and plan to put in two more peat moss factories to meet the growing demand for that product. They are producing now about 50,000 tons of peat briquettes every year and plan to produce 250,000 tons.  In addition, they will have the obligation <Col N="1153" /> of producing the peat required for the fertiliser factory.  All of these are substantial operations apart altogether from the fuel requirements of the E.S.B. but the main market for the 4,000,000 tons which Bord na Móna ultimately hope to produce will be the power stations.</P>
    <P>The whole plan is to ensure that the fuel reserves of the country are utilised in the most economic manner, which involves the erection of power stations on the perimeter of the bogs which are being developed.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Quigley referred to the desirability of Bord na Móna undertaking a plan for popularising turf as a domestic fuel.  Bord na Móna were engaged in such activity but had to drop it last year as they had not the supplies to meet the demand.  I was surprised to hear Senator O'Quigley referring to the high and increasing cost of coal.  One of the problems of Bord na Móna is to calculate the effect on their future planning of the rapidly decreasing prices of coal.  They are proceeding with the erection of these new turf briquetting factories.  The existing factory at Lullymore has been overhauled and one new factory will be in production towards the end of this year or early next year and the other later on in 1960.  By the end of 1960 there should be a supply of turf briquettes equal to the demand for them.  They are a very popular fuel and Bord na Móna are anxious to get ahead as quickly as possible with the expansion of output.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Quigley referred also to the old question of the relationship between statutory boards and the Oireachtas.  I do not believe in this humbug that the previous Government indulged in, or pretending to have this matter under consideration and being about to do something about it. I do not think there is any need to do anything about it.  I believe the existing system is adequate to meet any reasonable need there is for parliamentary control.  Ministers have got power in relation to all these boards.  There is an obligation to submit annual accounts and reports and there are frequent occasions for debate on their activities such as there is to-day.  I <Col N="1154" /> think it is not desirable to do more about that.  The whole aim in setting up statutory boards was to give them the freedom of a commercial enterprise, to release them from day-to-day control of Parliament and we cannot have it both ways.  It is time that we clarified our minds in that regard.  The theoretical case for closer parliamentary control has been examined not only in this country but in others and found to be unsustainable.</P>
    <P>With regard to the possibility of utilising the lands under the bogs for afforestation or other purposes after the turf had been cleared off, that is a problem that will arise in about 20 years' time and certainly there is no urgency about it.  Some experimental work has been done in areas where there is cutaway bog.  There seems little doubt that some production, whether of forestry or something else, will be possible in these areas when Bord na Móna operations have ceased.</P>
    <P>I mentioned in the Dáil that a technical committee was meeting to consider the various aspects of the problem of the utilisation of the waste heat or surplus heat of power stations for horticultural or other purposes.  I expect to get the report of that committee soon.  I could not at this stage attempt to forecast the character of its report.  It is quite obvious that, apart from the technical aspect of the matter, economic and commercial considerations will arise also.  I think that covers all the points which were raised.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
    <P>Agreed to take remaining stages to-day.</P>
    <P>Bill considered in Committee.</P>
    <P Just="Center">SECTION 1.</P>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That Section 1 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I say on this section, which is the principle of the Bill, that it is difficult to understand the Minister's approach to this?  I thought this House was one in which the members were at liberty to make constructive suggestions about any <Col N="1155" /> Bill which we were expected to pass. That is what I was trying to do.  I thought I had the right to do it and I felt that I was doing it.  I think the Minister can recall on a previous occasion here years ago when he was, so to speak, in his infancy in regard to this whole policy, he commended the support which he got from me. I do not want encomiums from the Minister.  I do not blow hot and cold on any matter.  I prefer to let the Minister and the House know where I stand.</P>
      <P>My point of view about the part of the proposal the Minister touched very lightly upon &mdash; the nitrogenous manure plant &mdash; is as follows: I presume some of these funds will be utilised for some work in connection with that development &mdash; I do not know: the Minister did not make that very clear, or to what extent.  If there is to be such a development as that in the national interest, the farmers ought not to have to pay for it.  I am against it if the farmers have to pay for it.  I do not think our economy ought to be built on that basis.</P>
      <P>The Minister and others may say: &ldquo;We do not know.  We have to get the thing started.  We have to do a great deal more investigation.&rdquo;  As far as I can get any impression of what is in his mind, it seems to me that the Minister thinks that this is past the stage of investigation and that it is practically a decision.  That may be.  Other people, however, may also have to make decisions in this regard.  I suggest to the Minister that it is terribly important to take the other people with him because they are the people who will be buying the nitrogenous fertiliser, not the Minister.  If they feel they have to pay the price of a new development of Bord na Móna, there may be a very chilly atmosphere and I do not want that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am just as keen and enthusiastic that our peat resources be fully developed as anybody in the country, not excluding the Minister.  However, I do not believe that a branch of that industry ought to be developed at the <Col N="1156" /> expense of a section of the people of the country.  If it has to be developed in the national interest, let the nation pay for it but not a section of our farmers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I admire the Minister for Industry and Commerce very much.  Many years ago I used to admire him a great deal more than I do now.  Then I began to look at his statements analytically.  He starts off with a proposition at the beginning of a paragraph.  He leads on to a conclusion.  But there is no link between the various statements that lead to that conclusion, none whatever. He did the same thing to-day.</P>
      <P>The Minister did not answer my point about his own statement to the Dáil that the board showed a substantial surplus up to 1958 and repaid a large part of its indebtedness to the State.  I did not criticise how Bord na Móna attempted to do their business. I said it is time we stopped climbing on the band wagon as we saw three or four Senators on the other side do.</P>
      <P>The statement was made that Bord na Móna is &ldquo;the greatest organised employment agency we have in this country&rdquo;&mdash; a body that employs 5,000 people, a body with a capital which will now be brought up to £19,000,000. There are three or four other agencies that employ more people than that.</P>

      <P>I shall leave it at that.  The Minister suggested that Bord na Móna failed to vindicate my depressing forecast.  On the contrary, I was always interested in it.  No sensible person could take a different view.  Here we have a vast natural resource &mdash; one of our few.  It may not be of as great value as some of the natural resources in other countries, but it is worth putting a good deal of money into investigating it.  It is not my argument that it should not be developed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My argument is that the Minister <Col N="1157" /> should place the cards on the table. I think the Minister knows that the day may come again when, with the climate we have in this country, you will find the same attitude towards capital expenditure as existed here in 1956.  A large part of it was generated by the Minister's colleague, the Minister for Health, Deputy MacEntee, in the spring and summer of 1956.  A large part of it was then generated underground by the Minister for Health who came out in the open about it subsequently.  The Minister is getting in ahead of that particular climate.  From the point of view of executive action, more power to the Minister.  However, there is no question of my making any depressing forecast, and so on.</P>
    <P>This board is 25 years in existence one way or another.  Even if you come to the period since it was established in its present form, it is just over 12 years in existence.  The Turf Development Board had certain assets.  The preliminary work was done when the present Bord na Móna came into existence.  The Minister said: &ldquo;Milled peat can be supplied at a much lower cost than X, Y or Z.&rdquo;  If a large amount of money is required for a purpose and you can secure money free of interest for a number of years, then it is almost certain that you can supply anything for nearly nothing for a number of years.  You only have to think of the prime costs.  The Minister knows that is true just as well as I do.</P>
    <P>I am doubtful that these bogs will, in fact, have paid off the capital invested in them by the time their useful life comes to an end.  Let us face and accept that fact.  I see no point in hoodwinking ourselves or in blindfolding our minds in relation to this matter &mdash; and there is no criticism of Bord na Móna in that.  I know the kind of effort the men attached to it have made to investigate matters.  I know the number of different approaches they have made to their problems from time to time.</P>
    <P>By far the most important statement I made during my few words was that there was a 25 per cent. surplus generating capacity in this country in the last few years brought about by the present <Col N="1158" /> Minister for Industry and Commerce. I stand over that statement.  There is no use in the Minister's saying: &ldquo;Capacity must cover peak demands.&rdquo; I learned that from the Minister.  It is the last thing that anybody interested would seriously think of.  If he read the E.S.B. reports, for example, he would go out and say: &ldquo;Look at the very lowest demand.  They have four times as much capacity as the demand.&rdquo;  If the Minister was just saying it to emphasise it, it is O.K. with me but if it it supposed to be an answer to my case, then it is not.</P>
    <P>The Minister also said: &ldquo;The slump in the demand for electricity in 1956 has passed.&rdquo;  There was not a slump in 1956.  It was merely that, owing to a combination of circumstances, the increase turned out to be only 4.6 per cent. or so.  The fantastic basis on which the Minister and his Department, or wherever it came from, prepared this generating programme, that is, a doubling of demand for electricity every six years &mdash; in 1954, just before the inter-Party Government came into office, it was every five years: it would double every five years &mdash;is one that only a sociological lunatic would think of.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am replying to the statements made by the Minister on the Second Reading.  I can do that now or on the Final Stage, if we are taking all stages to-day.  I do not mind.  I have the option of doing so on either of the two.  The Minister says the demand is increasing at the rate of 7 per cent. per annum.  There is a very big difference between an increase of 7 per cent. per annum and the increase of 13 to 16 per cent. per annum that would be required to double the demand for electricity every five or six years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister also took up Senator <Col N="1159" /> O'Quigley when he talked of rapidly increasing coal prices.  Taking any period, except the past four, five or six months, one will see that coal prices have been rapidly increasing. The climate of inflation looks like being around the corner again&mdash; super-inflation this time.  If that is to be the case, the prices of coal will go up again.</P>
    <P>The Minister also referred to the operations of statutory bodies.  Again, the Minister is quite satisfied that they are to be free in their day-to-day operations. But there is a big difference between that and the serious problem which the people are aware of in every country.  The fact that no satisfactory solution is put forward in any country is a very different thing.  The Swedes, contrary to what the Minister said, have a solution.  That solution has been looked at.  It was not adopted.  These boards were brought before a Parliamentary Committee the same as secretaries are brought before the Public Accounts Committee.  There is no use in the Minister saying that the existing system is adequate.  It is not recognised in any country as being adequate. The fact that you have a problem and nobody sees the solution does not suggest that the existing system is adequate.  My purpose in drawing attention to these matters is that you come up against all kinds of problems in relation to them.</P>
    <P>Senator Seán O'Donovan, my namesake, talked about silviculture.  Let me be honest.  It is a fleabite.  The total area of bogs is a fleabite in relation to one year's forestry.  At a time when there were very few or no forests it might be regarded as a fairly substantial thing.</P>
    <P>There is no question of our opposing this Bill.  It is right to draw attention to the fact that the Minister is now bringing in a number of Bills &mdash; he is taking time by the forelock &mdash; involving very large capital expenditure.  In other words, he is hypothecating the resources of the Central Fund for his own purpose.  I paid a tribute to the Minister's effectiveness as an executive. Mind you, there are two sides to good <Col N="1160" /> administration &mdash; the effectiveness as an executive and the thought element behind it.  Sometimes the effectiveness as an executive militates against the thought behind it.  I intend to make some remarks of a similar nature at a later stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOQuigley" hpid="Mr. O'Quigley Mr. O'Quigley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make one or two observations on a few matters at this stage of the Bill. Senator John O'Donovan referred to one of them &mdash; the relationship which ought to exist between the semi-State bodies and the Legislature.  The Minister squelched the whole matter by saying that in other countries there is no solution to it and that in our circumstances there was no need to deal with the problem.  The suggestion that this was under consideration by the inter-Party Government was described as so much nonsense.</P>
      <P>I have a recollection that the Minister's colleague, Dr. Ryan, Minister for Finance, had something to say on this very problem within the past year or so.  The Minister for Finance was dealing with some Bill like this. The matter had been raised by Deputy McQuillan.  The Minister said that was a matter about which he was concerned.  We are not all idiots.  We cannot all be put into that category by the statement that there is no necessity to deal with it. Senator John O'Donovan pointed out that there is a certain system in operation in Sweden.  The fact remains that thinking people in this country are not at all satisfied with the situation.  There is no problem so great that we cannot find a solution to it if we spend sufficient time thinking about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other matter that the Minister talked about was the surplus electricity being generated.  I have a clear recollection of a feeling of disappointment when we were discussing the Turf Development Bill in 1957. At that time &mdash; if my recollection is right&mdash;it was the Minister himself who spoke about the surplus electricity that was being generated and gave some indication that there was not likely to be any great demand for increased power in the future.  If we took the Minister's word on trust at <Col N="1161" /> that time, can we now be blamed if, since the Minister last spoke on turf development, we were of the view that there was surplus electricity being generated and less expansion in relation to turf development?</P>
    <P>I am somewhat disappointed to note what the Minister said at the conclusion of his speech &mdash; that there does not seem to be much prospect of Bord na Móna or any other body going into areas of bog which are not large enough to enable Bord na Móna to operate on with the present machinery.  There are large areas of bog where I would have supposed there would be some development to provide much needed employment.</P>

      <P>There is just one matter upon which I should like to comment in regard to the nitrogenous fertiliser project.  The only decision the Government have taken so far is to reserve the Blackwater Bog for that project.  The examination of the technical processes to be used and the estimation of the cost factors involved are now proceeding.  It is clear from the point of view of agricultural needs that a much greater utilisation of nitrogenous fertilisers would be desirable and the overall objective of the Government would be to bring about an increased utilisation of nitrogenous fertilisers.</P>
      <P>Clearly, that cannot be done by increasing the price.  The aim of the Government in relation to this matter would be to endeavour to devise a method by which a new and important industrial chemical industry could be established while at the same time making the utilisation of nitrogenous fertilisers on a larger scale more attractive to farmers.  The indications so far have suggested that, assuming that no technical difficulty arises, the utilisation of milled peat rather than some other fuel for the production of synthetic gas is likely to be the cheapest method.</P>
      <P>I do not want to get into any further arguments with Senator Professor O'Donovan.  He appears to regard himself as being under the obligation to reply to every argument and disagree with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1162" /> So far as the capacity of the E.S.B. is concerned, it is true that the growth in the demand which was anticipated in 1955-56, when the 1954 generation programme which I had prepared in discussion with the E.S.B. and which was set out in a White Paper circulated to each House of the Oireachtas, did not take place.  It seemed, consequently, that if the full programme was completed a surplus of generation capacity would emerge.  The Government then in office in 1956, facing that situation, cut away a very substantial part of that programme.  They eliminated from it stations representing 180 m.w. capacity.  Even at that stage they were in my view far too pessimistic in assuming that the growth in demand would not recover, if not to the grade which had existed up to 1954, at least to a rate which would equate to that common throughout Western Europe.</P>
    <P>In 1957 we had to reinstate in that programme the North Mayo station which had been eliminated the previous year and which will now be required at the earliest date the board can bring it into commission.  Certain industrial developments which we can foresee at the moment&mdash;the oil refinery, the Cork shipyard project, certain mining projects, and other projects which are contemplated, although not yet completed &mdash; will increase the industrial demand for electricity very substantially.  It may be, and indeed, I hope, that the growth in demand for current will begin to rise again even beyond the present annual figure of 7 per cent. and back to something like the 11 or 12 per cent. which was our experience up to 1954.</P>
    <P>With regard to smaller bogs the statement I made was that the methods and machines which Bord na Móna have developed would not be suitable for utilisation on them.  Certain private interests are undertaking turf development on smaller bogs for commercial sale and have been encouraged to do so and I know that the Bord na Móna research station is continuously investigating new processes, new machines, new devices that could be utilised if not on smaller bogs possibly on the blanket bogs which offer an entirely different problem for their <Col N="1163" /> technicians to solve.  I could not forecast whether or not they are likely to solve them.</P>
    <P>On the question of the relationship between Parliament and statutory boards I have expressed the opinion that that is not a problem.  Others may think that it is.  The previous Government said every six months that they had it under consideration.  It may be Senator O'Donovan knows of some solution of the problem but he does not appear to have advised them about it. They never completed their consideration of it.  I do not concede there is a problem at all.  The existing procedures are quite adequate and the idea behind the assertion that there is a problem is that of having it two ways; of having complete parliamentary control over these boards and at the same time giving them the freedom of action which any such enterprise must have if it is to succeed.</P>
    <P>I was interestd in Senator John O'Donovan's statement that much greater inflation is just around the corner.  He must welcome that prospect because it would at least give the opportunity that in 1962 it would be possible to reissue the leaflet which was so effective in 1954.</P>

    <Title>Imposition of Duties (Confirmation of Orders) Bill, 1959&mdash;Second and Subsequent Stages.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. S. Lemass) Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. S. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to confirm Orders which were made during 1958, under the Imposition of Duties Act.  There were 39 such Orders.  That Act requires that Orders made under it imposing or amending duties must be confirmed in the subsequent calendar year by legislation of this kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Six of these Orders were made to <Col N="1164" /> afford protection to new industries which came into production, and nine of them to protect the manufacture of additional lines which were commenced by existing concerns during 1958. Thirteen of the Orders increased the rates of duty to protect certain of our industries against low priced goods from Far Eastern or Iron Curtain countries, and against dumping from certain other countries.  Seven of them amend earlier Orders as a normal tightening up operation where methods of evading duties had been devised, and one Order permits a modification of the restriction imposed by an earlier Order permitting the importation of unprinted paper without payment of duty where the paper was intended for use in connection with the manufacture of corrugated paper board.</P>
    <P>Three of the Orders refer to agricultural products.  One of these amended the duty on raw tomatoes and the purpose of the Order was to give growers a measure of protection which would encourage them to cater for the earlier market by installing heating apparatus. Another Order related to the duty on dried peas which was amended to provide an incentive to the pea processing firms to extend the acreage of peas grown in this country.</P>
    <P>The duty on wheat was imposed as part of the arrangements made by the Government to deal with the situation arising out of the failure of the 1958 wheat crop.  The proceeds of that duty are paid over to An Bord Gráin to reduce the loss on the disposal for animal food of wheat purchased from growers and unsuitable for manufacture into flour.</P>
    <P>An explanatory memorandum on the Bill has been circulated to Senators but I shall, of course, be willing to answer any questions which Senators may wish to ask about the Orders.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardMcGuire" hpid="Mr. McGuire Mr. McGuire">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGuire</NameTxt>
      <P>Once again we have a list in relation to import duties and this time it is quite a formidable one. I always feel slightly on the wrong foot when I speak on the subject of duties and the protection of industry because there are always those who want to say one is anti-Irish industry, and so on, if one even dares to make <Col N="1165" /> reasonable comments in that regard. I hope such a charge will not be levelled against me if I make a few critical but constructive remarks.</P>
      <P>When the question of duties arises the public are always interested to see in what category the imposition finds itself.  There are three reasons for duties: first, there is the protective reason; secondly, there is the revenue collecting reason &mdash; very often the public are suspicious, especially traders, who say: &ldquo;As far as we can see it is nothing but a revenue collecting proposition&rdquo;&mdash; and, thirdly, there is the imposition which is designed to deal, as we had to deal a few years ago, with balance of payments problems.</P>
      <P>On this occasion the duty seems to fall into the purely protective category. When we are dealing with anything in this category we should always ask ourselves, and we do ask ourselves, several questions, for example: Are the industries deserving of the protection being provided? There is also the consideration of the number of people employed, the quality of the employment provided, the nature of the product &mdash; is it good, fairly good or not so good?  We must also ask: Is the whole enterprise efficient?  What is the price on the home market and how will the price compare in the export market, which we need so badly?  Finally, there is a point that is often overlooked: Is the disturbance to other firms from the point of view of employment justified?  An enterprise which will employ 50 people may, invisibly, unfortunately, disemploy other people or decrease the forms of employment in which they can be engaged &mdash; say, distribution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all agree that protection should not be protection for inefficiency or lack of knowledge.  The Minister has, quite rightly, stated that. If the right operating conditions were provided here, we would get the right kind of industries and the right kind of industrialists.  I do not think that up to now we have had the best conditions here.  So far, the emphasis has been on protection, subsidies and grants to people who want to start industries.  I suggest that in relying on <Col N="1166" /> protection, subsidies and grants, one does not get the right kind of people. Rather, it entices in people who do not know the job because they are not asked to put up enough of their own capital and they have not got the know-how.  Rather than give these forms of protection and bolstering, to use a rather crude word, I suggest it would be much better if we could provide opportunities for profitable trading here through a benevolent taxation system.  In other words, instead of giving people setting up industries subsidies, protection and so on, we should provide here a profitable market in which to operate, where profitable results could be got from business.  I suggest that in that way we will get people to put their own capital into business here, people with know-how, who know what they are about.  In that way we would get industries that would give more competitive prices at home and at the same time would be in a position to export as well.  In other words, we would have cheaper goods in the home market than we are getting at present and we would also have goods capable of competing in the export market for which we are making such a drive nowadays.</P>
    <P>As I said, mere protection, subsidies and grants inevitably attract the wrong kind of industry and industrialist. At present the home market is flooded with many goods.  The home market is bored with many products which offer the consumer little or no variety of choice.  They are also incapable of competing in the export market.  This limits trading expansion in the home market with no compensating value in the export market. I must not be taken as ignoring the good industries and industrialists of which we have very many here.  There are many industries and industrialists here justifying themselves fully both in the home and export markets, but I feel these people are not getting the encouragement and fair crack of the whip they deserve.  Sunbeam Wolsey is an absolutely marvellous factory that can take its place with any in the world both as regards efficiency and product.  The chairman of that organisation said last year that in the <Col N="1167" /> past ten years the company had paid £1,000,000 in taxation to the Government. That is a terrible state of affairs.  If they were only allowed to keep half that and plough it back into their business, look at the wonderful things they could have done.  It is an example of an industry which is a splendid industry despite the present conditions.  If it only had the conditions I should like to see prevail here that industry would make even greater strides than at present.  At present we have not got the atmosphere here that we should have in order to have the right kind of industry and industrialist rather than rely on this heavy protection.</P>
    <P>I suggest that in future the emphasis should not be on this sort of thing but rather on economic and fiscal incentives for profitable trading to encourage the industrialist with capital and know-how.  The Minister himself has been making the same sort of recommendation recently.  At least he has been appealing for efficiency and insisting that in future we should have efficient industries able not only to serve the home market but to compete in the foreign market.  I do not think that can be done by exhortation or subsidies.  It can only be done in one way: by making such conditions here for setting up and running industries that they will be profitable and that when they make money they will be allowed to keep it and plough it back, thus making their businesses bigger and better in every way.  There is no other way of creating the industrial economy here that will carry the burden we want it to carry in giving employment to our people.</P>
    <P>As regards the particular list of duties we have here to-day, all I can say is we can only rely on the Minister himself to see that the protection is given to the people who deserve it, and that it is being given only where it is deserved and that it will be given only as long as it is needed to give them a fair chance of getting going and of competing, perhaps, with <i>ad hoc</i> invasions from abroad of uneconomic goods produced in other countries.  I do not think these duties should be used to compete against goods fairly <Col N="1168" /> produced under fair conditions and offering fair competition from people in other countries.  If we are not able to compete fairly with people in the ordinary way, I do not see how we will ever be able to compete in the export market.  This country cannot live for ever on the limited home market.  We will not get anywhere if we are to rely on 2,500,000 people.</P>
    <P>Finally, I should just like to say I trust that in this coming year we will see a new line taken on this whole question of the protection of industry. It is generally felt by the man in the street and by the people in the distribution side who see the thing at close quarters as the go-between between the manufacturer and the public, that the time has come when we really should take a major look at ourselves and see can we not get good results here without bolstering methods.  Let us use the ordinary economic laws, the laws of incentive. This all comes back to one thing: in all forms of life, not only in the material but in the spiritual life, there is the incentive of fair reward for work done.  As they say on television, it is the end product that people want to see; they want to see a job well done rather than be given grants and subsidies and protection at the beginning.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OwenSkeffington" hpid="Dr. Sheehy Skeffington Dr. Sheehy Skeffington">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>I would regard this Bill as the 1959 edition of the Incompetents' Charter.  We are in the position that we have put before us every year an Imposition of Duties (Confirmation of Orders) Bill.  It varies in some details, but, in fact, as I have said on several occasions, it seems to me to allow the continuing of certain inefficient manufacturers in business, despite the fact that since they started in production they apparently have not been able to cut costs of production, administration or marketing by one iota.  On the contrary: because some of these items, as the Minister has told us, represent an increased protection for goods already being manufactured.  We are asked to approve and confirm these 1958 Orders.  They were made last year, but we have to confirm them, and they could be nullified by us <Col N="1169" /> to-day.  We are asked to confirm to-day 39 different Orders of which 38 represent increased duties of one kind or another.  Only one represents a concession.</P>
      <P>The Minister's predecessor, who did not differ particularly from him in his line in this matter, would nevertheless when introducing a Bill of this kind always introduce proposals confirming Orders for the reduction of several duties.  You can see that from the records.  I heard him here defending such reductions, by saying that his advisory committee had investigated the industry and had decided that it was now producing in a way and at a rate which would justify a smaller measure of protection.  Even with the Minister's predecessor, that was exceptional; I would submit that it should be the rule.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For some of these industries the Minister is asking for a protection of as high as 200 per cent.  There is one item with 200 per cent. duty being imposed and many of them are around 50 per cent.  I should like to ask the Minister in relation to such industries is there any sign since they were set up that they have increased at all in efficiency?  I have put the point again and again here, and I do not want to over-labour it.  But it seems to me it should be remembered that when an industry first starts up behind a protective duty barrier, it will have in its first five, or possibly ten, years certain growing-pains, certain initial problems, which it can only conquer behind such a barrier; and it seems to me obvious that in the initial years for a new industry costs will be higher than they will be subsequently, if the industry is any good at all.  In other words the new industry must progress in administrative and marketing and productive skills after the early years.  It must learn something, surely, if it is worth its salt.  Consequently if at the end of five, ten or 15 years it requires precisely the same rate of protective duty as in the beginning, either it has not increased in efficiency at all, in which case I would suggest it does not deserve this continued protective <Col N="1170" /> barrier, or it has in fact increased in efficiency and decreased its costs of production and marketing, but has failed to pass on any of the benefit of that increased efficiency to the consumer.</P>
    <P>In both cases I suggest that the duty should at least be reduced, and in many cases abolished, because protection at a higher level than is necessary is bad for an industry, bad for the community, and bad for the consumer, the consumer especially, upon whom these duties are a form of tax. It is an indirect tax, but the effect upon the consumer's home is felt very directly.  These are protective barriers thrown up around Irish industry at the consumers' expense, and I think we should fully recognise that it is the consumer who is paying.</P>
    <P>In other countries, not dissimilar from ours in opportunity and available resources, countries like Denmark, they have had a different policy on industrial development.  They have sunk most of their finances and directed most of their efforts into building up a first-class agriculture upon which has grown an industry based upon agricultural demands for machines, churns and the rest of it, with the result that their home market for that kind of industry is a first-class market, to such an extent that they can export agricultural machinery, and we in fact buy it.  That seems to me to be the type of industrial policy which we should follow.</P>
    <P>Senator Baxter has spoken well and surely justifiably about the burdens that the farmers have to carry.  They have to carry not only the burdens of farming, but the burdens of inefficient industrial production.  Three or four of these items refer to items of industrial production which constitute the raw materials, or tools of the trade, for the farmer, and the extra cost represented by the extra duties is paid by the farmer in order to keep these industrialists in business.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister and the Seanad to consider whether this is a sound industrial policy such as they have in Denmark, or a patchwork structure to foster those industrialists who happen <Col N="1171" /> to possess that very valuable piece of organic matter, the ear of the Minister. It seems to me that access to the ear of the Minister is really the central element in a lot of our so-called industrial policy, which in my opinion represents an extremely patchwork piece of machinery.</P>
    <P>Another illustrative point which occurred to me was the habit, in rather second or third-rate retail enterprises, of advertising a &ldquo;Monster Sale&rdquo; with the &ldquo;slashing&rdquo; of prices, and, in anticipation of the sale and before the prices are &ldquo;slashed,&rdquo; they are all put up.  I suggest that we in Ireland, in anticipation of the day when we enter the European Free Trade area, when it will become mandatory on us to reduce our tariffs progressively by 10 per cent. or 20 per cent. are now pushing them up far more than is necessary, in order to say later that we are quite prepared to reduce our tariffs all round by 10 per cent. with the air of making a big concession.</P>
    <P>Now, we have in this Bill 39 different items.  The Minister may say: &ldquo;Yes, but perhaps the Senator has forgotten that we now get this Bill once a year.  We used to get it twice or three times a year.&rdquo;  But I have gone into the figures for the last five years.  In 1953 when there were two Bills there were 11 items in one case and 11 in the other making a total of 22.  In 1954 there were eight items plus eight, making a total of 16.  In 1955 there were ten items plus 13 items making a total of 23.  In 1956 there were ten plus one plus nine making a total of 20.  In 1957 there were only nine, but now there are 39. I feel the Minister should advert in some way to the curious inflation that we find here in the number of items upon which he finds it necessary to put import duties.</P>
    <P>Senator McGuire referred to the three purposes for which duties may need to be applied.  He referred as the third one to the necessity to redress the balance of trade.  It has not surprised me, incidentally, but I have noted with interest that where the inter-Party Government put on <Col N="1172" /> special import levy duties the only difference in policy between them and the present Government, in most cases, is that the present Government turn those special levies into permanent duties.  It seems to me regrettable that most people on both sides of the House seem to be agreed on the necessity for practically every new duty at the ultimate expense of the Irish consumer.  It is for that reason that I want to advert to some of these items, and as a matter of fact I intend putting down on the Committee Stage recommendations for the deletion of certain items in the Schedule.</P>
    <P>I should like now to turn to certain individual considerations and put them to the Minister.  I am familiar, of course, with the Minister's manner and his skilled debating device in dealing with this kind of question.  He says one of two things.  He says that the Minister does not understand what the Senator means or alternatively he says that the Senator does not know what he is talking about.  When the Minister says he does&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>They are not alternatives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OwenSkeffington" hpid="Dr. Sheehy Skeffington Dr. Sheehy Skeffington">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>No, not alternatives, but they can be said arising out of similar circumstances.  When the Minister tells me that he does not understand what I mean, I know that I am getting pretty near the truth, but when he tells me that I do not know what I am talking about, then I know that I have really got at the truth.</P>
      <P>I should like to ask some questions about some of these items about which I feel concerned and there should be public concern.  The first deals with Order 18 of 1958, which is the second item on the Memorandum, dealing with files for filing cabinets and component parts thereof.  We are told that the minimum rates are to be 1/- full and 8d. preference per article or component, or per part of per article, as they say in the North country.  I should like to know what percentage duty does that represent, because it may be very small or it may be big.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then I notice that Order 30 imposes a duty on silk and artificial silk.  I <Col N="1173" /> noticed rather to my surprise that there is a duty of 2/6 full and 1/8 preference, United Kingdom and Canada, per square yard on certain artificial silk, costing not more than 1/3 per square yard.  At the very lowest, unless my mathematics are very much gone astray, that is a duty of 200 per cent. I would ask the Minister to consider what kind of effect on retail prices does a duty of that kind have here, as the stuff apparently coming in even from the United Kingdom under a preferential rate of 1/8 costs initially less than 1/3 per square yard.  Does the Minister think it necessary to impose this exorbitant duty?  I should like to hear something in justification of that.</P>
    <P>Order 37 imposes a duty on tomatoes.  The Minister has said that this is for the purpose of encouraging Irish growers to grow tomatoes in heat. I would like to hear some more details of the effects of that.  Has the Minister satisfied himself on the costs of producing tomatoes in the early season in heated greenhouses?  I do not pretend to have any expert knowledge of the matter, but I would be surprised if it is not so, that all the major growers in this country are already growing tomatoes with heat.  I know that there are a number of small growers who grow them in cold greenhouses but I should be surprised if large numbers of the growers are not already using heat.  I am surprised to find that this is to encourage them to put in heating which they have already. I should like also to advert to the fact that our rivals in this trade are mainly the Dutch, and I should like to ask how do the Dutch do it.  What are their advantages over us in the way of heated greenhouses?  You may say that they get more sun in summer time but this is not summer time; it is spring, and it depends on artificially produced heat.</P>
    <P>I should like to relate this question to the very apposite remarks of Senator Seán O'Donovan when he asked would it not be possible, instead of wasting the heat of the turf-burning power stations, to use it for the production of heat in greenhouses.  That was one portion of Mr. R.N. Tweedy's plan for the production of electricity from turf, at a time when everybody <Col N="1174" /> was saying that he was mad, and the present Minister was just as pessimistic as he accuses other people of being now, because, after all, this was not started in Ireland until we had learned the hard way from the war, when it became perfectly feasible to produce electricity from turf.  Mr. Tweedy long before the war cited as an added advantage in the production of electricity from turf, the fact that you could use the surplus heat, instead of in cooling towers, in heating the greenhouses all around the turf power house.</P>
    <P>Those who are familiar with the not very beautiful Battersea Power Station near Victoria Station are aware that they pump hot water under the river to give heat and hot water to blocks of flats on the other side.  If that is possible, then it is highly possible in relation to glasshouses growing tomatoes in Ireland.  I would like to be satisfied that the best policy in such a thing as this is simply to slap on a duty, because I am not satisfied that that is the best way.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask about Order 36 under which the duty on dried peas is being raised from 2d. per pound full, 1?d. preferential the United Kingdom and Canada to 6d. full and 4d. preferential. What percentage does that represent?  I would like to hear justification of it, for it appears to be very high.</P>
    <P>Order 38 refers to sections for beehives. Is this duty really necessary? I should like to hear justification for it.  Who are the main people using these?  Large numbers of them are smallholders who have been encouraged to keep bees and produce section honey.  This means an almost punitive duty placed upon them, for it is not a small duty&mdash;it is 50 per cent. full and 33? per cent. preferential.  Is it really worth while, in the Minister's contention, to give this enormous protection to an industry which will not employ very many people at the expense of these small beekeepers?  I doubt if there are many large enterprises of that kind in the country.  The raw materials of beekeeping are costly enough as it is without putting higher costs still on the wood for making the sections.</P>
    <P>Order 49, in this slightly bemusing way, does not mention a percentage, <Col N="1175" /> but a sum of money &mdash; a duty of 5/7½ full and 3/9 preferential on berets and other similar articles not made wholly or mainly of felt or felted materials.  I do not know what they cost initially, but it seems to me that that duty must represent something like 150 per cent. Are the producers of these things producing them efficiently?  Has the Minister satisfied himself that that is the case?</P>
    <P>Again, I should like to know something about the implications of Order 57 which refers to what the paper before us rather coyly calls &ldquo;certain electrical accessories&rdquo; and promptly slaps on a 75 per cent. duty.  I did not have time to check the Order again to-day but it is available of course.  It was made on the 7th March, 1958.  I should like to ask what are those &ldquo;certain accessories&rdquo; that require a duty of such a high order.</P>
    <P>Order 157 refers to door and window fittings&mdash;imposing a duty of 75 per cent. full and 50 per cent. preferential. I do not know what is covered by that but, in fact, window sashes come in and are assembled here, frequently rather unskilfully.  I do not know if the Minister has ever noticed that many window frames are so assembled that when the window is theoretically fully opened it is not at right angles to the frame, because the drilling has been badly done.  It is not because the raw materials are wrong, but because the drilling, which is about the only operation done here, is done in the wrong place.  I have tried on two different occasions to get a properly fitted window of this kind but it is impossible apparently to get satisfaction.  What are the door and window fittings which are so unsuccessfully produced in many cases in Ireland that they require a duty of 75 per cent. or 50 per cent?</P>
    <P>Then, No. 128 of 1958 is an extension of a duty which I opposed when it first came before us here.  It puts a duty on milk cans.  Again, this hits the agricultural community.  The milk producer is asked to pay more for the milk cans.  This is an extension of the duty.  I have forgotten what the amount of the duty is.  This merely extends it from 12-gallon cans to 14-gallon cans.  I am not satisfied, and <Col N="1176" /> I do not know whether or not the Seanad is satisfied, that that is the way to help agriculture.  I do not think it is. I doubt, if that duty is justified.  I thought the same thing the last time. I am sorry to say that, in this Seanad, where the farming community is vocationally represented, my memory is that I did not even get a seconder when I moved the deletion of this duty originally from the Bill.  A lot of people in this Seanad speak vocationally for the farmer but vote vocationally for the protected industrialist.</P>
    <P>There are three other items which I want to mention.  No. 190 of 1958 refers to the duty on certain wire webbing, netting and fencing.  What I said about the milk cans applies here too.  Here is a duty from 33? per cent. to 50 per cent. going on to fencing and netting.  Again, this is an impost upon the agricultural community in order to keep industries going.  I should like to have some assurance as to whether the efficiency of these industries has increased a little since they started.</P>
    <P>Then, Order No. 194 of 1958 refers to certain portable oil-fired space heaters and component parts therefor. These had a 60 per cent. duty full, and a 40 per cent. preferential.  In this Order, No. 194 of 1958, there is a clause which disturbs me &mdash; Clause No. 3.  It is common form but I think it should be more commonly disturbing.  It provides:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Whenever the Minister for Finance, after consultation with the Minister for Industry and Commerce, so thinks proper, the Revenue Commissioners may by licence authorise any particular person, subject to compliance with such conditions as they may think fit to impose, to import without payment of the duty imposed by this Order any articles chargeable with such duty or, in the case of any such articles already imported, to take delivery thereof without payment of such duty either as the Revenue Commissioners shall think proper without limit as to time or quantity or either of them or within a specified time or in a specified quantity.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1177" /> That means that any person having the ear of the Minister can get a licence to import these space-heaters duty-free in any quantity at all.</P>
    <P>I am not suggesting that this right would be improperly used.  I am suggesting it is a right we should be reluctant to give.  This is a statutory Order.  It places within the power of the Minister the right to make this concession to anybody he likes, with any conditions he likes, or no conditions, as to time or quantity.  Some people would be paying a 60 per cent. duty and having to sell the articles with that duty while others would be importing them and paying no duty at all.  That is unsatisfactory.  It is another of these Orders which I should like to see deleted.</P>
    <P>The final one is Order No. 206 of 1958 which puts a duty of 50 per cent. on imitation cotton wool.  That may be what our Irish industrialists are wrapped up in; I am not sure if that is the genuine or imitation article.  Again, it seems to me that this is a very high percentage of duty to be imposed.  This imitation cotton wool is used largely in homes where there are young children. It is an ordinary item of household expenditure and here we have this exorbitant duty.</P>
    <P>I desired to put down some recommendations.  I thought from the Order Paper the last time that this Bill would come first to-day.  It came to us first but the Turf Development Bill was taken first.  I should like to propose recommendations.  I am quite happy to allow them to stand over for a week, if the Committee Stage is to be taken then.  However, I took the precaution of handing them in beforehand.  I want to give the Seanad an opportunity to vote in accordance with a concern that is often expressed here for the consumer and the farmer in relation to some of these matters and move the deletion of certain of these items from this Bill which seems to me to be inordinately long.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator McGuire referred to the fact that this Bill contains a formidable list of duties.  I agree that the Schedule is fairly long. As Senator Sheehy Skeffington pointed out, the practice was to confirm Orders <Col N="1178" /> made under the Imposition of Duties Act by legislation within six months of the making of the Orders.  That generally required that, towards the end of every session of the Dáil, a Bill of this character had to be produced. My predecessor thought of the idea of providing for confirming in one year the Orders made in the previous year. From an administrative point of view, it is a more practicable approach. However, I can see that it does present Senators and Deputies with a substantial list of Orders of this kind and there is likely always to be more.</P>
      <P>Senator Sheehy Skeffington wanted to know why the number of Orders this year is larger than in previous years.  I suppose the answer is that there is more activity on the industrial front at present.  Senator McGuire said these Orders are of a protective character. That is true with, possibly, the exception of the Order relating to wheat which is a temporary arrangement to deal with what we hope will be a very temporary situation.  I do not accept his contention that the maintenance of a policy of protection for new industries means that we are attracting into industrial activities the wrong type of industrialist.  I certainly reject absolutely Senator Sheehy Skeffington's sweeping assertion that all protected manufacturers are inefficient manufacturers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OwenSkeffington" hpid="Dr. Sheehy Skeffington Dr. Sheehy Skeffington">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>May I say that that was not my contention, and that what I said was that there ought to be, for the efficient industrialist, evidence of a recognition of that efficiency in a reduction of tariff?  I did not say that they are all inefficient but some may be making too big a protected profit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>We have to take into account, in considering policy in this matter of protection for industry, possible developments in the international field.  While the prospects of the emergence of a European Free Trade Area Agreement were strong, it would obviously be injudicious to start applying substantial tariff reductions on our own initiative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we come to consider the matter of tariff reductions, whether we do so under an international agreement, <Col N="1179" /> multilateral or bilateral, or on our own initiative, we will need to supplement existing legislation for the protection of industry by something similar to the British anti-dumping law. In circumstances where tariffs are frozen, whether because of international commitments or our own decision, the prospects of dumping are enhanced.  This country is particularly liable to suffer from competition by dumping.  We are in very close geographical proximity to great industrial countries where large firms not infrequently have surplus stocks to dispose of, at or below cost, or find themselves with goods prepared for delivery to other markets which become closed to them and have to get rid of them somewhere.  The quantities involved are often so substantial in relation to our requirements that they could put existing Irish industries out of business for many months.</P>
    <P>We have not anti-dumping legislation at the moment.  We have the practice of making variations of existing duties.  Many of the Orders became necessary because of evidence of dumping.  In the White Paper on economic expansion it was mentioned that the Government were preparing and would introduce, when required, anti-dumping legislation. That decision was, of course, related to the possibility of a European economic agreement which would limit our freedom of action in regard to tariffs but circumstances may require its introduction in any event.</P>
    <P>It is true, as Senator McGuire said, that it is desirable that persons who promote new industrial undertakings should have a considerable personal stake in their success but we are not in our circumstances seeking to apply sound theories only.  We are trying to get practical results and our practical need for industrial expansion and the employment it gives is such that we must do what we can with the weapons at our disposal.</P>
    <P>By and large, it is true to say that a shortage of capital is not the limiting factor in our industrial development. It is lack of opportunity for utilising the capital resources we have <Col N="1180" /> arising out of deficiencies in technical knowledge and experience and, perhaps, in export possibilities represented by market contacts abroad.  To the extent that we can associate our capital resources with technical experience or market contacts available to firms elsewhere then we can get results of the kind we require.  I do not think we should stop ourselves from doing so by the theoretical consideration that it would be preferable to have the original promoters, the controllers of technical processes and skills, themselves financially involved in the capitalisation of new undertakings.</P>
    <P>Indeed, Senators may have noticed that I have been invited by the Italian Government to lead a small economic delegation to Italy next month.  The Italian Government consider that Italian technology might be able to contribute to the industrial development of this country to the mutual benefit of both countries and are anxious to discuss possibilities in that regard.  I think we should consider these possibilities.  It may be that substantial capital participation in Irish industrial development from Italian sources will not be forthcoming but noticing the skill which Italians have acquired in industrial technique and organisation and the fact that they have introduced many products on the world markets it seems probable that some substantial advantages to us might follow from closer contacts with them.</P>
    <P>While I say that, I again want to make it quite clear that it is desirable that persons promoting new industrial undertakings should be involved themselves in a substantial way in the financing of them and stand to lose if the undertaking fails to make good.</P>
    <P>Senator Sheehy Skeffington referred to this Bill as the incompetents' charter. I must not say that I do not understand him as he would regard that as vindication of his point of view.  When Senator Sheehy Skeffington spoke about industrial policy he seemed to be arguing in favour of industrial policy with no industries.  That does not make sense to me.</P>
    <P>However, let me refer to the specific <Col N="1181" /> matters that the Senator mentioned in order to make it clear to him what the reason for the Orders was.  I do so as briefly as possible while at the same time trying to satisfy the Senator's thirst for information.</P>
    <P>I have said that many of these Orders were imposed for the purpose of dealing with specific instances of dumping which arose in the circumstances of a slight trade recession in other countries during the past year. It may be that our experience in that regard was somewhat abnormal.  That certainly applies in the case of the first commodity the Senator inquired about &mdash;the suspension files.  I have good reason to think that there was a systematic attempt made to put out of business the firm engaged in the production of these goods.  I am satisfied that the quality of the Irish product is as good as that of the imported product, while their prices were higher when they were unable to get their production up to the economic level.  Now that the tariff has been imposed and their production is increasing, their prices are going downwards.  An undertaking has been given that price reductions will be effected when production reaches a level which represents a much higher proportion of the home market than was achieved heretofore.</P>

      <P>What percentage does the 1/- duty represent?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a minimum duty.  The percentage rate would vary according to the price of the article. It could not be given on an <i>ad valorem</i> basis.  With regard to silk and artificial silk, we carried out a recasting of the duties last year.  As well as imposing certain minimum duties, the recasting was effected to deal with any instances of duty evasion by various devices all of which had to be countered by one method or another.  The minimum duty was provided consequent upon a problem which is not merely ours but one experienced in every European country.  It is how to handle this Far Eastern competition in textiles.  We have handled it by means of the minimum duty.  Great Britain, which is certainly stronger in industry than we are and has a much longer tradition and experience in the textile field, has <Col N="1182" /> met it by a quantitative restriction of imports.  Other European countries have done the same.  By reason of the very low labour costs and other factors in the Far Eastern countries, their textiles come to the European markets at such low prices that the most efficient European country cannot compete with them.  Some come from Iron Curtain countries where economic considerations do not enter into the determination of the selling price at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OwenSkeffington" hpid="Dr. Sheehy Skeffington Dr. Sheehy Skeffington">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a duty of 1/8 put on against the U.K.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It will not be applied because British cloths do not come in at that price.  That is imposed as a consequence of the obligation under international agreements to impose some duty at the basic rate for British goods but in so far as British cloths do not come in at 1/2 per square yard, no cloth will carry that duty. That is the explanation there.  As I said, it is a problem which is not merely ours but which affects all European countries.  It is one of the problems which helped to delay and complicate the European Free Trade Area discussions because it was clear that some countries saw the possibility of securing a greater share of the European garment trade on the basis of utilising Far Eastern textiles and thereby reducing their selling prices.</P>
      <P>In the case of tomatoes, the objective the Minister for Agriculture had in mind was to encourage tomato growers to get into the production of tomatoes earlier in the year.  The duty applies only for certain months of the year &mdash; from the 1st June to 31st October.  The belief is that by the assurance given by this duty greenhouse owners will be encouraged to install heat, lengthen their production season, and increase their efficiency. The duty is not payable from the beginning of November to the end of May.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of dried peas the duty, which I should say is a prohibitive one, is not paid by anyone.  If it were not for the obligations which we have undertaken to the O.E.E.C. <Col N="1183" /> we would probably have imposed quantitative restrictions instead of a duty.  The intention is to confine the duty-free import of these dried peas to firms in this country which have entered into contracts with farmers for the growing of peas and to relate the duty-free import facilities to the area represented by their growing contracts.  In fact, that duty will not be paid by anybody.  The full quantity of peas required to supplement home production will be admitted free of duty to the canning firms on the basis of the extent that they have contracted to have peas grown for them.  They will be allowed duty-free imports to make up the balance of their requirements.</P>
    <P>As regards sections for beehives, this is a very small industry in a rural area; I am not pretending it is anything else.  However, it did appear that the failure to secure business from manufacturers here was due to the reluctance on the part of traders, for not known reason, to use the Irish product in preference to the Canadian one they were used to importing. Before imposing this duty I was satisfied, by means of enquiry carried out through the Department of Agriculture, that the quality of the Irish product was as good as the imported product.  Its price was considerably less than the imported product and yet for some reason they were not getting sales.  By reason of the duty their sales are increasing.  I have had no adverse representations from any source as a consequence and no application for duty-free import facilities or any representations regarding the quality or price of the product.</P>
    <P>In the case of berets, again the only consideration that arose was substantial evidence of dumping.  The evidence showed that goods of this character which were normally being sold to wholesalers in Britain by British firms at a particular price were being offered to wholesalers in this country at two-thirds of that price.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OwenSkeffington" hpid="Dr. Sheehy Skeffington Dr. Sheehy Skeffington">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>What was that price?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1184" />
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The standard price in Britain was 66/- per dozen and these goods were being offered here for 40/- per dozen.  The quality of the Irish product is satisfactory over the whole range of different varieties being produced. Prices do not exceed those prevailing in Britain and the undertaking given by the manufacturers is that prices here will not exceed the prices prevailing in Britain at any time.  I have always contended that an Irish manufacturer who produced and sold goods here at the same price at which goods of similar quality were produced and sold in Great Britain was meeting the only reasonable test of efficiency we could apply.</P>
      <P>In relation to electrical accessories, these are manufactured principally in Carrick-on-Shannon, though other firms are engaged in the production of some of these goods, and the scope of the duty was enlarged to cover new items which they have undertaken.  If the Senator wants to know these I shall tell him.  They are: junction boxes, batten lampholders, 3 pin plugs, screwed lampholders and multi-sockets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In connection with door and window fittings, the items covered by this duty do not include metal window frames. The items relate to door handles, sash handles, hat hooks, coat hooks and other doors and window fittings.  In this case it was clear that the price at which the goods have been produced here was considerably higher than that at which they could be imported by reason of the inability of the firm to get its output up to a completely economic level.  In the case of an industry of this kind, when goods are manufactured at a place like Tubbercurry in Sligo, there is naturally a strong desire to nurse the industry along, to help it to get into economic production even if it means carrying increased prices for a time.  One would naturally be less ruthless with a firm which was giving substantial employment in Tubbercurry than one would be with a similar firm, say, in Dublin or Cork because the disappearance of the employment from that village would be far more catastrophic than the disappearance of a similar volume <Col N="1185" /> of employment from a larger centre. With the imposition of this duty production has expanded and already the prices of all the products of the firm have been reduced.  It is confidently expected that further reductions will be made as the efficiency of the firm increases and as its output rises so as to reduce its production costs.</P>
    <P>In the case of milk cans, that was only a minor alteration in the definition of a milk can for the purpose of preventing evasion.  The definition related to milk cans under 12 gallons capacity, but it was found that cans of a capacity of 12½ gallons were being imported duty-free.  Consequently the Order was amended to cover milk cans under 14 gallons.  They are manufactured satisfactorily here and are sold at prices similar to those in Britain, which is the test of efficiency which applies in such instances.</P>
    <P>In the case of wire webbing, netting and fencing, the problem there was again one of quite substantial dumping, dumping which represented the sale of the manufactured products at lower prices than the cost of the wire for making them.  We had to handle that situation.  This webbing, fencing and netting is manufactured here from wire which is also manufactured here and it represents a substantial part of the total production of important firms.  They are as efficient as they could reasonably be expected to be. It was desirable to maintain them in production, notwithstanding the temporary advantages that might be secured through the low prices at which these products were being offered in certain continental countries.</P>
    <P>The manufacture of oil space heaters represents a new development.  There are three important firms engaged in the production of these goods, all with external associations which give them the right to patents and designs developed abroad, and there is a substantial market for these goods which should be met by Irish production.  Senator <Col N="1186" /> Sheehy Skeffington quoted in that connection the licence provision attaching to the Order.  That is the standard licence provision.  There was nothing unusual in it.  He could have read the same section in any other Order.  In fact, no duty-free licences are given for the importation of these oil heaters, but during the transitional period while the firms were getting into full manufacture, they were given duty-free licences for parts of assembly, parts which they ultimately intend to make but which they require to import during the period in which they are trying to get the industry properly organised.</P>
    <P>As regards cotton wool, the only question here is the amendment of the definition.  Senator Sheehy Skeffington asked if this was the genuine article. The purpose of the Order is to extend the duty from the genuine to the synthetic article.  The definition is extended to cover not merely cotton wool made out of cotton but cotton wool made from synthetic material.</P>

      <Col N="1187" /> I do not want to repeat what I said before.  I should like to make it clear that in the case of some of these things, such as this imposition of a duty of 6d. on tomatoes, it is not in our power to reduce it.  I think a case could be made for something, but 6d. is too high.  The only power we have is to reject, and the Minister can then make a fresh Order.  In that light, I propose the deletion of this Order in the hope that the Minister will make a more modest Order in place of it.</P>

      <P>I find it difficult to answer the argument that a lower rate of duty might be equally effective.  Possibly it would.  In a matter of this kind one must appreciate that the people who undertake the production of tomatoes in glass-houses require very specific encouragement to effect the capital investment involved.  Only the imposition of a duty that appeared to them to be likely to secure the market for them would be strong enough as an inducement, particularly having regard to the knowledge that in other years, when market conditions were such as to produce a big surplus in other countries, very low prices were offered.</P>

      <P>On the Second Stage, the Minister said that the products of the Irish factory were sold at about the same price as the products in Britain. Could the Minister tell us if the wages paid here are at anything like the same level as in Britain?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not know that.  The firm has given an undertaking that the prices they will charge will, quality for quality, be no higher than the prices in Britain.  I do not know how it becomes possible for it to do so.  This Order relates to unfelted berets &mdash; berets made of fabrics other than felt.  There was a duty on berets made of felt.  The evidence of systematic dumping in the Irish market by suppliers in Britain was quite emphatic, and certainly it justified the imposition of the duty upon these unfelted berets.</P>

      <P>I do not think that the Senator showed that these berets are, in fact, made in Britain.  They could be made in Hong Kong, imported into Britain and re-exported here.  In fact, they could be made in China, where the Chinese Communist Government are engaged in a campaign of undercutting prices in this type of goods all over the world.  They have succeeded in undercutting the Japanese who were the masterhands in that particular business.  When the Senator queries the wages paid in that particular industry, I might say to him that he should read the statement in the Hong Kong papers recently relating to workers in China who were looking for a rest.  Mao told them that if they wanted a rest he had a salt mine similar to that in Siberia where he could send them for a short holiday.</P>

    <P>We were assured a short time ago that the duty put on the 12-gallon cans would make every farmer buy Irish cans but apparently the Irish farmer is determined to buy the non-Irish can.  The Minister thinks it is purely from the profit he gets.  I think it is because he gets better value.</P>

      <P>I should say in defence of the Irish producers that not merely are they supplying requirements here at prices which are the same as those at which British-made cans are sold in Britain but they have succeeded in obtaining a very substantial part of the Six Counties market by reason of their quality and price.  It is true that some of these cans are occasionally available from Germany and other continental countries at lower prices than prevail here, and by this device of making cans 12½-gallon instead of 12-gallon, they are able to get outside the duty.</P>

      <P>I want to be quite clear on this.  This is a new manufacture and the demand for these oil space heaters has grown enormously and quite a number of firms of well-known repute have gone into their manufacture. The licensing device has been used solely to enable certain component parts to be imported free of duty by these firms so that the completed product could be produced in their factories pending the installation of the necessary apparatus.  Once the full degree of manufacture to be undertaken by the firms is reached the licensing provision will become inoperative except in special circumstances.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1196" /> Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. S. Lemass) Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. S. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to provide for an increase in the authorised capital of Irish Shipping Ltd. from the present figure of £5 million to £12 million; to provide for an increase in the maximum borrowing by the company which may be guaranteed by the Minister for Finance from the present limit of £2 million to £5 million; and for the repeal of the provisions of the Irish Shipping Ltd. Act, 1947, whch empowered the Minister for Industry and Commerce to pay subsidies to the company.</P>
      <P>Irish Shipping Ltd. possess at present a fleet of modern vessels totalling 140,000 tons dead-weight, consisting of 17 dry cargo vessels, one deep sea tanker and one coastal tanker.  A second deep sea tanker of 18,000 tons deadweight has been launched and will be delivered later on in this year.  As Senators are aware, the company have grown to be a very considerable enterprise, giving employment now to some 900 persons either ashore or afloat. The scale of their operations may be deduced from the fact that, in the five years which ended on 30th April last, the freights earned by the company amounted to approximately £9½ million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Irish Shipping Ltd. Act, 1947, provided for a maximum authorised capital of £5 million and for borrowing, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, up to £2 million.  These limits are no longer adequate.  Expenditure on the present fleet, including payments in respect of the tanker under construction, has amounted to approximately £12½ million.  Of that sum, the company contributed from earnings some £5¾ million.  Five million pounds, being the full authorised capital of the company, has been contributed by the Minister for Finance in the form of share capital.  The balance of approximately £1¾ million is covered by overdraft with the company's bankers.  The overdraft was <Col N="1197" /> arranged for the purpose of financing the purchase of two deep sea tankers and is guaranteed by the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>When, after the war, the programme of expansion for Irish Shipping Ltd. was determined, the target aimed at was a dry cargo fleet of 250,000 tons deadweight.  In the light of our wartime experience, that was considered to be the minimum size of fleet required to carry essential imports to this country in time of war.  Because of increases in the size and in the speed of the dry cargo vessels with the consequent improvement in their overall efficiency, it is now considered that minimum emergency requirements could be put at a figure of 200,000 tons.  The cost of an additional 80,000 tons required to put the company's fleet up to 200,000 tons in respect of dry cargo vessels will, at present prices, be of the order of £9,000,000.  I should like to make it clear that it is not intended to limit the company's growth to that tonnage but expansion beyond that figure must depend solely upon commercial considerations.</P>
    <P>The Board of Irish Shipping Ltd. consider that the best shipping practice requires that they should replace their vessels when they become relatively uneconomic to operate.  On that basis, a number of the company's vessels will fall due for replacement during the next few years.  I should mention that, as an alternative to replacement, the company have undertaken the conversion of two of the older vessels to diesel propulsion.</P>
    <P>The cost of replacing vessels would in the normal way be met from the sale of the older vessels and from depreciation reserves.  Since the vessels of the present fleet were built, however, the cost of new vessels has risen very considerably and, moreover, the company's entire reserves have been applied, at the direction of the Government, to the acquisition of new tonnage.  The cost of replacements which will, over a long period ahead, amount to many millions of pounds will, therefore, have to be met to a considerable extent from new capital. Outstanding commitments on the <Col N="1198" /> tanker due for delivery this year amount to about £420,000 and the payment of the outstanding sums is expected to bring the company's overdraft to over £2,000,000.  In view of the present shipping slump, the company will not be able to pay that overdraft from earnings in the relatively short time originally envisaged.  It may be necessary eventually, therefore, to liquidate the overdraft by long-term borrowing or by payment from capital account.</P>
    <P>The Irish Shipping Company, Ltd., like other shipping companies, have been affected by the present severe slump in freight rates. They have been fortunate in that a large part of their fleet is modern and relatively economic to operate, and that a number of their vessels is on long-term charter at rates which were negotiated before the slump began. The company expect that in the present year they will break even, the profits on some vessels offsetting the loss on others.  They have, however, been forced to lay up two of the older and less economic vessels.  The company are unable at present and for the time being to devote any part of their earnings to the liquidation of their overdraft or to the acquisition of new ships.  The extent to which they may be able to do so in the future will depend very much on developments in the freight market.</P>
    <P>It is not possible in present circumstances to estimate with any degree of precision what the gross capital requirements of the company may be for a considerable number of years ahead or what contribution the company may be able to make from their earnings towards the cost of future replacements and expansion.  Any such estimates would have to depend to a considerable degree on developments in the world shipping market.  The Government, however, consider that adequate statutory provision should be made to meet whatever developments may be found to be practicable and desirable in the light of future experience.</P>
    <P>It is proposed, therefore, that the maximum authorised capital of the company should be increased from <Col N="1199" /> £5,000,000 to £12,000,000.  That figure of £12,000,000 is in any case more in keeping with the present value of the company's assets which amount to £13,000,000.  It is also proposed to increase from £2,000,000 to £5,000,000 the amount which the company can borrow under guarantee of the Minister for Finance.  Taking into account the prospects for a return to normal conditions in the shipping industry within some reasonable time the provisions now proposed should be sufficient to meet the company's requirements on capital account for some years.</P>
    <P>It is proposed to repeal the provision in the 1947 Act which empowers the Minister for Industry and Commerce to pay subsidies to the company. When that Act was being passed Irish Shipping, Ltd., was beginning to meet, for the first time in peace, the brunt of competition from established shipping companies.  It was expected that competition would become more acute and that the company would have to face the discriminatory practices operated by some Governments to protect their own shipping and unfair competition from some combines of private shipping concerns.  The provision of subsidy is considered to be no longer necessary and the retention of powers in legislation to pay subsidy could give rise to misunderstanding and difficulty.  Since 1947 this country has become a member of the interGovernmental Maritime Consultative Organisation, one of whose aims is the elimination of discriminatory and restrictive practices in the shipping industry. While it is not to be expected that these practices will be eliminated entirely it is hoped that some mitigation of them may be brought about. In our circumstances discriminatory action in favour of our own vessels would be impracticable even if it were desirable.  Our national interest, both from the narrow point of view of the success of Irish Shipping, Ltd., as well as from the broader aspect of the freight levels which affect the cost of our imports and exports, is best served by supporting the abolition of discriminatory and restrictive practices in the industry, and as a token of our view <Col N="1200" /> in that regard we are moving to delete this power to pay subsidy which, in fact, has never been utilised.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>Whatever remarks I may have made when we were discussing Bord na Móna a while ago can be raised to the power of <i>n</i> in relation to this proposition.  The capital at present in Irish Shipping, as the Minister remarked, is £12,500,000 provided as to £5,000,000 by the Minister for Finance, by earnings, in the early years particularly, of profit on marine insurance on which the former chairman of the company was constantly reiterating that the company paid income-tax with an overdraft of £1,750,000.</P>
      <P>The proposition that is now being put to us is that the capital of the company should effectively be raised by £10,000,000.  I find it hard to believe that, if we take any one of the ordiary tests which we should apply in this country at present to capital expenditure, this proposition would pass them.  The cost of the ships that were built in the first building programme of Irish Shipping two or three years after the war was £40 per ton.  They were built with the profits, as we are so often reminded, on the marine insurance carried by Irish Shipping.  I have no doubt that it would have been better not to have made these profits, that it would have been far better if the State had covered the insurance in the same way as the Export of Livestock Insurance Act was operated instead of allowing the cost of the goods at that time to go up enormously.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second building programme, from October, 1950, to May, 1951, put five vessels in service at a cost of £2,500,000 or £60 a ton.  The third building programme, as far as my recollection goes, cost about £100 per ton.  The proposition that is now before us is that we should accept the proposal by the Minister to provide another 80,000 tons of shipping at a cost of £9,000,000 or £112 per ton. When the Minister said the cost has risen very considerably he was understating the matter very much.  It has <Col N="1201" /> trebled since the war and we are expected to do this at a time when, in accordance with the very full figures the Minister gave to the Dáil, the freight index for shipping is at a very low point.</P>
    <P>These ships are not being built in this country but abroad.  We are told, on the one hand, that we require very badly that people should bring capital in here and, on the other hand, that we can afford to spend an additional £10,000,000 on ships to be built abroad.  I know new merchant ships can look as nice as any other ships but I do not think there is much prestige to be got from merchant shipping, and the expenditure of this money on the building of these ships will give no employment in this country.  When this money has been spent&mdash;taking the information the Minister gave us that the existing ships employ 900 people&mdash;the only additional advantage to be gained in real terms would be on such occasions as the ships would be provisioned here, or have some painting done.  We shall give the Minister full credit for the fact that the existing fleet takes 900 people to operate it, not bothering to deduct the overheads of the staff employed in the office.</P>
    <P>The new vessels will employ 400 people.  What do I get as the cost per man of this employment?  The existing fleet cost £12,500,000.  The cost is about £14,000 per man employed but the cost of the new fleet will be £22,500 per man employed.  We had a discussion this evening in which I was accused of being unduly critical of an industry here.  What is the cost per man employed in that industry? Somewhere about £2,000 to £3,000 per man.  I suppose the figure for industrial employment is gradually getting higher.  Certainly there was a figure of £3,000 per man for putting people into industrial employment a few years ago but in recent times I have seen the figure of £5,000 quoted both here and in Britain.</P>
    <P>Do not forget we are being told <i>ad nauseam</i> that there was no capital for housing, nothing for this and that, yet we have here a proposition which, <Col N="1202" /> as far as employment within this country is concerned, will cost about £22,500 per man put into employment. I know it will be argued that the fleet is kept for other purposes&mdash;for security in time of war and so on.  I shall come back to that at the end of my speech.</P>
    <P>Unless I misread the signs, this is the second time the Minister has insisted on Irish Shipping doing a job they were not prepared to do.  They stated publicly in their report in relation to one of the earlier building programmes that they were ordered to do it by the Government.  On this occasion I read the last report of Irish Shipping Ltd., a report of a meeting held on Wednesday, 9th July, 1958.</P>
    <P>I feel this is the relevant paragraph of the report:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It would seem that many of the experts believe that the present world-wide slump in the shipping industry will last for quite some time, and there is nothing which we or even the Government can do to protect our shipping from the effects of a world-wide shipping depression. We must rely on our own resources to survive this difficult period.  We must intensify our efforts to economise and, if necesary, we may have to lay up the more costly units of our fleet.  Above all, we will require the co-operation of all our employees, both ashore and afloat, to eliminate wastage and any uneconomic practices.  We have sufficient knowledge and skill amongst our personnel and we have a sufficient number of the right type of ships to be able to carry on as well as other companies of our size and type.  I hope that it will not be long until we will be again able to resume at full strength and continue our task of adding further to our ships and to the prosperity of our Irish Merchant Marine.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>What do we find when we examine the the freight index and go back to the period when this company was operating with its new fleet of ships&mdash;at the time, nine or ten ships?  We find that the freight index in January 1956 was 144.3.  That was towards the end of the Suez crisis period.  The company <Col N="1203" /> had a very good year that year, just as they had a good year at the time of the Korean war.  As the Minister was good enough to say in the Dáil, they had dropped in April 1958 to 52.7 and had recovered 12 points in December 1958 to 74.6.  So that it was still at only about three-quarters of the level it was at prior to the tremendous rise that took place at the time of Suez. The Minister said in the Dáil, putting all his cards on the table this time&mdash; I suppose if he has a really bad proposition the best thing to do is put all his cards on the table&mdash;that out of 114,000,000 tons of shipping in the world, 7,000,000 tons were laid up, including ships of Irish Shipping.  It was interesting that there were 7,000,000 tons laid up as compared with an addition to the world tonnage of shipping the preceding year of 7.7 million tons. In other words, for every ton added there was a ton of shipping laid up somewhere in a river or in a bay.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to one other thing about this company.  It is all very well to talk about the manner in which you build up a number of ships and replace them, all the time requiring additional capital.  I want to point out that no dividend has ever been paid by this company to the Minister for Finance for his investment.  I might be wrong in these facts, but that is my recollection.  The second thing I want to emphasise is that it pays no income-tax. Lest somebody might take me up on it, there is an item of £7,800 income-tax on investment income.  My recollection is that income-tax was specifically excluded under the earlier Act.</P>
    <P>This company pays no dividend. After all, even if it has been paying only a low rate of interest on its advances, Bord na Móna has been paying a rate of interest, which was originally fixed at 2½ per cent.  That is not bad if you compare it with the 3½ per cent. the E.S.B. were paying at the same time.  But this company pays nothing at all to the State and there is no suggestion that it will ever pay anything. We put this immense amount of money into this company and there is no suggestion that the Minister for Finance will ever get a bean out of it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1204" /> Do not forget that under the system we have the Minister for Finance has to pay very substantial amounts for such money&mdash;about 5½ per cent. at present.  The answer usually given is to refer to the target of shipping necessary in time of war. The Minister tells us that target is 250,000 tons.  Again subject to my recollection being accurate that figure has been inflated.  That is not the figure used ten years ago.  I am quite certain of that.  As the fleet came up to the tonnage which was regarded as the minimum necessary in time of war, the target was inflated.  I do not think the Minister's statement that the target aimed at was 250,000 tons is correct. He has deflated it now to 200,000 tons. That is not correct; that is my distinct recollection about it.  It is an inflated figure to justify this proposal.</P>
    <P>The Minister made use of a few phrases&mdash;I notice he made use of the same phrase in the Dáil&mdash;&ldquo;The best shipping practice.&rdquo;  I am not in a position to disagree with the best shipping practice.  Let us say the best type of motor car is a Rolls Royce, but I do not know that any Senator runs a Rolls Royce.  There would be general agreement that the Rolls Royce is the best type of motor car.  The best shipping practice is the same mentality&mdash;the millionaire mentality.</P>
    <P>I notice that the company, despite the reference to the best shipping practice, are prepared to depart from it a little.  This best shipping practice is the replacement of ships at the age of ten or 12 years.  How does it compare with the way this country scraped through the war with the old tubs bought from Central American Republics, from Greece and Turkey or wherever they could be got, owing to the fact that the matter was not attended to before the outbreak of war?  I understand quite well why it was not attended to.  The Government relied on promises made by the British Government and did not attend to it.  They could have bought shipping very cheaply as there were tens of thousands of tons of shipping lying idle in the Clyde.  I am not criticising the Government on that. This is an historical matter which has <Col N="1205" /> happened from time to time.  What the guarantee is that you will not have, literally, hundreds of miles of shipping tied up I do not know.  I saw a programme on television some time ago showing ships laid up in one of the bays on south-east England.  Certainly it was a very impressive sight to see that number of ships laid up there already.</P>
    <P>The Minister, perhaps not deliberately, gave the impression that £10,000,000 was being added to the capital of the company.  I may have misunderstood his phrase but in fact the existing assets of the company, the assets on the balance sheet, are £11,000,000.  The Minister said these additional moneys were roughly equivalent, or rather that they were not, to the present assets of £13,500,000.  I do not understand the relevancy of that.</P>
    <P>Finally, I should like to reiterate, and emphasise, the warning given by Deputy Kyne in the Dáil about this matter.  This is very dangerous and shaky territory.  If there was massive employment to be given at home in the business of building these ships I would not be as critical as I have been, if I were satisfied that we wanted to provide security in the next war, but we are adopting a Maginot Line mentality, as if the next war will be fought on the same lines as the last one.</P>
    <P>This proposal of the Minister reminds me very much of a previous occasion when he did exactly the same thing.  That was in the autumn of 1952 when&mdash;certainly not owing to any action of the Minister&mdash;his Government, following the Budget of April 2nd of that year, were in grave difficulties.  I do not think anybody would be so unfair as to blame the Minister for these particular difficulties but all I can say is that I hope the Minister will not be in as unhappy a position as when the Taoiseach was in Utrecht.  It will be a case of history repeating itself and next winter the Minister will find himself in the same position.  This is extremely unwise.  That is not an opinion I have arrived at for the purpose of this Bill.  It was an opinion <Col N="1206" /> which I also formed about the programme which was forced on the company against their wishes some time ago.  If that applied at that time with shipping freights relatively stable, following the end of the Korean war, how much more does it apply now with the shipping index 72 points compared with an index for shipping of 100 points when costs were greatly lower than they are to-day? I doubt that this is a wise proposal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DominickMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill and the particular aspect of it that I consider to be of importance is the building up of our tonnage to what would be regarded as the essential minimum for survival in the event of war.  I would not be in favour of spending millions of pounds on jet fighters but certainly I would favour investing millions in providing Irish shipping with what would be regarded as an essential minimum.</P>
      <P>I consider that Irish Shipping, its officers and its seamen generally, have done a very good job and they deserve the congratulations of this House.  In the Dáil, the Minister, on the Second Reading of this Bill, referred to the rise in the dry freight cargo rates as shown by the British Chamber of Shipping, and indeed the fluctuations are very steep.  The maximum was 189.4 points in December, 1956.  It went down to 62.7 in April, 1958 and rose slightly to 74.6 in December, 1958.  We have often heard, as an explanation for rising prices and increased costs, about the rise in the costs of shipping.  To clear any doubt in my mind I referred to the cost-of-living index for about the same period to see if the substantial drop in the shipping freight dry cargo index had shown itself in the cost of living.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unfortunately, it did not seem to work in that direction.  The cost-of-living index for February, 1957, would, I suppose, be related to the dry freight index of December, 1956, and it was 135.  It had gone up to 146 by December, 1958.  The same can be said&mdash;it is even more marked&mdash;in regard to the index for tanker freight levels, because the peak there was December, 1956, at 435 whilst at May, <Col N="1207" /> 1956, it had gone down to 424.  The cost of petrol and oils increased substantially when that peak of tanker freight rates was reached.  The cost of petrol has gone down by ½d. in the meantime; it never seems to go down as much as it goes up.</P>
    <P>I know that in regard to the building of ships the facilities available here so far are not quite suitable for building the type of ship required by Irish Shipping.  I would say to the Minister, and I think he agrees with this, it is the viewpoint of the trade union movement that, in so far as we cannot get things done in this part of the country, before going outside these shores, we should endeavour to get them done in the North.  I know that he has given a direction to the Board of Irish Shipping that they should always ask the Belfast shipyard to quote for their ships and I hope that wherever possible the work will be given to Belfast before it is given to some other country.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of our shipping problem to which I should like to turn is the rather vexed question of passenger facilities between here and Britain.  There has been some improvement in that direction by the introduction of sailing tickets for which a deposit has to be paid when application is made for the tickets.  I suppose that that tends to reduce the confusion and chaos which obtained on previous occasions.  This is a peak problem which occurs usually about July and August and again at Christmas.</P>
    <P>I know that British Railways do make extra shipping available, as far as they can.  The B. and I. make no effort at all.  They simply carry on more or less as they do for the rest of the year.  No matter what is done, I am sure that there must be many thousands of would-be visitors, returning emigrants or others, who do not come to this country because of the difficulties involved in getting accommodation at the time they want to come, when they have their holidays, who cannot get sailing tickets or secure accommodation.  Irish people working in Britain have told me that it is <Col N="1208" /> such a problem trying to get sailing tickets so far ahead, trying to put up with the crush, etc., that they have abandoned their former practice of coming home regularly for their summer holidays to Ireland.  There must be many such and there must be many English people who would come if the facilities were better and they could be assured of getting accommodation at the time they want it.</P>
    <P>I do not know how far Irish Shipping could help in this direction.  It would be quite unrealistic for Irish Shipping or any other concern to tie up £1,000,000 in a modern passenger steamer simply for that short peak period; but I am wondering is it practicable for some sort of vessel providing simple seating accommodation under cover to be put into service during that peak period in the summer or daylight sailing. Such a vessel might be available and might be suitable for carrying cars, and for some other traffic, during the rest of the year.  It might be suitable for a container service or for the purpose of carrying trailers.</P>
    <P>I do not pretend to be an expert in this matter, but I think it is very desirable and necessary for the economy of the country that any tourist or returning emigrant should have every facility to come here whenever he wants to come.  Even though such a service might not be immediately economic, it would be desirable from the point of view of the overall benefit to the economy.  I would ask that that problem should be reviewed.  I am sure it has been considered already. There might be some way of making some vessel available for that peak period, not providing cabins such as are usually on the cross-channel service but with seating accommodation for daylight sailing, and it might be possible to use them for some other purpose during the rest of the year.</P>

      <P>I am prompted to intervene in this debate by hearing Senator Dr. O'Donovan using his pet phrase about the Maginot Line mentality. I intervene for the purpose of reminding him that the normal interpretation placed by the ordinary man in the street in 1938-39 on the Maginot Line was the system of defences which <Col N="1209" /> ran along the Franco-German border up to the North Sea behind which the French dug themselves in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasMullins" hpid="Tomás Ó Maoláin Tomás Ó Maoláin">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Ó Maoláin</NameTxt>
      <P>They believed they were impregnable and that nothing could ever happen them.  In other words, it was the system of defence which unfortunately did not run the whole way along the vulnerable Belgian border to the North Sea. Senator Dr. O'Donovan in using that phrase to-night makes it quite clear that in connection with Irish shipping, turf development and many other facets of our national economic progress, the only people who have that mentality to-day are Senator Dr. O'Donovan and some of his colleagues on the other side of the House.  The Maginot Line mentality of which Senator Dr. O'Donovan is an exponent was the mentality which resulted in the sacrifice of the five Constellation planes which were bought in 1947, which resulted in the disappearance of our short-wave broadcasting station and wave-length&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>It was a great loss.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasMullins" hpid="Tomás Ó Maoláin Tomás Ó Maoláin">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Ó Maoláin</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;which resulted in the disappearance of the possibilities at that time of a heavy industry, and in the disappearance of the airframe factory at the time that Senator Dr. O'Donovan and his friends took over the Government.  It is annoying to hear Senator Dr. O'Donovan, in referring to this Bill on Irish Shipping, say that if we took any of the ordinary tests this would not pass.  He had much the same mentality on the proposals in the Turf Bill which was passed through the Seanad earlier to-day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no doubt in the world that Senator Dr. O'Donovan had the same mentality at the time when many of the great industrial and economic projects which were put into action here from 1932 to 1938 were in their infancy. That was the mentality of his Party during all that period, and it is unfortunate and deplorable to see that even at this late stage there are members of the Fine Gael Front Bench <Col N="1210" /> who take the same view as many of their colleagues in the other House took in the early days in 1932 when efforts were being made to gear this, country for an industrial revival.  Senator Dr. O'Donovan could not see that there was much prestige to be got out of merchant shipping and he seemed to think that the only advantage that could accrue to us here was if the new ships were provisioned or painted here in Ireland.  Otherwise, nothing was to be gained out of them; and to prove that, he wanted to know how this country scraped through with old tubs during the war, which after the war were reconditioned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I said that we did scrape through.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasMullins" hpid="Tomás Ó Maoláin Tomás Ó Maoláin">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Ó Maoláin</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, with old tubs.  It would be a good education to Senator Dr. O'Donovan to look up the newspaper files of recent months. He will find a series of articles which dealt with our position when the war began in 1939 and the efforts that were made all over the world and, in particular, from a very friendly Government, to secure even one ship at that time, and how deplorable was the reception we got in many quarters when ships were at a premium. It is not very much use for Senator Dr. O'Donovan to talk about hundreds of miles of ships laid up already, to indicate, perhaps, that a great shipping depression is about to follow.  The fact remains, ní hé lá na gaotha lá na scolb.  The time to take precautions against the future is not when the blaze comes, but now; and as for wondering whether the pattern of the next war will be like the pattern of the last, nobody knows, not even the scientists who will, probably, create it.  All we do know is that according to the information we have and the system under which we work we have to take the precautions which seem to us to be necessary to ensure that if a crisis does come, either a big one or a small one, we will have at least sufficient tonnage to ensure that the necessary raw materials to keep our industries going are imported in our own ships because, if war does come, we will <Col N="1211" /> not be in a position to get ships any more than we were on the last occasion.</P>
      <P>It is absolutely silly for Senator Dr. O'Donovan or anybody else to be computing in the mathematical way in which he did compute that the 400 people who would secure employment in these new ships would cost £22,500 per man employed.  If the people of this country were in a position in 1940, 1941, 1942 or 1943 to buy a few new ships they would not have computed whether the cost per man employed was £22,000 or £252,000, if they could have got them.</P>
      <P>I would like to pay tribute to Irish Shipping Ltd. for the tremendous achievements which they have chalked up to their credit since the company began.  I hope that they will continue on that very progressive and prosperous way and that they will in the future, as in the past, be not alone a credit to this country but one of our best insurance policies for survival in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister gave us an interesting survey of what had been achieved and what was proposed to be achieved by Irish Shipping Ltd.  The points made in his speech in regard to the numbers employed and their aims and objects have been adequately explained.</P>
      <P>It is interesting to note that efficiency will now allow us to do as much work with 200,000 tons of dry cargo shipping as could have been done in the middle forties with 250,000 tons.  That should help to make Irish Shipping Ltd. a more competitive force than it would have been if the yardstick of 1945 were applied to present-day conditions.</P>
      <P>Shipping must be one of the most difficult businesses that one could engage in and in this case it is well that Irish Shipping Ltd. has the fairy godmother of the State to stand behind it and encourage it in it various enterprises.  It is a great source of joy to all of us to see very fine Irish ships entering our major ports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to feel that if we are not able to build ships in Cork or <Col N="1212" /> Dublin they would be built in Belfast. Even if we have difficulties with people in Belfast or across the water from time to time, we would be pouring coals of fire on their heads by having our ships built in Belfast.  Senator Murphy has said that the Minister was interested in having ships built in Belfast, and naturally they would not be built there unless they were built at the right price.</P>
    <P>The aspect of shipping which I want to mention is a facet which has been neglected, in my opinion.  We are speaking about the big ships, and the ships we are now building will enter only two or perhaps three ports in this country&mdash;Dublin, Cobh and Foynes. The other major ports such as Limerick and Waterford will not be able to take the largest of the Irish ships.  These ships will probably engage in the highly competitive international tramp ship competition.  It is fortunate, indeed, that many of them are first-class modern ships and have been engaged on long-term charters at remunerative rates, but it often strikes me as a member of a harbour board and a person interested in this problem, that we have done nothing to encourage the development of the small ship which, in my opinion, has been the most significant development in the shipping line in Western Europe since the war.  Anyone who visits the ports of Cork, Waterford or Dublin, or any of our ports for that matter, will see the flags of the Low Countries, Western Germany, France and some of the Scandinavian countries, carrying small cargoes to our shores.</P>
    <P>The Irish economy has the nature of a small economy and our needs can often be served better by the smaller ship than by the larger.  Our industries may want to buy a 500 ton cargo of raw materials for manufacture and may not be interested in chartering a 10,000 ton or 12,000 ton cargo in an Irish Shipping bottom.  That amount is not required.  They may not be able to finance it and the industry may not require so much raw materials.  The Minister has the imagination necessary for dealing with these matters. The State should encourage, whether by financial support or by remission <Col N="1213" /> of taxation, conditions which would allow this type of shipping to develop in all Irish ports.  These small ships could be built and serviced here and operated by people living around our seaboard who have a seafaring tradition.</P>
    <P>I remember reading in the library some weeks ago a book which showed that in the Penal times our people were not allowed to hold land and, therefore, they had to engage in trade in the cities like Waterford and Cork, and the ascendancy at that time were complaining that the Irish were outstripping them in trade and commerce. The history of Waterford, Cork, Clonmel and other towns shows that many people from these places were well known as far south as Cadiz in Spain and all over the Low Countries for their trading.  That trade was done in the schooners and small ships they had at that time.</P>
    <P>To-day the Dutch principally are engaging in that type of shipping, I presume as family businesses, while we are doing nothing to assist the private sector in the shipping economy.  If we did that and encouraged that business acumen and seafaring tradition that is latent in our people they would be the main people to operate a big business in shipping afterwards.  We have neglected that.  That is one aspect of our economy that the Minister for Industry and Commerce should certainly keep in mind.  We could build those ships ourselves.</P>
    <P>I want to touch on one point made by Senator Murphy, that is, cross-channel shipping.  I was engaged recently in several conferences with British Railways with regard to new arrangements made to give facilities to the port of Waterford.  We were promised that conditions would be very much better in the western region that would serve the ports of Rosslare and Cork than they had been before.  Some of the trouble that has occurred in Dublin was that during the war period all the passenger traffic came through Dublin and when it returned to the other routes the same facilities were not provided.  For example, the best boat trains on the western region average only 36 m.p.h. <Col N="1214" /> as against, probably, 55 to 60 m.p.h. on the Irish Mail service.  I understand that these things are being attended to. When a service comparable with the Irish Mail service from Euston to Holyhead is given from Paddington to Fishguard on the western region, and modern ships are operating at that port, the bottleneck at Dún Laoghaire will be obviated.</P>
    <P>Irish Shipping Ltd. have before them to-day a very difficult problem. Until the international situation is a little bit clearer, we should be slow in spending this £9,000,000 which it is suggested will be required to bring our tonnage up to 200,000.  I believe that Britain will be obliged to reduce the cost per ton of ships.  Otherwise, she will lose, and she is at the moment losing in competition with Western Germany and Japan.  It might be prudent to bide our time, so that we may be in a position to purchase ships at good value.  Any new ships we purchase to-day will have to be bought at peak prices. Maybe, in a year or two, we will be able to purchase ships at a price that will not be a burden on Irish Shipping Ltd., who will have to operate these ships when they come down the slip-way into the sea and fly the Irish flag.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGuire</NameTxt>
      <P>Like everybody else, I regard Irish Shipping Ltd. as a most creditable and efficient organisation and one that an island country such as this simply could not do without.  It was one of the first things we always looked forward to when we got self-government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I read the debate which took place on this Bill in the Dáil and I have heard the debate on it here to-day. There was almost unanimous approval of the proposals of the Bill in the Dáil.  Here, Senator Dr. O'Donovan opposed the expenditure and gave very good reasons for doing so.  It is important that every Bill that comes here&mdash;especially one involving expenditure of some £10,000,000&mdash;should have critical examination and some opposition, even if only for the sake of opposition, though I do not think that Senator Dr. O'Donovan made his <Col N="1215" /> objections from that particular aspect.  I think he was genuine but, even if he were not, it is well that somebody should make such a stand.</P>
    <P>I am very much in favour of the expenditure proposed here.  It is good foresight, even though there is a slump in the world.  On the occasion of the last slump the Americans got out of it by providing for the future, looking forward and beyond the immediate future.  Otherwise, the difficulty might have been perpetuated. The same thing might apply here.  I would ask the Minister to answer seriously the case made here.  There is a natural temptation to be slightly annoyed with rather strong criticism of one's proposal.  I should like to hear, and I am sure the public would like to hear, the answers to the case that has been made.  I believe that the answer has already been given, not only in the statements of the Minister, but in the actions of the company.</P>
    <P>I rose just to say&mdash;as I said previously in respect of Senator Sheehy Skeffington&mdash;that those people who do not agree with everybody else, even if everybody else is in agreement, perform a very useful function.  On this occasion, it is particularly useful that the public should know that an expenditure of this kind has been objected to and that the Minister can show a case for the expenditure as I am sure he will.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>While I do not wish in any way to oppose the proposed expenditure, I want to make one or two observations.  We are being faced with a number of development Bills such as this and I understand that others are on the way.  Personally, I feel that if we had a really good debate, extending perhaps over several weeks, on our economic future and on where we go from here, we would be in a better position to judge the priorities to be accorded to such developments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are all in favour of putting millions into every industry that gives hope of development here and of providing some measure of relief of our <Col N="1216" /> unemploment and emigration problems. But there is a very limited amount of money available&mdash;as has been made crystal clear in the Survey on Economic Expansion by Mr. Whitaker.  A system of priorities should be set out and this House and the Dáil should play a very important part in pulling together and discussing on a completely non-Party basis how our resources can be spent wisely.  That is my query in relation to the present expenditure.  It is all very well but there is a commitment for at least £3,000,000 of State capital by the Minister for Finance.  The point was then made by Senator Dr. O'Donovan that, so far, no dividends have been paid on such capital by the company; in other words, that this is not a very highly-productive type of investment.  Yet it is one, perhaps, that we should continue.</P>
    <P>I should like a general debate.  If we could have one before we sanction very much more expenditure such as the £5,500,000 on jet airplanes, and so on, we would perhaps be able to spend our resources more wisely.</P>
    <P>There is one cargo carried by Irish Shipping Ltd. at present which I hope can be dispensed with very shortly, that is, imported wheat.  I hope that any expansion in Irish Shipping Ltd. will not create a vested interest that will prevent or postpone the day when we will have the 100 per cent. Irish loaf.  I should also like to get far more convincing evidence as to why we should be in the tramp-ship business. Apart from the fact that we want to provide for future wars, and so on, it seems that a development of our own home shipping would confer much greater advantage on our economy than too much of this tramp-ship business.</P>
    <P>The figure of £22,500 per worker employed shows the very high capital investment required in modern industry. There is the example of Whitegate Oil Refinery where the capital expenditure is even higher&mdash;£30,000 per worker.  When considering such figures and when being forced to expand at such a high cost, I would appeal to the Minister to look kindly at expenditure in agriculture and to do a small sum and capitalise our <Col N="1217" /> present loss of an average of 7,000 workers from agriculture each year. If that is capitalised at the present figure of £22,500, it goes to the dizzy sum of something like £150,000,000 a year.  Even if it is capitalised at a modest figure of £3,000 per worker employed, it shows it is good business for the State, a highly profitable business and an investment we should all support, to expend, say an additional £21,000,000 in agriculture, if by doing so we were able, at least, to halt the present flight from the land and maintain our present numbers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOQuigley" hpid="Mr. O'Quigley Mr. O'Quigley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to say very much on this Bill but I did notice that the Minister in the Dáil on Second Stage gave a figure of £9,500,000, the amount of money which Irish Shipping Ltd. had earned in foreign exchange through freight in the previous five years.  I wonder would the Minister have counterparted that figure with the amount of money spent by this country by way of payments to other shipping industries? The question that arises on Senator Dr. O'Donovan's speech, which has been criticised by Senator Mullins, as to whether we are spending our resources in the best possible way seems to me to be entirely to the point in relation to the desirability of one expenditure rather than another.  I do not think that is anything about which Senator Mullins should get so heated.  It seems to me that we are now reaching the stage in relation to Irish Shipping&mdash;I think it is a most desirable thing&mdash; where the ministerial colleague of the Minister who wished that every British ship was at the bottom of the sea can now have his wish with impunity and without detriment to us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Senator McGuire, I think Senator O'Donovan is to be congratulated on having made a serious effort to understand what the Bill is about.  He very nearly succeeded. The proposal here is that the limit now fixed by law on the amount the Minister for Finance can invest in the capital of Irish Shipping Ltd. should be raised.  That is all the proposal in the Bill, except the subsidiary and consequential proposal about raising the limit that may be <Col N="1218" /> borrowed by the company on Government guarantee.</P>
      <P>The actual outlay of the additional capital resources by the company on new vessels is a matter upon which decisions have not yet been taken. How and when that capital will be utilised in the purchase of new assets will be considered later.  I said in the course of the debate on this Bill in the Dáil that I proposed to meet the board of the company after the measure had been passed for the purpose of hearing their views in that regard.  That meeting has, indeed, already been arranged.</P>
      <P>It is true that the minimum target of 200,000 tons of dry cargo tonnage is not strictly related to commercial considerations of the ordinary kind although, no doubt, the company will have opinions to express as to the trend of ship building costs and when and where the best value in new tonnage can be secured.  Development beyond 200,000 tons will be influenced solely by the prospects of operating these ships profitably.  The point, however, that should not be missed is that a new vessel delivered now can even at present freights earn profits. The difficulties which have been created for many companies by the slump in rates related to the older type of vessels which were much more costly to operate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The company have to undertake new capital expendituure upon replacing the existing vessels.  That is because they were not allowed by Government direction to accumulate depreciation reserves which a shipping company in the normal way would seek to accumulate.  The Government, at any stage since the company restarted its operations after the war, could have provided new capital for the purpose of new tonnage and allowed this company to accumulate reserves to cover the cost of replacements. For reasons which Senators will understand&mdash;the reluctance of the Minister for Finance to part with money before he has to&mdash;the company were told to go ahead and use their own resources for the acquisition of new ships on the assurance, that when capital was required for <Col N="1219" /> the replacement of existing vessels the Minister for Finance would make it available to them.</P>
    <P>It is impossible to attempt any guess now as to when shipping freights are likely to recover or the extent to which they are likely to recover.  Certainly, short of another international crisis, they will not go to the levels which operated during the Suez business or the Korean war.  It is to be recognised that in the long run world trade is always increasing.  Populations are increasing and the demand for shipping will certainly not contract permanently. Therefore, it is probable that over any reasonable period of years freight rates will average out at levels where it pays people to operate ships and so long as Irish Shipping Ltd. keep the policy of maintaining a fleet of modern efficient ships they will be able to remain in business and make profits.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Donovan was critical of the decision to allow Irish Shipping Ltd. during the war to go into the marine insurance business.  He said the Government could have done that and made profits.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister will allow me, I simply mean that the Government should have carried out the insurance and made no charge to the shippers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>In fact, shippers were able to get insurance because of the intervention of Irish Shipping Ltd., at as low a rate as they would have been able to get it if Irish Shipping had not entered the field.  There was no thought of the possibility of Irish Shipping making a profit in the business, when we permitted the company to go into the marine insurance business.  We did see the possibility of building up a marine insurance market for the first time in this country by reason of that development.  Indeed, an important marine insurance business has been established in which a number of companies are participating and which is still expanding, and will be a substantial earner of foreign exchange.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1220" /> There is, apart from the strategic need to keep a fleet of deep-sea vessels upon the Irish register in circumstances in which an international emergency might deprive us of opportunity of securing vessels of other flags, the consideration that it is a very important earner of foreign exchange.  The £9,500,000 earned over ten years in freights was a net gain for the country. There is no counterpart.  The Senator who asked what was the counterpart missed the point.  Nobody in this country lost anything by reason of the fact that Irish Shipping Ltd. earned that revenue on foreign trade. It was earned carrying goods from one foreign country to another.  The freight charges paid out by Irish firms to other companies is not a counterpart in any sense of the term.  They would not have avoided paying that if Irish Shipping Ltd. had not been in business.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Donovan is relying too much on his memory and his memory is letting him down very badly.  The target of 250,000 tons was fixed immediately after the war.  It was fixed by the committee which was then set up to plan for post-war economic development. It has never been modified from that up to this and the first announcement that the target could be reduced from 250,000 tons to 200,000 tons, because of the greater speed and higher carrying capacity of the ships available now compared with those that were available in 1945, was made on the introduction of this Bill.</P>
    <P>The company does pay income-tax. Senator O'Donovan is misinformed on that also.  As a non-profit making company it does not pay corporation profits tax but that is the only exemption it has.  If it did not pay dividends to the Exchequer on the capital invested in it&mdash;it was a very small capital for many years; it is only in the last few years that it was increased from the original figure of £200,000 to £5,000,000 at which it is now&mdash;it was because the Government considered that it was better policy to leave the money with the company to be used by them for new investment purposes rather than draw it into the Exchequer.  The fact is that with a total capital investment <Col N="1221" /> of £5,000,000 the company have built up assets valued at £13,000,000. That is where its resources went over the years and it was a very useful employment of its resources.</P>
    <P>There is one further matter about which I want to put Senator O'Donovan right.  I am not forcing the company into a development programme they do not wish to undertake. The Senator made that assertion and read an extract from the speech of the chairman at the annual general meeting.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us get the facts straight about this.  The company have been pressing me, so far as this measure is concerned, to raise by more than I propose the limit to which the Minister can provide new capital for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With reference to the cross-channel services, I do not think that is a field in which Irish Shipping Ltd. should contemplate operating at any time. Undoubtedly there are problems there and consideration will have to be given to them.  They are different from those which Irish Shipping Ltd. face in the type of business in which they are engaged and to which they should confine themselves.  That applies also to the continental trade to which Senator Burke referred.  The smaller vessels which he has in mind owned by private companies are engaged in trade between Irish ports and the near continental ports.  That sector of the shipping business in this country is available to private enterprise and Irish Shipping Ltd. will not enter it. An assurance has been given to that effect and the Irish companies which are engaged in that trade are showing considerable enterprise.  It is not true that the Government gave no encouragement to private enterprise in that field.  In the Budget of last year quite substantial tax concessions were given to private concerns in the shipping business as a result of which most of them are acquiring new ships and extending their services which, as I say, are in the main confined to those near continental ports to the extent <Col N="1222" /> that they are not operating to Great Britain.  I would, indeed, hope to see private enterprise taking a still larger share of the development of our merchant fleet.  I hope we shall see developments in that regard.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Quigley talked about Irish Shipping Ltd. engaging in a different type of operation.  Their ships are at present tramping, that is to say, they are carrying cargoes from port to port as these offer.  There is another type of service which could be operated, where a ship sails on regular routes at regular times calling at specified ports, and taking cargo along that route as it is available to them.  That type of operation, which Irish Shipping Ltd. does to some extent, is different from that which is their main activity and is one which requires not merely the provision of ships but an organisation which can arrange trade for the ships. The problem for this country is whether our own trade, the trade originating here, is a sufficient basis upon which to develop a service of that kind.  It appears that it may not be so unless certain supplementary trades can be made available also. However, that is a matter to which some examination is being given at the present time.</P>

I am not one of those people who suggest that when you reach a target you can stop there.  That is not the nature of my criticism of the Bill, and the Minister knows it.  I have made no criticism of the technical organisation of the company, just as I made no criticism of the technical organisation <Col N="1224" /> of Bord na Móna or any of these companies.</P>
      <P>My other main criticism was that really the company is of very little use to this country.  Here is a huge investment.

      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to give effect to a protocol which amends the convention known as the Warsaw Convention; the protocol was adopted at The Hague in September, 1955.  The Warsaw Convention, the full title of which is &ldquo;The Convention for the Unification of Certain Rules relating to International Carriage by Air&rdquo;, is set out in the First Schedule to the Air Navigation and Transport Act, 1936.</P>
      <P>The convention clarifies the circumstances in which carriers are liable, and lays down maximum limits of the liability of carriers, in relation to passengers, baggage and cargo carried on their aircraft.  It also prescribes the manner in which such documents of carriage as the passenger ticket, the baggage ticket and the air waybill, should be completed.  Its purpose is to provide a standardised code of legislation for application internationally. Without such an internationally accepted code of legislation it would be difficult to determine the liability of air carriers in respect of persons killed or suffering bodily injury, or loss of, or damage to, goods or baggage.  The convention has fulfilled for the past 25 years the need for such a standardised code and international aviation has benefited considerably from it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Experience has shown that the convention is, in some respects, in need of revision.  For example, the limit of the carriers' liability for the carriage of passengers, as laid down in the convention, is fixed at 125,000 gold francs.  This amounts to about £3,000 in our currency.  The Hague Protocol raises this limit to 250,000 gold francs or about £6,000.  The provisions of the convention relating to the completion of the various documents of carriage have also given rise to difficulty because carriers have from time to time found it difficult to comply fully with those requirements. <Col N="1226" /> Those requirements are simplified by the protocol.  Finally, certain expressions in the convention have been held to be ambiguous and their meaning has been clarified.</P>
    <P>The question of amendment of the convention has been under consideration for a number of years.  The International Civil Aviation Organisation convened an international conference at The Hague in September, 1955, for the purpose of considering the convention.  Forty-four countries, including Ireland, were represented at the conference, which adopted the protocol amending the Warsaw Convention. The protocol was signed at the conclusion of the conference on behalf of 26 States including Ireland, and is set out in the Schedule to the present Bill.</P>
    <P>It is clear that a maximum of £6,000 compensation is not fully in accord with present conditions and, no doubt, a higher limit might have been fixed.  While this might be conceded, account must be taken of the fact that liability is almost automatic up to that amount and that if negligence on the part of the carrier is proven, the common law applies and liability is unlimited.  The Hague Conference considered higher limits and we would have supported them if they had been proposed but it was, in effect, necessary to compromise between the views of States which sought high limits and those which sought very low limits.</P>
    <P>The protocol is subject to ratification by the signatory States.  Up to the present, nine States have ratified it and a number of other States are proceeding with its ratification.  It will not come into force until 90 days after it is ratified by 30 States.  Accordingly, provision is made in the present Bill for the making of an Order by the Government bringing into operation the provisions of the protocol.  The intention is that that Order will not be made until the protocol is in force, i.e., until after 30 States have ratified it.  When that stage has been reached, the convention as amended by the protocol will operate in relation to international <Col N="1227" /> carriage by air between States which have ratified the protocol.  Until then the Warsaw Convention, as set out in the 1936 Act and as amended by Part II of this Bill, will continue to have effect and even after the protocol has come into force the convention itself will continue to operate in relation to those States which although they have ratified the convention have not ratified the protocol.</P>
    <P>It will be noted that under the terms of the protocol the only reservation which a State is permitted to make to the protocol relates to carriage by air for its military authorities in certain specified circumstances.  Under that article, a State may at any time formally declare that the convention as amended by the protocol, shall not apply to such carriage.  It is not intended, at present at any rate, that Ireland should make any reservation.</P>
    <P>The Hague Protocol when it comes into force will, I believe, be of benefit to all concerned in the business of air carriage.  It represents an improvement on the original convention and it is in the public interest that legal effect should be given to it here.  That is what this Bill proposes to do.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>State Guarantees Act, 1954 (Amendment of Schedule) Order, 1959, <Col N="1228" /> a copy of which Order in draft has been laid before the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. S. Lemass) Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. S. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this Order, the draft of which was approved by An Dáil on the 3rd March, 1959, is to enable the Minister for Finance to guarantee borrowings by the newly-formed Shannon Free Airport Development Co., Ltd. Under the State Guarantees Act, 1954, the Minister for Finance may guarantee, both as to principal and interest, borrowing by a body scheduled to the Act within the limit specified in the Schedule. Section 9 of the Act empowers the Government to add, by Order, a body to the Schedule and to specify the limit within which borrowing by that body may be guaranteed.  It is proposed in the draft Order to add the Shannon Free Airport Development Co., Ltd. to the Schedule to the State Guarantees Act, 1954 and to insert the sum of £200,000 as the maximum amount of borrowing by that company which may be guaranteed by the Minister for Finance.</P>
      <P>When the Government decided to provide all the facilities necessary to equip Shannon Airport to receive jet aircraft, they had under consideration also other measures to ensure the fullest possible utilisation of the airport and the maintenance of employment there.  The advent of the new type jet aircraft with high speed and long range would, it was felt, tend to lower the airport's revenue from transit traffic unless steps were taken to promote and develop the use of the airport otherwise than as a transit stop.  Particular attention was paid to the possibility of developing air freight traffic at the airport.  The desirability of increasing terminal passenger traffic in order to offset an expected contraction in the airport's transit traffic was also realised and it was felt that this might best be secured through promotional activities directed particularly at the North American tourist trade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No suitable organisation for undertaking this development work was in existence at that time and the work was of such a nature that it could not be discharged satisfactorily within the <Col N="1229" /> framework of departmental organisation. There was no State or semi-State body which could be expected to undertake all the various activities which were required if the aims were to be achieved.</P>
    <P>The responsibility for the commercial development of the airport was therefore entrusted to the Comptroller of Sales and Catering who had been primarily responsible for the building up of the airport's restaurant and shopping service into the present major industry with an employment content of almost 600 persons.  The comptroller undertook the following additional responsibilities&mdash;(a) the development of transit traffic, (b) the development of tourist facilities at or near the airport in order to attract terminal traffic, and (c) the active promotion of freight traffic there.  In the carrying out of his new duties the comptroller operated as the Shannon Free Airport Development Authority and was authorised to spend on these development activities up to £50,000 annually out of revenue from the sales and catering service to meet running expenses.</P>
    <P>On a review of the initial working of the authority, it became clear that the success of its efforts would depend on the promotion of freight traffic at the airport and the promotion and development of industries within the perimeter of the Free Trade Area.  The encouragement of Industries at the airport is a matter requiring special treatment.  One of the steps deemed necessary is the provision in advance of actual demand of factory accommodation for renting.  This was a matter for the authority.  For this reason and from the experience of the authority already acquired in negotiations with interested firms, it became obvious that it was essential to give the authority legal status for the general conduct of its business and in particular for such matters as the leasing or letting of factory premises, the acquisition of rights and physical assets, such as premises and equipment, and the making of contracts and agreements.</P>
    <P>With the approval of the Government, <Col N="1230" /> the authority was reconstituted on 29th January last as a limited liability company with the title&mdash;Shannon Free Airport Development Co. Ltd.  The Government also directed the introduction, in due course, of legislation to provide capital for the company by enabling the Minister for Finance to subscribe for shares in it and to provide moneys annually by way of grants-in-aid to enable the company to perform its functions.  As negotiations which the company has in hands with prospective manufacturers are well advanced and as it would be harmful to the development scheme generally if the provision of capital for the company had to await the enactment of legislation, the Government decided that, for the purpose of providing the company with capital &mdash;in advance of the legislation&mdash;the name of the company should be added to the Schedule to the State Guarantees Act, 1954, thus enabling the Minister for Finance to guarantee borrowings by the company.</P>
    <P>As I indicated at the outset, the intention is to allow the company to borrow up to £200,000.  That money will be used for the construction of factory space for letting at the airport. When the legislation which I mentioned comes before the House it will be seen that provision is being made to ensure that capital subscribed by the Minister for Finance will be applied in the first instance to the repayment of any moneys which the company may borrow on foot of guarantee by the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>The arrangement now being made is, therefore, purely a provisional arrangement so that the company will not be handicapped owing to lack of funds pending the, enactment of legislation. I must emphasise that the avoidance of delay in bringing into effect the plans of the company to promote activity at the airport is specially important. The changes in the pattern of air traffic over the North Atlantic which have already taken place suggest that the transit traffic on which Shannon depended in the past may diminish&mdash;although Shannon had a record year in 1958&mdash;and it is essential that vigorous and prompt measures be <Col N="1231" /> taken if the level of activity and the employment position at the airport are to be maintained.  I am sure, therefore, that the proposed Order which will provide the necessary capital as an interim measure will meet with the approval of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOQuigley" hpid="Mr. O'Quigley Mr. O'Quigley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure all of us will welcome any plans that will encourage the development of Shannon Airport.  The only point that occurs to me, arising out of the Minister's statement, is that it has been necessary to establish this authority at Shannon Airport.  The Minister has said it was not considered possible to do it, apart from establishing the authority, but I do not think he expanded his reasons as to why it was necessary to establish the authority.</P>
      <P>At present, we have a whole lot of bodies which, it would appear to me, could do all that it appears it is intended this authority should do.  We have Córas Tráchtála which is concerned with expanding our export trade.  We have the Industrial Development Authority which is concerned with planning industry in this country. We have the Minister's own Department which has its own aviation section and which seems to be familiar with the different types of problems which this authority would be up against.  Then we have Bord Fáilte which is also concerned with the promotion of tourism.  I think that is intended to be part of the activity of this authority.</P>
      <P>I can hear the Minister saying: &ldquo;This particular place is removed from Dublin where all these authorities are centralised.&rdquo;  I still do not understand why it is not possible to direct these activities from Dublin in the same way as tourism or industry, and so forth, are developed in other parts of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We seem to have fallen a victim to the notion that in order to make progress we must establish statutory bodies.  Apparently the Minister intends to introduce legislation to constitute this new authority into some form of statutory body and to give <Col N="1232" /> it greater authority than it has at the present time.  I do not say that I have any particular objection to that.  I am wondering whether a new statutory body is necessary in this case when we already have so many organisations, all of which have, in one way or another, activities relating to the activity this authority will be concerned with in the future.</P>
    <P>The Minister says there ought to be no delay in passing this motion and I am sure the House will not delay it. If the Minister is of opinion that it is necessary that this Order should be passed, I would have no intention of asking anybody to delay it.</P>

      <P>Earlier to-day I congratulated the Minister and, incidentally, we congratulated ourselves, on the success of Bord na Móna, which certain critics predicted would go up the spout.  I wish to congratulate the Minister on the motion which he brings before us now and on the fact that the rabbits are not gathering round Rineanna as predicted by some critics.  We are to have a chinchilla farm down there now.  That may be some consolation to the member of the Oireachtas who predicted that Rineanna would be a rabbit run in the future.</P>
      <P>I should also like to congratulate the Minister on the fact that he has taken time by the forelock and provided for the satisfactory re-forming of these runways to suit the planes of the future.  Jet planes are coming in even at present.</P>
      <P>There is a point of criticism which I should like to bring to the Minister's notice.  I have been in the airport on four occasions.  On two occasions I was in the reception hall, which an emigrant enters in order to cross the Atlantic.  On the occasion of my second visit there, which was last year, I was very perturbed by the fact that the place was not anything like what I anticipated it should be.  I presume and I hope that provision is being made through the present development authority of the port for the provision of a more satisfactory reception hall for emigrants.</P>

I instanced what happened in Northern Ireland where, in their efforts to encourage industry, they provided the factory space.  I am glad that in the Shannon Development Area it is intended to take that positive action in providing factory space so as to encourage the people to set up distribution centres and manufacturing centres in the free airport sector.  I very much welcome the motion and trust that the work being put in hand will be very successful.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGuire</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to join in the approval of the action being taken under this Order.  Because Senator O'Quigley made a slight criticism in regard to the way this should be done, I want to point out that we should not like it to be taken that there was any opposition to what is being done under this Order.</P>
      <P>The development of Shannon Airport and Dublin Airport and a lot of these things should not be a matter of one Party pulling against another and of one side saying: &ldquo;We did this&rdquo; and the other side saying, &ldquo;We did that.&rdquo;  There are some matters on which, obviously, we are all in general agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a danger that larger and faster aircraft may overfly Shannon with passenger traffic.  In view of all our commitments there, in view of all the money invested there and all the people employed, we should make some provision for the future in order to try to get the best out of the money we have invested there and to do our <Col N="1234" /> best for the people employed there. Freight traffic comes to mind in that connection.  There was a good debate on the matter in the Dáil.  Everybody there approved the action to be taken at Shannon in order to develop air freight traffic.  There is a very good future for such traffic there.  There will always be plenty of traffic for slower moving aircraft.  They will be cheaper at all times in the foreseeable future than the fast jet planes, which will be very expensive to run. For that reason, we fully approve and I fully approve of the proposal in this Order to provide the necessary capital for the Air Development Authority to function and to set up the necessary equipment at Shannon to handle this traffic.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of Senator O'Quigley's observations, Shannon Airport is at present administered by the Department of Industry and Commerce.  It is not a very satisfactory arrangement.  It was never intended that it should be permanent. My idea, when we started the construction of the airport, was that it would be handed over for management, as Dublin Airport was handed over for management, by Air Rianta, when the permanent buildings there had been completed.  They were never started and the existing building arrangement is, I think, quite satisfactory.  At some stage we will have to consider how the management of the airport can best be carried out in future because the conduct of what is in practice a commercial concern in many of its aspects by the Department of Industry and Commerce is not the best method. Certainly, when we considered how an effective campaign could be organised for the purpose of expanding activity at the airport, whether tourist, freight or transit traffic, it was felt that it could not be done by a section of the Department of Industry and Commerce but by somebody with a fairly free hand closely associated with the management of the airport.  That is why the original development authority was set up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had not contemplated that anything in the nature of a statutory company would be required.  We found it was <Col N="1235" /> difficult for the authority to work satisfactorily when it had no legal status.  I do not agree that the problem that exists there could be handled by all the existing organisations.  Each one would have some function there. Some of them would be handicapped by the limitation of their statutory powers in carrying out the particular drive we contemplated.  That is why there is separate organisation.  Arrangements have been made to ensure that there will be no lack of liaison between the new company and the existing boards.  The chairman is, in fact, also the chairman of Bord Fáilte.  That is one sphere where close integration of activities might be profitable to both. There is an officer of the Department on the board.  Arrangements in relation to the work of the Industrial Development Authority include the submission to the Industrial Development Authority of proposals relating to industrial activity in the airport.  I have appointed them as my advisers in relation to the issue of licences.  In that way, the overlapping of activities has been very largely eliminated.  I will not say there is no possibility of it but, in so far as it is possible to eliminate it, that has been done.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Traynor) Oscar Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Traynor)</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a preliminary Bill designed to make certain changes in the law as to the administration of the estates of deceased persons, and it will clear the way for a comprehensive Bill to reform and consolidate this branch of the law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main object of the present Bill is to provide that all property will devolve in the same way.  In other words, it will provide that real property will devolve on the executor or administrator in the same way as compulsorily registered land and personal property do at present.  Under existing law real property (other than compulsorily registered land) goes directly <Col N="1236" /> to the heir or to the devisee, if there is a will.</P>
    <P>Most land already devolves on the personal representative as it is registered land purchased under the Land Purchase Acts, but there is still a fair amount of real property to be found in cities and towns and in country districts.  The present difference between the devolution of what I may call pure realty and other property cannot be justified, and the Bill proposes to remove this difference.</P>
    <P>The Bill does not deal with the descent of real property, and the heir-at-law will continue for the present to exist in our system of law.  However, the privileged position of the eldest son as the sole heir to pure realty is a matter which it is hoped to tackle in the comprehensive Bill to which I have referred.</P>
    <P>In addition to providing for the devolution of real estate on the personal representative, the present Bill contains in Part III elaborate provisions governing the powers, duties and liabilities of executors and administrators. These provisions will clarify and consolidate with amendments the existing law, both statutory and non-statutory. All types of property are covered in Part III, and it is hoped that setting out the law as to executors and administrators in a concise and readily accessible form will be of considerable assistance to practitioners and others who have to deal with the administration of estates.</P>
    <P>Part IV of the Bill contains certain miscellaneous and consequential provisions which are considered necessary and desirable.</P>
    <P>This is a rather technical Bill and Senators will notice that each provision has an explanatory sidenote showing whether the provision involves a change in the statutory law or merely consolidates an existing statutory provision. I should like to explain that the word &ldquo;new&rdquo; opposite a provision simply means that the provision is new to statutory law.  It does not mean that it is new to ordinary non-statutory law, although it may be.  I mention this matter because there was some confusion in regard to it during the discussion in the Dáil.  I mention <Col N="1237" /> it also in order to explain that there is nothing unusual or improper in stating in statutory form what is the ordinary non-statutory law.  In fact, there is a lot to be said for doing this in appropriate cases.  Speaking as a layman, I should imagine that it is a great help to a practitioner to be able to find the law in readily accessible form in an Act of the Oireachtas as he is saved the trouble of having to look up the law in textbooks and in law reports.  And this is especially so in this country where, I am informed, we are, unfortunately, very short of up-to-date textbooks.</P>
    <P>Senators will have received with the Bill an elaborate explanatory memorandum which deals in detail with the Bill section by section.  It is unnecessary for me to go over the ground that is already covered in this explanatory memorandum which will, I trust, be of assistance to Senators in considering the proposals in the Bill.</P>
    <P>This Bill is a non-Party measure which will, if enacted, represent a beginning in the reform of a branch of our private law which is to a large extent out of date.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOQuigley" hpid="Mr. O'Quigley Mr. O'Quigley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>This is very much indeed a non-Party measure, as the Minister stated.  It is a Bill which not alone the House but everybody who has to do with the administration of estates of deceased persons will welcome. I have only one regret in regard to the Bill and that is readily resolved by what the Minister has stated, that this is only a forerunner to further legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My regret is that the devolution of real property upon the heir at law is not completely set aside in this Bill.  Considerable difficulty arises where part of the person's property descends to the heir at law because tracing the heir at law can be difficult in a variety of ways, more particularly in our country where there is so much emigration.  It often means advertising in various countries to find out where the heir at law resides, and it has been known that property which has devolved to the heir at law has fallen into a state of disrepair and become quite useless because nobody would look <Col N="1238" /> after it knowing that at some stage the rightful owner might turn up, or, indeed, while inquiries were being made to trace the heir at law.</P>
    <P>Other difficulties and hardship can arise in that regard.  A man may die and leave a widow.  That man may have been possessed of certain real property and the widow, who, in the normal circumstances, would be entitled to the property if it were personal estate, could have only a life interest in one-third of the real estate.  That can cause dissatisfaction to a widow who has no children because some descendant of her husband is entitled under a medieval rule of law.  That is my only regret&mdash;and it is one that will be shared by members of the legal profession and by people in trustee departments of banks&mdash; that this elusive and unique animal, the heir at law, has not been abolished altogether.  However, as the Minister hopes to introduce further legislation to deal with that situation we can let the matter rest at that and express the hope that it will not be too long before the Minister introduces more comprehensive legislation than is contained in this proposal.</P>
    <P>With regard to the main purpose which the Billl seeks to achieve, to provide that real property shall devolve upon the personal representative, that provision is overdue.  There is no good reason why freehold registered land, which constitutes the bulk of the land of Ireland, and leasehold property should devolve upon the personal representative and this very insignificant property, called real estate, should not also devolve upon the personal representative.</P>
    <P>This notion of the sanctity of real estate as against personal estate, which includes leasehold property, is preserved in the Bill.  I know the Minister's reply to that would probably be that we are only consolidating what is already the law but it does seem that, in preserving the order in which property will be liable for payment of debts and other testamentary expenses, real estate has always been at a slight advantage over leasehold and personal property which is not justified but is merely a hang-over from feudal times of the sanctity which was attached to <Col N="1239" /> freehold property.  I do not see any reason why real estate should have any advantage over personal property in general.</P>
    <P>Very often in this connection the intentions of a testator are wholly defeated because he leaves land to one and certain legacies to another and he feels he has made equal provision for the beneficiaries under his will.  When it comes to the payment of debts and other expenses the legacies which are provided for under the will are wiped out or certainly abated by reason of the fact that these debts and expenses have to be borne by the personal estate. Therefore, once we are changing the position with regard to the devolution of real property, that sanctity which is attached to it in regard to the payment of debts and testamentary expenses should go also.</P>
    <P>I welcome also the fact that there is no change in regard to the extent to which different types of property would bear their proportion of death duties.  In another section, where a person dies and the administrator or the executor under the will has not acted or is abroad, a power is given to the High Court to appoint another person in lieu of that person.  I have never understood why it is that when you want an administrator appointed by the court you must always apply to the High Court.  You have the High Court on the Land Registry side, in regard to the registration of title, exercising the same jurisdiction as the Circuit Court.  It seems quite unnecessary that people should have to apply to the High Court when, in relation to other matters, the Circuit Court exercises the same jurisdiction as the High Court, the jurisdiction being limited by the poor law valuation of the property involved or the total amount of the assets.  There should be a provision that the application should not be made to the High Court where the value of property is within the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court in the ordinary course.</P>
    <P>Section 14 (3) seems to be a most curious provision.  It puts a new <Col N="1240" /> burden upon administrators who must enter into a bond &ldquo;for the payment of all income-tax and surtax payable out of the estate of the deceased&rdquo;.  I had always thought that the Revenue had ample powers for compelling allcomers to pay income-tax or surtax.  I do not know why it is necessary to incorporate in a Bill of this kind something which throws a further burden upon the administrator.  In the ordinary course debts due to the estate are a first charge after testamentary funeral expenses upon the estate of the deceased.  These must be paid in priority to all other debts.  I do not know to what extent this new addition will increase the amount of money payable out of the estate in respect of the bond.</P>
    <P>In the Dáil, the Minister remarked that this is really a Committee Stage Bill, and I entirely agree.  Section 18 seems to me to present a number of difficulties.  This is a new provision giving power to the personal representative to sell property, whether real or personal, for the purpose of distributing the assets of the deceased person and giving persons moneys in accordance with their entitlement to them.  To my mind, the section will raise difficulties.  If the personal representative is to have regard as far as practicable to the wishes of the persons entitled to a particular property, there probably will be cases in which persons who do not want a particular property sold, do not want it to go out of the family, may well start litigation.  That problem will give rise to more trouble than the good sought to be achieved by this section.  It would seem to me if there was some direction in the section to the personal representative to have regard to the wishes of the beneficiaries and that, having done that, he had absolute discretion thereafter to sell as he thought fit, that would be a better provision and would avoid unnecessary trouble within families, and litigation.</P>
    <P>The section is curious in another way.  It may be that I am misinterpreting it.  It provides that the wishes of the persons of full age entitled to the property proposed to be sold are those to which the personal representative is to have regard.  I do <Col N="1241" /> not know what the position will be where you will have beneficiaries of full age and beneficiaries who are minors, or whether the executor will still be able to sell property even though there are minors in the case.  As the section stands, it seems to me that all a personal representative will be bound to do, where you have a mixture of adults and minors, will be to have regard to the wishes of the adults and then he is free to sell.  Apparently, the minor does not come into it.</P>
    <P>In that connection, it seems to me that the personal representative may also sell property which devolves upon the heir at law.  I may not be right in that, but at the moment that is the interpretation I am putting on it.  If that be the case, it seems to me that certain difficulties may arise when the heir at law is not to be found.  I am merely mentioning these matters so that the Minister will be aware of them and that he may be able to deal with them at a later stage.</P>
    <P>The only other questions I wish to deal with are the very technical matters the Minister has referred to in Part IV. Up to the new Statute of Limitations Act the position was that a person who remained on in possession of freehold registered land, and who had taken out administration, could not plead the Statute of Limitations for the purpose of having himself registered, whereas a person who stayed on for the same period, did not take out administration and did not raise representation to the deceased, could have himself registered. That position was rectified under the 1957 Act and under the decision <i>Vaughan v. Cottingham</i> in the Supreme Court, mentioned in the explanatory memorandum.  It always seemed to me to be a peculiar twist to the law that the man who had endeavoured to comply with the law and take out administration, thereby having to pay whatever death duties were payable, was in a worse position than the person who had made no effort to comply with the law or pay any revenue.  I understand the new position will also apply to the case of a personal representative who remains on in possession of real property.  I think that is inevitably logical in harmonising the position with regard to freehold property and real property, which is <Col N="1242" /> one of the main purposes of this Bill, and a purpose which it achieves in a very admirable way.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I should like to say that the explanatory memorandum issued with the Bill has proved extremely helpful.  It is extremely clear and will be highly useful to practitioners because it does a lot of the donkey work for people trying to understand the Bill.  It will be welcomed by the legal profession and other people dealing with the administration of estates.</P>

      <P>I welcome this Bill and, in particular, I should like to congratulate the Minister on the marginal notes, which should be of even greater help than the explanatory memorandum.  Opposite the particular section, they set out whether it is new law or the consolidation of existing statutes and what the statutes are. Those marginal notes will be very useful, indeed, to practitioners.</P>
      <P>The Bill is in the nature of being transitory in that it is a step towards dealing with the problem of the heir at law, which is, if you like, a feudal relic, and, in my view, in the present circumstances in this country relating to land holding it is outdated.  The heir at law idea is particularly outdated since the passing of the Registration of Title Act in 1891.  For all practical purposes the position of the heir at law in regard to realty is in the nature of something obsolescent, and I am glad to know it will be the basis of further legislation.  This particular legislation is a step towards that.  It provides that in future such realty as there is in the country will devolve in the same way as registered land has devolved since 1891 and in the same way as personalty does in the personal representative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator O'Quigley raised certain matters.  In regard to Section 16 he said he did not see any reason why a particular application under Section 16, for power to grant representation where there was no estate, could not be made in the Circuit Court.  He made the analogy with the Land Registry process.  I do not think there is any real analogy.  In each Circuit <Col N="1243" /> Court there is a Registry of Title and the application would be done through a particular Circuit Court but in regard to probate the central Probate Office is in Dublin and probates can easily be done as they are done every week in the High Court where the Probate Office is.  I do not think it is really practical to suggest that you could make these applications in the Circuit Court throughout the country where there are no probate offices.</P>
    <P>The Bill is a welcome one, as I say, because it is dealing with the realty of the situation that has existed in this country since the passing of the Registration of Title Act, 1891.  The distinction, since that Act, between such realty as there was left, and registered land, has become so obviously wrong and outdated that this Bill is a very welcome one.  I join with Senator O'Quigley in hoping that the Bill dealing with the heir at law problem will be tackled as quickly as possible to put paid to that particular medieval relic of the devolution of personal property and registered land as against realty.</P>

      <P>This Bill is, as the Minister has stated, preliminary to a proposal for important amendments in the law in connection with the distribution of real estate amongst next-of-kin and, for that reason, it will be a desirable piece of legislation.  The law in relation to descent of real or freehold property is not in keeping with the present-day outlook on individual rights.  Senator O'Quigley and Senator Lenihan have already referred to the system whereby the eldest son or brother obtains the property, subject only to a widow's right of dower. It frequently causes hardship to the daughters or younger male members of the family and may result in the person who has the benefit of the best education, and is possibly the most unsuited, obtaining ownership of the property to the exclusion of another who has stayed at home with the parents and cared for them in their old age.  The parents may have neglected making wills and so the person who should naturally benefit is excluded at the expense of some other person who is possibly away from home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1244" /> No doubt it was convenient with the system of hereditary titles which does not, of course, apply in our democratic State.  Undoubtedly, in consequence of the various Land Acts and the very large number of buildings which are now erected on leasehold property the amount of real property has considerably diminished and there seems to be little justification for retaining this antiquated system of inheritance.</P>
    <P>The Bill is, of course, largely a Committee Bill and I should like the Minister to consider for the next stage, if the doctrine of &ldquo;Relation Back&rdquo; should apply to administrators as it now applies to executors.  I should explain that executors' powers and responsibilities commence from the death of a testator, whereas those of the administrator commence only from the time of extraction of grant.</P>
    <P>An administrator cannot commence an action until grant of administration has been issued to him so that a person who improperly disposes of goods of an intestate and afterwards takes out administration may then, in his character of administrator, maintain an action to recover them back.  For that reason I would ask the Minister to consider for the next stage if there should be some provision made to get over that particular difficulty.</P>

      <P>It will not be necessary for me to talk for very long in view of the cordial manner in which the Bill has been received.  Senator O'Quigley was perfectly correct when he forecast that I would probably fall back on the comprehensive Bill because we do propose to tackle in that Bill some of the points raised by the Senator.  I have no doubt that the points which he raised will be very carefully and considerately examined by my officials.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to say, in regard to the explanatory memorandum, and the compliments which have been paid to it, that it was the work of my officers and that it was prepared at my request in view of the fact that I myself, being a layman, would not be in a position to explain legal points in the detailed manner that might be expected.  From that point of view the explanatory <Col N="1245" /> memorandum is in the nature of a textbook for practitioners and others interested in the Bill.  Almost every question raised here in the short discussion is referred to in the memorandum and the answer is probably to be found there.  That is the purpose of the memorandum.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question of the Circuit Court as against the High Court, I am informed that at the present time the High Court is the only court which has and always had, the jurisdiction to appoint administrators. The Probate Office and the district probate registries are, in fact, offices of the High Court.  Nevertheless, it is my intention to have the suggestion examined to see if it is possible to have some applications dealt with in the Circuit Court.  The Senator may have it in mind that fees would be higher in the High Court than in the Circuit Court.</P>
    <P>The Senator also raised the matter of administration bonds.  This was also raised in the Dáil and I made a statement on it there which, apparently, still does not satisfy the Senator. I do not know whether the Senator read the statement or not but it was a fairly clear statement to my mind. So that there will be no doubt, and in fact so that there will be complete clarification of the position in regard to these bonds, I want to say that the section and sub-section have been thoroughly examined in the light of criticisms in regard to provisions therein in respect of the payment of death duties, income-tax and surtax.  This matter was raised by the Incorporated Law Society and was also raised in the Dáil. On the Committee Stage in the Dáil I explained the necessity for the provision, and Senators will find my remarks reported at Column 427 of the Dáil Debates for the 5th November last.  I shall try to explain the matter again.</P>
    <P>The existing form of administration bond provides for the payment of those debts &ldquo;which the deceased did owe at his death&rdquo;.  This does not clearly cover death duties, which do not become due until after the death. Further, it does not clearly cover income-tax in respect of income arising <Col N="1246" /> to the administrator as such after the death or surtax falling due after the death.  The purpose of the provision in the sub-section is to cover these defects.</P>
    <P>Income-tax and surtax up to the death are clearly covered in the existing form of bond, and the proposed amendment of the law will make little if any difference as far as these taxes are concerned.  In so far as income-tax and surtax due after the death are concerned, the proposed new provision in the bond will, by the words of the sub-section, be confined to taxes &ldquo;payable out of the estate&rdquo;. I am advised that income-tax and surtax may in particular cases be payable out of the estate of a deceased person though not due at the date of death.  To take an example, income-tax may be payable in respect of income arising after the death.</P>
    <P>By the way, it was suggested in the Dáil that the proposed change in the law would mean increasing the amount of the bond.  That will not be so.  The purpose is merely to include payment of the taxes and duties in question amongst the conditions of the bond, without extending the penalty on breach of the bond mentioned in sub-section (2) (a).  The penalty will continue to be double the amount at which the estate is sworn unless the probate officer or the district probate registrar directs that the penalty be reduced.</P>
    <P>Most of the other points that Senator O'Quigley has raised will be examined before the Committee Stage.  I do not know that we can do very much about some of the points but they will all be considered. The points raised by Senator Louis Walsh will also be given consideration. There, again, I cannot say whether we will be able to do anything or not but, at least, we shall fully consider them.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
    <P>Committee Stage ordered for first sitting day after Easter.</P>
