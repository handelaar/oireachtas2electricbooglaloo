      <P>Since our last meeting, the members of the House will have learned with deep regret of the unexpected death of our friend and colleague, the Leas-Chathaoirleach, Senator Baxter.  Go ndéana Dia trócaire ar a anam.</P>
      <P>From his early manhood, the late Senator was prominently identified with the national movement.  He was associated with all Gaelic activities in his area, he acted as treasurer of the Sinn Féin West Cavan Executive, 1917-21, and was a member of the Dáil Éireann Courts West Cavan Executive.  For his national activities he suffered terms of imprisonment in various jails during the years 1919-21. In 1923 he was elected to Dáil Éireann and was a member of that House until 1927.  In 1927 he was Leader of the Farmers' Party in the Dáil.  He was a member of Seanad Éireann from 1931 to 1936.  On the re-establishment of the Seanad in 1938 he was elected on the Agricultural Panel and from that date had unbroken service in this House until his untimely death.</P>
      <P>In 1954 he was appointed Cathaoirleach of the Seanad and continued in that office until 1957 when he became Leas-Chathaoirleach.  In his capacity as Presiding Officer, he was fair&mdash;even indulgent&mdash;but he could be firm also. His firmness and sense of humour helped him to carry out his duties to the satisfaction of the House.</P>
      <P>Senator Baxter was a man of outstanding personality and a true friend.  Of a courteous and kindly disposition, he was a popular figure amongst all sections.  He was a forthright speaker with firm and strong political views but no matter how vigorously he expressed these views he never gave personal offence and never allowed his politics to mar his personal relationships.  He had an independent mind and was therefore excellent in council.  His Sinn Féin and Irish Ireland activities had widened his intellectual interests.  He added wide reading and careful study to a practical experience of farming and of local and national affairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the late Senator's interests were many and varied, agriculture and the economic advancement of the farming community were his main concern.  As a farmer who had equipped himself with up-to-date knowledge of sound agricultural methods, Senator Baxter's contributions to the discussions on agriculture were always listened to with interest and respect.  He was a member of <Col N="3" /> the Executive of the Irish Agricultural Organisation Society by whom he was nominated to the Seanad, a director of Irish Associated Creameries and he was one of the first directors appointed to the Agricultural Credit Corporation. For many years he was a member of the Cavan Agricultural and Vocational Education Committees.  He also rendered valuable service as a member of the Gaeltacht Commission, 1925, the De-Rating Commission, 1929 and the Commission on Agriculture, 1938.</P>
    <P>In Senator Baxter we have lost a public man whose work and integrity were appreciated by all with whom he came in contact and his passing will be keenly felt by all of us.</P>
    <P>To the widow and relatives of the late Senator, I shall convey on your behalf, and on my own, our sympathy and appreciation.</P>

      <P>Deintear na Scéimeanna Óglaigh na hEireann (Pinsin) fé <Col N="5" /> údaras na nAcht Fórsaí Cosanta (Pinsin), 1932 go 1957, agus tá baint acu le pá scoir, pinsin agus aiscí i gcóir nó i leith comhaltaí de na Buan-Oglaigh agus i gcóir comhaltaí de Sheirbhís Altranais an Airm agus den tSheirbhís Seipléineachta.  De réir Ailt 4 den Acht de 1932, ní thiocfaidh aon scéim phinsin i bhfeidhm go dtí go ndéanfar í do leaghadh fé bhráid gach Tí den Oireachtas agus í do dhaingniú le rún ó gach Teach acu sin.</P>
      <P>The Defence Forces (Pensions) Schemes are made under the authority of the Defence Forces (Pensions) Acts, 1932 to 1957, and deal with retired pay, pensions and gratuities for or in respect of members of the Permanent Defence Force and for members of the Army Nursing Service and the Chaplaincy Service.  Section 4 of the Act of 1932 provides that no scheme shall come into force unless and until it has been laid before each House of the Oireachtas and has been confirmed by a resolution of each such House.</P>
      <P>The Scheme, as Senators will see, contains eighteen Articles, the first four of which are definitory.  Four of the remaining 14 Articles&mdash;those numbered 5, 6, 12 and 14&mdash;provide for increases in the retired pay, pensions and gratuities of members of the Permanent Defence Force who, before retirement or discharge, enjoyed the benefit of the Army pay increases awarded as from 1st April, 1958.  The increases in retired pay, pensions and gratuities are proportionate to the pay increases.</P>
      <P>As will be seen from the explanatory memorandum circulated with the Scheme, Articles 7, 9, 13 and 15 are designed to give formal expression to certain interpretations which were always intended; the Articles do not, therefore, introduce new policies or principles and I feel that Senators will not wish me to take up the time of the House with any further elaboration of these provisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Article 8 is necessary because of a revision of the Short Service Scheme for officers of the Air Corps.  Up to the 31st December, 1958, the Short Service Scheme provided that those appointed under its provisions would serve for six months as cadets and <Col N="6" /> 3½ years as officers.  Selected officers would be permitted to extend to 5½ years.  Gratuities under the Pensions Schemes were payable to officers on completion of these periods of service. The revised Short Service Scheme provides that persons appointed under its provisions will serve for 18 months as cadets and 5½ years as officers. Article 8 of this Amending Pensions Scheme removes, therefore, the entitlement to a gratuity, on completion of 3½ years service, in the cases of persons appointed after the 31st December, 1958.</P>
    <P>At present, ex-officers in receipt of retired pay who desire to live outside the State are required by Article 18 of the Principal Scheme to obtain the written permission of the Minister for Defence to do so.  There is no reason why any restriction should be placed on the movements of retired officers, except those with commitments to the Reserve Defence Force, whose position is provided for in Defence Force Regulations.  It is proposed, therefore, to revoke Article 18, and this is being done by Article 10 of this Scheme.</P>
    <P>Article 20 of the Principal Scheme as amended provides for the payment of pensions to the widows and children of deceased officers but it does not cover the case of the widow of an officer with twelve or more, but less than twenty, years' service who died, following voluntary retirement, while in receipt of retired pay.  Article 11 of this Scheme enables a pension to be paid to the widow of such an officer who was originally appointed for special duties with the Volunteer Force.  Amendments limited to officers in this category and their dependants have been made from time to time because of their exceptional circumstances, and it is in accordance with that consideration that the present amendment is being effected.  Only one widow is involved.</P>
    <P>Articles 16 and 18 are designed to cover the case of an officer who retires voluntarily with less than twelve years' service and who is later reappointed to be an officer.  A case in point would be that of an officer who retired to follow a religious vocation but who, not finding himself suited to the religious <Col N="7" /> life, was permitted to return to the Army.  At present, the Principal Scheme does not enable such an officer's service on his reappointment to be reckoned as pensionable.  Article 16 adjusts this position, and Article 18 provides that if the Officer received a gratuity in respect of his first period of service, that gratuity will be taken into consideration in the calculation of his final retirement benefits.</P>
    <P>Lastly, Article 17 of the Scheme enables children adopted under the Adoption Act, 1952, to be reckoned for benefit under the Schemes as if they were children born in lawful wedlock to the adopting parents, provided that they were adopted before termination of the services of the adopting officer or soldier.</P>
    <P>I hope that my statement will have served to clarify the provisions of this amending Scheme, but if there are any points of difficulty remaining in the minds of Senators, I shall be glad to deal with them when I am concluding.</P>

As I understand the position, there is very considerable delay at times in obtaining copies of Bills which have recently been enacted.  Is the Minister satisfied that, if this Bill comes into operation on 1st June, a person who requires this Bill will be able to get copies of it on that date or before it, if possible?</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamStanford" hpid="Prof. Stanford Prof. Stanford">
      <NameTxt>Prof. Stanford</NameTxt>
      <P>On the section and, if I may, on Part II in general in connection with Section 6, I should like to say that this is a very technical Bill and I hope the House will forgive my temerity in speaking on it, but I did consult an expert on the matter in the Bill and the following points were raised by her.  As you may guess from the pronoun it is in connection with the position of women under this Bill. I should like to phrase it in the form of two questions to the Minister.  First of all, is there any intention under this Bill to provide for the following case? If a wife dies intestate, I understand her property goes entirely to the husband at present.  I think it is felt in many quarters that that is unfair because the husband may use all that property on himself, or on a second wife, and the children of the first marriage may receive nothing whatever from their mother's estate.  I believe I am correct in holding that, but, if I am wrong, I waive it.  I would ask the Minister to consider whether that is a just provision.  It may be completely accidental that the wife makes no will.  The money, I think and many others think, should be shared in some settled proportion between the husband and her children. Would the Minister consider making provision in this Bill to meet that case if it is not already provided for?  As far as I can see, it is not included in the Bill as it stands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Here is a second case which I should like the Minister to consider.  Suppose a husband dies, without making adequate provision in his will for his wife, so far as I can see she has no right to appeal to the courts for adequate provision.  I believe that is the case.  I confess that all the time I am speaking about matters I know only at second hand, but I am trying to improve the Bill, if it is possible for an amateur to do so.  Would the Minister consider under this Bill, or by other means, making it legally permissible for the wife to go to the <Col N="9" /> courts and ask for adequate provision for herself from her husband's estate? I may have misstated this: if so perhaps the Minister will correct me. Perhaps I can clarify what I want to say after the Minister has spoken.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>The law at the moment is as the Senator states, but I do not know if he was here when we were discussing this Bill on Second Reading.  On that occasion, I made it very clear to the House that we were bringing in a comprehensive Bill at a later stage and that matters which Senator O'Quigley, Senator Lenihan and Senator Louis Walsh raised would be considered.  At the time I gave that undertaking to these Senators with a view to seeing that the matters they raised be considered for inclusion in the comprehensive Bill.  I can give only the same reply to Senator Stanford now.  The law, as it stands at the present time, is more or less what has been outlined to him.  Matters in regard to the descent of property will be dealt with in the comprehensive Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamStanford" hpid="Prof. Stanford Prof. Stanford">
      <NameTxt>Prof. Stanford</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Minister is it likely-that the comprehensive Bill will be forthcoming fairly soon? Would it be possible, since this is the matter of elementary rights&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>At, the moment the Department of Justice is inundated with Bills of one kind or another, and the comprehensive Bill will just have to take its place in the queue, so to speak.  The Bills which are being given priority over all others are the Bills to establish the Courts under the Constitution and, until we get clear of that, I cannot make any firm promise that one Bill will take precedence over another. Senators will also remember that we have an Intoxicating Liquor Bill, and I am being pressed right, left and centre for its introduction.  There is also the Rent Restrictions Bill and innumerable other Bills, and how we are to get through them all, and please everybody who is pressing for them, will be a matter of difficulty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamStanford" hpid="Prof. Stanford Prof. Stanford">
      <NameTxt>Prof. Stanford</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of what the Minister said, would it be possible to work these elementary rights into the <Col N="10" /> present Bill or does he not think it a suitable Bill in which to incorporate them?  Women are patient by nature, but sometimes they become a little impatient, and it would be sad if we lost the good will of our women citizens if we delayed granting these elementary rights.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>According to the memorandum, this is a section which is designed to clarify the position with regard to the vesting of property between the date of death of a person dying intestate and the grant of administration.  I am just wondering whether, in fact, this section does clarify the position, because it is easy to envisage circumstances in which the office of the President of the High Court will be vacant.  I am wondering can the Minister say where there are other statutes to provide for the contingency, where the President of the High Court either retires or dies, that some other judge will be deemed to occupy the office of the President of of the High Court.  If there is not, this section does not eliminate the difficulty.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>The section is intended to put it beyond doubt where vesting takes place between the date of a person dying intestate and the date of grant of administration.  For some part of that period, the office of <Col N="11" /> the President of the High Court may be vacant and, if the matter is to be dealt with at all, it seems to me there should be no lacuna which would still leave the position not clear beyond doubt.  It seems to me there can be a position in which there will be nobody in whom the property will vest when the office of the President of the High Court is vacant.</P>

      <P Just="Center">SECTION 14.</P>
      <P>Government amendment No. 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>*1. In subsection (3), line 15, before &ldquo;and&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;for which the personal representative is accountable.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a drafting amendment designed to ensure that the administration bond will cover only those death duties for which the personal representative is accountable. The difference between real estate and personal estate for the purposes of death duties is explained in some detail in page 2 of the Explanatory Memorandum.  Estate duty on real estate (including compulsorily registered land) is a charge on the estate itself, and is payable by the person entitled to the estate under the will of an intestacy.  The personal representative is accountable for the estate duty on the personal estate, and he pays this duty out of the residuary personal estate.  It has recently been advanced against subsection (3) that the sub-section as drafted might be relied on to make the personal representative accountable for estate duty for which he is not at present accountable.  If this were so, we would in fact be running contrary to the proposal in section 8 to leave the law as to death duties as it is.  The present amendment <Col N="12" /> will clarify the position.  Our intention was to make no change in the law as to the incidence of death duties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOQuigley" hpid="Mr. O'Quigley Mr. O'Quigley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>On that amendment, there are certain circumstances where the personal representative may be accountable for duty but may not be able to pay the duty because sufficient assets may not have come into his hands.  So far as I understand the position, there is provision in the Finance Acts which makes the personal representative liable only to the extent to which assets have come into his hands.  He might be accountable, say, for some £500 estate duty on personal property, but he may have assets only to the extent of £300.  Therefore, the Revenue Commissioners could hold him accountable only for the sum of £300.  It seems to me that what the amendment is doing is making the administrator, under his bond, liable for the whole amount and it seems to me that that is some change in the law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>The only reply I can give to that is that the representative enters into a bond and is responsible then for seeing that the payments are made.  As the Senator knows, that is the normal position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOQuigley" hpid="Mr. O'Quigley Mr. O'Quigley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>That is so.  He will be liable now under his bond to pay the whole of his duty and the Revenue Commissioners can proceed against the bond for duty which up to now he was not liable to pay but was liable to pay only to the extent to which assets had come into his hands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>The actual position is that he is not liable to pay any more than the value of the assets he has received.  He is, of course, bound to get in the assets.  I think that may clarify the difficulty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOQuigley" hpid="Mr. O'Quigley Mr. O'Quigley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid not; I do not agree that that is so.  I know that the administrator at present is liable only to the extent to which assets come into his hands.  If you take a person dying with a large amount of real estate, land, by reason of the amount of land, the rate of duty may be, say, 15 to 20 per cent. but the <Col N="13" /> amount of liquid assets, personal property, the administrator would have would not be sufficient in certain circumstances to meet the claim of the Revenue Commissioners in respect of that personal property.  There is great difficulty dealing with this Bill because it is so complicated.  This Bill is peculiarly one which can be examined properly only as it works out in practice but if hardship does result to the administrators of estates by reason of this, I am sure the Minister would be prepared to modify it in the light of experience when it has been working for some time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Louis Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator O'Quigley has raised the question of real estate, but under this Bill the real estate is vested in the personal representative and it is necessary for him to give an assent before the real estate comes into the hands of the devisee.  I suggest the personal representative would have control over all the assets and would be able to pay the duty from all those assets before he vests the devisee. Accordingly, I suggest that it is only right that the bond should be given for the amount of assets that come into the hands of the personal representative.</P>

      <P>This is a section to which I referred especially on the <Col N="14" /> Second Reading.  It seems to me that the section, as worded, will give rise to considerable difficulty, so far as personal representatives are concerned. The section is intended to confer upon the personal representative power of sale over real and personal estate.  The personal representative already has power to sell personal estate and has now to get power to sell real estate for the purpose of selling assets among the persons beneficially entitled. There is an obligation imposed on the personal representative apparently to consult with the person beneficially entitled, so far as practicable and to give effect to their wishes, so far as is practicable.  I do not know what the position will be where a personal representative is not giving effect to the wishes of the persons beneficially entitled so far as practicable in the view of those people.</P>
      <P>I think the Section would be far better if it were drafted in another way, but it is very difficult to see how it could be drafted in another way so as to give the power to personal representatives to sell personal property and provide that he shall endeavour to ascertain the wishes of the persons beneficially entitled and take their wishes into consideration. Here there is a direction that he shall consult with the persons beneficially entitled, so far as practicable.  A number of people whom I have consulted on this section anticipate that it is likely to give rise to considerable trouble because of the direction that the personal representative shall give effect to the wishes of the persons beneficially entitled, as far as practicable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another point which arises on this section, sub-section 1, that the persons who are to be consulted by the personal representatives are those who are of full age beneficially entitled. There is a somewhat similar section in the Land Transfer Act, 1897, which applies only in Britain.  I think it is Section 6 of that Act.  It dealt with the position where the personal representative was given certain powers but where there were minor children or persons of unsound mind and then the consent of the committee of the person of unsound mind, or of the guardian of <Col N="15" /> the minor children, had to be obtained.</P>
    <P>A difficulty would arise in cases of this kind in rural Ireland, where a man dies and appoints, perhaps, his brother as executor and he leaves his property among his children and his wife.  Under this new situation, the personal representative will be entitled to sell the farm of land, by virtue of this section, over the heads of the widow and children, and then distribute, that is, lodge the money in respect of the children, apparently, in court and give the widow her share.  That is a situation which is not likely to arise in many cases, but it could arise where there has been bad feeling between in-laws and where one of them has been appointed personal representative, or where they fall out after the death of the testator.  It seems to me to be an extremely wide power to give to a personal representative, without any obligation on him to get the sanction of the court or of anybody else.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator expressed some concern about this matter when we were discussing the Bill on the Second Stage.  He may remember that. As a result, I had section 18 examined rather carefully by my advisers in the Department of Justice.  The Senator felt that this section might give rise to difficulties, in so far as it provides that the personal representative must, before selling the whole or any part of the estate, have regard to the wishes of the beneficiaries of full age.  The Senator seemed apprehensive in case the section should lead to litigation.  As a result of the examination to which I have referred, I am satisfied that the Senator's fears are groundless.</P>
      <P>First of all, the section says that the personal representative must give effect to the wishes of the beneficiaries &ldquo;as far as practicable&rdquo;.  If it is not practicable, he need not do so.  Secondly, in case of dispute, the wishes of the majority (according to the value of their combined interests) must prevail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Senator raised another point on the section.  He said that he did not know what the position would be in the case of beneficiaries who are minors.  The answer is that the personal representative cannot take account of the wishes of minors <Col N="16" /> because there is no way minors have of giving effect to their wishes.  A minor in the ordinary way cannot make a binding contract and is in general under a legal disability.  The personal representative looks after the interests of minors who are beneficiaries and he does so as he is a trustee for them.  The present law is that, where a minor is himself the personal representative, an administrator appointed for the period of the minority may sell.  This could arise where a person under 21 years is appointed sole executor by a will.  I should mention that it is only for the purpose of administering the estate that the personal representative is allowed to sell.  If, for instance, debts cannot be paid without selling, he must sell.</P>
    <P>Subsection (1) of section 18 will help in a case where a farm of unregistered land descends on an intestacy to three sons.  One of the sons may decide to remain on, and the other two can then come to a financial arrangement with him to prevent a sale.  In a case like this, the desirability of compelling the personal representative to consult the beneficiaries is obvious. In the case of the heir at law mentioned by the Senator, the personal representative would sell only for the purpose of paying debts, paying legacies payable out of the real estate, and satisfying the rights of a widow.  The difficulty in finding the heir at law could also arise in finding the next of kin, where an ordinary farm of registered land is concerned.  I cannot see that the section will cause much difficulty in practice.  A personal representative may always apply to the court for directions in case of difficulty.</P>

      <P>Subsection (4) provides that where the personal representative has dissented to the transfer of land within a year of the death of an owner, the person entitled can apply to the court for an order ordering the personal representative to transfer.  Then, if he does not transfer, the court may vest the land in the person entitled.  In connection with that application, there does not seem to me to be any provision under which the court can penalise the personal representative in costs for his failure to comply with the law.  It seems to me to put an unnecessary burden on the beneficiary.  When he has to make such an application to the court, there are always costs incurred in that connection.  I wonder if the Minister is satisfied that, in such a case, the court would have power to award costs against a defaulting personal representative.</P>

      <P>We are satisfied on reconsideration that the last part of subsection (2) of section 87 of the Registration of Title Act, 1891, which allows the personal representative to be registered jointly with the person entitled, should not be re-enacted.

If there is any reason why the Court should not make an order for the registration of the person entitled, there is nothing to prevent the Court allowing such person to renew his application.</P>

      <P>To delete subsection (6) and substitute the following new subsection:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;( ) (a) Nothing in this Act or in the Administration of Estates Act, 1959, shall operate to require the registering authority to register as the owner of land a person in his capacity as personal representative.</P>
      <P>(b) Notwithstanding anything contained in subsection (1) of section 17 of the Registration of Title Act, 1942, the registering authority may enter on the register a note setting out the fact of the death of a registered owner of land and the names of his personal representatives.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>The object of this amendment is twofold.  Firstly, it proposes to re-write subsection (6) in the light of the amendment to subsection (5).  Secondly, it proposes to provide for the entry in the register of a note of the death of the registered owner.  Up to the making of the 1937 Land Registration Rules, the entry of such a note was provided for in the rules, though there was no express statutory authority for so doing.  The entry of a note renders unnecessary the registration of the personal representative. <Col N="19" /> The present practice of registering the personal representative will be discontinued.</P>
      <P>By the way, subsection (1) of section 17 of the Registration of Title Act, 1942, mentioned in paragraph (b) of the proposed new subsection, prevents notice of a trust in respect of registered land being entered in the register.  It is considered desirable to make it clear that the 1942 Act provision does not prevent the entry of a note of the death of the registered owner and the names of his personal representatives.  The policy of the law as to the registration of title is to keep trusts off the register, but the entry of a note of death will not conflict with this policy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. S. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to amend the law relating to companies at present laid down in the Companies Act, 1908-1924.  It has long been recognised that our company law is in need of revision to bring it into line with present-day conditions, but it has, up to the present, been difficult to find an opportunity to undertake the task because of its magnitude and complexity.</P>
      <P>As Senators are no doubt aware, a committee was set up in 1951 to examine the matter, and their report was published last year.  The committee discharged their task in an expert and workmanlike manner, and I have already expressed the Government's appreciation of the valuable services rendered by them.  Their report, which contains many proposals for the amendment of the existing legislation, is at present under examination, but some period of time must elapse before the full implications of all the recommendations can be fully examined.  For that reason, the Government decided, as an interim measure, that legislation should be introduced to give effect to some of the more urgent reforms requiring attention.</P>
      <P>Later on, perhaps before the end of the year, a second and much larger Bill will be introduced to deal with the other amendments.  Then, in order to cause as little inconvenience as possible in the legal and commercial fields and to ensure that the law will be as readily comprehensible as possible, it is intended to have all the law on the subject ultimately consolidated in one Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendments of the legislation contemplated in this Bill are not very numerous.  One of them will permit the issue of redeemable preference shares.  Under the existing law, the share capital of a company cannot be reduced without the sanction of the Courts.  A company cannot, therefore, issue preference shares on <Col N="22" /> the basis that they are redeemable, as this would involve an assumption that the Courts would sanction the reduction of capital.  As Senators are aware, it is sometimes difficult to raise capital on satisfactory terms by the issue of ordinary shares.  There is, of course, the alternative of issuing preference shares, but this may be an unsatisfactory alternative, since preference shares do not nowadays find the support they commanded in former years.  One reason for this is that, over a number of years, there has been a tendency for their market value to fall, with the result that prospective purchasers of preference shares are often deterred from buying them because of the danger of capital loss. It is reasonably certain that an assurance of redemption at par within a fixed time would go a long way towards removing this disadvantage and would prove an attraction for investors. The possibility of issuing shares of this kind would therefore remove to some extent the difficulty which a number of Irish firms have experienced in procuring capital for development purposes.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that, provided adequate safeguards are adopted, the issue of redeemable preference shares would be advantageous.  It has been suggested in the course of the debates on the Bill in the Dáil that, in addition to providing for the issue of redeemable shares as such, the Bill should also enable companies to convert existing preference shares to redeemable preference shares.  In the case of many companies this would no doubt be a desirable power to have, and I considered carefully the possibility of making a suitable amendment in the Bill.  There are, however, obstacles to this course which are rather formidable.</P>
    <P>The principal difficulty which arises is that it is not sufficient to secure the assent of the preference shareholders and other members of a company to a scheme for the conversion of irredeemable shares to redeemable ones; the interests of creditors are of paramount importance and must also be safeguarded.  It must be borne in mind that creditors enter into commitments <Col N="23" /> with a company on the understanding that its capital cannot be reduced without the sanction of the Courts.  A conversion of existing shares to redeemable shares would seriously affect their security, as it could involve a reduction in the liquid assets equivalent to the value of the shares to be redeemed.  The creditors must, therefore, be given the right of applying to the Courts to have any such conversion disallowed.</P>
    <P>A further difficulty which arises is that it would be unrealistic to assume that all the preference shareholders involved in a conversion scheme would be willing to accept redemption of their shares, and steps would have to be taken to protect their interests. As the law would stand on the passage of this Bill it would be possible to replace existing preference shares with redeemable preference shares by cancelling the existing issue in accordance with the procedure for reduction of capital provided for in the 1908 Act&mdash;a procedure which safeguards the interests of creditors and dissenting shareholders&mdash;and making in its place a new issue of redeemable shares.  Should it be possible to devise a more direct and simpler method which would at the same time provide adequate protection for creditors and dissenting shareholders, I should be prepared to consider incorporating it in the next Companies Bill which as I have indicated, will be coming along later.</P>
    <P>At present, a company may not purchase its own shares, as this would constitute a reduction of its share capital.  The present Bill closes a loophole in this provision by prohibiting a company from providing financial assistance to other persons to enable them to purchase its shares.  I propose to make an exemption to this rule which will permit a company to provide funds for the purchase of shares for the benefit of the employees. Schemes of this kind, which are in fact profit-sharing schemes, are regarded as highly desirable, and I do not wish that there should be any legal difficulties in our way.  As a corollary to prohibiting companies from dealing in their own <Col N="24" /> shares, I propose to prohibit a subsidiary company from purchasing shares in its holding company, and so prevent a holding company and its subsidiaries, by purchasing each other's shares, from building up an impressive facade of capital, which might be unsupported by any worthwhile assets.</P>
    <P>Schemes for the amalgamation of companies may, in certain circumstances, prove impracticable under the law as it stands.  The vast majority of the shareholders of a company whose shares another company wishes to acquire may be quite willing to sell, but for one reason or another a small minority may not be prepared to do so. As sometimes it is not an attractive proposition for the purchasing company to purchase less than 100% of the share capital of the other company, amalgamation schemes which are, perhaps, desirable from many points of view may fall through.  In order to provide a remedy for this difficulty, the Bill contains a provision that if an amalgamation scheme has been approved by the holders of at least 80% of the shares involved, the acquiring company may purchase compulsorily the shares held by the dissenting minority.  The position of minority groups is being safeguarded, however, by providing for a right of appeal to the Courts.</P>
    <P>At present, certain resolutions (such as resolutions in connection with a change of name of a company or a change in its articles) are effective only if they are passed at two successive meetings; these resolutions are known as special resolutions.  In practice, the second meeting is usually a complete formality and serves no useful purpose.  There is, therefore, little point in putting companies to the expense of calling a second meeting, and I propose to relieve them of this obligation. I propose also to make a change in the law as regards the computation of votes at a meeting.  As the law stands, members who are present at a meeting but do not vote on a resolution are regarded as voting against it.  This is obviously unsatisfactory, and I propose to amend the law to provide that, in future, in computing the requisite majority, votes not cast will be disregarded.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="25" /> Every company is required to send each year to the Registrar of Companies a complete list of its shareholders showing their names, addresses and occupations and also giving details of their shareholdings.  The preparation of this list involves a good deal of labour in the case of companies with a large number of shareholders and I propose to relax the requirement to some extent without weakening its effectiveness.  The Bill includes a provision that in future a complete list of shareholders need be filed in every fifth year only, provided a list of additions to, and deletions from, the full list is filed in each of the intervening years. This provision is permissive, and any company may if it wishes continue to file the complete list each year.</P>
    <P>The name of a company must be set out in the Memorandum of Association which is registered in the Companies Office.  This name may be changed subsequently by passing a special resolution and procuring my approval.  As the House is aware a number of companies have been established under the Companies Acts by Acts of the Oireachtas, which in some cases prescribed the name under which they were to be registered.  As a result these companies are unable to change their names under the procedure provided by the Companies Acts.  A case which illustrated their difficulty came under my notice sometime ago when I was requested to approve of a change of name for one of these companies.  I would have been perfectly willing to convey my assent, but I was advised that the procedure under the Companies Acts could not be utilised and that amending legislation would be necessary.  In order to remove the difficulty I am including in this Bill a clause providing that the procedure under the Companies Acts will be available to these companies in future.</P>
    <P>I am taking this opportunity of repealing the Companies (Foreign Interests) Act, 1917.  That Act, which was passed during the First World War, is now an anachronism.  It has long ceased to have any force but it is sometimes the cause of confusion in commercial and legal circles and the best way of dealing with the situation <Col N="26" /> is to remove it from the Statute Book.</P>
    <P>As I have already said, this Bill is merely an interim measure which is to be followed shortly by another and much more comprehensive Bill.  I would therefore ask Senators not to press for the inclusion in this Bill of any matters which can be allowed to stand over till the second Bill, since to do so would defeat the whole purpose of the present Bill which is to give the force of law to certain desirable reforms without suffering the delay which is inescapable in the preparation of so large and complex a measure as the main Bill will have to be.</P>
    <P>I can assure the Seanad that all possible steps are being taken to reduce to a minimum the delay in preparing the main Bill, as I am satisfied that the revision of our company law is long overdue and should not be postponed any further.  It will be realised, however, that the drafting of the second Bill will be a very complex and formidable task, and time will be needed to prepare the comprehensive and carefully thought-out measure which will replace our present code of company law.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is, in my opinion, one of the most important Bills that have come before the House for very many years.  It is, if you like, the child of the report of the Company Law Reform Committee which was set up by the then Attorney General, Mr. Charles J. Casey.  On that Committee, Mr. Casey was able to procure some of the best brains, in the State and outside the State, to report on the position of company law as it appertained in Ireland at the present time, and on its defects.  I was glad to hear the Minister say that this is only a beginning of what he intends to do and I presume he proposes to codify the whole of the company law in Ireland as it exists at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I must welcome his forcefulness in bringing forward this Bill because it deals with some, or at least one, of the most important omissions in existing company law, that is, the right of the private company to issue redeemable preference shares and I think it well <Col N="27" /> that I should refer briefly to what I think has been one of the defects in our company law as it affects our economy and particularly as it has affected our provincial economy.</P>
    <P>I know that in south-east Ireland, a part of the country in which I was born and reared and which I know very well, there were many fine, thriving industrial concerns.  There was one firm, known as the firm of Malcolmson, and I think it is quite possible that the defects of the then inadequate company law constituted one of the reasons why that great firm in Portlaw became bankrupt nearly one hundred years ago.  At that time, the establishment of the public company in Britain and the wider scope there for the investment of family moneys attracted moneys away from the establishment of the limited company, which were invested in readily marketable equity stocks in Great Britain.  The result has been that money has been siphoned away from the family business.</P>
    <P>There is another point which I think the Minister knows, but which I think should be stated in public today, that money invested in private companies is not readily marketable and is not negotiable.  One can walk into a local bank and say: &ldquo;I have five thousand £1 ordinary shares in a local company.  It is giving good employment and is exporting a quantity of its products.&rdquo; The bank manager then says: &ldquo;It seems a very good company to me but I am not able to put these shares on the market.  I am not in a position to sell them.  They are not negotiable and, as a security, the bank is not very interested in this type of scrip.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There is also another disadvantage which I wish to bring to the Minister's attention and of which, doubtless, he knows already, that is, if one invests money in one of these companies and, if one can be a director of the company, one may in that way derive remuneration but, on ceasing to be a director of the company, there is no obligation on it to pay a dividend to the holder of the shares.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="28" /> Finally, the important point I wish to make is with regard to the redeemable preference shares.  If one of these companies wants capital, it can now get it by the redeemable preference shares because they will have to be paid off at stated times.  A person living in a country town who would like to help the economy of that country town but might want to provide for a daughter or son who may come of age, or for the education of a son or daughter in five or ten years' time, might say: &ldquo;I shall invest £2,000 or £3,000 in a local industry and it will be redeemed at the time I want to send my son or daughter to a University or to another place of education.&rdquo; That, to me, is one of the major advantages which the Minister is including in this Bill.  The other advantage I see is that the Minister's State agencies who wish to lend money to these companies, to assist them to increase their activities or to help them through difficult times, can be paid off at stated dates in redeemable preference shares.</P>
    <P>At this stage, I do not think there is anything further that one can add except to thank the Committee who have issued such a fine report.  We shall have an opportunity of reading it much more closely and of giving it a more detailed scrutiny when the Minister brings in the codifying legislation which he has promised to bring in at a later stage.  I should like to ask the Minister if he has this work in hand at present and I should like to express the hope that it will not be long delayed because the type of company which we are to have in Ireland will be influenced by it.  The type of legislation we have must protect the family and the family business because the family business will be the genesis from which the big public company and the managers will spring.  I feel that the Minister's responsibility in this is great and I do not think that he is unmindful of his responsibility.  We wish him well in this work and ask him to hasten the conclusion of the task as contained in the report of the committee set up at the instigation of the Minister's predecessor, Deputy Sweetman, when he was Minister for Finance.</P>

      <P>As I understand the position from what the Minister has said, and from reading the Dáil debate, this is not a very important measure.  It arises out of a report of a committee which sat for some seven years and the Minister anticipates another and more complicated measure later on.  That is to be followed by a third Bill to codify all the company legislation.  The Minister is aware that the trade union movement feels very strongly that the inadequate type of accounts which public companies must furnish should be brought up to date; that not alone should the bare essentials of the balance sheet be furnished but also that the profit and loss account should be furnished.  The trade union movement made submissions to the committee on that point, amongst others.</P>
      <P>The committee did recommend that the law should be brought up to date in that respect.  I am wondering why the Minister did not take the opportunity in this Bill to provide for this improvement.  I do not think it would be a very controversial issue.  I do not think it would be very complicated because already the committee have said what they thought were the essential minima for the type of accounts that should be furnished by these public companies.  Of course, the furnishing of accounts and the new details which should be furnished, as recommended by the committee, apply only to public companies.  I was interested in what Senator Burke said about the public companies growing out of the family businesses and the family companies. Unfortunately&mdash;or perhaps Senator Burke would say &ldquo;fortunately&rdquo;&mdash;that does not seem to have been the experience in this country.  I notice that, in 1925, there were some 1,088 private companies and by last year, they had increased sevenfold, to 7,664.  Over the same period, the number of public companies had increased by only three, from the comparatively small number of 368 to 371 and the accounts I am talking about refer only to those public companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the Bill itself, I was interested in what the Minister said about making provision for the issue <Col N="30" /> of shares to the employees of a company, which is provided for in Section 3, that is, that the companies are being exempted from the bar which otherwise operates in relation to furnishing money for the acquisition of shares of that company.  That bar does not operate when the money is for the purpose of purchasing shares for the benefit of employees or former employees&mdash;in other words, encouraging in a way&mdash;or should I say?&mdash;preventing a discouragement of, profit sharing and a share in the ownership of companies by the employees.</P>
    <P>That is thoroughly desirable.  To my mind, it is essential that we should have industrial democracy as well as political democracy&mdash;although the latter may seem to be endangered at present.  To come back to Senator Burke&mdash;he mentioned the banks and the views of bank managers in regard to giving loans to a company.  That reminds me of something I heard about a factory in France recently which wanted money to expand, or to re-equip, or to stay in existence.  The firm approached the bank manager who did not seem to be very much different from Irish bank managers and after examining their accounts, the company was told: &ldquo;Well, certainly we will advance you the necessary money, but of course we would want a seat on your board and we also think you should cut out these social services and welfare benefits to your employees.  After all, that is the task of the State.&rdquo;  This company did not take that advice and the management went back to the employees in the factory and told them what the bank had said.  The management asked them would it not be a good idea if, instead of the bank advancing the money, and having a seat on the board, the employees themselves furnished the money and had a seat on the board.  I believe that factory has shown considerable improvement and when there were some general strikes, even the Communists in the factory worked there because they considered they had a share in the ownership of it.</P>
    <P>It is very desirable that profit sharing and sharing in the ownership of companies <Col N="31" /> and factories should be encouraged. This Bill does not go out of its way to encourage that, but it prevents a bar coming down in a certain respect.  Applying the same sort of argument and the same point of view to Section 2 of the Bill, I find that it is provided that where redeemable preference shares are redeemed otherwise than out of the proceeds of a fresh issue, the nominal value of the redeemed shares is transferred to a capital redemption fund; in other words, it is set aside in a separate fund.</P>
    <P>Sub-section (5) of that section goes on to provide that this capital redemption fund may be used to issue fully paid up bonus shares to members of the company&mdash;and apparently only &ldquo;to members of the company&rdquo;.  It seems to me that a company wishing to expand, wishing to re-equip, wishing to boost its production, might think it a very good idea to get the necessary money by the methods&mdash;desirable methods&mdash;which are being provided in this Bill, namely, the power to issue redeemable preference shares.  Having improved itself, it sets aside the money to redeem those preference shares.</P>
    <P>A company in that position may have been materially helped to accomplish that by the co-operation and work of its employees.  I suggest that the board might think that in those circumstances it would be a good idea to issue bonus shares to its employees.  As the section stands, it would be precluded from doing so.  All they can do, if they wish later to issue bonus shares out of the proceeds of this capital redemption fund, is to issue fully-paid up shares to the existing shareholders, and only to the existing shareholders.  I should like the Minister to consider, between now and Committee Stage, whether it would be desirable, in view of what he is doing in Section 3, to amend that subsection slightly so as to provide that the company can issue shares to its existing shareholders and/or to its employees.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOQuigley" hpid="Mr. O'Quigley Mr. O'Quigley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister, in his statement, has made the purpose of the Bill very clear.  I do not intend to say very much on it.  The report <Col N="32" /> of the committee which studied this matter is an admirable document and, indeed, many people who are concerned with company law are glad that such a document is available, since it sets out the position with great clarity and sets out its recommendations very clearly, too.  There certainly is a great need for some clarification of the existing law with regard to companies.  I am certain that everybody will welcome the Minister's statement that it is intended to introduce another comphensive amending Bill before the end of this year, with a view to the consolidation of company law.</P>
      <P>There seems to be a considerable demand for power to issue redeemable preference shares.  If that be the case, this Bill will help considerably in the provision of capital for industry.  The Minister made it quite clear that, where one company is buying all or any class of shares of another company, adequate provision has been made in the Bill to safeguard the rights of minorities.  After all the discussion we have had here in recent times on the position of minorities, I am sure we are all very glad that solicitude is shown, and rightly so, in this Bill for minorities.  Not alone is the position safeguarded as regards the value of shares, but also as regards the number of holders&mdash;and of course, there is an appeal to the Court provided in the Bill.</P>
      <P>There is one drafting point which seems to be curious.  It occurs in Sections 4 and 5, and I must confess that I do not understand it.  I wonder if there is any particular reason for it in this Bill.  In subsection (1) of Section 4, the words &ldquo;cannot be a member&rdquo; are used.  It seems to me that this is a colloquialism which has unwittingly crept into this section.  I should have thought that the phraseology there should be &ldquo;shall not be a member&rdquo; or &ldquo;may not be a member&rdquo;. The word &ldquo;cannot&rdquo; does not seem to make any sense whatever.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The same word occurs in Section 5 (2) (a), where a person &ldquo;cannot be appointed thereto without the exercise in his favour,&rdquo; and so on.  Colloquially, &ldquo;cannot&rdquo; is correct, I suppose, but I can see lawyers having considerable <Col N="33" /> difficulty in deciding what this word means.  I do not pretend to know a great deal about company law.  It may be that that is a phrase which is particularly appropriate in this case, but I do not think it is and I should be glad if the Minister would consider the matter with a view to having it amended.</P>
    <P>The sections could be amended today, if that is necessary, and if the Minister is anxious to get all Stages of the Bill today.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. S. Lemass Mr. S. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Burke was correct in describing this as an important Bill, in so far as it represents the first effort to revise our company legislation for 50 years.  It is, of course, only the lesser of two Bills which will precede the ultimate consolidation measure to which I referred.  The second Bill will be much larger and far more comprehensive and intricate. We undertook in this Bill to deal only with amendments to the law the need for which had been demonstrated in recent years and where it was practicable to meet the situation by an amendment which could stand alone and would not necessarily involve any consequential changes in other sections of the Companies Acts.  There may be other amendments which I would regard as equally important and equally urgent, but which just could not be given effect to without a great number of consequential changes in various parts of the Companies Acts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The principal provisions of the Bill is that which deals with redeemable preference shares.  That is a change which I was anxious to effect quickly, since these redeemable preference shares represent a particularly suitable device in our circumstances, for providing capital for companies desiring to expand and for facilitating the operations of the Industrial Credit Company. The Industrial Credit Company at the present time can make new capital available for companies which want to expand only by taking up ordinary shares&mdash;which gives them obligations of ownership and is not always desired by the companies concerned&mdash;or by giving money on loan, which involves a <Col N="34" /> charge on the company's assets.  A redeemable preference share is somewhat similar in character to a debenture, but it is not a debenture in the sense that it does not carry a charge on the company's assets, which can still be used if temporary financing is needed.</P>
    <P>From a practical point of view, the investor has the protection that he is guaranteed against capital depreciation. In recent years, because of the fall in the value of money, preference shares have become a drug on the market and have been saleable only at a capital loss and there has been no successful attempt to issue preference shares for many years.  I think interest in preference shares will revive with the introduction of this redeemable provision. Certainly, the Industrial Credit Company will use the device of redeemable preference shares quite extensively. We are most anxious that the change should be made quickly.</P>
    <P>There is one point I should like to make in that regard, arising out of Senator Murphy's remarks.  The intention is that a company will redeem these shares out of profits that would otherwise be available for the payment of a dividend.  That, in effect, means that the members of the company will agree to forgo a dividend they might otherwise receive in order to enable these shares to be redeemed, and in consideration of having sacrificed their right to a dividend, they may get in return ordinary shares in the company equivalent to the amount of dividend they have surrendered.</P>
    <P>I do not think that the Senator is quite right in saying that the Bill might provide that those bonus shares, issued to the members in consideration of the fact that they have surrendered their dividend to enable preference shares to be redeemed, may be given as a gift to employees.  There is nothing in the law to prevent the board of the company giving a gift of shares to employees. We are providing here a right to the company to issue those shares when the preference shares have been redeemed, in consideration of the fact that the members of the company have paid for them by forgoing their dividends.</P>

      <P>It is, of course, true that there are possibilities of improving the provisions of the existing law in relation to the publication of information concerning the financial affairs of public companies. The committee made a number of recommendations in that regard.  They are fairly comprehensive and quite intricate.  I should not like to undertake the drafting of the provisions of the new law, without a great deal of thought, and without affording organisations of accountants and so forth ample opportunity of expressing their views.</P>

      <P>Not sufficiently.  I hope that I shall get far more comprehensive comments on this from the accountants and others than I have received so far.  I have received a lot of very useful observations already from them and from other organisations, but the full effect of all the changes will have to be very carefully considered.  The existing Companies Acts have remained unchanged for 50 years.  I hope that the new Bill will be so comprehensive and satisfactory in its terms that it also can remain unchanged for another 50 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The difference between private and public companies is that private companies, in consideration of the fact that they are not obliged to publish the same details of their affairs as public companies, are permitted to restrict the transfer of their shares.  That, in turn, means that they are not readily negotiable securities.  Public companies wishing to raise money by inviting subscriptions from the public have to give all the details of their affairs which the Companies Acts prescribe, and of course are in the position that their shares can be transferred <Col N="36" /> without any power in the company to control the transfer.</P>

      <P>If the company is only a small concern and there is no public quotation for its shares there is not likely to be any ready demand for its shares as a negotiable security. The shares in a private company cannot be transferred without the consent of the board, and that makes them unacceptable as security for lodging with the bank in consideration of a loan or overdraft.  The fact is that the great majority of business concerns in this country, including some quite large ones, are private companies. Their membership is limited and their shares are not transferable, except with the consent of their boards.  While they suffer from some disadvantages because of this, they also enjoy advantages which the Companies Acts set out to give to all companies.</P>
      <P>The great advantage the Companies Acts give is of course limited liability. A partnership, or a group of people coming together to form a partnership and to share the profits on going into business is, each of them, liable to creditors to the extent of the whole of their resources whatever they may be, and until limited liability was introduced, the members of a company were liable to the last penny that they owned for the debts of the company. The principle of limited liability means that they are not liable for anything beyond their own shareholding in the undertaking, and that is a very great advantage which the Act confers upon a company in consideration of the company conforming to all the other requirements, and, particularly, publishing the details of its business as required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="37" /> I would accept that the principle of publication of information has to some extent been evaded or defeated in the course of time and that a strengthening of the law in that regard is necessary, because everybody going to do business with a company should be entitled to know, from its published accounts, exactly what is the state of its affairs and how good security they are for credit.  I have said that I hope to have the main Bill coming along in the course of some months.  The Government have in fact agreed to a procedure which will somewhat shorten the formalities involved in the preparation of a Bill of that kind.  It was not entirely for the purpose of shortening the time that the Government so agreed, but because of recognition of the fact that nine-tenths of the task of preparing a new Companies Bill is not in deciding what is to go into it but the need to assure that decisions will be expressed in language which in fact carry out the intention, and be so interpreted in the courts in the years ahead.  I should certainly hope that we would have the preparation of the Bill completed towards the end of the year, and while there will be no attempt to hurry it through the Oireachtas, it should be law some time next year.  Immediately on the conclusion of that enactment, the aim will be to start the process of codification and ultimately reach the situation where one statute will embody all the law relating to companies.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Quigley made a point about the rights of minorities under one section, but in fact that section is to establish the rights of majorities.  I do not agree with him in the matter of the phraseology in Sections 4 and 5.  I think that the right word there is &ldquo;cannot&rdquo;.  What Section 4 sets out to do is to provide that a body corporate cannot be a member of a company which is its holding company, and any allotment or transfer of shares to its subsidiary it would attempt to make is null and void.  The right word is not &ldquo;must not&rdquo; or &ldquo;should not&rdquo; or &ldquo;may not&rdquo;; it is just that it cannot do that. Any arrangement which appears to be intended to bring about that result is null and void.  Therefore, I think <Col N="38" />&ldquo;cannot&rdquo; is right in both sections.  It just cannot happen, and anybody who tries to make it happen is attempting to do something which is null and void.</P>

      <P>The Minister has given an explanation of the use of the word &ldquo;cannot&rdquo;.  I am not at all convinced that the position is as the Minister outlines it.  It is intended that a body corporate cannot be a member of a company which is its holding company and that any allotment or transfer of shares in a company to its subsidiary shall be null and void.  If you say &ldquo;shall not be a member of a company which is its holding company&rdquo;, it can never be a member.  That is the way Acts are rendered null and void commonly in legislation and I am inclined to think that the use of the word &ldquo;cannot&rdquo; is wrong.

    <P>In so doing, the first thing we must consider is the context.  What was the context of the situation?  In relation to wheat growing over the past few years, the context is briefly that in December, 1953, the then Fianna Fáil Government discovered there was a danger of a wheat surplus and they instructed their civil servants to produce for them a figure which would give the average consumption of Irish wheat per year. <Col N="41" /> The figure given was 300,000 tons. That information was conveyed in the Dáil and there is no point in giving the actual date, line and column.</P>
    <P>However, the harvest of 1954 was a very bad one.  The Government had changed and was then an inter-Party Government who were elected in May, 1954, and from that day, the Opposition, the Fianna Fáil Party, were extremely unsympathetic with regard to the wheat difficulties facing the then Government.  They were extremely unsympathetic with regard to the bad harvest of 1954 and with regard to the danger of a surplus.  In 1955, there was a reduction in price and they were similarly unsympathetic and indeed, in 1955, 1956 and 1957, they were almost vindictively attached to the practice of attacking the Government on the basis of the reduction in the price of wheat which the Government unfortunately had to impose because of a threatened surplus.</P>
    <P>So we come to the year 1956.  A publication is issued monthly or quarterly from the Fianna Fáil head office named <i>Gléas.</i>  In its January, 1956, issue, it published some observations. The first observation is:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;A few days ago the Taoiseach received a deputation from the National Farmers' Association, which put the case for restoring the price of wheat to the 1954 level. From every point of view it is to be hoped that the Government will over-rule Mr. Dillon and accept the unanswerable case which has been made for a restoration of the Fianna Fáil price.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil price referred to was 82/6d. per barrel with a moisture content of 22 per cent. and a bushel weight of 63.  In the same issue, we read:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is now recognised by all that the slashing of the wheat price was a grave error of judgment by the Government.  The results of this error will become still more serious, should there be a further fall this year in the acreage under wheat. Only an immediate Government decision to restore the 1954 price can save Irish wheat-growing from disaster.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="42" /> Things began to take on a different flavour when a Fianna Fáil Government were elected and according as time wore on.  In order to convey to members of the Seanad the sort of feeling there was in the country at the time, I shall quote from the leading article in the <i>Irish Farmers' Journal</i>&mdash; naturally, a non-political organ&mdash;of Saturday, 14th December, 1957:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;A statement on wheat prices for 1958 is now long overdue.  There have been some vague rumours that the Fianna Fáil Government is not as strongly behind the wheat-growing policy as it was in the past.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We trust that there is no truth in this because our national economy demands the maximum production of wheat in Ireland.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Further down, we read:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Any attempt to upset the present level of wheat prices can only lead to reduction in agricultural production. Due to heavy sales this year we will have less cattle to graze on the pastures.  Sheep numbers are not sufficiently rapidly increasing to absorb increased grassland output.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was after the election of 1957. Before the election of 1957, the time referred to in the motion, there were other pronouncements.  One of the most pungent of these was by the Minister for Finance, which was made on the radio on 25th February, 1957, and reported in the <i>Irish Times</i> the following day.  In his statement, the Minister described the 1954 cut in wheat as &ldquo;cruel&rdquo; and &ldquo;unjust.&rdquo;  He stated that under a Fianna Fáil Government, a remunerative price would be fixed, for crops such as wheat.</P>
    <P>When a person says that a price is &ldquo;cruel and unjust&rdquo; and that, under a Fianna Fáil Government a remunerative price would be fixed, one can only take such a statement as meaning that the speaker foreshadows a very large increase in price.  Young men on farms in this country are very short of capital.  They have not the money to buy cattle or to increase their other livestock, but they can get the money to buy a combine harvester. They can get the money to buy a new tractor simply by buying it on the hire purchase system.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="43" /> These young men&mdash;young men, largely&mdash;bought farm machinery on the basis of the few pronouncements I have just read out for the House and many hundreds more, beginning with the Fianna Fáil county councillor in the very backward districts, right up to the Minister for Finance.  In that situation, and to put this matter in its proper context, we must realise and accept that the Government had a very serious responsibility to the farmers who entered into the purchase of combine harvesters, ploughs and tractors on the hire purchase system and turned over to wheat-growing. These men believed they would get increases in prices and better terms than they had been getting.  They believed that the terms they were getting were bad.  They were led to believe that by the Fianna Fáil Party and therefore the Fianna Fáil Minister for Agriculture had this serious obligation cast upon him.</P>
    <P>Then we arrive at the harvest of 1958, a most disastrous and regrettable harvest comparable only with the harvest of 1954, but it was admittedly much worse because in 1954 alleviations were given by the then Minister for Agriculture.  He removed the deductions for moisture content up to a very high level, costing the Exchequer well over £150,000 but these were alleviations that he gave.  At the same time, he said, in effect, to the millers at that time: &ldquo;You will mill a minimum amount of 50 per cent. Irish wheat&rdquo;.  A miller said to me he did not believe we would ever get it and he was right because eventually the Minister made it 66-2/3 per cent.</P>
    <P>The best way to deal with the 1958 harvest is to deal with the newspaper observations.  Here is a heading carried by the <i>Irish Independent</i> at that time: &ldquo;Hope of Saving Crops Fails.  Heavy Rain Causes More Flooding&rdquo;.  I come from County Louth, a county in which a large volume of winter wheat became unfit for anything except to feed to animals.  Flour millers are not philanthropists and are not a nationalised body.  They are in this thing not for the colour of anybody's bright blue <Col N="44" /> eyes but for profit&mdash;and so is everybody else in business.  The finger of scorn cannot be pointed at them for that.</P>
    <P>The flour millers, with no arrangement made and no Minister for Agriculture at that time, would not&mdash; because they were a private or a public concern, answerable to their shareholders or proprietors&mdash;buy wheat which was unfit for milling into flour. Then the farmers had the wheat on their hands and had to dispose of it for whatever they could get for it or try to save it themselves and have it dried to feed to animals, or just let it not there with a moisture content of 25 or 26 per cent. and be suitable for nothing.  That situation obtained on 4th September for at least a week.  On September 5th, there was another headline in the <i>Irish Independent:</i></P>
    <P>&ldquo;Wheat Shrivelling in Many Areas. New Threat to Harvest Prospects.&rdquo; The report then stated:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Wheat is shrivelling in many parts of Ireland, to add to farmers' worries and bringing new grave threat to the harvest.  The National Farmers' Association Grain Committee's request to the Minister for Agriculture to meet them for emergency discussions on the situation points to the alarm felt by grain growers.  It is believed&rdquo;</P>
    <P>&mdash;this is a fact, as can be verified in the leading paper of the day&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;that the growers' leaders may meet the Minister next week.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>At that time, I was trying to make contact with the Minister for Agriculture. He was not available to meet anybody.  There continued to be this vast quantity of winter wheat&mdash;</P>

      <P>Thanks very much for the explanation.  Apparently the Minister was not available, either, to the National Farmers' Association, as is shown by the newspaper report of that day.</P>
      <P>On September 9th, winter wheat, particularly, had been harvested and was deteriorating.  It was being sold for conversion into animal feed at as low as 43/- a barrel, from August 27th onward and on each successive day. On September 9th, the Minister met a deputation from the National Farmers' Association and on September 10th, lest the Minister should think that I am now being wise after the event, I felt I had to draw public attention to the situation and I did so by writing a letter which was published in the <i>Irish Independent</i> of that date.  It stated:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Over the last 14 days approximately 70 per cent. of the winter wheat in Louth has been harvested, and of this at least 90 per cent. has been rejected as unmillable.  Certain millers will buy no winter wheat, and others are accepting some. Therefore there is no standard for unmillable wheat.</P>
      <P>A few farmers can find a market for unmillable wheat, but most cannot.</P>
      <P>The Minister was not available all last week.  He met the N.F.A. yesterday, and I understand he is meeting the millers to-day.  No matter what decisions are arrived at with either body, all the winter wheat shall, before these decisions could be implemented, have been sold as unmillable, or, in present weather conditions, become unmillable, on the farmers' lands.  The loss can conservatively be estimated at a minimum figure of £30,000 to £40,000 in the smallest county in the Republic.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That proves conclusively that I am <Col N="46" /> not being wise after the event and it is completely in line with what I have said to-day.</P>
    <P>The days wore on and on September 12th, the announcement was made that the millers would accept all sound wheat, and I quote from the <i>Irish Independent</i> of that date:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;To provide a market for wheat affected by the weather, flour millers, in agreement with An Bord Gráin, will take up all sound wheat offered, says a Government Information Bureau statement issued on behalf of the Department of Agriculture.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It was inevitable, due to the major crisis that had developed, that something had to be done.  It was inevitable that the millers had to accept this wheat, but, from August 27th until September 12th, many of them had not been accepting it.  I do not blame them because no arrangements had been made with them.  As I have said before, they are not philanthropists. They are ordinary businessmen and by that time much of this wheat had been sold at from 40/- per barrel upwards and was already walking around in the &ldquo;tummies&rdquo; of pigs in Monaghan and Cavan and other counties where pigs are fed in great numbers.</P>
    <P>It was obvious that on September 12th the Minister had made a very bad arrangement in as much as no price floor, no price level for given qualities, had been fixed, and between 12th September and 18th of September, savage screening deductions were made by the millers.  The Minister had to make a further announcement on 18th September that the minimum price payable for wheat of 26 per cent. moisture or under would be 63/6d. per barrel, less 5/9d.  On this question of screening deductions, I want to say that there was no question whatever of screening deductions up to 12th September, except in the case of wheat contaminated with chaff, wheat seeds, dirt and other extraneous matter.  It was perfectly correct that there should be deductions in respect of such wheat which farmers might try to get paid for at the higher price.</P>
    <P>It was again obvious on 12th September that the millers had no financial <Col N="47" /> arrangements on which to work. They did not know how much of this wheat they were to be asked to handle, and they decided the best thing they could do was to lower the price to the absolute minimum they felt possible. They did so and reduced the price in cases to 47/-, 48/- and 49/- per barrel. Finally, on 18th September, a new arrangement was made whereby a minimum price was enforced and the headline in the <i>Irish Independent</i> for that day was: &ldquo;New Price Fixed for Sound Wheat&rdquo;.  The report stated:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;A new price of 63/6d. per barrel is to be paid for &lsquo;sound&rsquo; wheat containing not more than 26 per cent. moisture, it was announced last night.  While it represents a drop of 10/- per barrel, the arrangement will, it is said, relieve growers of some of the financial loss they are likely to incur and the guarantee by the Government of a market for all such wheat, the bulk of which will only be suitable for animal feeding, will go a long way towards cushioning the losses.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>As I have said, the Minister made a very bad arrangement on 12th September and had to return, with his tail between his legs, on September 18th.</P>
    <P>Lest the Minister should seek to say that the absolute minimum was always paid for Grade 2 wheat, I should like to quote from the Irish Flour Miller's <i>News Letter</i> for February/March, 1959, page 2, which states under a heading &ldquo;Minimum Always Paid&rdquo;:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Deductions for screenings were then applied, but only to the Grade 2 wheat, and only so far as they brought the price down to the agreed minimum.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The agreed minimum then was 57/9d. which was exactly 24/3d. less than was expected by the unfortunate young men who had bought combine harvestors and tractors.  They had expected that the price of wheat would return to the Fianna Fáil price of 83/6d. for 63lbs. bushel wheat, but instead of that they got only 57/9d. Admittedly, they have since got two or three shillings more as an <i>ex gratia</i> payment.  I do not see how the Minister <Col N="48" /> can call it such since he took 5/9d. away from them in the first instance but, to use the legal jargon, it was an <i>ex gratia</i> payment.</P>
    <P>I charge the Minister with not making a concrete arrangement with the millers.  He did not leave them in a position in which they could go ahead and buy wheat at a fixed price and at a figure that would be equitable.  He threw his responsibilities over on the farmers and in a national crisis, he fed them with their own tail.  To put it exactly, I shall refer to the <i>Irish Independent</i> of Monday, September 15th, and the Press reports of statements by Mr. P.D. Odlum, of the Executive Committee of the Irish Flour Millers' Association, who said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The millers had been accused of delay in the emergency.  The millers knew that the winter wheat was poor and the spring wheat had not yet come in.  Now they had an opportunity of examining the spring wheat they found it just as bad.  The millers had then taken immediate action.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We know of cases of young men with very little capital who sold their 20 or 30 barrels of wheat to various people because they had no drying accommodation and, perhaps, needed to sell this wheat to pay for farmers' produce.  These men sold this wheat to compound millers.  There is no hope of their being repaid as it went to compound millers.  These compound millers mill it into pig food.  Few men could be expected to pay the price of £30 odd per ton when they had expected to issue it at £23 to £24.  There is no hope of repayment for the unfortunate grower because of the Minister's delay and because of his negligence&mdash;I would say, his gross negligence&mdash;these unfortunate men are left in that position.</P>
    <P>I am well aware that where this wheat, prior to 12th September, was sold to millers who besides being compounders were also flour millers they will in fact, by a paper transaction, buy the wheat again for themselves and put it into the Grain Board pool and repay the farmers.  The only loss will be to the pool.  The unfortunate <Col N="49" /> farmer who sold the wheat to a compounder, or to a neighbour who wanted it for pig feeding, or who kept it for feeding cattle will get no compensation. There is no compensation and the Minister has been grossly negligent.  There is no use abusing the millers; they did only what any business man would have done in the same situation.</P>
    <P>The Minister dealt with this Grain Board pool in a way, which, in my opinion, is grossly unfair.  He discovered that the screening deductions have reduced, on paper at least&mdash;as we know in most cases&mdash;the cost of dried Irish wheat to a level which was lower than the cost of the imported substitute and lower than the estimated figures which it would cost the miller to put it into the grist.  The estimated figure was 86/- a barrel.  He has now concluded an arrangement with the millers whereby the price should be taken as 81/- a barrel and they will pay a levy of £2 on every barrel they take in substitution for the Irish wheat.</P>
    <P>The Minister has also placed two prices on the Irish wheat.  If you want to import bran, pollard, barley, millet or maize for feeding, you must buy two tons of Irish wheat at £24 a ton before you will be given a licence to import one ton of any commodity I have mentioned.  That constitutes a levy of £4 per ton on the imported commodity.  It has been represented that in order to get the wheat used, it was necessary to do this.  In my view, that is very silly.  Could the Minister not have said that in respect of every two tons of Irish wheat anybody bought, he would give a licence for one ton of the imported grain, but that he would make no price differential? He could have said that he would not charge the man who wanted to buy feed for his pigs an extra £4 a ton, purely in order that the Government would not have a loss as high as it was.</P>
    <P>The deliberate and studied silence of the Minister from December to the present month spoke volumes.  He should have told the farmers whether the millers wanted wheat in the year to come; whether or not screening deductions would be operated again in <Col N="50" /> a normal year.  He should have said how much wheat was wanted and what sort of wheat was wanted.  At least previous Ministers for Agriculture told us what was expected of us.  The Minister did not want more than 300,000 tons of wheat because every ton over that amount loses votes for him and therefore he kept quiet in the hope that the farmers, who had been lacerated by the harvest, would now grow less wheat and relieve him of any embarrassment.  I think he has succeeded in that.</P>
    <P>The price for oats and barley will not be very attractive next harvest. The Minister has not lived up to his responsibilities and he has not come to the help of the farmers and has not told them what is expected of them. I think that is the first duty of a Minister for Agriculture, particularly in a sphere of agriculture where disaster has struck.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I should like to say that the whole situation points to great negligence.  Disregard perhaps would be a milder word, but it could be a harder one.  The complete disregard of the Minister for the dilemma of the wheat farmers last harvest and the complete disregard of the Minister for them when they were wondering what to do during the last two months has been almost criminal.  These unfortunate men were led by the Party, of which the Minister is a member, to gear their agricultural production to wheat.  The Government have the responsibility of telling them to grow more wheat every week of the year for the last ten years.  The Government do not accept that responsibility.  The Government leave them with their combine harvesters, with their ploughs, with their tractors and with their implements and do not tell them what they may expect next harvest.  This disregard will reap its reward and it will not be very pleasant for the Minister.</P>
    <P>The levy on the imported wheat which was put into the Grain Board pool and not given to relieve the farmers was unjust.  The levy put on imported offal&mdash;simply by putting £2 a ton more on all the Irish wheat that you would require for feeding before <Col N="51" /> you received a licence for one ton of the imported grain&mdash;is also, in my view, most unjust and unfair and should be abolished.</P>
    <P>I put it to the Minister that he should consider what are the necessities for wheat growing in the future. In my view, they are, in the first instance, a realisation that the millers are businessmen and that they are not going to buy wheat just because it suits somebody.  They are going to buy wheat for milling at a price which they regard will pay them and nobody can make them do anything else.  If you do make them you will find that they are unable to pay after some years and therefore such a desire will defeat its object in the long run.  If this realisation is accepted by all, and by the Minister, you may be able to make a better bargain with them.  You may be able to see to it that there is certainty and hope of profit, both for the farmer and the miller.  In the last harvest, the Minister has seen to it that no one has anything to hope for in the years to come.</P>
    <P>The second prerequisite is some price relation between wheat and wages and the cost of living.  I believe quite sincerely that when the subsidies were removed and when the 10/- increase was invented, there was a price relationship between that price for the barrel of wheat, on the one hand, and the wages being paid and the cost of living in the country, on the other. That should be preserved.  The Minister sought to preserve it in no way in the last harvest.  In future, we should try to preserve it.  We should give increases in the price of wheat based on increases in the cost of living and on the level of wages.</P>
    <P>There should be constant investigation and statement upon the findings. Constant investigation there is; statement by the Minister there has not been at any time.  I feel there should be constant investigation and that the Minister should use his office to see that the results of these investigations are got across to the wheat farmer, the miller and everyone involved.  For instance, winter wheat is a type of wheat which, in my opinion, is useful <Col N="52" /> for inclusion in wheatmeal milling and to some extent for inclusion in flour milling; yet most farmers are very chary about the prospects of selling winter wheat at the ordinary milling wheat prices next harvest.  The Minister has not said a word since last September about that, which might have led them to sow or not to sow, to hope or to be in despair.</P>
    <P>The last remedy of all is to cease the political pricing of wheat, to cease this business of putting 5/- on a barrel of wheat before an election and then leaving the wheat at the same price as before or reducing it, afterwards. There should be an end to what the Minister for Finance did&mdash;making a speech which clearly implied he would increase the price of wheat after the election.  These are important questions and I should like to know what the Minister has to say about them.</P>
    <P>I believe this motion of censure was necessary, to place on the records of this House exactly what was done from 27th August or 1st September of last year until the present time.  It is absolutely necessary that those facts should be recorded, as the Minister should not be allowed to get away with it.  He may have all the excuses in the world.  If he has, I am ready and willing to listen to them and I am sure the House is also.  I have tried not to abuse my position; I have tried not to be condemnatory; but I feel very strongly in the matter.  I hope I have not hurt the Minister's feelings; if I have, he will know it is not intended.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise merely to say that I have listened with some attention to the various statements made by Senator Donegan.  Although he has said a lot, in my opinion, what he said did not contain much common sense. The main point he omitted from all his discussion was that the year just passed, 1958, was one of the most disastrous years in the memory of any man living to-day, so far as the harvest is concerned. In spite of that, the Senator accused the Minister for Agriculture, using strong language, of gross neglect <Col N="53" /> by depriving the farmers, according to him, of something they were entitled to and of not doing something, through neglect, that he should have done to alter the situation in their favour.  I do not agree with one single word he said.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Agriculture, in my opinion, handled the situation as resourcefully as any man in that position could in very difficult circumstances. He did so in consultation, during the whole period, with the National Farmers' Association and what he did had their approval.  They claim to represent the views of the farmers as much as I do or Senator Donegan does. A greater price for wheat was agreed between the Minister and the N.F.A., but the weather cut across that arrangement and it could not be made effective later on.  It is most unfair for any Senator to accuse the Minister here of having neglected his duty.  I fail to see why it should be insinuated that he did anything which was not helpful to the farmers in that disastrous year.  He deserves credit for what he did, for having taken all the wheat produced.  Even though 80 per cent. or more was unmillable, none of it was left on the producer's hands.  Although the price was not as good and the wheat did not realise as much as people expected, it was all taken and a fair price&mdash;the value of it, to put it that way&mdash;was given.  That was done through the Minister's efforts, in a most disastrous year; and for that action the farmers owe a lot to our Minister for Agriculture.</P>
      <P>Apart from the little political change which was added on to the discussion, there was nothing else in the statements made here this evening by Senator Donegan.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J.L. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>In seconding this motion, I mean to confine myself entirely to the effects on the farming community in the present year.  I do not mean to go back to the last disastrous harvest.  Every farmer will have it implanted in his memory for a long time to come.  I hope that no Minister and no Government will have to face a similar situation for a considerable time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="54" /> When we put down this motion, our principal purpose was to deal with the future.  We hoped it would be discussed in time for the present sowing season, but, unfortunately, that did not happen.  We have been waiting for some pronouncement from the Department as to the policy of the Government on the growing of wheat in this season, but we have not heard of any policy.  As far as I can see, there is nothing but a lack of policy, complete silence on the part of the Government and the Department on the growing of wheat.</P>
    <P>What a change that is from past years, when we saw all the countryside decorated with advertisements, placards and brightly coloured signs: &ldquo;Grow More Wheat&rdquo;.  Not alone were these lacking, but there was nothing from the Government or the Department. The farming community had built themselves up to the agricultural policy preached by previous Governments. At considerable expense to themselves, they had purchased tractors, ploughs, harrows, combine drillers, combine harvesters and so on. As a matter of fact, the people I am looking at across the House were producers themselves and, for once, they will have to take the consequences just like ourselves.  Co-operative societies put up grain drying plants in every corner of the country.</P>
    <P>What has happened this year?  The people waited for a lead which they did not get.  The acreage of wheat is considerably reduced, to such an extent that we will have to import a considerable quantity of wheat even to add to the supply that has been bought for the grist.  I hope we will have a good harvest this year.  Even if we have, we will find that because of the acreage sown under wheat, we shall be far short of the target of 300,000 tons.  The people who put their money into those agricultural appliances I have mentioned will have to turn to some other means of paying for them, for unfortunately many of them are not paid for.  The farming community has been led up the garden path. &ldquo;Grow more wheat&rdquo;, &ldquo;Grow more beet&rdquo; were the catchcries of the past. &ldquo;Grow more wheat&rdquo; is a thing of <Col N="55" /> the past, which we have not heard this year, and &ldquo;Grow more beet,&rdquo; I am sorry to say, is facing a similar position.</P>
    <P>When the ordinary farmer is making up his mind what to do for the year, he parcels out his land and says: &ldquo;I will grow so much wheat, so much barley, so much oats and potatoes, and keep so many livestock.&rdquo;  In justice, he is entitled to know whether he can market the crops and animals he produces, and to get a lead from the Department or the Government.  I can tell the Minister and the Government that next year the acreage of tillage will be considerably reduced. The amount of grass seed sown this year in with the corn crops is very considerable, as the Minister can find out from the seed merchants.  It is very plain that the people are disgusted by this lack of policy and of foresight.</P>
    <P>At present we have a price of £22 a ton for unmillable wheat, while we exported early in the past year to our neighbours in Britain and the Six Counties first class millable wheat for £18 and £19 a ton.  Now we are importing that same wheat and charging our own farmers £22 and £24 a ton for unmillable wheat.  That cannot be denied.  I have the figures here of the amounts exported to the Six Counties and to Britain in September, October, November and December, 1958 and as late as January, 1959.  We have given a present of so many thousand tons to the farmers in Britain and the Six Counties and charged our own farmers £22 a ton wheat of worse quality.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, our motion cannot do any good this year, but we want to get from the Minister and the Government some idea of their future policy.  Are they behind the growing of wheat or are they not?  Do they mean to stand by the promise they made to the farmers as regards the growing of wheat?  Every member of the farming community at every meeting throughout the country in the past two or three years listened to propaganda from the Party opposite saying: &ldquo;If we go back to power, we will raise the price of wheat.&rdquo;  No honest man <Col N="56" /> can deny that that was said up and down the country.  I wonder what will happen in the rural constituencies during the next election.  I wonder what answer they will have to make to the people who paid their money for combine harvesters, tractors, machinery and implements.  Those unfortunate people still have them only partly paid for.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister and the Government even at this late stage to tell the agricultural community where exactly they stand.  As I said at the beginning, I am sorry that it is too late to do anything about this year's sowing season, but we are looking to the future and we do not want anything like this to happen again.  We want to get some lead and the farmers want to be told where they stand.  I hope that by putting down this motion, we shall get an answer from the Minister and the Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1943" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I have had 25 years' experience in flour milling.  I know that the farmers have been badly let down because they were told that they would get their price back.  That was the line taken in the canvassing and speeches made in my constituency, which is a good wheat growing area. My grievance, however, is this, that although the price of wheat has been reduced, the consumer to-day is paying 1/2½d. for his loaf, where under the inter-Party Government, he was paying 9d.  Naturally, when the price went down to the farmer, the Minister for Industry and Commerce should have stepped in and said: &ldquo;You will have to reduce the loaf&rdquo;.  The loaf is still the same price and the people are wondering why the Government took no action.  I know that the Government have very little say in regard to wheat buying or anything else. It is controlled by the monopoly, by Ranks.  They are the people who dictate policy to the Irish Government. They say: &ldquo;We do not want your wheat.  It has a bad moisture content&rdquo;, and still the flour cannot be milled without dampness.  That is the strange thing about it.  After the making of the silos and the drying, the water is running out of the wheat in every flour mill in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no doubt that Fianna Fáil <Col N="57" /> won the election on the farmers' votes, on the pretence that the farmers would get back the 12/6 taken from them, but the Government failed them.  They did not stick to their promises to the farmers, or to their promises to the consumers to reduce the cost of living. Bread, one of the necessaries of life, and butter are dearer here than they are in Birmingham, Newry or Belfast. I bought these commodities myself and I saw them in shop windows in those cities.  Irish butter can be bought in Birmingham at 1/10 per lb.  That is wrong.</P>
    <P>If the reduction were passed on to the consumers, I do not believe this motion would have been put down. The movers were right to put it down to fight their case, but people are suffering as a result of the high price of bread.  The Minister and his colleague, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, should consider that.  We all know an increase in the price of wheat and bread will be passed on to the consumer and they should step in and keep the price down.  We know that at the moment wheat is being ground down into compound food for pigs and we know wheat is exported across the Border and to England.</P>
    <P>The Wexford Committee of Agriculture sent representatives to see the Minister with regard to the export of wheat and the importation of foreign wheat.  There is no need to import foreign wheat but we are told that the bakers' flour must have a mixture and so Manitoba wheat is imported.  That is a mistake.  Just because we had one harvest which gave an abundance of wheat, people got excited and said there were no stores, no room for it in the country, and they exported it at half price.</P>
    <P>That policy was all wrong.  In 1958 and 1957, bread was 9d. and it is now 1/2½d.  Is that not a shame?  No action has been taken in the Budget to do anything about it and after a bad harvest, the price of bread to the farmers is still the same and they have a grievance.  Why did the Minister not say: &ldquo;The price of wheat has gone down to the producer; we will reduce it to the consumer&rdquo;?  If they had done <Col N="58" /> so, I would say nothing, but they have not and the consuming public are paying the piper.</P>

We are all prepared to concede that the 1958 harvest was one of the worst in history.  Any fairminded person will concede that the measures taken to deal with it were largely emergency measures because it was sprung upon us.  The Minister did not create the conditions under which we laboured. He is not a prophet, nor, so far as I know, has he hand, act or part in <Col N="60" /> providing us with our climatic conditions. He is only a mere man like the rest of us.  He carries the portfolio of Minister for Agriculture and in so far as he was able, in my submission, he did his best under most trying circumstances to meet the position.</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:&mdash;</P>
    <P>That, in view of the wheat policy announced by the members of the present Government prior to the last General Election, Seanad Éireann deplores the manner in which wheat growers were treated by the Minister for Agriculture during and after the harvest of 1958.&mdash;(Senators Donegan, L'Estrange and J.L. O'Sullivan.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCarter" hpid="Mr. Carter Mr. Carter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carter</NameTxt>
      <P>I was trying to relate my remarks to this motion regarding wheat growers.  In the course of the argument, amongst other things, the Minister was accused of refusing to meet certain representatives.  We all know that that is not so.  We further know that the Minister was available in his office on most days during that period.  I wish to quote briefly from an article in the Irish Flour Millers' Association's <i>Newsletter</i> of February-March, 1959:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;So-called &lsquo;excessive&rsquo; and &lsquo;penal&rsquo; were among the adjectives applied to deductions for screenings by people who argued last autumn that wheat prices should provide the whole cost of compensation of Irish farmers for their losses in a harvest ruined by bad weather.  As is usual, those who knew least made the loudest noises.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That is a very apt quotation.  I am prepared to bet that those who know least will make the loudest noises here in this debate this evening.  The article continues:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;But as flour milling is, in fact, a highly complicated business, there were many who quite reasonably felt it hard that there should be deductions for wheat defects of <Col N="62" /> which little had been heard heretofore.</P>
    <P>Our hope is that this article on an admittedly difficult subject will be useful now and also for reference in normal years, to reasonable people.</P>
    <P>The essence of the 1958 scheme devised to rescue wheat growers from the worst effects of a natural disaster was that wheat suitable only for animal feeding should be purchased, in the same way as if flour could be made from it.  Only thus could millers, under the Cereals Act as it stands, pay a price which would offer compensation to growers whose wheat was unmillable.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There is a further paragraph under the heading <i>The Legal Device</i>, which reads as follows:</P>
    <P>Regulations made by the Minister for Agriculture and stated to apply expressly to the 1958 harvest only, provided that wheat could be treated for pricing purposes as millable if it were (a) commercially clean and (b) in sound and sweet condition. The usual requirement that the wheat should be capable of being milled into flour suitable for human consumption was omitted in its entirely.</P>
    <P>This legal device, produced at necessarily short notice, enabled the existing legislation to be operated for the benefit of badly-hit farmers. But the Act still stood, as did its schedules on prices.  The millers therefore divided the wheat, as they took it in, into Grades 1 and 2, representing the actually millable, and the feed wheat which was to be treated theoretically as millable in order that a minimum price could be paid.</P>
    <P>That does not suggest to me that the Minister was lacking in his duty or that he reneged on his duties to the farmers during the 1958 harvesting crisis.  It is unlikely, under normal harvesting conditions, that such a condition will arise again, but, having regard to the conditions under which the Minister, the growers, the millers and the consumers were labouring at that time, I think the position was well and adequately handled.  No matter what <Col N="63" /> line of business we indulge in, we cannot insure against risk.  Business presupposes risk whether it be farming or business in other lines, and if we are to engage now in a campaign of deprecating the Minister's efforts in his dealings with the farmers&mdash;if you like to put it that way&mdash;then I think we will be doing a very bad job of work.</P>
    <P>During the course of the debate, reference was made to farmers purchasing machinery.  They have ample credit to do so and if they want to go in for tillage, that is a matter for themselves individually.  If they want to take the risk of harvesting, let it be good or bad, that is their sole responsibility.  The people who put down this motion and who criticise the Minister did not mention who would pay the difference.  They did not even mention a price or who would make up that price.  They had not the gumption to say the taxpayer should do it because that, of course, would be a very unpopular thing to do.  Since the Fianna Fáil Party were able to form a Government in 1932, wheat and beet got preference in our campaigns.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Carter</NameTxt>
      <P>I was trying to relate my remarks to charges made during the course of the debate, but since you rule that we must confine ourselves to the terms of the motion, I shall attempt to do so.  As I said already, the position that arose in 1958 may never arise again.  At least for our part on this side of the House, we hope it will not, and our argument is that the Minister did a very good job of work in dealing with the situation that faced him at that time.  I do not believe that anyone with an outlook of fairness or who is actuated by motives of fair play could condemn him for the action he took in regard to the 1958 wheat crop.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is admitted on both sides that we <Col N="64" /> are never likely to succeed in marketing our surplus wheat abroad.  We shall always have certain difficulties in dealing with that subject.  We are not able to compete against the great wheat exporting countries like Canada and other countries that are able to grow hard wheats and put them on the market at much lower prices than we could.  We have no elaborate machinery to help us do that.</P>
    <P>As I said before, account has to be taken of the consumer and we never resorted to any device where he was concerned.  We never tried to make a bun out of the loaf in order to cloak our difficulties.  We always told the people where we stood and where they stood in regard to the growing of wheat, and I believe that most fair-thinking people, even in the N.F.A., will agree that the methods adopted to deal with the situation as we found it were sound methods, to say the least of them.</P>
    <P>During the course of the year, there were many remarks made by the Westmeath Committee of Agriculture casting aspersions on the Minister for Agriculture.  I am from the Midlands and it is news to me that Westmeath Committee of Agriculture are so interested in the growing of wheat.  I remember a period during which they would not grow it and when the farmers around Mullingar would much prefer to grow hayseed.  Now that we want them to grow hayseed, in order to grow good grass, we hope they will sow good hayseed and thereby produce good grass.  I should like to hear fair criticism on this matter because it is one in which we are all interested&mdash; not merely the farmer but the miller and the consumer are also interested parties in the wheat cycle.</P>
    <P>So far as I know, the Fianna Fáil Party made no specific promises regarding the price of wheat during the election campaign.</P>

Senator Donegan quoted certain individuals, people who, to my mind, were not experts at all on the growing of wheat.  I know Senator Donegan comes from an intensive tillage county, one of the nine intensive tillage counties we have, and the people in Louth are very interested in the growing of wheat. I suppose he spoke as a miller and I suppose he can also speak as a grower, but, whether he speaks as a miller or as a grower, he should temper his remarks and inject some little justice into them, because the Minister, and the Government for that matter, laboured long and hard to get certain people in this country to accept the view that we could grow our own wheat.</P>
      <P>Very hard things were said during the course of our campaigns regarding the growing of wheat and, if I wanted to, I could produce quotations from certain well-known personalities in the Fine Gael Party which would go to show that they had an inherent dislike of the growing of wheat and, if they had their way at that time, we should never have reached the position which we have attained today in which we are able to grow, not alone our own requirements, but a surplus of wheat as well.  So far as I see, that is the position.</P>

      <P>Despite all the promises made by Fianna Fáil speakers before the 1957 general election, we know now that the tillage farmers were thrown to the wolves.  We know that the farmers suffered enormous losses. <Col N="66" /> It is reckoned that they suffered losses to the tune of at least £7 million.  That loss had to be borne by those farmers who were growing that wheat and it is bound to have an effect on our future agricultural production.</P>
      <P>We know that the tillage farmers are the backbone of this country.  Some of those people who went in for wheat growing, who believed what they were told, who believed the promises made, are still stunned and silent because some of them staked all and lost all. They are stunned and silent because they were promised so much and expected so much and got so little.  They were left to perish; they were left to paddle their own canoes, despite all the promises made prior to 1957 general election.</P>
      <P>We on this side of the House know that in 1954, there was a glut of wheat and that the then Minister took courageous action.  He told the people that there was a glut and that the price of wheat would have to be cut by 12/6d. a barrel.  Senator Carter stated that Fianna Fáil always told the people where they stood as regards wheat growing.  That statement is altogether wrong, as far as Fianna Fáil are concerned.  The Government of that day told the people where they stood and told them the price they would get, but Fianna Fáil did not do that.  They fooled the people and led them into believing that if Fianna Fáil were returned to power, they would get a price of 82/6d. a barrel for their wheat.</P>
      <P>We know that Fianna Fáil Deputies at that time tabled a motion deploring the action of the Government in reducing the price of wheat.  A similar motion was tabled here and the discussion lasted for two days.  We all remember the crocodile tears that were shed then by members of the Fianna Fáil Party for the wheat growers. Senator Carter a few moments ago said that as far as he knew, no specific promise was made by Fianna Fáil that the price of wheat would be increased. Then he qualified that by saying that at least no Minister made such a promise.</P>

Would anybody not infer from that, that if Fianna Fáil were returned to office, they would give an increase in the price of wheat?

      <P>It appeared in the Dáil Debates.  I refer to column 43, volume 161 of the Dáil Debates, for March 26th, 1957.  Deputy Corry put down a question asking the Minister for Agriculture</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;if, in view of the absolute necessity for increasing the wheat acreage this <Col N="68" /> year, and in view of the endorsement of the wheat policy by the people,&rdquo;</P>
    <P>&mdash;that, of course, was because of the inducement that they would get 82/6d. a barrel for wheat&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;he will state what steps he intends to take to secure by financial inducement an increased wheat acreage this season; and if, in view of the lateness of the season, he will make an immediate statement on the matter.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Acting-Minister for Agriculture, in reply, said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;No alteration of the price of wheat in these last days of March could appreciably affect the acreage of wheat this year.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There is an implied promise.  If the Minister wanted to tell the truth at that time, instead of trying to fool the farmers, he could have told them, as he knew well in April, 1957, that there was sufficient wheat sown.  There were statistics and statements in the papers at that time, and the Minister, with his knowledge, would have been aware of the position.  The statistics afterwards proved it.  No matter what may be said about the policy of the inter-Party Government, or what some Minister or others are supposed to have said about wheat in the past, in that year, 1957, over 502,200 tons of wheat were supplied to the mills of this country&mdash;an all-time record.  That was grown, despite the fact that wheat had been reduced by 12/6 a barrel the previous year.  That was produced with an inter-Party Government in office, not by filling ten fields with inspectors but because they had confidence in the Minister in office at that time, that they would get at least a fair crack of the whip from him and also that the millers would have to give them a fair deal and a fair price for their wheat.  He would not let the millers or anyone else ride roughshod over the farmers.  He did not let them do it in the bad harvest of that year. Why did the Party opposite not give the 12/6d. they promised, instead of reducing the price?</P>

      <P>One cannot convince some people.  I am not trying to convince them, but I am giving the facts.  Let me quote from Volume 170, Col. 2723 of the Dáil Debates.  At that time, the man who had been in the position of Minister for Agriculture was dead, Deputy Tom Walsh, the Lord have mercy on him.  Many people thought Deputy Corry might be the future Minister.  Speaking at that time, when he himself thought he might be the future Minister, this is what he said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I told the people that they would get 82/6d. a barrel for their wheat and they believed me.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>There was one man who was not afraid to come into Leinster House and admit that he, as well as all the other Deputies and Senators and canvassers of the Party, told the people they would get this price of 82/6d. We all know they told it to the people, but he came into Leinster House and admitted he told them that.  If further proof is needed, let Senators look at the <i>Nationalist and Leinster Times</i> of March 2nd, 1957.  There was a very prominent Fianna Fáil Senator here at that time, Senator Cogan.  Perhaps he had his designs also on the position of Minister for Agriculture.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree, but he made a promise in black and white that he would give 82/6d.  In any case, we know that the farmers lost a large amount.  Over £700,000 was taken from them then and now they are getting back in return only a mere pittance, something like £420,000. What the farmers asked for was a fair deal and a reasonable return for their labour.  They did not get a fair chance last year, but were badly let down by the Government.  The Government held them up to ransom.  They blundered very badly on the wheat problem.  Their handling of it this year shows how quickly, irrespective of political morals, they can change tune when in Government, as soon as the instrument of their accession to power has turned against them.  I have quoted the promises by members of the Government, by the Minister for Finance and Deputy Corry.  What a change has come over them since they came into office, after all their specific promises and after all the attacks they made on the inter-Party Government for reducing the price of wheat by 12/6d. a barrel in 1954.</P>
      <P>It would have been much better if Fianna Fáil had admitted the truth then, that there was a glut of wheat in 1954 and that no Government could deal with it more satisfactorily, as our agricultural policy had become lopsided, since we were importing oats and barley from Turkey, Iran, Iraq and elsewhere.  If Fianna Fáil had admitted that the Government of the day were right in the action they took, they would not have a glut of wheat on their hands such as they had last year. They encouraged the farmers to grow wheat and then threw them to the wolves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 12th September, 1958, the Minister discovered that a new sort of wheat was being grown in Ireland.  He labelled it &ldquo;millable but unsuitable&rdquo;. This was to be put aside as animal feeding, but it was to be included in the price structure which would determine what the flour millers paid for wheat.  The price to be paid for <Col N="71" /> this &ldquo;millable but unsuitable wheat&rdquo; was left to the flour millers within the ambit of the Wheat Order.  So drastically were the screening deductions implemented that the Minister had to crawl back on 18th September with his tail between his legs and make an arrangement that, in respect of wheat of 26 per cent. moisture and under, the screening deduction would not reduce the price to anything lower than a net 57/9d., with levy deducted. That price was exactly 24/9d. less than that expected by the wheat farmers from Fianna Fáil, as a result of the specific promises made before the election, that if Fianna Fáil were returned to power, they would increase the price of wheat to 82/6d.</P>
    <P>We know that the Minister made a statement on 14th November, 1958 and I quote it:&mdash;</P>
    <P>The Government have decided, that in view of the losses suffered by wheat growers this year, a substantial portion of the amount by which the cost of wheat for milling in 1958-59 falls below the cost for the past year, should be used for the benefit of the growers.</P>
    <P>When that announcement was made, the farmers thought they would get something reasonable in return.  We know that they did not get even what they were entitled to, that is, the £700,000 which was collected from them in levies.  The levy was to come into operation only if we had a surplus of wheat.  There was no surplus last year.  Despite that, the Minister gave back only a little more than half of the levy which had been collected from the unfortunate farmers themselves.  This was altogether wrong. The Government should come to the aid of the people who had lost £7 million and tried to help them even in some small way, because the Government can spend £5 million on jet planes, can give relief to professional boxing, to greyhound racing and to those paying income tax.  It is only right that they should have the same consideration for the unfortunate wheat gowers, people who have done a good job.  The wheat growers stood between the people of Ireland and <Col N="72" /> hunger and want during the war.  They answered the call when the call was made.  There is no denying that the farmers have been in the front line of trenches in every war, national, social and economic, in this country, and when they were hit so hard as they were last year with the bad harvest, they were entitled to better consideration from the Minister and the Government, especially in view of the specific promises made to them.  The promises Fianna Fáil made to these people lulled the farmers into growing more wheat than many of them intended to grow.  The present policy of the Government is a continuation of their previous policy, to make the farmers paupers, hewers of wood and drawers of water.</P>
    <P>We know that last year when the cost of living increased&mdash;it is at an all time record now of 146 points&mdash;every other section of the community got relief.  Every wage earner got an increase, the civil servants, the local officials, the Garda and the Army got their increase of 10/- a week and in the case of national teachers up to £1 a week.  Those people were entitled to that; but the farmers, who are expected to pay increased rates and, in the case of the wheat growers, lost all, instead of getting any increase, were not compensated and did not even get back from the Government what was deducted from them.  They were not even given back their own £700,000 taken off in the levy on wheat.  They are getting back only £420,000.</P>
    <P>Many of the tillage farmers go in for mixed farming, and besides the loss from their wheat are getting 6/- less for their barley than they got three years ago, and for their grade A pigs 5/- a cwt. less.  That is very unfair. While that continues, it is no wonder that we have wholesale emigration, that the people are closing their doors and emigrating.</P>
    <P>What annoyed the small farmers more than anything else was the fact that the Minister advertised that this wheat which was sold to Irish farmers at £26 a ton was, according to the answer given to a question in the Dáil, sold in England to the British farmer at £18 a ton.  That wheat went to John <Col N="73" /> Bull, whom we were not to feed at one time, but were to whip, left, right and centre.  We were told that we would starve John Bull.  The Irish farmer was giving that advantage to the British farmer, with whom he was trying to compete, and that wheat was grown with the blood, sweat and toil of the Irish farmer.  Why were the unfortunate people who grew this wheat and had lost all not given a chance at least to get back some of their losses?  Wheat was sold here at £26 a ton, then reduced to £23 a ton, but John Bull, the British farmer, could get it at £18 a ton.  In my opinion, that is a very foolish policy.  It would have been much better if the Minister had sold to our own farmers, the people who produced it and lost heavily on it, at £18 a ton, to give them a chance of feeding it to pigs, poultry, cattle or anything else, so that at least they would have some little chance of getting back some of their losses.</P>
    <P>As I have said, now that the Government have got into power on the backs of the tillage farmers and wheat growers, they have deserted them.  We all know that due to their promises before the last election, they gained seven seats in the wheat growing area, but the Government have deserted the farmers and are now trying to court what in the past they called the ranchers and the graziers. We all know that consistency can be an overrated virtue in politics, but when the 30 year's old agricultural policy of a political Party is completely reversed overnight, we are entitled to ask what is wrong in the Fianna Fáil Party.  There is no denying that this has occurred.  If anyone looks up the recent White Paper issued by the Government called a Programme for Economic Expansion and looks at page 12, paragraph 17, he will find the following sentence: &ldquo;Climatic and market influences combine to make grass the most important feature of Irish agriculture and future agricultural expansion will depend mainly on a dynamic policy of grass land development. Grass is the raw material of our principal export trade, beef, and cattle, of milk production and of sheep and lamb production&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="74" /> That sentence could well have come from the lips of the late Deputy Hogan, Minister for Agriculture in the first Cumann na nGaedheal Government. It could have come from the lips of Deputy James Dillon, who was also a Minister for Agriculture.  It is an astonishing utterance issued without any explanation from the Government who decried the growing of grass and the production of cattle and for a long number of years wanted to have all our land under tillage.  We were told at one time by the Minister for Agriculture that he would fill ten fields of inspectors and make the old cods tuck down their ditches and tuck their tractors into them.  We got 502,000 tons of wheat in this country&mdash;a record&mdash;in 1957 under an inter-Party Government without any compulsion.  That was because the farmers had faith in that Government and knew that the Government and Minister of that day would see that the farmers got justice, that they got a fair price and that the millers would give them a fair field.</P>

      <P>The Government, and there is no denying it, let the farmers down after promising them the sun, the moon and the stars.  It reminds me of a quotation from Lord Melbourne who said: &ldquo;Ponder, pause, prepare, postpone and end at leaving things alone; in short, earn the people's <Col N="76" /> pay by doing nothing every day.&rdquo;  They have done nothing for the wheat growers in the past six or eight months, in the bad harvest of 1958, and this year they have given no lead, good, bad, or indifferent, one way or the other, by an advertisement or anything else.  Not one bit of advice has come from the Department.  We know that last year the millers did not want to take winter wheat.  They would not take it and farmers in certain areas asked for a lead from the Government as to whether they should or should not grow winter wheat.  No lead came as to whether they should grow it or whether it would or would not be taken by the millers, if it were grown. The Government have let the farmers and the wheat growers down badly and they are doing nothing for them now.</P>

      <P>It is difficult for me to answer a charge which has not yet been made in concrete form.  I have heard words bandied about but there is no practical evidence of any charge in regard to the motion put down in the names of Senators Donegan, L'Estrange and J.L. O'Sullivan. There has not been a scintilla of evidence to support the charge that has been made, the charge that the Government made definite promises during the general election.  Allegations have been made but that is as far as it goes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The motion &ldquo;deplores the manner in which wheat growers were treated by the Minister for Agriculture during and after the harvest of 1958.&rdquo;  This charge is made by the very people who have been saying down through the years that wheat should not be made the football of Party politics. For goodness' sake, will they swallow their own words?  Wheat growers have been let down by the Minister, they say.  Is it not a fact that the Minister met representatives of farming organisations in regard to wheat during and after the 1958 harvest? That cannot be denied.  Nobody can <Col N="77" /> deny that difficult times were approaching during the harvest of 1958.  I think I can say without fear of contradiction that we have come through the most serious harvest the country ever had to face.</P>
    <P>The Minister met representatives from farming organisations, including the N.F.A.  I have met members of the N.F.A. who were in consultation with the Minister, and although they were politically opposed to him, they agreed with his point of view that under the circumstances nothing else could be done but what had been done. Why cannot Senators opposite who know very well the difficulties that had to be contended with, leave these matters in the hands of those people who stand to benefit or to lose through the policy carried out at the particular times?  Those who are fully qualified to discuss the points of view with the Government have had discussions with the Minister and his officials, and they have agreed that in those difficult circumstances nothing else could have been done.</P>
    <P>I put it to the movers of the motion: if the Minister had insisted as the harvest went on, that only the full standards should be accepted by the millers, who would benefit or lose? Senator Donegan will not contradict me when I say the standards accepted by the millers were seriously relaxed, thereby bringing into the mills a lot of wheat that would not in normal circumstances have been accepted even for pig feed.  Who would lose if the full standards were maintained?</P>
    <P>In the debate on a somewhat similar motion on the price of wheat on 12th March, 1958, I agreed that the Minister and the Government, in determining the price of wheat, should give full benefit to those people, the wheat producers, who have been habitual growers of wheat, who produce it and harvest it by the old methods of cut, stook, stack and thresh.  If that were followed in the 1958 harvest, who would benefit?  Would it have been the wheat growers who are now rallying to Senator L'Estrange or the wheat growers who are rallying to Senator O'Sullivan?  Senator O'Sullivan's supporters would gain considerably <Col N="78" /> because they have been habitual growers of cereals and continue to harvest by the old methods.  My constituents who grow cereals on a big scale, and grow wheat, would also benefit.</P>
    <P>In the debate I agreed with Senators opposite, and Senator Tunney was one of them, that steps should be taken by the Minister to see that the practical farmers who have grown wheat down through the years and have husbanded both the crop and the land should get full benefit of the maximum prices available.  I still maintain those views. The Minister, in meeting the farmers' representatives and taking into full consideration the hardships that would be involved in the greater section, agreed to marry the two prices.  We all had to benefit or lose by their decision, whichever point of view we held.</P>
    <P>Senator J.L. O'Sullivan said that the Fianna Fáil Government have been uttering the catch-cry &ldquo;Grow more wheat&rdquo;.  I could remind him that another Minister had been throwing around catch-cries that wheat, like peat and beet, would go up the spout and God speed the day.  It looks as if none of them has gone up the spout.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Government that if they want the farmers to produce anything here in abundance, they should send out the other Minister in violent opposition to the proposal and they would get what they want, I assure them.  Not only have we an overabundance of wheat but we have an over-abundance of beet, too, as Senator J.L. O'Sullivan will agree. He mentioned, as did Senator L'Estrange, a price of £18 for wheat for export.  Both of them know full well what happened then.  To prepare for the abundant harvest that was promised, were it not that the weather prevented it, the granaries had to be prepared for this crop&mdash;and most of them were still filled with grain from the previous harvest.  No steps were taken to get rid of it before that.</P>
    <P>If it happened that the granaries were still filled with corn from the previous year and no room was available for the incoming crop&mdash;granted we had a favourable season&mdash;I could see Senator L'Estrange and Senator <Col N="79" /> Donegan, especially, coming here to-day with an entirely different motion.  If the Irish farmer were allowed to purchase it at the price at which he said it was exported, what would happen to the guaranteed price for feeding barley?  Senator Donegan knows full well what would happen. There lies the answer.</P>
    <P>I said at the outset that the policy in regard to wheat should be left to the people who represent wheat growers.  In fact, the same applies to all crops.  Not only should wheat be left outside the arena of Party politice, but every crop should be left to the safe care of the farming organisations, in free consultation with the Government and the Department concerned. If that could be done, I think a good deal of the difficulty could be overcome.  A good deal of harm has been done by irresponsible people who go up and down the country with catch-cries such as &ldquo;the Government let down the wheat growers.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If we could get the people to organise themselves in such a way as to grow every ounce of everything we need in this country, and grow a surplus of that commodity for which we are sure we can get an export market, something would be done to stabilise agriculture.  It can be done if politicians leave these matters to the people concerned.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to go outside the terms of the motion.  It is difficult to answer a charge that has not been substantiated in any sense, shape or form.  The charge is groundless and it is calculated to do more harm than good.  I suggest we should leave this matter entirely in the hands of the agriculturists who are directly concerned. If they do that, we shall do a very fine service to the people they represent, be they agriculturists, producers or consumers, for whom Senator O'Leary is gravely concerned.</P>

      <P>There can be no gainsaying that the impression was conveyed in the last general election by back benchers and others that Deputy Dillon, the then Minister for Agriculture, had lowered the price of wheat; that that was wrong; and that <Col N="80" /> Fianna Fáil would remedy the position if they were returned to office. The suggestion was made that they would bring the price back again. There was no suggestion whatever that the price would be lowered below that obtaining at the time.</P>
      <P>In recent months, we have heard quite a lot about the policy put forward by political Parties at elections and about the fact that the electorate are supposed to judge on the policies&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I do not wish to quote on this.  I am merely making the general observation that nowhere was there any suggestion of a decrease. I make this point at the present juncture because it is extremely important to keep the confidence of the producers. I deplore the charges, back and forth between the two Parties, as to who did this and who did that. That is not the way to get increased production.  Increased production calls for the united efforts of all concerned. That is why I subscribe to the motion. I believe such charges can undermine the confidence of producers.  Increased production does pay and the more they produce, the more they will have in the end.</P>
      <P>Senator Lahiffe referred to the National Farmers' Association.  That is ground on which we should be very careful not to tread.  It is a non-political organisation and it is doing an excellent job.  I am aware that they have been greatly dissatisfied with the wheat policy of the Government.  I am equally well aware that they would not have agreed with Deputy Dillon's lowering of the price in the previous period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The point is that if it is necessary to lower the price, to take drastic measures, it should be possible for the Government, at this stage of our <Col N="81" /> advancement, to bring the producers' representatives together, to get them to see the reasonableness of whatever policy is being implemented and not to leave the producers dissatisfied, as quite definitely they are dissatisfied, with the present wheat policy.  We all know the surplus: it seems that that could have been got over reasonably enough by a contract system.  Even if the contract system could not be introduced last year, certainly arrangements could have been made to introduce it in the future.</P>
    <P>I think the taxpayer should have had to pay to keep the confidence of the producers in the policy of the Government prevailing at that period.  I do not want in any way to be construed as making a political speech.  I am talking simply of the necessity for keeping producer confidence and, of course, those references to ranchers and all the rest in connection with the growing of wheat can be simply answered.  Surely, at this day and date, our Government have ways and means of ensuring that does not happen&mdash;whether by contract system or otherwise&mdash;and of ensuring that the small and medium farmers are given their proper priority?</P>
    <P>I know we have got a measure of agreement but I believe the stage has come in this country when we ought to take agriculture out of politics and I shall welcome the day when I see, in the Seanad and in the Dáil, an all-Party committee on agriculture.  I shall welcome the day when we cease bickering about who did this and who did that.  All Ministers have been endeavouring to do their best.  Deputy Dillon did his best and the present Minister, undoubtedly, is doing his best, but that is not good enough to keep faith with the producers.</P>

      <P>To tell the truth, I am always anxious, whether it be in the Seanad or elsewhere, to take part in a discussion and to listen to the views of those <Col N="82" /> who have anything to say on agricultural matters, but, to tell the truth also, this motion has been suspect with me and, I think, quite legitimately so&mdash;the purposes of it, the objective being aimed at, however plausible and non-political the words may be that are chosen in introducing it or completing the discussion on it.  That is the opinion I formed when coming here and, as a result of that, it is not easy to take too seriously some of the points made and some of these non-political pleas we always hear from people who I am afraid are not too non-political.</P>
      <P>We expected that Senator Donegan would have some charge to make, as Senator Lahiffe has pointed out.  I do not intend to go into all the details of last year's troubles, so far as the wheat producers were concerned, except to say that in all my Department's decisions, and prior to the decisions being made, there was full consultation with the N.F.A. and that, in fact, the scheme which was introduced and announced in 1958 was the scheme that was prepared by the N.F.A.  It would not be any harm if Senator Quinlan kept that fact in mind.  As I said in the Dáil, it was not my scheme, nor, in all probability, would it have been the scheme I would decide upon, but, in order to secure the co-operation and support of those who were most intimately concerned, I bent my will and judgment to meet them in this regard.</P>
      <P>The same thing applies to the situation that came about rather suddenly in August and September of last year when the whole pattern was changed, as a result of the havoc caused by the weather, in so far as wheat growing was concerned.  It is not that I resent this because when you are in politics, and especially when the Fianna Fáil Party are in office and are confronted with a disappointed, despondent Fine Gael Opposition, there are no depths to which they will not go, either privately or in public&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;whether in private or public, as character assassins.  I have been accused of not announcing <Col N="83" /> to the farmers what I thought they should do in 1959.  In fact, I made it my business to make an announcement as to what they were going to get earlier than an announcement had been made for years past.  I made that early announcement deliberately for the purpose of rehabilitating and building up their confidence and of letting them see that, even if they had a bad year, the mind of the Government was clear.</P>
      <P>What kills the members of the Fine Gael Party, the non-political members and otherwise, is that, in 1957, when we came into office, some time in March, the acreage under wheat increased and, in 1958, when we announced the policy I have already referred to and the plan I have already told you about, despite all the predictions and all their accusations, the actual acreage in that year increased still further over that of 1957.  That, of course, goes to show that the public at large and the farming community have always had confidence in us.</P>

      <P>According to Senator L'Estrange, from 1932 to 1959, we have been breaking promises to the agriculturists and yet we have retained their confidence.  Is it not an extraordinary thing that while we are charged with having broken faith with them, we got a greater acreage?  We were accused of breaking promises in 1932; we were accused in 1937; we were accused in 1938; we were accused in 1943; we were accused in 1944, and in 1947; but in 1948, we were thought to have been broken politically, and now we are back again, stronger than ever, because the farmers of Ireland supported us.  Is that not an extraordinary thing?  Are they not the facts?  It is these facts and it is that tendency, that loyalty and determination on the part of the people that make the character assassins come to life again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am castigated because of not having made some sort of announcement about price and general conditions.  I made it in November, earlier than it <Col N="84" /> has been made in years, for the reason that I wanted to re-establish confidence and give courage to owners of land. Why should I, anyhow, have resorted to the expensive campaign of advertising what I thought the farmers should do in the matter of whether they should grow wheat, barley or oats, when I had some of the most active members of the Fine Gael Party and, indeed, the mover of this motion, inserting advertisements in the <i>Dundalk Democrat</i> telling them what they should do?  The strange thing about these advertisements is that although they were issued by the firm of which the Senator is a director, his name and the names of the other directors for the first time were not included in them.</P>
    <P>Here is how one advertisement reads:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;My advice is wheat&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>is how it is headed.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;...I think that those Farmers who are still in a position to change their minds should do so.</P>
    <P>This firm has repeatedly advised the same approach for the last three weeks in this paper.</P>
    <P>Oversowing of barley and oats is financially dangerous.</P>
    <P>This year&mdash;&lsquo;grow more wheat.&rsquo;&rdquo;</P>

    <P>That was why I asked earlier which foot did the Senator dig with, whether he was digging for the farmers or the wheat growers, or whether he was digging <Col N="85" /> as a merchant or digging for the millers or the brewers.</P>

      <P>I do not think there is anything of the character assassin about that.  After all, the <i>Dundalk Democrat</i> circulates in Louth and Senator Donegan is a businessman in Louth.  He is interested in wheat as a merchant; he is interested in barley as a merchant; he is interested in oats and fertilisers; and he is interested in the selling of all these commodities.  Why should I call upon the resources of the taxpayer to advertise, since we have a businessman who, for his own reasons, and his own motives, is prepared to do it for us?  In addition to that, he is a Fine Gael Senator?  Perhaps having regard to some of the pronouncements, he did not like to associate his name openly with the advertisements.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="86" /> Dougherty's and so on.  One of the directors of that firm is a Bachelor of Agriculture and after all, I am an ordinary layman and I am invited to express the view whether winter wheat should be grown and whether it is good policy.  Would you not have thought that a firm so keenly interested in a policy like this, with a Bachelor of Agriculture as a member of the board of directors, would have utilised his tremendous technical knowledge in order to tell the Louth farmers what course they should pursue?</P>
    <P>There is another matter with which I meant to deal earlier, but it escaped my memory.  Senator Donegan made an allegation that he had endeavoured to see me on three or four occasions during the months of August and September. I can say quite deliberately that no such request ever reached me and I can also say that as Minister for Agriculture, if I had been available on those dates, I would have been in duty bound to meet any member of this House, or any member of the Dáil, or indeed any public man.  I do not know what Senator Donegan would like to pass as in this House amongst the members.  I do not know what he would wish to pass as amongst the people amongst whom he circulates in his own county, but I do not think, somehow, that by a person from whom we hear all these protestations of fair play and co-operation a completely and entirely untruthful accusation should be made&mdash;by one who would like to have himself taken, whether entitled or otherwise, as one who is the essence of fair play.</P>
    <P>A further point I want to make is that I do not think that at a time like this it is the business of a Minister for Agriculture to set about telling farmers what they should do.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">

      <P>There are times when the needs require a different policy and I should be the first to admit it.  Not only that, but I would be the first to recognise when such a time arose.  In the ordinary way, I have a fair share of contacts with rural people and farmers.  I know their minds.  I have met quite a few county committees of <Col N="87" /> agriculture, composed of farmers, in the main.  Indeed I was in County Westmeath for a whole day and I think I gave a good account of myself there. I have met all these people and, with all these contacts I undoubtedly can claim to have, I did not hear a critical word spoken on this matter by any fair-minded person, or even by persons openly hostile to the political policy of the Party of which I have been a member all these years.  I have not heard a solitary word of criticism of the way in which this whole matter was handled last year.</P>
      <P>I can tell Senators that I take a tremendous pride in the way in which we handled that matter.  I know that is appreciated by growers of wheat in Louth, in Meath, in Wexford and other grain-growing counties.  Members of the executive of the N.F.A. have openly and publicly declared that to be the conclusion at which they arrived.  That is not to say an organisation like the N.F.A. will agree with everything you do.  However, in every step taken, first, in the announcement of the scheme&mdash;which was their scheme&mdash;and secondly, in the departure from it to meet the extraordinary situation, there was consultation with them.  There are a lot of Cork men these days who are speaking in a non-political sense on a whole lot of matters and Senator Quinlan, if he wants to sustain his claim to speak in a non-political sense, should make himself conversant with all these things.  He will find that, in every step taken, the very pattern which he has outlined as the pattern desirable to follow, was the one followed by me.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister answer one question?  When the N.F.A. wanted 360,000 tons, the Minister insisted on 300,000 tons.  That is a fundamental difference, is it not?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>

      <P>The Senator has just made his speech and I shall make mine, with the Cathaoirleach's permission.

We hear a lot about the young on-coming men who, we hope, will not have the political tinge and bias of those who went before them.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>The first thing I want to say, in conclusion, is that several Fianna Fáil Senators made a statement that no quotation was given which, within the wording of the motion, gave a proof that members of the Government had made specific promises.  At the start of my speech, probably in the first column, I gave a reference to Dr. Ryan's radio speech, taken from the <i>Irish Independent</i> of February 25th, 1957, in which he referred in the most drastic terms to the reduction in wheat and went on to say that the Fianna Fáil Government would give a remunerative price for wheat, implying that our price was not remunerative and that their price would be an increased one.  That disposes of the statement that there were no definite proofs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been in politics since 1954. From 1954 to 1957, I was in the Dáil and then they sent me upstairs.  I do not know much about precedents, but never before have I heard any member <Col N="89" /> of the Oireachtas attacked provocatively in his business.  I have never known anybody who was a director of a firm or had an interest in a firm, to be attacked to make a political point, on what he did in that firm or what the firm did.  I hope that this does not create a precedent.  I found myself in that position.  I knew full well that the Minister had before him a slice of the <i>Dundalk Democrat</i> which is well known to me and which I have seen before.  I hoped he was not going to use it, but I made up my mind as a businessman that if he had started to use it I would have no choice but to let him read it through and then I would reply to it, as if I claimed the indulgence of the Chair and asked that my business be not discussed, I could not reply.  I hope that neither in the Dáil nor in the Seanad will the Minister's actions create a precedent, as I can assure him of one thing, that there will be fewer businessmen in the Dáil or Seanad if this sort of thing continues.</P>
    <P>He spoke of my &ldquo;character breaking&rdquo; and a lot about the depth to which Deputies can go.  I did not sink to that.  I did not at any time attack the Minister or say what he does or does not do in Cavan.  He said what I did or did not do in Louth.  We in Louth can look after ourselves and I can be friends, thanks be to God, with many friends of the Minister.  I want to stay that way.</P>
    <P>As an ordinary member of the Upper House here, I feel I have been deeply injured in my approach to politics by the approach of the Minister in attacking me.  I must reply on it and say that he did not quote the whole of the advertisement in which he says: &ldquo;My advice is wheat.&rdquo;  I would not presume to say such a thing.  &ldquo;My advice is wheat&rdquo; was an extract from an editorial in the <i>Irish Farmers' Journal</i>, specified as such.  Also, the advertisement heading: &ldquo;Spring sowing report&rdquo; referred to a Spring sowing report&mdash;and the Minister was five months wrong when he mentioned that winter wheat should have been the subject of discussion there.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, I want to say that it is about <Col N="90" /> two or three years&mdash;it might be a shorter period, it is hard to remember, but it is certainly some considerable time&mdash;since that firm's advertisements carried the names of its directors.  They decided that, as a new firm, that was necessary; but it is not necessary now. They were not deliberately left out in that advertisement, nor have they been inserted in advertisements for some time past.  I shall say no more, but I hope the Minister has not created a precedent.  I do not think any one of his colleagues would have acted in that manner.  I need not reply by attacking him, as I could, on his method of making money in County Cavan.</P>
    <P>The Minister also stated that there was full consultation with the National Farmers' Association.  Consultation is one thing; agreement is another.  There may have been full consultation but there was not full agreement, and it is unfair to use a non-political body like that and, in saying that there was full consultation, to imply that there was full agreement.  I referred to the N.F.A. statement after the Minister had announced his <i>ex gratia</i> payment. The statement said: &ldquo;Mr. Seán Healy, general secretary of the National Farmers' Association, issued the following statement on behalf of the Association:</P>
    <P>The National Farmers' Association is gravely disappointed with the Government's announcement of the &lsquo;special payments&rsquo; to be made to wheat growers in respect of the 1958 wheat crop.  Farmers throughout the country based their hopes on the Government's statement of November 14, 1958, an extract from which reads&mdash;&lsquo;The Government have decided that in view of the losses suffered by wheat growers this year, a substantial proportion of the amount by which the cost of wheat for milling in 1958-59 falls below the cost for the past year can be used for the benefit of the growers&rsquo;.  Their (the farmers') hopes have been far from realised.</P>
    <P>The statement went on to give the opinion of the N.F.A.  If the Minister wishes, I shall read it, but I do not want to delay the House.  I shall give <Col N="91" /> the arguments they used.  Whether or not I would agree with these arguments, I want to prove that while there might have been consultation, there was no agreement and it was unfair of the Minister to imply that he had the N.F.A. behind him.</P>
    <P>Again, we have the situation after the election when the acting Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Aiken, who had taken over after the very sad demise of the previous Minister, God rest his soul, said in reply to a question that &ldquo;no alteration in the price of wheat in those last days of March would appreciably affect the acreage of wheat this year&rdquo;.  If that answer did not have the result of increasing the acreage even in the last days of March, why imply a promise of an increase in price?  I do not know what his intention was, but I certainly think that reply was misleading in the extreme.</P>
    <P>Senator Carter asked who is going to put up the money.  I shall say what I think.  There was a national emergency which was handled very badly and the Minister was grossly negligent. I have said so, and I have also said that I hoped he would not take it personally. Many a person who was grossly negligent lived to do something for Ireland, and I hope he will do so too.  Why was the national exchequer not asked to make a greater contribution? The handling of the matter was bad inasmuch as the Minister did not do specific things.  I asked why he did not do them, and to make a statement about them, but he did not answer me and in summing up to-night in five minutes I referred to them.  Around that time the Minister interrupted and said that I did not dare to offend the millers.  That indicated that he intended to attack me in my business.  I do not think that it did me any harm.  I hope not, anyway, but I can assure the Minister that if somewhere in Ireland there is another fellow in my business who might think of coming into this House and giving his honest contribution, the Minister certainly has not helped him.</P>
    <P>If the Minister wants a few criticisms in which the millers would be involved and with which they would not agree, I am now going to give them <Col N="92" /> and to show the Minister that I do dare to offend anybody I feel like daring to offend when I carry out my public duties in this House.  The first thing I am going to say is that the Minister allowed the millers to remove the payments they made to the merchants or driers for sacks, but at the same time the price of wheat was not increased. The cost of a sack was approximately a shilling when one takes account of the number of times a sack can be used.  That meant that the Minister allowed the millers to pocket 2¾ million shillings in an average wheat harvest, and not a word was spoken. That is something the millers would not like to hear.  I could meet them tomorrow and still hold my views and do my work for them as long as I do it well.</P>
    <P>They would not like my saying that the Minister's big mistake was not insisting on a minimum quantity of Irish wheat in the grist.  When the price of foreign wheat was favourable, the Minister did not insist on a minimum quantity of Irish wheat.  His predecessor in 1954 insisted on 50 per cent. and eventually made them use 66? per cent., but because the present Minister did not insist on a minimum, 90 per cent. of the wheat of Ireland was put aside as millable but unsuitable and only 10 per cent. was used in the grist.  The Minister when he made his catastrophic agreement of September 12 allowed himself to be led astray.  If only 10 per cent. of the wheat grown in Ireland was fit for milling, where did we get the seed that is too thick on every field in Ireland to-day?</P>
    <P>I come back to the stage at which the Minister told me that I did not dare offend the millers.  I am going to say something that does not offend them.  I am going to refer to Senator Carter's quotation from the Irish Flour Millers' Association <i>Newsletter</i> in which attention was called to certain journals which referred to the screenings as &ldquo;so-called excessive and penal.&rdquo;  The reason these screenings were such was that the Minister had failed when he made his bargain on September 12th.  He left the millers in a position that final arrangement of the prices which would have to be made was not made on that date.  The millers <Col N="93" /> are nobody's darlings.  They are people in this business to make money for themselves, and quite naturally, they reduced the price to the maximum extent to be as safe as possible.  If the Minister had made a definite arrangement on September 12th, there is no doubt that things would have been entirely different.</P>
    <P>Senator Carter said that there is no one at this stage in any doubt as to Fianna Fáil policy.  Everybody at this stage is in the greatest doubt as to Fianna Fáil policy.  In December of 1957, after the Fianna Fáil Government had been in office nine months, a leading article in the <i>Irish Farmers' Journal</i> which I quoted earlier to-night drew attention to the fact that there were grave doubts as to Fianna Fáil's attitude to wheat growing.  If there were grave doubts then, what sort of doubts are there now?  Senator Carter went on to prove beyond yea or nay why there was a change in Fianna Fáil policy when he said that at one time they were trying to make the farmers of Westmeath grow wheat, and now they wanted them to grow hay seed when they wanted to grow wheat.  That is the position.  I am fed up.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to refer to the things the Minister did not mention. He is very fond of me and various other people and he made us the subject for the debate.  We are not very wonderful so he did not make a good job of it.  He did not mention the point I raised with regard to the minimum amount of Irish wheat put into grist.  That is far more important. If we had sufficient seed wheat and sufficient millable wheat that was graded as unsuitable, where is the wheat?  The Minister did not answer that question or was that the point?</P>
      <P>Will the Minister give any help to the farmer who sold his wheat before 12th September and got 40/- a barrel for it?  As I said at the opening of this debate, I know of cases where it was bought for use as feeding stuff by a firm which was linked with a flour mill and is in fact a flour mill, and that money would be paid back by a paper entry.  I refer to the man who sold his wheat to a merchant or compound miller or feeder for 40/- per barrel and cannot get his money back.  Did the Minister mention anything about that unfortunate man?  I know 20 of them in my own area and I am quite certain there are thousands of them in Ireland. The Minister did not even deign to say: &ldquo;I am terribly sorry; I cannot do anything about it.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The truth is what I had to announce to the Minister to-night, that the people who sold their wheat at feeding stuff prices to firms linked with flour mills would get their back money.  The Minister could not announce it, because if he did, it would show to greater effect the fact that many people were not going to get it.  That is the <Col N="95" /> political reason.  Has the Minister succeeded in making a statement that would enlighten the farmers on next year's harvest?  Last year many millers refused to take winter wheat. Has the Minister informed us that three out of four millers, giving a list, will accept winter wheat?  Has he told us that no flour miller will accept it or that some of them will?  He has not mentioned it.</P>
    <P>Has the Minister given any hope to the man with the combine harvester on hire purchase who has not the money to buy a cat?  I do not think he has.  Has he taken into account the fact that speakers from this side of the House told him that the policy of this Party was to grow wheat, that men sold their cattle, small farmers, took land and bought machines and now, as verified by Deputy Carter and given in retaliation by the Minister, the Fianna Fáil policy has backflipped? These people who have £1,000 or £1,500 to pay on their combine harvesters are to be left with no hope for the future and no leading light as to whether wheat will be as good in the future as it was in the past.</P>
    <P>The Minister made the statement that he never told us so early before what the price of wheat will be.  He did not have to do that.  When the subsidy went and An Bord Gráin was constituted and the system of levy introduced, everybody knew what the price was.  The Minister can come along in August if he wants to and find a levy but he can then reduce it.  That is one of the things he can do because again there is no question of the farmers knowing whether or not there will be a screening reduction on normal wheat <Col N="96" /> next year.  Those are the things the Minister did not tell us.  He was interested only in discussing Senator Quinlan and myself and not in making a factual statement on wheat.</P>
    <P>Has he made any suggestion as to the type of wheat best suited to the Irish economy?  After all, the catastrophic harvest of last year must have brought something to the surface. Has he had discussions with millers as to how much of each variety of wheat they want?  If he has, why has he not told us and if he has not, why does he object to our putting a motion down to elicit the information from him?</P>
    <P>Finally, the Minister took the line that he could pay some money but he refused to call it a repayment of the levy.  A lot of people said: &ldquo;What does it matter, if we get the money?&rdquo; The truth is that the Minister could introduce a levy only for surplus wheat. He made a levy of 5/9d. per barrel for what was not surplus wheat but for the disposal of what was unmillable wheat. He got the Exchequer out through a side door by a method which, if adopted by any group of firms in the country, would result in their finding themselves in the highest court in the land, and they would pay the compensation.</P>
    <P>Without any doubt, the Minister has the big stick.  He has wielded it and wielded it very fully.  He has refused to answer tonight, almost in an impertinent fashion, any of the reasonable case put to him.  He chose instead to make me a butt in my own business. I hope he will not continue on that line because there is not one other Minister in the Cabinet who would have done what he has done.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter which I wish to raise on the motion for the adjournment is that the Government should take steps to ensure that copies of the Dáil and Seanad debates on the Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill are made available to the public at all post offices and in all public libraries.  Before I begin, I must draw attention to the absence in this House of any Government representative.  I think the most valuable instrument we have got here is the opportunity to raise matters on the Adjournment.  I regret that the Government have not seen fit to treat this motion seriously, as I am treating it.  My reasons for this motion come under five headings, although it should scarcely be necessary to show the necessity for such an elementary thing as informing the public on the vital issues that are at stake in the coming referendum.  Still, I shall give my reasons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First of all, we have the fact that this referendum involves a change in the Constitution.  That is something which is fundamental and sacred and has been agreed as such by all Parties.  It therefore behoves us to have a rational and impartial approach so that if the Government are sincere in their protestations, that they want the public to judge this issue, then the necessary information will be made available to them.  My fellow university Senators and I being independent members deeply resent the implications which were made by those on the opposite side against our impartiality.  Nevertheless, we will do our duty whether it offends Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael or Labour; we are here from the universities and that is our task.  As long as we go under the label of Independents, we will act as Independents.  We have always insisted on the necessity for an impartial inquiry in this matter.  We have not got that but we have had the case made by some Government spokesmen that the debates here are a substitution for that impartial inquiry or commission. We had the words of the Minister <Col N="104" /> for External Affairs who said, when we pressed for a commission:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We have had a commission of 147 men sitting on the proposed change for almost three months in the Dáil and I do not know how long it is going to take here.  I think that is the best type of commission.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamOBuachalla" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator will understand that he may not go into the whole merits of the case on the motion for the Adjournment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that.  I am giving my reasons briefly in support of my motion and I have quoted the Minister for External Affairs as giving the debates of the Dáil and Seanad the status almost of a commission.  Surely if the Government regard those debates in that manner, they should agree to this motion, that those reports should be made freely available through the means I suggest?</P>
      <P>Again, we have the absence of any authoritative guide to the voter.  Any other country that set about changing such a fundamental aspect of its Constitution would have a report of a commission available for the guidance of the voters.  Sweden has been mentioned at great length and Sweden had a commission in 1948 and they appointed another one in 1954 when they wanted to make some other adjustment in their Constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I take it that it is the central core of a democratic approach that a reasonable body of evidence should be made available.  Consequently, I can see no reason whatsoever why this request should not be met.  It may be mentioned that these reports are on sale to any citizen who cares to buy them, at the Government Publications Office, at only 6d. each.  I have found out that that is a myth because, in effect, 120 copies of each day's sitting are made available to the Government Publications Office.  No more will be issued or printed unless an order is given for a very substantial fraction of 120.  In fact, to get reprints of the debate here of February 12th last, I had to give an order for 120 copies.  At present no reprints are available at the Government Publications Office, and therefore I take it that this, in effect, is burying <Col N="105" /> the very extensive and reasoned debates that we had in this Chamber ranging over six weeks and also the debates in the Dáil.</P>
    <P>It is a very reasonable request that these should be made available in all public libraries and in all post offices so that our citizens can consult them freely.  It may be asked whether or not they should be for sale in those places. That is purely a matter for the Government. I think it would be well to have them on sale as well as having them available for perusal by voters in these places.</P>
    <P>Finally, I should like to say that since the debate here I for one have been very disturbed by the very biased approach of some newspapers in reporting on it.  I had my own experience where two letters were printed by a newspaper attacking the university Senators because we dared to do our duty here.  Remember, that we were not attacked when we voted for the Fianna Fáil nominee as Chairman of the Seanad&mdash;and quite rightly so&mdash;and we would do so again.  We were not attacked on any occasion on which we voted with the Government, but we were attacked when we saw fit to express an opposite point of view. Those two letters appeared in the official organ of the Government Party and I felt called upon to reply to the second one which singled me out, without mentioning my name, and misrepresented what I had said.  Over four weeks ago, I sent a letter to the newspaper and two weeks after sending it, I telephoned in connection with the letter but it has still not appeared.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Very naïve.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should expect that at least if a paper prints letters attacking a member of this House, it will give that member the courtesy of an opportunity to reply to the attacks. It is for that reason that I feel the voters must be enlightened.  This is the cheapest and only available way at the present time&mdash;unless the Dáil in its wisdom sees fit to accede to the very reasonable request put by those opposing the motion to set aside the decision of the Seanad.  If that goes through, of course, we shall have what we regard <Col N="106" /> as second best, a committee of this House and of the Dáil which will sit and sift the evidence, the debates and so on and present a report on the proceedings of these two Houses which will be some guide to the voters.  In the absence of that, at least the other course should be taken and these debates should be made available.</P>
      <P>We are not to be prevented from doing this by any financial considerations. The amount involved would be very trivial.  At most there would be 8,000 to 10,000 bound booklets costing about £1 each.  That would be the very outside cost.  In other words, a trivial amount would be involved, but a great amount would be involved for the ordinary people down the country. Consequently, I appeal strongly that this suggestion be accepted by the Government in the spirit in which it is moved.  Then the voters in their approach to this decision on the referendum will be able to approach it in a strictly non-political, non-Party manner and will be able to distinguish between the political issues, the candidates going forward for the Presidential election, and the fundamental issue which is the constitutional change proposed in the referendum.</P>

      <P>Before Senator Mullins replies, may I say I regret very much that it has not been thought fit to have a Minister present for this question on the adjournment?  It has been the unvarying practice of the House&mdash;and I have had the experience of it from this and the other side of the House where the Senator now sits&mdash; that a Minister should be in attendance. That practice has been broken in this instance.  I do not see any reason for it, because there was pretty long notice.  Also, the other House is meeting and, though the matter is not a departmental one, I do not see any difficulty would have arisen in having a Minister here, as has been the practice, to state the Government viewpoint.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like, not so much from the point of view of the merits of the matter, or from a political or Party point of view, but from the point of view of Seanad Eireann, to take exception <Col N="107" /> to that omission to-night.  I regret very much as a Senator that it has not been thought fit to have a Minister present here as is usual to express the point of view of the Government.</P>

      <P>Senator Quinlan must be a very simple man, if he cannot see the obvious objections to the proposal which he makes.  He must be so immersed in the pursuits of science that he never stood in a rural post office, or has probably never had time to go into the busy post offices in the city centres, where he suggests these books will be displayed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us bring him back to earth for a few minutes.  He seems to think that the people are ill-informed on this matter, in spite of the fact that the Dáil and Seanad have debated this proposition very thoroughly over the past six months.  To enlighten the people further, he makes the fantastic suggestion that copies of the Dáil and Seanad reports of the debates should be made available in post offices and public libraries.  Has he, even before he spoke on this matter, got the 29 booklets of the Seanad and Dáil debates which incorporate the debates on the Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill, and just put them up together on a table?  Has he any idea of what the 29 booklets would look like?  There were 17 booklets covering the Dáil debates <Col N="108" /> and 12 booklets covering the Seanad debates.  If Senator Quinlan has ever gone into a post office in a city or rural area to check the electors list on publication to see whether his name and address were included in it as an ordinary voter, independent of his university status, he will know how awkward it is for postal officials.  They have one copy of that list hanging up and at a time perhaps when people are coming home from work, two or three citizens may say: &ldquo;Give me that list until I check whether my name is on it.&rdquo;  These 29 booklets would be hanging up somewhere in a post office. Apart from considerations of space, I commend the idea to Senator Quinlan that he should go into a post office and just ask to have a look at the register which hangs on the main counter.  It is only one slim volume.  Then he might appreciate the difficulties which would be involved in hanging 29 volumes.</P>
    <P>He seems to think that there is no difficulty whatever in this proposition and that the cost is trivial.  There are 2,269 post offices and approximately 2,587 municipal and county libraries. If a single copy of each of these debates were to be made available for each of these post offices and municipal and county libraries, 140,824 copies in all would be required.  The Senator has given us figures for the number of copies normally printed, but I do not think the figure he gave us was correct.  I think the reports of the Seanad debates go to a little more than the 100 odd he mentioned; the Dáil debates are printed up to about 800, I understand, per issue.  Therefore, in order to comply with this proposition, there would have to be a complete reprint of every one of the 29 booklets. I would ask Senator Quinlan to put himself in the position of the postal official on a very busy day in a crammed post office&mdash;say, Friday, when people are coming in to draw the old age pension.  Now, there are 29 booklets of these Dáil and Seanad debates on the Constitution Amendment Bill and two or three people come in at one time, all in a hurry to get back to work after lunch and each of them wants to read Senator Quinlan's speech.</P>

      <P>Suppose someone comes in and asks for Senator Quinlan's speech and another person is looking for another speech in the same volume, how does the Senator think they will be able to work it out? Even from the point of view of using the books for reference purposes in post offices, it would be impossible, because on the basis of getting them reprinted and hung up in single volumes, they would not be indexed and would be very little use for rapid study or consultation.</P>
      <P>Another thing the Senator urges is that they should be put into local authority libraries.  As far as I know, the Minister for Local Government has no authority to direct what particular book should or should not be put into any municipal library, and therefore from that point of view, it would be impracticable.</P>
      <P>As regards the suggestion that the people are not well informed, surely, as I said at the start, the widespread publicity given to these debates on the Bill, in the Press and on the radio and in discussion groups throughout the country, including rural organisations at which Senator Quinlan so often speaks, should be proof enough that the subject is a live one and that it is being discussed and debated from one end of the country to the other.  It has been front page news in every daily paper here in the past six months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The coverage by newspaper and radio of the Dáil and Seanad debates was excellent.  In the Dáil, the debates took 97 hours, spread over 17 days. In the Seanad, they got 63 hours, spread over 12 days.  It might be interesting to recall that the entire <Col N="110" /> debate in Dáil Éireann on the draft Constitution in 1937 lasted only 63 hours, spread over 12 days.  There was no Seanad at the time.  In this case, on the Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill, the debate in both Houses probably lasted longer than any debate for many years past.</P>
    <P>Nobody can say that the people are not informed on this matter, because in addition to all this, the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs is obliged, by law, to provide copies of the Bill for inspection or for sale at a cost of sixpence in every post office.  The result is that when the decision is definitely arrived at to nominate the polling day, the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs must put into every post office a copy of the Bill which can be inspected there by the citizens and copies of which can be bought, if they so wish, for sixpence.</P>
    <P>In addition, and most important of all, every person whose name appears on the Register of Electors and who will have a vote in the referendum will get by post with his polling card a statement agreed on by the principal Parties in Dáil Éireann explaining the proposal to him and enlightening the people on what they are called on to vote for in the referendum.</P>
    <P>In our opinion, this is quite sufficient. We do not believe that the people are suffering as a result of the lack of these volumes in post offices.  We do not believe it is a practicable proposition to put them in post offices or libraries, and we are quite satisfied that with the polling card and the explanatory card that people will get on the morning of the poll, the matter is adequately met and catered for.</P>
