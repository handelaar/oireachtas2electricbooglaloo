    <Title>Johnstown Castle Agricultural College (Amendment) Bill, 1959&mdash;Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Smith) Patrick Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the House is aware, Johnstown Castle was presented to the nation jointly by Mrs. Dorothy Violet Jefferies and Mr. Maurice Victor Lakin in 1944 and was accepted under the Johnstown Castle Agricultural College Act, 1945. It is now proposed to transfer the property to An Foras Talúntais.</P>
      <P>Since its acquisition 14 years ago, Johnstown Castle has become one of the most noted possessions of my Department. Apart from its historical and scenic values which were considerable, it has achieved fame as a centre of agricultural science.  In its development the State has invested about £250,000 and I think the House will agree this investment has given very good returns. The donors, Mrs. Jefferies and Mr. Lakin, have of course been consulted and have given their consent to the transfer of the property to An Foras Talúntais.</P>
      <P>The Bill itself is a relatively simple one and largely self-explanatory.  The Preamble, a rather unusual feature of present-day legislation, sets out rather well the main purposes.  Apart from the transfer of the College, the Bill authorises the extension of its purposes so as specifically to include agricultural research. This is included in Section 3 of the Bill.  Section 5 of the Bill has been framed to meet Mr. Lakin's wishes that the existing Jubilee Nurse who has a cottage free of rent and rates on the estate should be allowed to retain that tenure on the same terms for her lifetime.  Certain improvements of the cottage requested by Mr. Lakin will be effected by the Institute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 6 has also been designed to meet Mr. Lakin's wishes that so far as possible the castle and estate should be preserved in its present condition. <Col N="907" /> Section 7 of the Bill emphasises that Sections 6, 7 and 8 of the 1945 Act remain in operation.  These refer to the preservation of the ornamental nature of the gardens and pleasure grounds; the retention by Mr. Lakin of the sporting rights on the estate; and the preservation to the donors of access to the family private burial ground.</P>
    <P>Section 8 of the Bill safeguards the rights of the former employees of the Johnstown Estate who were transferred to the Department under the 1945 Act.</P>
    <P>It is of course the intention that Johnstown Castle, with all its stock, equipment and buildings, shall be transferred absolutely free to the Institute.  Other stations also have been transferred without charge.  In accordance with the terms of the Counterpart Agreement with the United States Government on the setting up of An Foras Talúntais the annual State grant to the Institute will include the money for the maintenance of the services transferred.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the Seanad for approval.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I think this is a desirable Bill.  Once the Agricultural Institute was established, it would seem to be logical that the seat of agricultural research should be transferred to the Institute and it is done in accordance with the previous Bill and with the consent of the owners, with certain provisos which were accepted.  I take it that the staff of Johnstown Castle College will be transferred to the Institute on suitable terms and that they will not be in any way injured by the transfer.  For that reason, it seems to me to be an entirely commendable Bill.</P>

      <P>In welcoming this Bill, I wish to ask the Minister a few questions.  Naturally, it is a forward step to have Johnstown Castle taken over by An Foras Talúntais, but I should like to get some information, if possible, as to the transfer of any other State institutions or teaching establishments.  I suggest it is in order to ask if there are any further transfers from State ownership to the ownership of An Foras Talúntais?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamStanford" hpid="Professor Stanford Professor Stanford">
      <NameTxt>Professor Stanford</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to comment on Section 6 of the Bill.  It seems to be very desirable.  It reads:</P>
      <P>No construction shall be undertaken within a view of Johnstown Castle or of the main avenues which is not designed in harmony with the style of the said Castle.</P>
      <P>I hope this will be a blueprint for further Bills of this kind and I hope this principle will spread throughout all Government undertakings.  I hope it may even govern the improvement of Leinster House when that is undertaken in the future.</P>
      <P>There is just one thing I should like to ask: in the opinion of whom does this section operate?  It is stated that &ldquo;no construction shall be undertaken ...which is not designed in harmony with the style of the said castle&rdquo; and I should just like to ask the Minister who will decide this and whether it would not be desirable to put the person or persons who will decide it into the Bill.  Otherwise, I can see a good deal of controversy about matters of taste arising later on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Stanford has raised a very important point.  While this is not relevant to town-planning there is the same sort of safeguard in this Bill as there is in town-planning legislation.  The officials charged with the responsibility of seeing that buildings are properly erected are apparently much more interested in structural soundness and the provision of fire escapes and that they are built a proper distance from the road than in whether they offend against good taste.  I have seen many buildings that have been allowed to go up in which there is no norm in respect of good taste.</P>
      <P>The Minister might consider the suggestion of Senator Stanford and perhaps set up a committee&mdash;not necessarily all civil servants&mdash;to which such matters could be referred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCole" hpid="Mr. Cole Mr. Cole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cole</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not quite catch the last sentence of the Minister's statement in which he mentioned the <Col N="909" /> annual cost of Johnstown Castle. What I should like to know is: how much of the expenses of running Johnstown Castle will come out of the funds of the Institute?  Up to this, the Department have been paying the whole of the expenses of the Castle and the College.  Are some of the expenses to be passed on now to the funds of the Institute?  The American grant is possibly a large one in one way but in another way it is, perhaps, a small one because of all it is to cover and, if additional expenses are to be undertaken in connection with Johnstown Castle which were previously undertaken out of the normal annual sums from the Department, it will reduce the final sum remaining for purely agricultural research, which is the purpose on which the money is supposed to be used.  Will there be expenses in connection with Johnstown Castle that normally should be, and would have been, borne by the Department?  Are we to eat into research funds for the purpose of keeping up this estate?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support Senator Stanford.  I think it is a most noteworthy development and marks a milestone in our history if we are to have regard to aesthetic principles in a matter of this sort.  I suggest the Minister should ask the Arts Council to advise him as to how that control should be exercised in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of the transfer of staff and the treatment of staff on transfer is not left with me because it did not seem to be a matter that should be dealt with in this Bill. The measure provides for the transfer of the college itself, but I think I can assure the Seanad that in the event of the transfer of established or unestablished people, their interests and their rights will fully be protected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As for the point raised by Senator Stanford and others regarding section 6, this section was suggested by the owner.  I do not know what sort of machinery one could devise to meet the points raised, but here is what I have in mind.  When we decided to transfer this college to the Institute, we found that the Act of 1945, subject to amendment of the law, would not <Col N="910" /> permit us to do so without the consent of the donor.  The term &ldquo;agricultural college&rdquo; was used and the building was about to be transferred to the Institute for another purpose.</P>
    <P>My idea is that if some architect employed by the Institute should be asked to devise plans to erect a building or make any alterations, he will be obliged to make himself conversant with the provisions of the act of transfer. Just as we consulted the Attorney General when confronted with this legal problem, so, too, will those who come after us consult as to what they are entitled to do.</P>
    <P>The architect employed by the Institute being fully aware of the limitations imposed on him by the section, who then will adjudicate and say: &ldquo;I do not agree with your view that the building you have designed and the alterations you propose to make are not detrimental to the purpose for which this section was inserted&rdquo;? I cannot see how that difficulty can be overcome, but I can see that the individual employed to prepare plans and make the design, being conscious of the limitations, would do his best to meet the requirements of Section 6.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>But it might not be just good enough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Even if you were to establish a committee of architects to prepare plans and another committee to adjudicate as to whether the plans so prepared were in conformity with the desires of the donor, it would not be easy to get agreement; but I am sure that, one way or the other, agreement will be found, and those who have the responsibility of interpreting this section will be as careful as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Ó Donnabháin asked me a question about the other institutions.  It is no harm to say we have transferred the farm at Grange; we have transferred Glenamoy; and we have transferred the station at Derrybrennan. Now we are proposing to transfer Johnstown Castle.  As far as Thorndale is concerned, we propose to establish <Col N="911" /> there a pig progeny testing station &mdash;the second in the country.</P>
    <P>In regard to the question asked by Senator Cole, I shall read the relevant part of my speech, which is as follows:</P>
    <P>It is of course the intention that Johnstown Castle, with all its stock, equipment and buildings, shall be transferred absolutely free to the Institute.  Other stations I have mentioned have also been transferred without charge.  In accordance with the terms of the Counterpart Agreement with the United States Government on the setting up of An Foras Talúntais, the annual grant to the Institute will include the money for the maintenance of the services transferred.</P>
    <P>As I understand that, the grant we make in the future to the Institute from the State funds will not be less than the grant which has been made to it in the past.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCole" hpid="Mr. Cole Mr. Cole">

      <NameTxt>Professor Stanford</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to give the Minister any trouble about this section.  It is an excellent Bill and we want it to go through quickly, but it seems to me that, though this section has been introduced rather reluctantly, it is a very good section.  We may have sections of this kind in future Bills and I suggest the Minister and his colleagues should think ahead along these lines.  It will not be quite satisfactory simply to say that the Institute's architect will think out a good design and that will be that.  There are pretty deep aesthetic problems involved in this, and it is very much for the good of the country that they should seriously and fully be faced. I would remind the Minister and the Government that in the original Government of this country, we had a Minister for Fine Arts.  I wonder if the time is not coming round when we need a Minister for Fine Arts again. At any rate, I should like to commend the Minister on having this section put in, however reluctantly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to take the same line as Senator Stanford.  In other countries, committees are set up to deal with matters of this kind and it is not left to the opinion of one architect. Senator Barry made an admirable suggestion when he said that these matters should be referred to the Arts Council for decision.  With all the wars of words and otherwise fought in this country, too few of these buildings remain.  The Minister ought seriously consider this type of section in other measures.  The fact that he has introduced this section, as a safeguard, into this measure shows the direction in which the mind of the Government is moving.  However, I think the approach needs a more mature development to reach the stage it has reached in many Continental countries.</P>

      <P>Senator Stanford so suggested.  I shall not argue about it. As far as I am concerned, there is no reluctance.  When the institution is transferred from the Department of Agriculture to the Agricultural Institute, the Institute will then have the responsibilities laid down in the provisions of this Bill.  They have a council; they have a chairman and a director.  This will be their guide.  I do not know what steps they will take. I do not know whether they will consult the Arts Council.  I do not know what else they may decide to do should the occasion arise in which they might be about to embark on something which might contravene or encroach upon the provisions of this section.  I do not think it is for me to say what their approach should be.  I am sure the council of the Institute will be very careful, either in its present form and as it will be constituted in future, to give full expression to what is contained in this section in everything they may do.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Stanford</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quite satisfied with what the Minister has said.  I do not want to press it, but, on the matter of reluctance, if the Minister will read what he said when the Official Report issues, the reason he gave for inserting this clause was that it was necessary on account of existing legislation.  He did not say he was delighted to point to Section 6. On the contrary, most of us, I think, detected a certain note of reluctance. I commend him for the section and I hope the Government will think along these lines in future legislation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickFirmullaghOReilly" hpid="Mr. O'Reilly Mr. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the intention of the section is to implement the desire of the donors of Johnstown Castle to ensure symmetry and harmony in any future building <Col N="914" /> development there.  This Bill is somewhat dear to my heart because the original Bill was the first Bill dealt with by the Seanad after I became a member many years ago.  Because of that, I have a certain kindly interest in the matter.  I see Senator Stanford's point.  Possibly the ghost of the Vico Road still haunts him.  I think Senator Stanford will agree that it would be very hard for a Minister to put all the necessary safeguards into a provision that would be workable.</P>
      <P>Even if a committee of architects were set up under this Bill to adjudicate, one could not guarantee that there would not be a row.  People's views and tastes change, even in architecture.  I think I am historically correct in saying that when a certain Queen of France was being crowned in Cologne Cathedral, one of the outstanding Gothic cathedrals in the world, the cathedral was enshrouded in tapestries in order to please the architectural fashion of the time. Gothic was out of fashion.  A committee of experts might be, shall we say, futuristic and they might recommend a building, very fine in its own way, but completely out of harmony. I think it is better to leave the section. If a row flares up, as it did in the case of the Vico Road, public opinion can be left to deal with it.  I think that is the best way.</P>

      <P>It is no part of my function to defend the Minister or his Government, but I detected no note of reluctance in the Minister's speech with regard to Section 6.  The real difficulty about Section 6 is one which recurs constantly in legislation. We are legislating for everything in accordance with modern fashion. Here, we are legislating about aesthetic matters.  It is very difficult to improve people's taste by legislation, or even to ensure that in future people will have taste.  I am inclined to agree entirely with the Minister: one <Col N="915" /> cannot do anything with the section beyond leaving it exactly as it is.  One cannot have, so to speak, a proliferation of taste and arrangements for seeing that in future people will act in accordance with this statute.  So, in this instance, as the Attorney General would say &ldquo;not further or otherwise&rdquo;, I am entirely with the Minister.</P>

    <Title>Shannon Free Airport Development Company Limited Bill, 1959&mdash;Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. Childers) Erskine Hamilton Childers">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>The main purpose of this Bill is to provide the Shannon Free Airport Development Company Limited with the necessary financial resources to enable it to carry on its functions which are the encouragement of transit traffic at the Airport, the development of tourist attractions at and in the vicinity of the Airport and the promotion of freight traffic at the Airport, including, if necessary, the provision of handling services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill provides for the supply of capital for the company by the Minister for Finance for the purpose of constructing factory premises for renting, <Col N="916" /> including factory space in advance of demand.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides also that funds will be made available to the company by way of annual grant-in-aid to cover administrative expenses and to make non-repayable grants for the purpose of encouraging and facilitating the establishment of business at the Airport. Such grants may be made towards the cost of machinery and equipment and the training of workers and in suitable cases towards the cost of construction of premises.</P>
    <P>Pending the enactment of this measure, the company's capital requirements up to a limit of £200,000 have been met out of State-guaranteed borrowings. This House approved, in March of this year, an Order adding the name of the company to the Schedule to the State Guarantees Act, 1954, thus enabling the Minister for Finance to guarantee, as to principal and interest, any moneys borrowed by the company within the limit specified. The Minister for Industry and Commerce informed the House at that time that it was considered important to provide the company with access to funds in order that the urgent work of development would not be held up and that legislation to regularise the financial affairs of the company would be introduced.  The capital to be subscribed under the Bill will be applied, in the first place, towards the repayment of borrowed moneys and thereafter to investment in projects, such as factory buildings, which are expected to yield long-term benefits in the form of increased traffic and employment at the airport.</P>
    <P>The Development Company are rightly placing great emphasis on the importance of industrial activity at Shannon.  The development of industry will have a two-fold effect.  Firstly, it will ensure the maintenance and extension of employment in the area and, secondly, it will provide new and substantial freight traffic in the volume of goods, both raw materials and finished articles, shipped into and out of the industrial estate.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that in Shannon Airport industrialists have a unique opportunity for developing profitable <Col N="917" /> businesses.  Apart from the availability on the spot of regular air transport services, the airport offers a range of attractions and inducements that would be difficult to surpass.  The industrial area is customs-free.  There is provision for the complete exemption from income tax and corporation profits tax for a period of 25 years on profits derived from exports.  The exemption from taxation can also apply to businesses engaged in distribution abroad and the provision of services.  The company has already constructed some factory buildings of a standard design for leasing to suitable industrial promoters and it is prepared to contribute towards the cost of factories to individual specification. One manufacturing and one distributing firm have already commenced operations.  Four other projects which are in an advanced stage of negotiation are expected to afford employment initially to about 145 persons increasing to 500 over a period of three years.  The House will understand that, at the present stage of negotiation, I cannot give greater detail in regard to these proposals.</P>
    <P>In the examination of industrial proposals for the airport there is no overlapping of functions between the Development Company and An Foras Tionscal.  In the processing of proposals for industries at the airport the services of the Industrial Development Authority are utilised in precisely the same way as for an industrial proposal for another part of the country to be assisted by An Foras Tionscal; and the Industrial Development Authority advises me on the desirability or otherwise of granting a licence to manufacture in each case.</P>
    <P>I have dwelt at some length on the company's activities in the industrial sphere, because of the obvious importance of these activities for the future of Shannon.  The company is also giving special attention to other ways and means of maintaining the level of activity at the airport.  The company aims to secure for Shannon the biggest possible share of the increased passenger and freight traffic <Col N="918" /> which jet aircraft will generate.  The company realises, of course, that the operational demand for landings at Shannon will diminish with the progressive improvements in aircraft design and performance and that future operations at the Airport will be increasingly dependent on traffic requirements.  In the course of a publicity campaign, undertaken in conjunction with Bord Fáilte Éireann and the Irish air companies, the company has been particularly anxious to focus attention on the duty-free shopping facilities and on the attractions of the South and West of Ireland as tourist centres.  This promotional effort is being directed in particular towards the lucrative North American tourist traffic and special emphasis is laid on the merits of short, inclusive coach-tours originating at the Airport. The company has also realised the advantages in having conventions and congresses take place at the Airport and there are prospects that a considerable measure of success will attend their efforts to bring about development along these lines.</P>
    <P>The importance of freight traffic to Shannon Airport cannot be sufficiently stressed.  I have already adverted to the expectations of the Development Company in regard to the generation of air freight through the establishment of industrial activity.  To assist air freight transport operators and to encourage the practice of breaking-down and consolidating air cargo at Shannon a special freight terminal with cargo handling facilities is to be erected at the Airport.</P>
    <P>Over the past 12 months, this House has on a number of occasions signified its approval of the measures being adopted to preserve Shannon Airport as the national asset that it is to-day. The Government are determined to do everything possible to maintain and develop Shannon as a major transatlantic airport and they hope that their aims can be realised through the Development Company.  The company has a difficult and onerous task ahead of it and I now ask the House to express its confidence in its efforts by giving this Bill a Second Reading.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>From any remarks I have made on other Bills which the Minister brought before the House, he will have no reason to believe that if I make a few critical remarks about this Bill, I have not thought the matter over.  Everybody will agree, in view of the employment situation and the development which has taken place over the past decade, particularly over the past eight years, when the number of people in employment here has declined by almost 100,000, that any effort of any sort which is made to increase employment deserves to be examined in the most favourable way.</P>
      <P>The Minister suggested that at the most this Bill would result in employing over 500 people, at least in the present propositions which he sees developing, and he mentioned 145 as the lowest figure.  That does not agree with what he said in the Dáil, when, under pressure, he admitted that since the start of this project, the total employment there is 30, unless I misread the Dáil debate.  The total employment as the moment is 30.  I do not propose to go through or read out to the House the names of the manufacturing organisations which have been set up. Anybody who read them in the Dáil debate could not but feel that they had no great merits.  I think that is a fair way of putting it.</P>
      <P>I think the Minister has a point in the latter part of his statement where he referred to Shannon Airport and its duty-free shopping facilities.  So long as the Airport continues to be as important as it has been in recent years it deserves to be developed and certainly should show a good return on any investment.  However, up to the present&mdash;I hope it will be otherwise in the future&mdash;the kind of industrial propositions that have been established there do not hold out a great deal of hope for the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like also to enter one other <i>caveat</i> about this Bill.  It relates to the operations of the Minister and his Department.  I understand the Minister and his Department have been&mdash;if I might use the phrase&mdash;butting in in an undesirable way on some of the concerns that have come there, that is to <Col N="920" /> say, trying to dictate to them about the way they should conduct their business. If the Minister wishes to give this concern or project the best chance of success, he will not do it by that kind of interference with concerns in the process of establishing themselves.</P>
    <P>I hope that if there has been such interference&mdash;and I am informed there has been&mdash;the Minister and his Department will have second thoughts amout the matter if they are anxious to establish this kind of business.  I think it is the view of both Houses of the Oireachtas and the system that has been established that we do not interfere in the day-to-day working of State companies for which we provide all the capital.  If that is so the Department and the Minister should be still more careful not to interfere with private enterprise companies that may come to this development area.  Subject to these remarks, as I said at the beginning, I welcome the Bill, but I am doubtful about it as a long-term proposition.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to talk about this from the point of view of what contribution it might make to the national picture of employment. The actual importance of the Airport is so great that anything that can be done to ensure its growth and development must be approved by the House.  Some of the proposals that we have heard for this kind of development seem to me to be fantastically ambitious, if I may put it that way. They even seem to be artificial, a sort of lifting ourselves up by our boot straps.  I hope the scheme comes off.  It is very important for us that the enormous investment the country has made in this Airport should fulfil the promise we all felt it might have.  If it does come off, if these projects are successful, no tribute would be too great to pay to those who conceived this development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I did not gather from the Minister's introductory speech when the figure of 500 employed could reasonably be expected to be reached.  Shannon, as we all know, is now at a point of difficulty and I still think that no matter how successful these schemes <Col N="921" /> of minor industries in the district are, the main drive we should make is towards the people and tourism is obviously the most profitable ground for us in regard to Shannon.  Nothing we do under this development and no activity on behalf of the people who are responsible for whatever success Shannon has attained up to this can compare with what has been done to the Airport in the past two days by its being overflown by international airlines. I wonder did the Government make any approaches to the labour organisations of the country to ensure that where obvious national injury would be done, it should not be done?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill in that when any region is in difficulties, it seems to be a wise move to decentralise as far as possible and allow the region to work out its own salvation.  I presume that is what this company will try to do in Shannon. I hope they achieve the success we all wish them.</P>
      <P>Many of us are somewhat uneasy about some of the new industries that are mooted for Shannon.  Perhaps the newspapers do not carry the full story, but I, for one, for instance, have very grave doubts about one of those industries which I think is already there or on the verge of beginning&mdash; the chinchilla industry.  I should like to know would the Minister be able to give us any assurance in regard to that industry because I think its ultimate development can be nothing better than the multiple system of poultry production.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are assured that these animals are easy to care for and take very little time to grow.  Surely then the future for such an industry can only be in the handling of these in very large lots and it is a question of whether the ultimate reward will be just sufficient to cover set prices, and to meet handling charges.  We may be lured into something unprofitable there and that is being done under the Shannon Development Company. It seems all right at this stage where you are selling breeding animals for very high prices, but in a few years the market must be saturated and the <Col N="922" /> animal will be worth very little more than the value of its pelt.  I should hate to feel that Shannon in its development might be marred by what will eventually be dubious enterprises. I should like some information from the Minister on that point.</P>
    <P>I also hope that in this development of Shannon, where so much emphasis was recently placed by the Minister on the development of air freight, the concessions and facilities given to encourage firms to avail of Shannon for air freight will extend outside the Shannon development area and flow into neighbouring centres such as Galway, Ennis and Tralee and some of the major towns within easy reach of Shannon Airport.  Nationally speaking, it must be equally, if not more advantageous, to us to create additional employment in those centres as compared with creating even the same employment at Shannon itself. In those centres, there are facilities and services and all that is required and, consequently, the housing of additional workers is far less expensive than creating what might be a new industrial town at Shannon.  We cannot envisage the situation continuing where workers will continue to travel 10 or 15 miles to work daily.  If Shannon is developed and factories built around it, other necessary services must follow and eventually what must emerge is a community or town in Shannon or close to it.</P>
    <P>It is mentioned in the Bill that the Minister may grant up to £500,000.  I presume that when these grants have been exhausted, the Minister in accordance with the Bill has to come before the House again to get authority for further grants.  In that case, we shall have an opportunity of reviewing the position of development in the region again.</P>
    <P>Finally, I should like to express the hope that the co-operation between An Foras Tionscal and the new authority will be as fruitful and close as the Minister envisages. It would be too bad if any division should come between the two bodies, due to the fact that An Foras Tionscal is prohibited <Col N="923" /> by law from making any grants to enterprises in the Shannon development area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I should like to deal with Senator O'Donovan's observations.  It is true that there are 30 people employed at the moment in the Shannon Airport area in new industries, that there are two factories under construction and that when they go into production there will be a total of 145 employed in those two factories.  There are two others and it is eventually anticipated that in the four there will be 500 persons employed. There are at least two other industries envisaged for the area in respect of which negotiations have not been completed.  There is also a very large number of inquiries, many of which, I hope, will result in final arrangements for production at the Airport.  Naturally, these negotiations take months to complete.  I do not think we need be alarmed by the fact that, so far, only two are actually in operation.  The effect of the negotiations and of the publicity carried out by the company is cumulative and I think we can have a fair degree of confidence that there will be quite a considerable number of persons employed in the course of the next three or four years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no information about either myself or officers of my Department interfering in the private affairs of the companies considering manufacturing and I am glad to tell Senator O'Donovan that I think he has been misinformed in that matter.  I do not want members of the House to think of the Shannon Free Airport industrial development as something freakish or artificially created.  Grants and loans are made available in a number of countries for industrial development. The concessions offered by the company, it is agreed, are maximum in character, but nevertheless it is the first airport industrial area in the world, as far as I know, and the great advantage of promoting a factory in the area is that goods can be directly placed upon an airliner coming up to the door of the factory, taxiing on the air-strip <Col N="924" /> in front of the building and taking on goods with a single handling.  Goods can be shipped to huge areas of the world by air direct literally from the factory premises.</P>
    <P>Looking at the world of the future, it seems to me that that offers considerable hope in the direction of industrial expansion and that the idea is a good one, a modern idea and something in keeping with modern trends. So that, over and above the tax advantages and concessions, the availability of grants, the fact that goods are being produced within a customs-free area, there is also the advantage of the proximity of the Airport which I think should have some considerable effect on the minds of industrialists looking around at a world in which the tariff system is gradually breaking down and finding it convenient to produce goods suitable for transportation by air in the Shannon Airport area.</P>
    <P>In regard to the industrial dispute that has taken place, I need only say that I understand Deputy Dillon has asked the Taoiseach to make a statement in the Dáil, and the Taoiseach is making a statement on the general position as far as he can.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinlan mentioned the chinchilla industry.  It would be undesirable for me to give any details in regard to the position of any industry here in relation to the future, but the chinchilla industry occupies temporary premises.  I think we can trust the company to deal sympathetically, and certainly realistically, with the operation of that enterprise in so far as its claims upon the company are concerned. I do not think I need say more about that.</P>
    <P>The Government intend that these concessions shall be confined strictly to the Shannon Free Airport area and shall not be extended to other parts of the country where all the grants and other privileges under present Finance Acts and the Undeveloped Areas Act obtain.  They think it is essential to maintain these special concessions for the Shannon Airport area.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinlan asked what would happen, if there is a measure of success and if we see more and more industries being established and a considerable <Col N="925" /> amount of employment given, in regard to the position of workers who have to travel to their work from some distance.  That, of course, will have to be considered by the company.  I need hardly say that if the number of persons being employed were to grow very rapidly, then some sort of arrangement for housing them would have to be considered.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinlan asked whether the Government would go before the Oireachtas to ask for an extension of the grant powers if the £500,000 were issued, and the answer, of course, is &ldquo;yes&rdquo;.  I should be delighted if the whole of the £500,000, which can be given as a direct grant to the company, were used up in a fruitful manner and that I should have to come before the Dáil and Seanad to extend the grant powers under this Bill.</P>
    <P>I thank the Senators for their sympathetic and helpful attitude.  I do hope that everybody will realise that this is a new idea and will not think of the Shannon Airport industrial area as a freakish artificial development but as something which I hope and believe has relation to modern industrial trends and modern freight trends.  It is because we believe in that development that we are doing the utmost we can to assist in the provision of industries in the area.</P>

    <Title>Transport Bill, 1959&mdash;Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. Childers) Erskine Hamilton Childers">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill provides that &mdash;(a) the Minister for Transport and Power, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, may from time to time make a superannuation scheme or schemes for whole-time members of the Board of Coras Iompair Éireann; and (b) Coras Iompair Éireann be authorised to pay Mr. Thaddeus C. Courtney, a former Chairman of the Board, a sum of £3,636 as compensation for the loss sustained by him by reason of his resignation as from 31st <Col N="926" /> August, 1958, on the ground of ill-health, from the office of Chairman of the Board.  Mr. Courtney's period of office was not due to expire until 31st May, 1960.</P>
      <P>The present Chairman of Coras Iompair Éireann&mdash;Dr. C.S. Andrews &mdash;was appointed for a period of five years from the 1st September, 1958. He had previously been whole-time Managing Director of Bord na Móna and had enjoyed the benefit of a superannuation scheme made under Section 5 of the Turf Development Act, 1953.  On resignation from Bord na Móna, he lost the right to superannuation benefit under that body's scheme.  On his appointment as Chairman of Coras Iompair Éireann, it was decided that he should be given credit for superannuation purposes in his new appointment for his prior service with State bodies.</P>
      <P>The Transport Act, 1950 made specific provision for the superannuation of Mr. T.C. Courtney who was then Chairman of Coras Iompair Éireann.  The provisions for the Chairman in this Act were framed to suit the particular circumstances of Mr. Courtney's services.  The Act also provided superannuation benefits for other whole-time members of the Board.  None of these provisions would be appropriate to the position of Dr. Andrews and, accordingly, if they were to be adapted to meet his circumstances, very substantial amendment of the Transport Act would be required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I consider, however, that, instead of such amendment related to the individual needs of particular appointees, it is preferable to provide in this Bill that power be given to enable the Minister for Transport and Power, with the concurrence of the Minister for Finance, to prepare superannuation schemes covering whole-time members, including the Chairman of Coras Iompair Éireann. This method is in line with that adopted in recent legislation in regard to the superannuation of whole-time members of State or semi-State bodies as, for example, in the Turf Development Act, 1953.  This course avoids the necessity for the <Col N="927" /> frequent amendment of Acts of the Oireachtas when there is a change of personnel.</P>
    <P>Any superannuation scheme to be made under the enabling provisions of this Bill will, in accordance with the normal practice and as provided in the Bill, be laid before each House of the Oireachtas for the appropriate period.</P>
    <P>Senators might wish to know for information that the intention is that Dr. Andrews' superannuation terms should be on the broad lines of those for Mr. Courtney, his predecessor, namely a pension of 1/80th of retiring salary for each year of pensionable service with a maximum of half pay, together with a retirement gratuity of 1/30th for each year of pensionable service, subject to a maximum of 1½ years' salary.  It is intended also that, in order to qualify for superannuation, a person must have had not less than 10 years' pensionable service.  The reference to 12 months' service in certain sections of the Bill is that members of the Board who have had at least that period of service have the right to opt out of amending superannuation schemes.  The period of 12 months mentioned is not related to the period of service necessary in order to qualify for pension.</P>
    <P>As mentioned, the superannuation position of Mr. T.C. Courtney as Chairman of Coras Iompair Éireann was specifically provided for in the Second Schedule to the Transport Act, 1950, and on his resignation on the grounds of ill-health, he became entitled to a pension of 1/80th of his yearly salary for each completed year of pensionable service, together with a gratuity of 1/30th of the yearly salary for each completed year of pensionable service, subject to a maximum pension of half his salary and a maximum gratuity of 1½ times that salary.</P>
    <P>On his resignation on 31st August, 1958, Mr. Courtney had not become entitled to maximum superannuation benefits and his resignation before the expiry of his term of office on the 31st May, 1960, meant that he obtained a reduced pension and reduced retirement <Col N="928" /> gratuity.  It also involved him in the loss for the balance of the period of the difference between his pension and his salary as Chairman. It has been calculated that this loss amounts to £3,636 made up as follows:&mdash;</P>

      <P>We are in agreement with this Bill.  It has been explained very clearly by the Minister. It is certainly better to do this rather than amend existing legislation. Superannuation schemes should be drawn up from time to time as they become necessary, particularly as the Bill provides that every such scheme shall be laid before the Oireachtas and may be annulled by resolution of either House.  Generally, the Bill deserves to be supported.  With regard to Mr. Courtney, the provisions are not excessive.  They correspond to provisions obtaining in a great many places and in State employment generally.  We are, therefore, in favour of the Bill.</P>

      <P>I should like to support the Bill.  It speaks for itself and the Minister is to be complimented on the very clear way in which he defended it and the detailed manner in which he dealt with its provisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Two questions occur to me.  One is a general question.  The Minister seemed to imply that this Bill would help to meet the situation where an employee entitled to superannuation benefit in one State body transfers his <Col N="929" /> services to another State body.  It occurred to me to wonder whether it would not be better to have superannuation schemes to cover employees of all the State bodies instead of having individual schemes which are similar in character.  I should like to hear the Minister's opinion as to whether it would make for smoother running, as it were, if there were one single superannuation scheme allowing employees to pass from employment by one body to another, very much as University lecturers or professors in Britain can pass from one body to another and retain superannuation rights in each area of employment.</P>
    <P>The second point has reference to this clause referring to Mr. Courtney. It is always a bit awkward and invidious to refer to specific persons. The gentleman in question is not here and cannot speak for himself, but his name is enshrined in the Bill.  The Minister has given us in great detail &mdash;I think it is right that he should do so from the point of view of the public &mdash;the exact basis for the calculation of this sum of £3,636 which we are being asked to vote as compensation for the loss sustained by Mr. Courtney by reason of his resignation.  Senator Hayes has told us this is common form and takes place in other regions of our economy also.  I am not quite convinced of that.</P>
    <P>It is suggested that Mr. Courtney be given complete compensation for the loss sustained by him by reason of his falling ill in 1958.  I do not think that is the usual practice in relation to civil servants.  I do not think there is the practice, the intention or the wealth on the part of the State to compensate a civil servant who retires owing to ill health before he reaches the normal retiring age.  I am open to correction here, but I do not think it is the practice of the State to compensate him in full and make up in a money grant for all the money he loses by reason of his retiring before he reaches maximum benefit age.</P>
    <P>In another country, across the water, we had the case the other day of a person in a very prominent position in Parliament retiring on grounds of ill <Col N="930" /> health and immediately taking up a job at a salary of £10,000 per year.  I do not know anything at all about the ill-health in question here.  I do not know whether in fact the ill-health has incapacitated this gentleman from further work of any kind, but I am a little hesitant as to the justice of making this very large grant to a person who has been very adequately paid, I think, down the years and who has fallen, as it were, into this accident of ill-health, something which besets all of us, and who is to be compensated in full for the loss sustained.  With respect to Senator Hayes, I would suggest not all of us by any means could hope for the same kind of treatment, even from the State.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DominickMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a Bill to amend the Transport Act of 1950 in relation to the superannuation arrangements of full-time members of the board of C.I.E.  I fully accept the principle that full-time members of the board&mdash;it is only the chairmen who are full-time members &mdash; should have adequate superannuation provisions made for them, if necessary, by an Act of the Oireachtas.  I am, however, somewhat concerned as to the mechanics of this Bill.</P>
      <P>Looking at the position of Mr. Courtney&mdash;and what I am saying is not in any way personal&mdash;we have the situation that we are not, as the Minister said, authorising the board to pay Mr. Courtney £3,000 odd compensation. We are compelling the board of C.I.E. to pay £3,636.  The board of C.I.E. has already been compelled, by the 1950 legislation, to pay Mr. Courtney a pension of £1,700 approximately and a gratuity of, as I calculate, somewhere between £4,000 and £5,000. Now the Oireachtas is asked to compel C.I.E. to pay £3,636.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Remember that I said at the start that I think adequate provision should be made for superannuation arrangements for these people who take on the onerous task of chairman of the public transport undertaking.  The board is being asked to pay this sum now and there will be a lump sum paid to Dr. Andrews when he comes to retire&mdash;I hope that will not be too early because I think he is a very successful Chairman. <Col N="931" /> C.I.E. is being asked to pay this sum and it is not calculated on service in C.I.E. only but on service in C.I.E. and in previous employments.</P>
    <P>As I said, the board is being compelled to pay Mr. Courtney a certain amount, the pension of £1,700, and gratuity of £4,000 or £5,000, and another lump sum of £3,636.  Mr. Courtney was with the board of C.I.E. for ten years.  I think it is quite wrong that that charge should fall on the last employer.  It should be spread out and shared by the previous employers.</P>
    <P>Mr. Courtney had previous service with the Department of Local Government and I think with the Tipperary County Council, and in calculating his pension and lump sum, that previous service is taken into account but the charge is laid solely on C.I.E.  Again apparently the position will be that Dr. Andrews, who had previous service with Bord na Mona, will have that previous service calculated in assessing his annuity and lump sum, which is only right, but the cost will be borne solely by C.I.E.</P>
    <P>In the Dáil, I noticed that Deputy Sweetman pressed the Minister on this point.  Deputy Sweetman apparently was under the impression that there was some arrangement for sharing the cost of superannuation with the previous employers.  I do not think that is correct, according to the terms of the 1950 legislation, and according to the terms of the Bill we are now asked to pass.  I would ask the Minister to look at that aspect of the matter and see if it would not be better, and indeed more equitable, that the cost of the superannuation should be shared and not simply left, by Act of the Oireachtas, on the shoulders of the last employer.  There is a new principle embodied in this Bill also and Senator Hayes was wrong in assuming that this was normal practice in regard to retirement owing to ill-health.</P>

      <P>The Minister is asking the House to agree to this new principle and I fully accept and welcome it.  What is asked here is that Mr. Courtney should be compensated in full for the years he did not serve to complete his period of employment because he had to retire owing to ill-health. We are compelling C.I.E. to pay that sum and I am sure the Minister, having accepted that principle and in asking the Oireachtas to accept it, will agree that in C.I.E. and other similar organisations the same principle should be applied in respect of other full time servants who because of ill-health have to retire before the normal retiring date.  I think it is a good principle and the Minister having asked us to accept it will agree that C.I.E. and other undertakings for which he is responsible should put that principle into operation in respect of other employees.</P>

      <P>Arising from what Senator Murphy said, I should like to ask the Minister this.  Having granted this gratuity for the unexpired period of office, and provided this is a principle the Minister thinks should be followed up, how many years would he think necessary for giving this gratuity in other cases?  Supposing this gentleman had retired after his first year of office with C.I.E., would the Minister approve the principle of allowing the other nine years or five years?  It is, as Senator Murphy said, a principle which might be copied, but if it were to apply to, say, the Civil Service, surely there would have to be a limit. The Minister might get a case where there was a substantial sum involved.</P>

      <P>I welcome this Bill as expressing the Government's appreciation of the services given by Mr. T.C. Courtney because, since his appointment in 1950, he did everything possible for C.I.E.  Unfortunately, C.I.E. is very much maligned at present; it is charged with being inefficient and much worse words are used about it.  The plain fact of the matter is that it cannot pay its way at present, due to the smallness of our population and above all, to our low <Col N="933" /> volume of trade.  An increase in our production and an increase in our exports is what C.I.E. wants and what will show us what our transport system can do.</P>
      <P>I believe that this appreciation of Mr. Courtney may bring us back to realities and may make us stop before it is too late in this policy of dismembering what we hope in the future will be a most useful adjunct&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to thank the House for the way they have received this Bill.  First of all, I shall deal with Senator Sheehy Skeffington's suggestion that there should be one Superannuation Bill to cover all these cases. I believe that is being considered but there are many complications and at the moment it seems essential to have a separate Bill in this case, quite apart from Mr. Courtney's position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Murphy raised the question of which body should pay a pension to a member who leaves its service and joins another board.  The general practice is that this pension is paid by the board of the concern from which the person concerned ultimately retires.  I think the case is arguable but I suppose the commonsense viewpoint is that Bord na Móna, for example, might say: &ldquo;Why should we pay Dr. Andrews' pension unless he stays with us to the end and gives us the full span of his services?&rdquo;  It could equally be argued the other way. The actual practice is that the last board in which the person has been active pays the pension.  That is being <Col N="934" /> done in this case.  I do not know of any other cases where the board agreed to pay pensions.  Sometimes, of course, it might happen that a person appointed as a full-time member of a board might wish, for his own sake, to draw the Civil Service pension to which he was entitled at the time of leaving the service.  In that case, of course, his service would not be counted in the arrangements made for a pension to be payable when he left the board to which he was attached at the end of his career.</P>
    <P>The State is giving a subsidy of over £1 million to C.I.E. so that the award of this pension will not be too onerous a burden.  So far as Mr. Courtney himself is concerned, I should say that the reason for including for him the sum set out in the Bill relates solely to his particular case and creates no precedent here for any other member of the board or for the member of any other board set up by the State.  The Transport Act of 1958 has conferred upon whoever is chairman an enormous responsibility, the responsibility of ending the enormous deficits of C.I.E. within a period of five years and of overhauling the whole of the organisation and of administering on a new basis practically the whole of the transport services.</P>
    <P>The Government felt that, as Mr. Courtney had recently reached the normal term of his office and knowing that he had been ill on a number of occasions and had been compelled to absent himself from the office, under the circumstances it would be right once he retired on grounds of ill-health, that he should be paid the sum laid down by the Bill.  I do not think I should say any more.  As I have indicated already, this matter is being presented to the Seanad on its own merits.  I think I need not say anything further than that.</P>

      <P>Might I ask some questions arising out of the Minister's reply?  I wonder if he would consider amending Section 3 on Committee Stage so that if Mr. Courtney's health recovered sufficiently to enable him to accept other remunerative employment, there would <Col N="935" /> be some modification?  The second point is a development of the Minister's last statement.  He asked the House to accept this as a case that will not create a precedent.  I did not quite understand how he explained the unique character of this situation.  I do not know in what way he meant us to regard this particular very valuable service as being unique?</P>
      <P>The third question I should like to ask is whether the Minister would in fact consider adopting this principle for bus drivers and bus conductors who, through ill-health, are forced to retire before they reach the maximum pension age?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. J. Lynch)</NameTxt>
      <P>The general <Col N="937" /> purpose of the Bill is to replace the Apprenticeship Act, 1931, with a measure which is designed to make better provision for the recruitment and training of apprentices.</P>
      <P>The successful operation of any law dealing with apprenticeship depends to a large extent on the wholehearted cooperation of the parties mainly concerned&mdash;the employers and workers.  It is, therefore, a source of satisfaction for me to be able to inform the Seanad that the Bill is, in large measure, an agreed one, After the Second Stage of the Bill had been passed by Dáil Éireann, a Joint Committee composed of representatives of workers' and employers' organisations examined the Bill in detail and made a number of agreed recommendations for amendments.  Almost all of these recommendations were accepted and appropriate amendments were passed during the Committee and Report Stages in Dáil Éireann.</P>
      <P>Consequently, the Bill now before this House represents, as far as possible, the united views of Government, employers and workers as to the best type of Bill to deal with this problem of apprenticeship.  This is a most gratifying situation which reflects considerable credit on the representatives who participated so diligently in the work of the Joint Committee. It is, I hope, a happy augury of future cooperation when the Bill has been enacted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think that anyone will quarrel with the general aim of this Bill which is to provide a system of apprenticeship designed to ensure that sufficient numbers of suitable young persons are given an opportunity of entering the skilled trades; that they receive thorough training on the job and in the technical schools; and that their proficiency in the trade will be tested before they are certified as fully qualified craftsmen.  We all know the existing apprenticeship schemes in some trades are fairly satisfactory.  But this is not true of all, or even most, of our craft trades.  The broad picture is that the recruiting and training of apprentices is dealt with either <Col N="938" /> haphazardly or in a way that is prejudicial to the long-term interests of the trades themselves and of the community as a whole.</P>
    <P>The Commission on Youth Unemployment examined this question some years ago and recommended that fresh legislation should be prepared to replace the 1931 Apprenticeship Act. That Act was based entirely on the principle of voluntary cooperation and no trade was brought within its scope except with the agreement of the trade itself.  The results were disappointing. Only four trades&mdash;furniture making, house-painting and decorating, hairdressing and brush and broom making &mdash;agreed to the establishment of statutory apprenticeship schemes under the Act.  The Youth Unemployment Commission recommended the establishment of a national apprenticeship authority, the setting up of statutory apprenticeship schemes for more trades, and the provision of more effective measures for the training, instruction and testing of apprentices. These recommendations are incorporated in the Bill now before the House.</P>
    <P>It might be of assistance to Senators if I were to outline briefly the main provisions of the Bill.  It is intended to apply mainly to the craft trades. Agriculture, dairying and horticulture, as well as professional and clerical occupations, are not included within the scope of the Bill.  I think it will be accepted that it would be neither appropriate nor practicable to apply the types of apprenticeship schemes envisaged in the Bill to any of these occupations.</P>
    <P>The outstanding feature of the Bill is the proposal to place the regulation of apprenticeship schemes in the hands of a central organisation to be known as An Cheard Chomhairle.  An Chomhairle will be under the direction of a full time officer, the Director of Apprenticeship, who will be in a position vigorously to promote the principles and practice of sound apprenticeship.  The ordinary members of An Chomhairle, of whom there will be thirteen, will serve in a voluntary part-time capacity.  They will be representative of employers, workers and educational interests.  The educational <Col N="939" /> members will act in an advisory capacity.</P>
    <P>The provisions of the Bill will not be applied automatically to all trades in which formal apprenticeship is the method by which future skilled workers are trained.  An Chomhairle will have power to carry out an examination of the methods used in any trade for the recruitment and training of apprentices.  Trades which operate satisfactory schemes will not be interfered with by An Chomhairle.  Other trades will have an opportunity, in consultation with An Chomhairle, of putting their own houses in order and any trade which does so will be left outside the scope of the Bill.</P>
    <P>It is my earnest hope that many trades will avail of this opportunity, because I am satisfied that the best apprenticeship schemes are those evolved as a result of close cooperation between responsible workers' and employers' organisations which recognise their duty to the community as a whole as well as to their own trades.  We must, however, provide for the eventuality that certain trades may not be willing or able to remedy defects in their existing apprenticeship arrangements, and An Chomhairle is, therefore, empowered to designate a trade and bring the apprenticeship arrangements in that trade under statutory control where they find such action necessary.</P>
    <P>There is, however, a provision enabling An Chomhairle to exclude from certain requirements of the Bill satisfactory schemes operated by individual employers or groups of employers within the designated trade. There is also provision for exemptions from rules to avoid hardship in individual cases.</P>
    <P>Where a trade has been designated, An Chomhairle will set up an apprenticeship committee or, where necessary, a number of committees to control apprenticeship in that trade.  Apprenticeship committees will, like An Chomhairle, include representatives of employers, workers and educational interests under an independent chairman, and the educational members will act in an advisory capacity.  Where it <Col N="940" /> does not prove possible, for one reason or another, to set up an apprenticeship committee, or where an established committee fails to do its job, An Chomhairle itself will be able to act as, or for, a committee for the particular trade and district involved.</P>
    <P>An Chomhairle will make rules in respect of each designated trade laying down minimum educational qualifications and the minimum age of entry for apprentices, as well as rules regulating the circumstances in which an apprentice may be dismissed.  The apprenticeship committee for the trade will maintain a register of candidates for apprenticeship and no person will be enrolled on the register unless he complies with the age and educational qualifications laid down by An Chomhairle.</P>
    <P>The apprenticeship committee will also make rules about the period of apprenticeship and about the training to be imparted to apprentices by their employers.  If, in the case of any particular trade, An Chomhairle considers it necessary that special advice or assistance should be provided to raise the standard of training, it will appoint supervisors for the purpose. If it is found that an employer is persistently neglecting to train his apprentices properly, arrangements can be made for the transfer of the apprentices to a more conscientious employer.</P>
    <P>There is, furthermore, a provision by which the employment of each apprentice by a particular employer must be approved by the apprenticeship committee.  The committee will, therefore, be in a position to ensure that an employer who has not the appropriate training facilities or who has shown himself to be incapable of imparting the necessary training, will not be permitted to take on apprentices.</P>
    <P>It is intended that, in time, all apprentices will be required to attend courses of instruction in technical schools.  If a boy is to reach a high standard of craftsmanship, attendance at a well defined course of technical instruction must form part of his training.  The technical school cannot, of course, displace the workshop <Col N="941" /> as the principal means of training, but it is an essential adjunct to training on the job.  Where appropriate, employers will be required to allow apprentices time off, without loss of wages, to attend day-time courses of instruction.</P>
    <P>Employers will also be expected to cooperate by making periodic progress reports to the apprenticeship committee on how the training of each apprentice is progressing.  The apprentices themselves will have to keep records of the training they receive and each apprentice will have an opportunity of undergoing proficiency tests, one mid-way through his apprenticeship and the other on the completion of apprenticeship. Apprentices who have completed their training satisfactorily and who have passed the final examination will be given certificates by An Chomhairle. It is not the intention to confine employment in any trade to holders of the certificates, but it is hoped that, in time, possession of this certificate will come to be regarded as the hallmark of a good tradesman.</P>
    <P>An Chomhairle will be empowered to award scholarships and other prizes to apprentices of outstanding merit and to send apprentices abroad to attend competitions and exhibitions.  The expenses of these activities may be met in part by registration fees collected from apprentices.  These fees will be of reasonable amount and there is provision for exemption in cases of hardship. These fees should not, of course, be confused with the rather substantial premiums which were formerly payable by apprentices in some trades.  This practice of collecting premiums can be abused and committees are, therefore, being given the power to prohibit the taking of premiums.</P>
    <P>A common complaint from employers is that they are unable to reap the full benefit of the time and expense which they devote to the training of an apprentice, since the apprentice is free to leave his employer for another employer on the completion of his apprenticeship.  The Bill recognises this problem by providing for the making of direct monetary grants to <Col N="942" /> employers who have trained apprentices in accordance with rules made under the Bill.  An Chomhairle will recommend the trades in which such payments are considered to be appropriate, the emphasis being placed on craft trades which make a positive contribution to national productivity. The amount of the grants will be subject to the consent of the Ministers for Industry and Commerce and Finance; it is not proposed that they should be paid in respect of apprentices in State or semi-State organisations.</P>
    <P>The question of the intake of apprentices is one which causes difficulty in many trades.  There have been complaints that in some trades, the trade unions place undue restrictions on the number of apprentices entering the trades each year, thereby creating an acute and artificial shortage of skilled operatives.  On the other hand, it is often argued on behalf of the trade unions that they must protect the interests of their members by ensuring that the intake of apprentices is such as will not lead to the employment of apprentices as a source of cheap labour or result in the deliberate creation of a pool of unemployed craftsmen.  It will be the task of An Chomhairle and the apprenticeship committees to examine closely the arrangements in each trade and to strike a fair balance in each case.</P>
    <P>The number of apprentices to be taken on in a designated trade within a particular district in any period will be determined by an apprenticeship committee, after consultation with An Chomhairle, and the committee will have power to require a particular employer to take on apprentices where it is satisfied that that employer has adequate training facilities and is failing without adequate cause to bear his share of the responsibility for training entrants to the trade.</P>
    <P>It is not proposed to re-enact in this Bill the provisions of the 1931 Act which enabled apprenticeship committees to regulate the wages and conditions of employment of apprentices. These questions are, in my <Col N="943" /> opinion, more appropriate for settlement by direct negotiation between employers and workers or their organisations, with the assistance of the Labour Court, where necessary.  I should mention here that there is provision for the reconstitution under the new Bill of the apprenticeship committees relating to the four trades which were designated under the 1931 Act; when these committees have been reconstituted the 1931 Act will be repealed.</P>
    <P>All rules made by apprenticeship committees will have to be confirmed by An Chomhairle before they attain the force of law.  The Bill provides for inspection and enforcement by authorised officers, and for penalties for persons found guilty of breaches of the statutory rules.  It will also be an offence for a person to prevent or obstruct an employer from complying with the rules.</P>
    <P>The salary of the Chairman and of the staff of An Chomhairle will be borne on the Vote for the Department of Industry and Commerce.  Other expenses will be met out of an annual grant to An Chomhairle.  It is difficult to give at this stage any precise indication of the probable total cost of administering the Bill.  In the first year or two, the cost might be of the order of £6,000 or £7,000, but according as An Chomhairle expands its activities the cost will naturally rise, particularly on account of the grants which it is proposed to make to employers who satisfactorily train their apprentices.  The annual cost may eventually reach about £50,000 a year.</P>
    <P>This, I think, summarises the main provisions of the Bill.  The need to raise the level of efficiency and output in industry is well recognised to-day. In this highly competitive age, there is no place for the shoddy, poorly-finished product and if we are to make progress in winning essential overseas markets, the goods we produce must be well made and capable of being marketed at competitive prices.  The provision of proper training facilities for young persons is an important prerequisite for the attainment of the <Col N="944" /> standard of skill and efficiency at which we must aim.</P>
    <P>This Bill is intended to provide the machinery to enable such training facilities to be made available.  The successful operation of that machinery will depend on the voluntary co-operation of employers and workers as well as educational interests.  The manner in which these interests have cooperated in the framing of the Bill leads me to believe that there is every expectation of continued cooperation in the administration of the measure and that a very substantial contribution will thus be made towards the establishment of sound apprenticeship schemes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGuire</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has given us a very detailed statement on the provisions of this Bill and as can be seen from what he has told us, the subject has been pretty well covered. The main reason for that is that the Bill has been drawn up, as he said, in co-operation with the employers and the workers concerned with its working.  Therefore, they have been able to bring to his notice, and get into the Bill, most of the problems associated with apprenticeship.  Therefore, I think it would be rather superfluous in this House to go too deeply into all the considerations appertaining to apprenticeship because the debate has already been carried out between the employers and the workers, the people who know most about this matter, and the Minister and the Government, so that all we can do is merely to comment on what they have said and what they propose should be done.</P>
      <P>I welcome the feature of this Bill, that consultation was entered into with the people who know all about the matter under discussion and with the people who will be required to carry out the provisions of the Act, namely, the employers and the workers.  The Minister himself paid tribute to the co-operation which he received from these two groups and I should like to say that the Minister and the Government are to be complimented for taking this enlightened action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="945" /> The necessity has been felt for a very long time for some regularising of the situation in connection with apprentices and for an orderly method of dealing with apprenticeship and bringing it under control and seeing that apprentices were properly trained and properly treated.  For a long time, Governments found it difficult to get the employers and the trade unions to come together on the subject. Eventually, the Minister took the bull by the horns and introduced the Bill and immediately everybody sprang to his feet and paid attention to it.  In an enlightened way the Minister then said, after the Second Reading: &ldquo;Get on with the matter yourselves and tell me what you would like me to do.&rdquo;  That was what happened and as a result of this action, the joint groups produced a report to the Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>
    <P>I have their report here and having looked at it, I can say that they have done a very good job.  They got down to the examination of the subject very seriously and with the full intention of producing something practicable and something that was in agreement. Many of the recommendations were joint recommendations and the Minister, I understand, has introduced if not all, practically all, of the recommendations as amendments to the Bill. Naturally, there were some recommendations made by the employers and some made by the workers which were not put into the Bill; naturally the employers and the workers were not fully satisfied; but I think it would be impossible to satisfy everybody in a case like this.</P>
    <P>As the Minister said, the Bill is a great improvement, and is welcomed as such, on the 1931 Act, but it is felt, and I think it is only realistic to say, that it is not a perfect Bill.  No Bill is perfect but it is a great improvement and perhaps, in operation, it will be found that some of the recommendations made by the employers and some of the recommendations made by the workers which were not put into the Bill and which are still on record in the Department of Industry and Commerce, may be <Col N="946" /> found desirable and may be introduced into some future amending legislation.</P>
    <P>I think I am expressing a general wish when I say I am sure it is very much hoped that under this Bill, when enacted, a solution will be found for the present unsatisfactory methods of recruiting apprentices in certain trades, both as regards numbers admitted and the kind of people admitted.  We are all aware of the limitation on certain people for admission as apprentices in certain trades and where tradesmen's sons only are allowed to become apprentices. There have been grave restrictive practices in this matter in the past and the result has been the denial of skilled craftsmanship to large numbers of our citizens, with the result that it may be, and always is, argued that there are not enough craftsmen.  I know there is the other side of the argument about apprentices sometimes used as cheap labour, but, purely on the question of craftsmanship, we can do with a great many more craftsmen.</P>
    <P>Even facing the actual position here, we have a large degree of emigration and while we deplore that, we must recognise it and it is very unfair to large numbers of our young men and women who have to leave the country without any skilled knowledge.  They find themselves in England or in other countries as unskilled people and are looked upon as hewers of wood and drawers of water.  From the point of view of national dignity, that is very unsatisfactory because we are regarded only as slaveworkers.  We may be well paid but nevertheless we are workers without skilled training.</P>
    <P>Under this new legislation, I hope that position will be very much changed and that a much more enlightened approach will be made to this matter of training the young people in skilled trades and making craftsmen and craftswomen out of them.  There are further extensions of this question.  I gather that there are certain men who learned their trade in the Army and other places and who are not recognised by certain groups at present as skilled craftsmen.  I do not want to go into all the details of the proposals in this Bill.  I know it is <Col N="947" /> very much welcomed all round; it is a great improvement on the existing situation in our industrial and commercial life.  I believe the results of this Bill will be far reaching in the future in giving us more efficiency and ultimately more employment of a higher quality leading to better products and industrial goods and services of all kinds.  Eventually, that will pay off in making us prosperous.</P>
    <P>Finally, this seems to me to be a Bill that might very appropriately have been introduced in the Seanad.  The Seanad will discuss this subject on another day but many of us feel that the Seanad is not being used to the full at present, that we merely come here in a very secondary capacity, whereas we could be utilised to perform a very useful service, if legislation were introduced in this House. That would lighten the work and the agenda in the Dáil and prevent the congestion that we continue to get at present.  This Bill might appropriately have been introduced in the Seanad.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support almost everything, I think, that Senator McGuire has said and certainly the main trend of his remarks. There is no doubt in my mind that the intention of this Bill is excellent and I am prepared to believe that the results it will produce will be good. I am not quite sure&mdash;although open to correction on this&mdash;that the Bill is not unnecessarily cumbersome.  Some of the provisions seem to me to be rather too detailed regarding the way in which the council will carry on its business, the way it will vote, and how it shall act when it first meets.  It seems to me that a good deal of that might, perhaps, be left to the council itself rather than be prescribed in such detailed form.  These are only matters of detail and I think the aim of the Bill is excellent.  If I am interpreting it correctly, it represents a desire to provide access by apprentices to a number of trades on ability rather than by any other test.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As mentioned by Senator McGuire and as hinted by the Minister, it has been the practice of the craft unions to <Col N="948" /> keep apprenticeship within a very narrow circle and the history of trade unionism in this country shows that the craft unions and their members have tended to a greater or lesser extent to seek that they should be regarded as aristocrats of labour.  That is understandable because it is based on the class structure of the State in which they exist and have their being.  They were evolved and did evolve in a class rule economy and of course you have the parallel on the other side among the employers, people desiring to restrict access to their trade&mdash;as appeared in the case of the garage proprietors not so very long ago&mdash;to very narrow limits.  This tendency is not to be found merely among the craft unions; it is also to be found among certain associations of employers.  In both cases, I think it is to be condemned by the public and the ordinary citizens.  I would subscribe to the much better and more liberal conception of a trade union in which access to the union was free and in which there was no restrictive screening before one got one's union card.</P>
    <P>I do not believe, for instance, that trade unionism can in fact flourish to the benefit of the whole of the crafts if it is based on an exclusive caste system which I am afraid is encouraged at the moment by certain craft unions, although I must say that among their officials and members there are many people who are far from satisfied with it.  During the war, it was found possible for a skilled craftsman in one or other of the crafts who was unable to get a union card here because he was not admitted to the trade union to go to England and work as a carpenter or plasterer there and to get his cards there in an English union. He could then come back with his cards and, because he had those cards, he could be recognised here by the equivalent union or by the Irish branch of the same union.  That seems an odd situation because, clearly, the man's skill was sufficient but he had to go outside the country to prove it before he would be accepted here.</P>
    <P>I remember one example among many which I might mention.  I was approached for the purpose of getting <Col N="949" /> a boy of about 16 accepted into apprenticeship in one of those trades&mdash;as a carpenter, in fact.  This was a most intelligent boy who was already working for a builder.  In fact, he was being employed as an assistant to a charge hand and was attending night classes in carpentry.  He was clearly intellectually and physically eligible and certainly from the point of view of physical skill, he was eminently suitable for training as a carpenter. When he applied, he was asked if his father was a carpenter or if by chance his uncle was a carpenter.  When he answered both questions in the negative, he was rejected.</P>
    <P>I took up the matter and approached the trade union officials who were most sympathetic but the reply was regrettably in the negative.  They showed the greatest sympathy, otherwise. That was a case of a boy who was quite willing to go into the union as an apprentice in this particular union and because he had not the basic qualifications, a father or an uncle a carpenter, this boy with all his ability was not even admitted to the union.  It is quite clear that this is bad for all of us, bad for the trade unions, for the community and for the workers and bad for these boys who might perhaps be far better fitted to become plasterers, bakers or carpenters than the sons and nephews of such tradesmen.</P>
    <P>I can understand&mdash;and I think we should try to understand&mdash;this desire on the part of such a union.  It is not a thing that we should merely condemn without trying to understand &mdash;the desire to keep the supply of trade workers within certain limits.  I can understand the desire on the part of such a union to keep the supply of trained workers within certain limits, because that is one way to prevent that trade or class of craftsman from being exploited.  It is, in fact, a restriction of supplies.  I can understand, within the profit system of economy which we operate, the desire on the part of such a union to keep the supply of this skilled labour within reasonable limits, but where I would join issue is on the point of what tests should you apply for admission to the trade.  I think we all ought to agree that the test should <Col N="950" /> be ability and nothing else&mdash;ability and personal capacity and not relationship to a previous member of the trade.</P>
    <P>I should like to say something about one or two details in the Bill, while welcoming the general intention of the Bill.  I notice, for instance, in Section 10, subsection (4), that it is stated &ldquo;The Minister may at any time remove the chairman of An Chomhairle from office.&rdquo;  That seems to me to be rather arbitrary.  There is no question of an effort to consult with anybody, no question of appeal and no question of his having to state reasons. Bang!&mdash;he can just chuck a man out of office.  That is that&mdash;full stop.  It has the merit of being a short, concise subsection, but I think its implications are rather alarming.  That requires some kind of amendment.  There should be some onus on the Minister to make some kind of explanation to somebody.  On the whole I think he might be required to take somebody's advice before he does this.  I should like to feel that the chairman would not be quite so open to immediate dismissal without reason.  I feel possibly his actions would be less circumscribed if he were given just a little more latitude.</P>
    <P>The same applies in Section 11, subsection (7), to any ordinary member: &ldquo;The Minister may at any time remove an ordinary member of An Chomhairle from office.&rdquo;  We all agree, I think, in general principle that the Minister will be guided by the best motives and so on and that he will not abuse this power, but we are also agreed we should not give a power to the Minister on the ground that, although the power is excessive, we are confident he will not abuse it.  I think it is better to give him just such power as we feel happy to see him exercise.</P>
    <P>In this same section, Section 11, I notice a phrase which occurs many times.  It occurs first in subsection (1): &ldquo;Of the ordinary members of An Chomhairle, five shall be workers' members, five shall be employers' members and three shall be educational members.&rdquo;  I am a bit hesitant about this phrase &ldquo;educational members.&rdquo; Some members of the Comhairle will <Col N="951" /> be highly educational but I am a little bit unhappy as to what is meant.  I think it is a bad phrase, in other words, and I should like a better phrase, which I find, in fact, in subsection (4).  &ldquo;The Minister shall, after consultation with the Minister for Education, appoint three persons whom he considers to be representative of educational interests...&rdquo;.  It might be possible to condense that a little further, but I am not happy that the condensation into the two words &ldquo;educational members&rdquo;. is a good one.  I would prefer even a lengthier phrase, if necessary, or else some further definition of what is meant by &ldquo;educational members&rdquo;. The same phrase occurs in subsection (3) of Section 12.</P>
    <P>In section 13, an odd provision in relation to the so-called &ldquo;educational members&rdquo; is found in subsection (6), which provides that they shall not have a vote.  I am a little surprised by that. Why not?  I think the workers' representatives and employers' representatives on An Chomhairle ought to be able to get together with the representatives of educational interests and agree on a policy, agree on rules and so on and, if necessary, take a vote.  We are dealing with adult people.  What is the fear implied in not allowing the representatives of educational interests to have a vote? &ldquo;An educational member of An Chomhairle ... shall not ... have a vote.&rdquo;  I think they will look rather silly on this committee.  Their advice may or may not be listened to and may or may not be adopted, but they will have no say except a verbal one. They will have no vote at all.</P>
    <P>Similarly, subsection (7) of Section 13 reads very oddly, I think.  It states:</P>
    <P>If, at any meeting of An Chomhairle, the group of workers' members does not equal in number the group of employers' members present&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  whichever of the said groups is in the majority may arrange that any one or more of its number shall refrain from voting so as to preserve equality.</P>
    <P>I feel that is an extraordinary provision to have in an Act.  I think you could <Col N="952" /> get very inefficient work in such circumstances.  I should be inclined not to give such power but to constrain the members to turn up at the meeting and, if they failed to do so, to take the consequences.  This matter, of course, may be arranged by the chairman saying: &ldquo;We would prefer to leave over the discussion on such and such a thing to another meeting&rdquo;; but I do not feel this is a point to be enshrined in the Act.</P>
    <P>I should like to turn now to Section 25 which refers to the kinds of qualifications that shall be required for entry into particular trades.  I am glad to see that they do not lay it down that one must be the nephew, grandson or son of a member of the trade.  But they do say in subsection (1) of Section 25 that An Chomhairle may make rules regulating educational qualifications. I should like an assurance from the Minister that this means precisely what it says, that what will in fact be asked of the persons will be educational qualifications and, under Section 26, a minimum age, probably a maximum age and nothing else.  I hope there will be no other considerations except the words &ldquo;ability and the right age group&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>There is provision, of course, in Section 27 as to the circumstances in which an apprentice may be dismissed and so on, but I trust that there is no question as to this being aimed to provide access to the trade for everybody with the ability or apparently with the ability to be able to benefit from it.</P>
    <P>I should like to turn now to Section 48 which provides for scholarships, in these words:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;For the purpose of making available for persons employed by way of apprenticeship in a designated trade better facilities for receiving training and instruction in the trade, An Chomhairle may, if it so thinks fit, grant scholarships to such persons so employed as An Chomhairle selects in such manner as it considers appropriate.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to this.  I should like to welcome it very much because sometimes it is not possible for children of a poor family to contemplate <Col N="953" /> a long apprenticeship where they might not be earning very much unless they are assisted by such a scheme as this.  I think this is excellent; it has the mark of an understanding of the realities of the situation. My hope is that the scholarships will be generous, both in amount and in number, and that the tests will relate to the trade only.  I should not like to feel that the tests for entry into a trade will have anything to do with anything except the trade itself. In other words, I hope there will be no restrictive practices in that regard, either.</P>
    <P>Turning now to Section 61, I notice that subsection (1) says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Where rules under this Act require printed copies of the rules to be posted and kept posted, such copies shall be posted and kept posted&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) in a prominent place in every premises in which persons are employed by way of apprentice in the trade to which the rules relate...</P>
    <P>I notice that although subsection (2) of the section says that &ldquo;a person shall not wilfully pull down, injure or deface any copy of rules posted in pursuance of this section,&rdquo; there are in fact no penalties involved for failing to observe the section. There is a long section subsequently which deals with all kinds of offences but it does not mention offences under Section 61.  So, while the section says that rules shall be posted and kept posted in a prominent place, there is no guarantee under penalty that they will be so posted and kept so posted.</P>
    <P>They might, for instance, be treated like the rules of the Department of Education which, according to regulation, are supposed to be kept suspended conspicuously in every classroom.  We all know, of course, and the Minister better than most of us probably, that the only way in which they are conspicuously suspended is that they are frequently ignored.  One does not see them posted up at all, and there is no sanction involved.  Similarly, here, from his knowledge of the persistent failure to carry out that regulation in <Col N="954" /> connection with another Department over which he presided for some time, to keep posted the regulations of that Department in every classroom, he might perhaps be inclined now to devise some way of ensuring that this section will be respected in fact as well as in the letter.</P>
    <P>The last point I want to refer to in detail arises on Section 62, subsection (10), paragraph (b).  This refers to what persons shall do, and so on.  They will be subject to penalty, and so forth, if they wilfully refuse to answer questions lawfully put to them under the subsection by an authorised officer. There are two points I should like to make there.  It has been found necessary in the past, and I think it is a principle to which the Minister would subscribe, to supply the authorised officer with some mark of his authorisation, some card of identity, something that will mark him out as a duly authorised officer and not merely because he says so.  In many Statutory Orders, it has now become the practice to make it necessary not merely for the authorised officer to have a card authorising him but to produce it on request.  That is the first point.</P>
    <P>The second point is that we are, perhaps, interfering with the common law when we are demanding, under penalty, that a person must not wilfully refuse to answer questions put to him. I think it is the right of any citizen to say: &ldquo;I do not propose to answer questions because my answers may incriminate me.&rdquo;  I understand that is a usually accepted principle and I should like to know whether this word &ldquo;lawfully&rdquo; allows a person so to refuse to answer questions.  I should like to hear what the Minister has to say about that.  It is a rather strong power to place in the hands of an authorised officer&mdash;a power to insist under penalty that people in trades, the employers, in this case, must, under statute, answer any questions that are asked of them lawfully.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I should like to say that, as I have suggested, the result of this Bill will be excellent if it succeeds in basing entry into the skilled trades upon ability rather than upon some other consideration.  I should also say <Col N="955" /> that another indirect and very good effect it may have will be a marked heightening of the degree of skill in all the trades involved.  It is quite clear that where the recruitment is on the level of pure ability, the final product in the craft will also be increased in value.  In other words, the Bill will serve the purpose of raising the whole standard of craftsmanship in general throughout the country.  If it is successful in its intention, that will be something to applaud.</P>

      <P>Like the other Senators who have spoken, I welcome this Bill.  I must say, however, that Senator McGuire and Senator Sheehy Skeffington will be disappointed if they imagine this Bill will be a vehicle permitting anybody and everybody to be trained in trades, according as they wish.  We must all accept that it is necessary to control in some way or other the recruitment and training of apprentices.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>To control the recruitment and training of apprentices.  Up to now, in many trades, that control was exercised solely by the union involved. The union decided the number of apprentices that could be recruited in any year.  The union decided who those apprentices should be.  Instead of engaging in a bout of sarcasm at these methods, we should welcome the decision by the unions to hand over a control which they previously had solely in their own hands to a joint body of trade union and employers' representatives, presided over by an independent chairman. That is a substantial step forward and the unions concerned are to be congratulated on agreeing to it.  It does not, however, mean that there will be indiscriminate recruitment of apprentices for the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill, as the Minister said, is largely an agreed measure and the Minister, his predecessor, his Department, the trade unions and the employers' representatives are to be congratulated on the work they put into achieving this large measure of agreement in the past 12 months.  The Bill, <Col N="956" /> as Senators may notice, is the Apprenticeship Bill, 1958.  We are now in 1959.  The delay was well worth while, I think, because it resulted in the bringing forward of this agreed measure.</P>
    <P>There is one particular principle that I welcome as a representative of trade unions.  The Minister has agreed to accept for appointment to An Chomhairle and the committees people nominated by the trade union body. He has departed from a principle upon which other Ministers insist, namely, getting a list of people from which a Minister will make his choice That practice is objected to by the trade union movement.  Unfortunately some bodies under other Ministers&mdash;perhaps it is just one Minister at the moment&mdash; are unmanned from the point of view of trade union representatives because the Minister concerned insists on getting a panel from which he will pick individuals rather than accept the people nominated by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  I welcome the fact, therefore, that in this measure it is clearly provided that the Minister will accept the people listed to him by the Trade Union Congress.</P>
    <P>I should like to draw the Minister's particular attention to three sections in this Bill.  One of them has already been mentioned in the Dáil and, as a result of what Deputy Norton said there, the Minister promised to reconsider the section between then and the Committee Stage in the Seanad.  I refer to Section 51 which has as its marginal note &ldquo;Interference with employers.&rdquo;  That section provides that where rules have been made &ldquo;a person shall not do any act or thing for the purpose either of preventing or obstructing an employer&rdquo; from complying with the rules.  The trade unions, and I think all of us will accept that this is a fact, will not hand over the power of deciding what to do about the terms and conditions of any one of their members to any outside body. In effect, this could mean that we are attempting by legislation to prevent a trade union taking an action in respect of one of its members, an apprentice.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect of this, the reverse side of the coin.  It could well <Col N="957" /> happen that an apprentice in the employment of a particular employer worked during a trade dispute or did work appropriate to another person who was engaged in a trade dispute, and, on the resumption of work, according to this section, the trade union would be debarred from taking any action about what they rightly considered a trade dispute.  In effect, the trade unions will not, I am afraid &mdash;or should I say &ldquo;afraid&rdquo;?&mdash;have regard to that.  They will take their traditional action to defend their own interests or the interests of an individual member.  I hope that the considerations which the Minister promised to give to this section will result in an amendment to exempt from this section any action taken in pursuance of a trade dispute, so that the good work in this Bill may not be swept away in a year or two where a dispute might occur and an attempt might be made to apply this section.</P>
    <P>Another section to which I should like to refer is section 37.  I am not very good at construing legislation but I have read the section a number of times and I think it is unnecessarily ambiguous.  What is intended, I think, is that nobody can recruit an apprentice, unless that would-be apprentice is on a list as prescribed in section 43 and, as well, such recruitment is approved by the committee.  In other words, it is not enough that the person being recruited is simply on a list; it is also necessary that such recruitment has the consent of the committee.</P>
    <P>The Minister will rightly argue that that is what is intended and, in effect, that is what is said by the section, but I think it is unnecessarily ambiguous and I ask the Minister to look at the section between now and Committee Stage and to see if some clearer wording could not be produced.  I have asked different people to read this section and to tell me what they thought it meant.  On many, I found it left the impression that a would-be apprentice could be recruited who was not on the list, provided it was with the consent of the committee.  In other words, the impression was left that in some way <Col N="958" /> paragraph (b) governs paragraph (a) rather than the section as a whole. That impression is left, as I said, and it might be left with other employers, that the committee could approve of somebody not on a list and he then could be recruited as an apprentice.</P>
    <P>That brings me to Section 43 which provides for the keeping of a register of candidates for apprenticeship.  It will be seen that according to Section 37, to which I have just referred, a person to be recruited as an apprentice must be on the list provided for in Section 43, the register of candidates for apprenticeship, and that register provides for, amongst other things, under paragraph (b)&mdash;&ldquo;such particulars of registered persons becoming employed as aforesaid...&rdquo; It seems to me that a person listed there who becomes employed, as provided for under Section 37, is then no longer listed on that register of candidates for apprenticeship, as provided for in Section 43.  In fact, he then apparently goes on to another list as envisaged under Section 44, a register of apprentices.</P>
    <P>It could well happen and it has happened&mdash;and it is unfortunate that it should happen&mdash;that a boy taken on as an apprentice in a trade is, for one reason or another, put out of work before his time is up.  The merchant or trader may go bankrupt and then the boy is out of work.  I think it is intended under Section 37 that the committee would have in mind placing that boy under another trader, another employer, when a vacancy arose.  I suppose that is one of the reasons they have power as envisaged in paragraph (b) of that section, but that boy is not on the register as provided for in Section 43. Apparently he has gone off that register on to the register envisaged in Section 44.</P>
    <P>Perhaps I am finding difficulties where they do not exist.  All I am asking is that the Minister between now and Committee Stage will examine the point I am trying to make, if he can understand my explanation, and say if that difficulty is only in my imagination.  With those words, I commend the Bill to the Seanad and <Col N="959" /> express the hope that the points I have raised, particularly in regard to Section 51, will be considered and met by the Minister on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>As one elected on the Commercial and Industrial Panel, I feel I should say a few words about this Bill.  The Bill is admirable in its conception and the work that has been done by the joint committee of employers and workers has helped the Minister in bringing before us a piece of legislation that should be a benefit in this age.  This is an age of science and technology and if the young entrants to crafts and trades are not given the proper technical as well as the proper craft education, I feel they are going to slip further behind in the standards which the people wish to enjoy but which they can enjoy only by the fruits of their own intelligent and educated efforts.</P>
      <P>A trade in which I am particularly interested and one of the largest export trades is the meat trade.  It is not possible in the training of apprentices in most of our factories to give them the technical and sometimes scientific knowledge which must be of importance to them in handling products of this kind.  The facilities are not available in the factories and the skilled personnel are not always readily available.  I hope that Senator O'Donovan who, perhaps, has experience in the matter, will contribute something before the debate concludes.</P>
      <P>In framing this Bill, I believe that the reason educational representatives on the committee were not given a vote is that they are there solely for the purpose of providing the educational facilities which employers and workers know from their experience are required.  If they were entitled to vote, they might be influencing policy in connection with matters in which they could not be competent.  I think it was a proper decision not to give the educational members a vote in this instance.</P>

    <P>Entrance to the trade has been mentioned and to judge by the emphasis on it, there is almost a suggestion that a carpenter's son would <Col N="960" /> make a bad carpenter and that anybody else who had no tradition in the craft or vocation would make a better entrant.  I think we should walk in the middle of the road in this matter.  It is generally true that tradition is something that must and should be encouraged.  We have too little of it in craft and industry in Ireland and any of us who visit Britain or the Continent will see that continuing tradition there.</P>
    <P>We find in Britain generations of millwrights and other such craftsmen whose fathers, grandfathers and great grandfathers all followed the trade.  As a result, Britain is an industrial country and I do not think there has been in that country&mdash;or in most countries of which I speak&mdash;any move to restrict new talent or new blood from entering the industry.  Sons of craftsmen, sons of printers, carpenters or masons have grown up&mdash;I know many of them&mdash;in a tradition involving everything connected with the trade.  Perhaps if they are not as good at mathematics or languages as some of the new entrants to the trade, they have other enormous advantages and they have a pool of knowledge and tradition which is part and parcel of their family and that should be given its proper weight by the Comhairle.  I believe the Comhairle will do that when drawing up rules with regard to the appointment of apprentices.</P>
    <P>I want to disabuse Senator Murphy of one misapprehension under which I think he has been labouring.  He said that trade unions always entirely controlled entry into the craft trades. They did not; in many cases, agreements have been made between the employers and the workers in different trades as to the numbers of apprentices which a trade can absorb.  Trade unions have occasionally tried to interfere, to restrict the number of new entrants, but it is not true to say that they have entirely controlled the matter.  I know that in the printing trade, there is a very definite national agreement with regard to the number of apprentices and the matter is discussed at local level always between the employers and the workers.  Even the lists of prospective entrants and their educational qualifications are discussed.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="961" /> I have nothing further to add except to hope that the Comhairle will be set up without delay and that the knowledge which our apprentices will be helped to receive will not be denied them any longer.  I congratulate the Minister on the measure.  Thanks are due to all concerned, the employers, the workers, the Minister and his officials.  I think the nation owes them thanks for a most exemplary piece of legislation.</P>

      <P>I should have thought this matter would more appropriately have been dealt with by the Department of Education but it is a peculiarly happy situation that the Minister now dealing with it has been in that Department and knows that vocational schools in a great many centres in the city and in a great many country districts have already formed classes to deal specially with apprentices in certain trades.  I wonder why the matter was not dealt with completely by the Department of Education. If it had been, the whole thing could be handled in one scheme.  The vocational education committees are anxious if they can get sufficient numbers&mdash;certainly in my county&mdash;to form such classes and are anxious to have them at times to suit workers and employers.  In a way, it is a pity the matter was not dealt with by the Department of Education, but it is a happy circumstance that the Minister who was in that Department is dealing with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From the Minister's remarks and those of Senator McGuire, I felt that there was a very happy sort of exchange between employers and unions in regard to the details of this Bill but it seems to me that Senator Murphy swept the whole thing away. His opening remarks were to the effect that it was necessary to control entry to the trades; that entry originally was completely controlled by the unions and that now the unions were to be commended for more or less handing over these powers to this joint board. His third and final remark was that this did not mean that there would be indiscriminate entry into any trade. That, it seems to me, takes away my <Col N="962" /> whole idea of what the Minister said and what Senator McGuire said; in other words, the unions are not going to allow this body to act with complete freedom.</P>
    <P>I have great sympathy with Senator Sheehy Skeffington when he says that entry to these apprenticeships should be on ability.  To define ability in those circumstances is sometimes rather difficult but one does know of people who may be useless at school but clever with their hands.  These are the people whom one would like to see apprenticed in certain trades but any attempt to find out their abilities beforehand might lead to their being put at the bottom of the list.  For those reasons, one would like to see the whole recruitment of apprentices left completely open.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to deal with one point.  In Section 2, he has defined a trade as any industry, occupation or business.  Section 20 provides for an examination into the method used in any trade for the recruitment and training of apprentices.  Then we come to Section 29 which states that an apprenticeship committee may make rules requiring persons carrying on trade to ensure the training of those whom they employ.  Nowhere can I see any power given to the Minister or the committee to compel employees who refuse to co-operate by assisting apprentices.  I can see a position arising in a trade where a union, trying to keep it a closed trade, at a very small number, will refuse to co-operate in any way whatever.  Does the Minister think he could deal with that situation under this Bill?</P>
    <P>I have every sympathy and pity for the boy who wants to enter a trade, who has a great interest in a certain trade, but who, simply because the members of the trade think it is already overcrowded, is not allowed to take up that trade.  I should like to assist that boy, if possible, by having some machinery to enforce his recruitment as an apprentice in the trade he wishes to join.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>Briefly, I wish to join with all other Senators in welcoming this Bill, more especially because of the way in which this very difficult subject has been approached and because both the Minister and his predecessor secured such a large measure of agreement as between the employers and the workers.  That is a very happy augury for the success of the Bill.</P>
      <P>Most of the provisions can best be discussed on Committee Stage and I shall refrain therefore from going into detail on the provisions now.  The main question raised seems to have been that in relation to the intake of apprentices.  We all echo the sentiment expressed here; we should all like to see any boy, who is willing and anxious to learn a trade, with the facilities for doing so.  I hope the Council will be able to use its influence towards that end.  It is only right we should pay tribute to the advantages of having a trade, in the family, as it were, especially in carpentry, masonry and so forth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a source of grievance to many of us to see our emigrants going abroad unequipped with skills, trades, or professions for which they have a natural aptitude.  In the Universities, we rightly refuse to limit the output of graduates.  So long as there are students coming along, equipped to profit by professional courses, it is only their due that they should have those courses, even though they may subsequently have to emigrate.  It would be a happy day for this country if all our emigrants could be equipped with either degrees or trades.  I hope that in future the legitimate fear of trade unions that increasing numbers of skilled workers may create embarrassing unemployment problems at home will be overcome and some means found of ensuring that skilled workers and craftsmen are turned out, even though some may have to emigrate.  So long as we have emigration, we cannot legitimately restrict educational opportunities or <Col N="965" /> avenues at home.  Remember, these may be the only gifts or the only dowry we can give to our emigrants.</P>
    <P>There is one other point I might mention.  I hope similar measures will be taken to cope with the problem of getting young men into agriculture. This may be outside the scope of this Bill, but some form of apprenticeship is long overdue in agriculture.  We waited twenty years for an amendment of the 1931 Act.  It is now before us in this Bill.  I hope that before long a similar constructive measure in relation to agriculture will be introduced.</P>
    <P>The Bill makes heavy demands on the facilities in the technical schools for providing suitable courses for apprentices.  That is all to the good. That is fit and proper work for the technical schools.  It is the work for which they were set up.  I hope that they will make their contributions to education by doing that work to the best of their ability, on a standard equal to that of the past, and that they will not chase mirages by trying to give University degrees as well.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very pleased at the manner in which this Bill has been accepted by the Seanad.  To be candid, I should have been very disappointed if it had been otherwise, remembering the background against which the Bill has been produced and the history of apprenticeship law since 1931.</P>
      <P>Senator McGuire rightly observed that this Bill is an improvement on the 1931 Act.  In the 1931 Act, the main defect was that no trade could be designated.  That can be done under this Bill.  Any trade which wanted rules of apprenticeship drawn up under the 1931 Act had to come forward voluntarily and the result was rather disappointing inasmuch as only four trades came forward for the drawing up of a code to govern entry and training.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator McGuire also observed that almost all the recommendations of the joint committee of employers' and workers' representatives were accepted.  I think he can safely remove the &ldquo;almost&rdquo; qualification.  All the <Col N="966" /> joint recommendations were accepted and incorporated in the Bill by way of amendment on Committee Stage or Report Stage in the Dáil.</P>
    <P>Naturally, there were some points of disagreement and a certain stand had to be taken on one side or another. The employers may have lost out, or the workers may have lost out, in the stand that had to be taken, but points of difference were reduced to a very happy minimum.</P>
    <P>Senator Sheehy Skeffington complained that the Bill was rather too detailed in its provisions.  I think it is one of the virtues of the Bill that we have succeeded, as we have, in getting a measure of agreement between employers' and workers' representatives on a series of details, and in getting them to iron out the bumps and smooth out the kinks at an early stage and embody that in legislation. It will render the work of An Chomhairle and the committees to be set up under this measure easier and will, to a very great extent, minimise the points at which disagreement might be registered between the representatives of An Chomhairle and of the committees at a later stage.</P>
    <P>I am very pleased that they have been able to agree on such detail to such a great extent.  As some of the Senators observed, the Bill might be more usefully discussed, certainly as to the criticisms I have heard here&mdash; and I did not anticipate that there would be no criticism of the Bill in some of its details&mdash;in Committee. Subject to making a few points here, I do not propose to go over all the criticisms or suggestions of the Senators.</P>
    <P>In the first instance, the question of admission to trades was raised by Senator Sheehy Skeffington.  It has been the practice and tradition that relatives of craftsmen are permitted, in the first instance, to go into a trade by way of apprenticeship.  In general, I do not see anything wrong with that and it is not intended in this Bill to interfere with that established practice. The fact will remain that a young person may not enter into apprenticeship for a trade only because he happens <Col N="967" /> to be related to a man already qualified in that trade.  The age qualification perhaps will not matter much in this instance but the educational qualification might and as a result it may be the boy, or perhaps in a few cases, a girl, with the necessary educational qualification who may secure entry as against a relative. On the other hand, there is the provision whereby An Chomhairle, and the committees through the Comhairle, will be empowered to regulate the numbers entering into any particular trade in order to ensure there will be no shortage, on the one hand, of workers for a skilled trade, and, on the other hand, no undue surplus which might create a situation in which advantage might be taken of such surplus of workers in a particular trade. So far as there is that provision, it must obviously mean that the entry cannot necessarily be restricted to relatives of people already skilled in their trade and members of that particular trade union.</P>
    <P>Speaking of trade unions, I doubt if it is possible to achieve the ideal suggested by Senator Sheehy Skeffington, of one big trade union.  I do not know if I interpreted rightly what he said but if I did, he seemed to suggest that all trades and crafts might be represented by just one union.  We know that that, in practice, is very difficult to achieve and having regard to the long drawn out negotiations&mdash;and the successful negotiations at that&mdash;to have one Congress rather than two Congresses of Unions, it will be realised that to get all trades into one union would be difficult.  It is a happy solution that all these trades are represented now in one Congress and certainly it was a good distance to go.  I doubt if we can go as far as the Senator suggests.  I am not suggesting that I am interpreting him absolutely correctly in this.  I may not be.  I do not know that it is possible to have only one union representing all crafts and trades.</P>
    <P>With regard to the criticism of the section whereby the Minister is empowered to remove the chairman at any time, I should like to point out <Col N="968" /> that this was raised in the Dáil but was not pursued by amendment.  As the Senator will agree, the task of chairman of An Chomhairle will be a rather delicate one and one in which he will require to use the utmost tact and retain the absolute confidence of both sides.  Only by exercising such tact and exercising his functions with the highest degree of impartiality will he succeed.  It may be that in some cases he could lean one way or the other, and he could do so constantly, and it might be difficult for any Minister to put his finger on any defects from which a chairman might suffer. As long as there will be a chairman capable of performing his functions properly and having the confidence of both sides, it is better that he should be retained and it is more than likely that he will be.  If the stage is reached at which, for some intangible reason, he has lost the confidence of one side or the other, or both sides, it is obvious that he should be removed from office, but it will not always be very easy to put a finger on the reasons why he should be so removed.  I repeat that as long as the chairman acts with tact and discretion and commands the confidence of both sides, there is no force in the suggestion that his security of tenure might in any way be jeopardised.</P>
    <P>The Senator also commented on the fact that members representing educational interests did not seem to have much power on the Comhairle.  The history of any power being taken from them is this.  As the Bill was originally drafted, it provided for 11 members of An Chomhairle&mdash;four members representing employers, four representing the workers' interests and three representing educational interests.  As a result of the setting up of this committee, and as a result of their examination of this provision, agreement could be got only on this basis: that the strength of the Comhairle be increased to 13, that each of the employers' and workers' interests would have a representation of five and that so far as there were educational interests represented, they would not have voting powers, except, of course, in stated cases when perhaps one of the educational interests might be <Col N="969" /> acting as a chairman of An Chomhairle, or a committee, when a casting vote would have to be taken into account.</P>
    <P>Senators complained about the provisions of Section 58 (1) (b) pursuant to which a person conducting a trade, an employer, will be required to answer certain questions put by an authorised officer.  He will naturally not be required to touch upon matters of such a nature as would perhaps disclose the manner of conducting his business.  The questions he will be asked must relate to rules of apprenticeship and the conduct of apprenticeship by him where he has apprentices in his employment who operate under the rules which are being drawn up and which will have statutory effect.  These are the only questions he will be required to answer and it is only reasonable that when he undertakes the obligation of training apprentices pursuant to statutory rules, he should subject himself to answering questions pertaining to his fulfilment of those rules.  He will not be asked any questions outside that scope.</P>
    <P>In that connection, I might answer the point put by Senator Cole.  He suggested that in certain circumstances, while perhaps the Comhairle had certain powers to ensure that people did not interfere with the carrying out of a proper scheme of apprenticeship, there may not be any provision preventing the employee or a fellow employee of the apprentice interfering with such a course of apprenticeship. Section 51 contains powers under which the Comhairle have certain rights to require the person not to do any act or thing either to prevent or obstruct an employer from complying with the rules.  I suggest that the use of the word &ldquo;obstructing&rdquo; might cover the point Senator Cole had in mind.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, it would be a difficult thing to prove non-co-operation or something going a little further than non-co-operation and indeed it would be difficult to imagine how such a situation could be provided for in legislation, but at least there is here a <Col N="970" /> section which the Comhairle can use to ensure that the scheme of apprenticeship will not be obstructed by anybody, whether an employer or an employee of the employer who conducts that apprenticeship scheme.</P>
    <P>Again referring to Section 51, I may say to Senator Murphy&mdash;unfortunately he is not here&mdash;that he objects to the provisions of this section in so far as it might restrict the trade union from declaring a strike.  As I said in introducing the Bill, it does not seek to control wages or hours of work.  It simply sets up An Cheard Chomhairle which will have the right to designate a trade.  It will not do so as long as it is satisfied that the trade is carrying out a proper scheme of apprenticeship or if it is not already doing so, if, following some submissions from the Comhairle, it amends its rules to conform to what An Chomhairle thinks is a proper scheme of apprenticeship.  If it does not do so, An Chomhairle may then designate that trade or may themselves or by some of their committees have rules drawn up.  These rules will have to be agreed in advance at the level of An Chomhairle or one of its committees which will be representative of employers and employees, with an independent chairman.</P>
    <P>Therefore, the rules will largely be agreed rules and will become statutory rules.  I think it would be a very wrong principle for us to adopt if we were to permit any organisation to have the right, without fear of sanction, to effect a breach of these statutory rules.  The rules are for the purpose of ensuring adequate apprenticeship training and under them the young apprentices will be required to serve certain hours on the workshop floor and perhaps&mdash;almost certainly&mdash; spend certain hours at a technical school for the purpose of equipping themselves and establishing firmly for themselves a place in life.  It would be very wrong for any organisation, trade union or otherwise, to interfere with the rights of any young boy to acquire, or be given the means to acquire, a craft or skill that would ensure him the means of earning a livelihood later on.</P>
    <P>If, pursuant to a strike, a young boy <Col N="971" /> required to spend certain time on the workshop floor was required by his trade union not to attend school and the period during which the strike was enforced was protracted, I think it would be obviously unjust to any boy that his time should be wasted in that fashion.</P>
    <P>It is not intended that this Bill should affect wages or hours of work. These will continue to be matters for negotiation between employers and employees, or between employers and trade unions, but it would be very wrong for us to legislate any organisation out of its obligations under statutory rules that will be agreed as proper rules by the committee or An Chomhairle for the proper conduct of an apprenticeship scheme.</P>
    <P>Senator Murphy said that Deputy Norton suggested in the Dail that I might reconvene the joint committee to reconsider this aspect of the Bill.  I am satisfied that it was fully considered originally by the joint committee and further that no purpose would be served by reconvening the committee.  I think I need go no further but I am sure that the vast majority of the Seanad will agree that the rules should not be capable of being easily upset by the act of any body or organisation with the detrimental effect that would have for a particular apprentice.</P>
    <P>The Bill is, in so far as it is possible, an agreed measure, agreed between employers and employees.  It facilitates the setting up of these committees to make these rules which will be statutory rules for the sole purpose of the proper conduct of apprenticeship.  So far as any other criticisms or suggestions made by Senators are concerned, I suggest that these might be more adequately and properly discussed on Committee Stage.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Col N="972" />
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. J. Lynch) Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. J. Lynch)</NameTxt>
      <P>The main object of this Bill is to amend in a number of respects the procedure laid down by the Restrictive Trade Practices Act, 1953, for the investigation of restrictive trade practices and for the elimination of those practices which are found to be unfair or to operate against the public interest.</P>
      <P>Senators will recall that the Act of 1953 provided for the establishment of the Fair Trade Commission and for the vesting in the Commission of the power to investigate restrictive trade practices in regard to the supply and distribution of goods and the rendering, in the course of carrying on any trade or business, of any services affecting such supply or distribution.  The Commission are empowered to make rules&mdash;known as fair trading rules&mdash; representing, in their opinion, fair trading conditions with regard to the supply and distribution of any kind of goods and the rendering of any services affecting such supply or distribution. Such rules have not the force of law, but represent a code of conduct for the particular trades concerned.</P>
      <P>The Commission must keep under review the operation of fair trading rules and report to the Minister for Industry and Commerce if the rules are not being observed.  As an alternative to the making of fair trading rules, the Commission may hold a public inquiry into the conditions which obtain in regard to the supply and distribution of the goods concerned.  They may hold such an inquiry on their own initiative, but must do so if the Minister so requests.  The Commission are required to submit to the Minister a report of every inquiry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A report by the Commission in relation to the non-observance of fair trading rules, or following the holding of a public inquiry, must describe the conditions which obtain in regard to the supply and distribution of the goods concerned.  The report must indicate whether these conditions prevent or restrict competition or restrain trade or involve resale price maintenance. If, in the opinion of the Commission, any such interference with trade or competition is unfair or operates <Col N="973" /> against the public interest, the report must give reasons for the Commission's conclusions.  The Minister, having considered such a report, may make an Order prohibiting specified arrangements, agreements or practices in the trade concerned.  An Order so made by the Minister does not have the force of law unless and until it is confirmed by an Act of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>To date, 19 sets of fair trading rules have been made relating to the supply and distribution of a wide variety of commodities, and six public inquiries have been held in relation to the supply and distribution of radio and television sets, building materials, motor vehicles, grocery goods, chemists' preparations and carpets.  Reports of all six enquiries have been submitted to the Minister, and five of these reports have been published.  The other report, relating to carpets, is at present under consideration by me.  As Senators are doubtless aware, a further inquiry, in relation to the supply and distribution of motor spirit and motor vehicle lubricating oil, was initiated recently by the Commission and is in progress at the present time.</P>
    <P>Orders have been made in relation to the supply and distribution of radio and television sets, building materials, motor cars and grocery goods.  The operation of the Orders relating to motor cars and radio and television sets has been reviewed by the Commission, and reports have been submitted in the matter to me.  In both instances, the Commission's recommendation was that the Order should not be altered, and this recommendation was accepted.</P>
    <P>An examination has been made of the operation of the Restrictive Trade Practices Act, 1953, in the light of experience over the past six years. In the course of the examination, consideration was given to the question whether legislation embodying a different approach to restrictive trade practices, such as is followed in some other countries, would be more suitable to conditions here.  The conclusion reached was that the machinery of the 1953 Act is fundamentally sound and that it has enabled substantial progress to be <Col N="974" /> made in a relatively short time in eliminating some of the more objectionable features of restrictive practices in many trades.  Experience does suggest, however, that some modifications of the Act are desirable in relation to the scope of public enquiries and the procedure for the review by the Commission of the operation of Ministerial Orders.</P>
    <P>I should explain that a public inquiry must deal with all the conditions which obtain in regard to the supply and distribution of the goods and all restrictive practices affecting their supply and distribution.  This arrangement precludes the holding of an inquiry of limited scope, for example, an inquiry confined to one particular practice.  I consider it desirable that the Commission should be empowered to hold such limited inquiries and Section 2 of the Bill provides accordingly.</P>
    <P>The review of the operation of existing Orders is obviously an important part of the Fair Trade Commission's functions.  Conditions in trades are liable to change and it is essential that the effect of Orders should be closely watched by the Commission. The 1953 Act requires the Commission to keep the operation of Orders under review and provides that the Commission may submit to the Minister a report in the matter together with their recommendations as to what action should be taken thereon. If a report by the Commission should indicate the necessity for amending an Order, it would be necessary to have a further public enquiry.</P>
    <P>I regard this procedure for the amendment of Orders as cumbersome and unsatisfactory and I propose to remedy the position by the introduction of the new procedure which is provided for in Section 6 of this Bill. That section provides that the Commission may, on their own initiative, and shall, at my request, hold a special review of the operation of an Order. The Commission are required to publish notice of their intention to hold a special review and give interested parties an opportunity of making submissions <Col N="975" /> in relation to the subject matter of the review.</P>
    <P>It will be open to any interested person to ask the Commission to hold a public inquiry, instead of a special review, and, if the Commission decide against holding a public inquiry, they must inform the party concerned of the reasons for their decision.  The Commission will be required to submit to the Minister a report of every special review and, if they are of opinion that the relevant Order should be amended, they must recommend accordingly and indicate the form of amending Order which they consider necessary.  A copy of the Report of every special review will be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>I propose to avail of the opportunity offered by this Bill to introduce a new provision authorising the Fair Trade Commission to investigate restrictive practices imposed by employers or employees affecting the use of specific materials or methods for manufacturing or construction purposes.  Perhaps the best example I can give the House of the type of practice which I have in mind is the one-time refusal of carpenters to install steel windows in new houses.  I must explain that that particular practice is not relevant now. Section 4 of the Bill authorises the Commission to undertake inquiries into such matters at my request.</P>
    <P>In essence, the aim of the section is to enable the Commission to investigate complaints that restrictive practices relating to the use of specific materials or methods prevent the reasonable development of trade and business and inflate costs.  It is not the intention that Orders will be made on receipt of a report from the Commission dealing with practices of this kind.  I feel, however, that it will serve a useful purpose if such practices are inquired into and reported on by an impartial body such as the Fair Trade Commission.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides also for some minor amendments of the Act of 1953 which are, in the main, consequential on the principal amendments which I have already mentioned.  I believe that this Bill will strengthen the procedure established by the Act of 1953 for the <Col N="976" /> investigation of restrictive trade practices and for the abolition of those practices which are unfair and contrary to the public interest.  I feel sure the Bill will commend itself to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGuire</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill, like the preceding Bill, seems to be an improvement on its predecessor.  As the Minister says, the procedure has been made less cumbersome and, I might say, less crude than in the original Act.  The actual working of an Act always brings out its weaknesses and it is good to see that the necessary changes are made with expedition, as has been done comparatively quickly in this case.  There is no doubt that the original Commission when it sat suffered from a certain amount of inexperience, as we shall call it, as regards trade conditions and trade practices in many cases.</P>
      <P>There is no doubt that business people were very perturbed and very upset by the workings of the original Act.  Even the strongest protagonists of the Act will admit that a certain amount of pillorying of reputable business people was done.</P>
      <P>The idea behind many of these public circuses, if one may so describe them, seemed to be that the business community were engaged in practices contrary to the public interest.  Due to preconceived ideas as to certain trading practices, such as price maintenance, it was believed that anybody engaging in price maintenance agreements was really acting contrary to the public interest, and all that had to be done was to establish that price maintenance existed and then proceed to condemn it.  The business community are glad that the Minister said in the Dáil the other day that it is now accepted by his Department and by the Commission that very often price maintenance agreements are, in fact, not detrimental to the public interest at all.  That is one fact that has been established.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the initial stages of the implementation of the Act, it was worked rather crudely.  That was due to the fact that the machinery was both <Col N="977" /> cumbersome and crude in itself.  As the Minister has explained now, a certain element of a more discreet form of machinery is being introduced. That is welcome because there will be less noise and more good work done.  For that reason, we welcome the changes in this Bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister seems to be satisfied with the way the Act worked but I notice Deputy Booth, quite rightly, pointed out in the Dáil that a certain amount of chaos and confusion had been caused in certain trades.  People who are in a position to provide first-class service of every kind and on whose integrity customers could rely have been put in a very awkward position. At the same time, irresponsible traders have been brought into existence and enabled to set up in business, very often without the know-how or the machinery to give the service expected from them.  That is notably true of the motor trade, and even the wireless trade.  These two were quoted.</P>
    <P>There has been an encouragement of cut-price shops.  Cut-price is the basis of all good commercial competition, provided the price cutting is done in the proper background; that is to say, that proper service is given, proper wages paid, and so forth.  Very often, cut-price is not the be-all and the end-all of commercial trading.  I think it is being recognised that a certain amount of injustice has been done to good traders and certain undesirable traders have been brought into existence because of the work of this Fair Trade Commission.  Of course, nothing works perfectly and I do not wish to condemn too much at this stage. Having gone through the birth pains, a smoother stage of growth and development may be experienced.  I think everybody has learned a good deal more as to how business works and operates, to say nothing of discovering that things are not always what they seem to be at first glance.</P>
    <P>The alteration in the machinery proposed in this Bill may ensure that restrictive trade practices legislation will in future work more fairly for everybody concerned.  There is an <Col N="978" /> interesting departure in this Bill.  A new feature is introduced.  Workers and employees are mentioned.  It was manifestly unfair that up to now there should be inquiries into restrictive trade practices of only one side of business, industry and commerce. Indeed, that was almost contrary to the Constitution.  But, even now, under this Bill, employees are introduced in a very timid way.  We hope henceforth everybody will get a fair crack of the whip and that in future employees and trade unions will be made to answer for practices which are detrimental to the public interest.  Why should any section of the community be put not only above the ordinary law but above the moral law?  I am not talking now as an employer but merely as someone examining this Bill. It is only fair that employees, even if in a very limited way, should be included within the scope of legislation such as this.  That is something that will be welcomed.</P>
    <P>In the Dáil, the Minister, in reply to Deputy Cosgrave, explained that the mention of employees applies only to the refusal or alleged refusal to use particular materials or particular methods.  That is welcome but I am sorry, and so will many other people be sorry, that this provision will not apply to restrictive trade practices at our ports in relation to containers. This is a most important trade to the country and the present situation may have a most detrimental effect on our turkey trade and other exports to Britain.  I do not wish to labour the point too much, but this provision is a major introduction into the Bill, although it comes in in a very gentle way at the moment.  I make no bones and the public make no bones about saying that employees should come under scrutiny just as fully and fairly as employers.  It is only right that employees and trade unions should take their place as well.  The Bill is an improvement on its predecessor.  I hope that it will prove smoother in operation, less harsh and more popular than its predecessor.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OwenSkeffington" hpid="Dr. Sheehy Skeffington Dr. Sheehy Skeffington">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not agree with all that Senator McGuire has said about either the first Bill or <Col N="979" /> this Bill.  I am not fully convinced that this Bill represents an advance. There are some details of improvement. I got a feeling&mdash;I may be wrong&mdash;that the Government, which was the Government which first introduced the Fair Trade Commission, became embarrassed by the very efficient way in which it set about working.  I have a feeling that there was a hope that it would be a kind of window-dressing Commission which would not get very much real work done but the Government would be able to say: &ldquo;We set up a Commission.  What more can we do?&rdquo;  I feel the embarrassment was caused not only to some businessmen but also to the Government when they saw the Fair Trade Commission really getting down to brass tacks in relation to a number of businesses, asking questions and finding out certain practices, and exposing them to the light of day, which I do not believe to be a bad thing.  My hope is that this amending Bill is not a very subtle and indirect way of nullifying, or making it possible to nullify, much of the excellent work already done by the Fair Trade Commission in relation to so many trades.</P>
      <P>Senator McGuire said the early methods were crude and that certain reputable businessmen were pilloried. I think that, in saying that, he is being less than fair to the Fair Trade Commission. Most of us will remember the early inquiries and the full Press coverage given to them and most of us will recognise in relation to certain trades&mdash;wireless dealers, the building trade, the grocery trade, the chemists, infant foods and so on&mdash;that while very searching questions were asked, the businessmen were allowed to be represented by counsel and their rights were thoroughly protected.  Really, the awkwardness was produced by the fact that they found it very difficult to give straight answers in public to certain questions it was in the public interest to have answered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator McGuire hopes that the Bill will enable the Fair Trade Commission in future to be more discreet.  I am afraid of that.  I believe that from the outset they have been most scrupulous. <Col N="980" /> They have insisted on bringing out in the open certain secret agreements and arrangements and cartels and price fixing and so on with which I do not agree and which are not in the public interest.  I think that is the most effective way to fight them, to bring them out into the open.  The Fair Trade Commission especially can do that with most beneficial results to the buying public.</P>
    <P>I should like also to touch on the question mentioned by Senator McGuire of, as he said, people without the know-how going into business and their having been encouraged by the Fair Trade Commission.  With all respect to Senator McGuire, I feel that that is simply nonsense.  When people without the know-how go into business, or attempt to go into business, the assumption is that they go out of business as quickly as they went into it. Unless they are giving value to the public&mdash;in which case they justify their efforts&mdash;they will go out of business and there is no use saying they will be engaging sweated labour because labour conditions and hygiene conditions are controlled by trade unions and legislation.  Therefore, if people without the know-how go into business, they are doing no harm to anybody but themselves and they will go bankrupt pretty rapidly.</P>
    <P>There is a great deal of squealing in this country about cut-price shops. Provided their conditions of employment and hygiene&mdash;which, as I say, are regulated, quite apart from the Fair Trade Commission&mdash;are all right, my feeling is that cut-price shops will be supportted in the measure they give the public what the public wants.  I am old-fashioned enough to believe that the public should have the right to choose.  We used be told that one of the principles of free enterprise and the profit system was that the business man was in duty bound to buy on the cheapest market and sell on the dearest, and that small profits made for quick returns and that competition was the life of trade.  I suggest that if we believe in free enterprise and so on, we must accept the results of real competition and not tolerate the behind closed doors arrangements made between reputable <Col N="981" /> businessmen arranging to take more profits from the public than, as the cut price shops demonstrate, need be taken.</P>
    <P>My hope is that this Bill is not an indirect way of watering down the power of the Fair Trade Commission. On the face of it, I think it is possible that the Fair Trade Commission will, under this Bill, be able to act just as efficiently as before, but there are some sections about which I have a certain amount of doubt.  In Section 6, I notice that &ldquo;the Commission may, on their own initiative, and shall, at the request of the Minister, hold a special review of the operation of an Order under Section 9 of the Principal Act.&rdquo;  I am a little suspicious of that.  The Minister can force the Commission to re-open the whole question of an Order that has been made, with a view either to amending it or revoking it.  Perhaps I am over suspicious.  Perhaps that is quite justifiable in practice.</P>
    <P>In the same section, in sub-section (6), I think there is a fault in drafting which would require to be amended on Committee Stage.  The sub-section reads:</P>
    <P>The Commission shall submit to the Minister a report of every special review and the report shall state whether any request was made to the Commission under sub-section (4) of this section and, if so, give the reasons for their decision not to accede to the request.</P>
    <P>Now I take it that means that the Commission are bound to report special reviews, but there seems to be a defect there between inquiries and special reviews because it looks here as if the Commission would only make a decision not to accede to the request. I suppose if they do accede to a request, and hold an inquiry, there will also be a report.  I do not see that referred to here, specifically&mdash;a fresh inquiry.</P>
    <P>I notice in Section 7, sub-section (2), that when the Commission gives a report to the Minister, and the Minister lays this before each House of the Oireachtas, the Minister may expunge certain details from that report before <Col N="982" /> the Houses of the Oireachtas see it. It states:</P>
    <P>It shall be lawful for the Minister after consultation with the Commission to omit from the copy any information contained in the report the publication of which would, in his opinion, materially injure the legitimate interests of any person, if such information is not essential to the full understanding of the report.</P>
    <P>I am very suspicious of that blanket sub-section which enables the Minister to expunge from the records of the inquiry certain facts for fear of embarrassing certain business interests.  I feel that if the Commission make a report, we have the right to read it and that it should be laid in full on the Tables of the Houses.</P>
    <P>I noticed Section 8 with some amusement.  Section 8, subsection (2) says&mdash;</P>
    <P>Section 9 of the Principal Act is hereby amended by the insertion in subsection (5) after &ldquo;months&rdquo; of &ldquo;(being months in which Dáil Éireann or Seanad Éireann has sat for not less than three days)&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>That subsection (5) in question, of the original Act, states that the Minister shall comply with sub-section (4) within three months after he has received the report.  Subsection (4) says:</P>
    <P>If the Commission in a report to the Minister recommends the making of an Order and the Minister decides not to make any Order he shall lay before each House of the Oireachtas a statement giving the reasons for his decision.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the subsection here is to oblige the Minister to lay such a statement before each House of the Oireachtas, not within three months as was said, but within three months which are months in which Dáil Éireann or Seanad Éireann have sat for not less than three days.</P>
    <P>I was amused because the people will remember the Minister's failure to take any action on the recommendation of the Fair Trade Commission on infant foods and medical preparations and the Minister in fact failed utterly to comply with <Col N="983" /> this Section 9 of the Principal Act.  In other words, he disregarded it and got away with it completely.  The report in question was laid before him in December, 1956, and in July, 1957, six months later, on the last day of the Dáil session, he stated he was not going to make an Order and he circulated a short statement in which he said that &ldquo;under Section 9 subsection (5)&rdquo;&mdash;the subsection we are here asked to amend&mdash;&ldquo;this statement must be laid before each House of the Oireachtas within three months after the Minister has received the report from the Commission in order to comply with the subsection.  The present statement should have been laid before the Oireachtas before the 29th March last&rdquo;&mdash;he is writing this in July&mdash;&ldquo;but the circumstances of the general election and the ensuing change of Government delayed consideration of the report and made it impossible to comply in time with the requirement of the subsection.&rdquo;  The point I am making and the one that causes me a certain amount of amusement is that the Minister was apparently not bound in the slightest by the section and I am really at a loss to know why he wants to amend it since he blandly disregards it when he wants to do so and apparently no one finds anything wrong with that.</P>
    <P>I do not want to delay the House further.  I hope this amending Act is not for the purpose of weakening the power and influence of the Fair Trade Commission.  I hope it is not going to be discreet in the sense of allowing itself to be muzzled or have its powers watered down to the point where it will be doing no work.  I desire to see it continue the excellent work it has so well begun.</P>

      <P>I hope Senator Sheehy Skeffington will not be offended if I suggest that when he was a small boy he played the game we know as &ldquo;Cops and Robbers&rdquo; and that the habit of mind has persisted ever since with him.  It is very easy to restrict trade in this country at the moment.  I do not know of any traders who do not agree that we are living in a very <Col N="984" /> violent buyers' market.  Frequently, goods are sold at too near cost; too often small traders go into insolvency through price cutting.  That results in bad debts for wholesalers and disemployment, and, in general, the breaking down of the small units of our economy.  It is not a buoyant economy in which the sellers could probably gang up.  I do not see much danger of that here.</P>
      <P>I am a restricted person; I buy goods and sell them and I live on the profit, if there is any after paying for the labour of those who help me to sell the goods and if I obey all the financial restrictions placed on me by my bankers, the local authority and by the State and particularly when I obey the restrictions placed on me by my competitors.</P>

      <P>I am fighting very hard to keep my head over water and have been doing so for some years.  I am not blaming the Minister or his Administration for that.  Apart from those restrictions, I have to obey restrictions placed on me by health and personal habits.  They are also considerable.  I must continue working to get a living until I die and the Seanad will not meet and agree to pay me a handsome gratuity for the rest of my life.  I am conditioned by all that to restriction.</P>
      <P>I suppose in an age of restriction like this, when we have become conditioned to it, it may seem reasonable to put up with a little more in exchange for the kind of tidying up that seems to appear in this Bill.  The Bill makes a slight move forward from the present position.  I particularly approve of Section 3 under which, as well as the wicked employers, the employees also are to be asked to account for certain activities. That is a step forward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suffer a lot through restrictive practices and I am sure the House and you, Sir, will forgive me, if I tell the Minister that his predecessor initiated a very deliberate restrictive <Col N="985" /> practice on me as a tea merchant.  I objected very strongly.  I wonder whether the Minister should not prosecute his predecessor, who is now Taoiseach, for engaging in restrictive practices by telling me that I was not free to import tea&mdash;even though it must be imported as we cannot grow it&mdash;and that if I did import it, I would have to pay 3d. a lb.&mdash;&mdash;</P>

He broke his word afterwards. That was restrictive and I suggest the Minister might investigate that.  I have no more to say.  The Bill makes a very slight advance on conditions obtaining up to now.  For that reason, I welcome it but it is a most qualified welcome.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcomed the last Bill which we had to deal with but I cannot welcome this one because at this stage we should have a Bill introduced to wipe away all the restrictive practices that are hampering our economy and preventing us from making progress here.  We are looking speculatively at the little traders in the country towns who are cutting one another's throats in competition in a contracting economy and trying to legislate to make these people compete even more keenly among themselves and driving a number of them out of business because there is not room for all of them. Some people stand up here and laud the cut-price shops but the fact that many of the people employed in the cut-price shops are either underpaid or juvenile labour is ignored.  Restriction is impeding our imports every day of the week and it is not dealt with at all.  The greatest restriction in Ireland to-day is the restriction on our ports.  We have to compete against the British in their own market and they are very large producers of agricultural produce which is our main <Col N="986" /> export.  They have the advantage of being on the spot with that produce in England.  They are able to subsidise it to the extent of £250,000,000 a year. We have not the money to subsidise our agriculture on the same level but at least we could get rid of restrictive trade practices.</P>
      <P>In its original conception and its continued form&mdash;although there is some slight improvement in it&mdash;this is an emasculated measure that does not even propose to deal with the situation. The Minister in his speech in the other House spoke about building materials. When this Bill came here in the first instance, I said there should be an investigation of the whole building trade covering the period from the raising of the gravel at the gravel pit to the handing over of the key to the person coming into the house.  There was a which hunt in regard to a few builders here in Dublin&mdash;I have no interest in them&mdash;but if there is to be a Restrictive Trade Practices Act it should apply to everybody and should fall on all sections of the community equally.</P>
      <P>In so far as the Minister says he will bring other people into this Bill, I approve; but that does not go far enough.  We talk very knowledgeably about restrictive practices.  We cannot restrict some of the things happening in this country because they come from outside.  Small manufacturers are competing against one another.  Traders selling their goods are competing violently against one another and are cutting down the margins of the manufacturers until some of the small industries here are almost non-existent.  Imported goods are being sold in a completely restrictive way.  Somebody goes into a town with a manufactured item and says: &ldquo;This is imported and we will give you the exclusive trading right for it.&rdquo;  They charge what they like; it has a snob value.  They say: &ldquo;This is imported; it is better and it is exclusive to you.  We are the only ones in town who have it.&rdquo;  The Irish manufactured product is being sold cheaply because it is held to be not as good.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the type of propaganda Irish industry is up against.  I agree with <Col N="987" /> what the Minister for Finance said last week.  If we could reduce our costs, we would be able to expand our exports and not have this appalling competition.  It is caused by the fact that nearly everything manufactured here is so high in price that we cannot afford to export it and the people here cannot afford to buy it.  Those are the facts.  If we can do anything to remove one of our natural disadvantages&mdash;the fact that we have to carry our goods to Britain or Europe &mdash;if we can remove restrictive practices at our ports through this Bill, then we shall be helping our people to progress.  If we could export more, we could have more competitive prices at home and we would not have the need for this semi-socialistic measure brought in here to placate people and further prevent us from making progress.</P>

      <P>I fail to understand the contribution of Senator Sheehy Skeffington to this debate.  I can quite understand the import of and the reason for the remarks of Senator Barry but it is difficult to reconcile the attitude of Senator Sheehy Skeffington with reality.  He says, in the first instance, that he thought the 1953 Act was a good thing and that the Government which produced it did a good thing, but he goes on to say that the operation of the Act has embarrassed the Government; in other words, that the Government created a Frankenstein or threw a boomerang.  I should like to assure him that the Fianna Fáil Government are quite satisfied with the operation of the Fair Trade Commission.</P>

      <P>They are quite satisfied that it has given the public an implement that has helped to improve the economy and the confidence the ordinary people can have in business practices.  It has helped to remove many doubts they would otherwise have had as to such practices.  Neither can I understand the Senator's cynicism when he suggests, with a certain <Col N="988" /> amount of amusement, that the Minister broke the terms of the Bill following the inquiry into chemist preparations. The Senator will reflect on the time when this inquiry took place and when the report of the Commission was presented.  He will remember that the report was presented about 29th December, 1956; that in the month of February, 1957, the Dáil was dissolved; that about 20th or 23rd of March, the new Dáil assembled; and that the three months expired on 29th of the same month.  In other words, the new Minister was given about four or five, or six days at the most, in which to consider the report of the Commission.  The Minister considered the report of the Commission, but no human being would expect him to consider it with any degree of reasonable assessment in such a short period.  I do not see anything to justify the Senator's cynicism in this respect.</P>

      <P>On the contrary, I think the Minister was very wise.

      <P>Whether it was the last day or not, the Minister was fully entitled to a reasonable period in which to assess the implications of such a report.  The Senator perhaps thinks that the occasion of a new Government is one on which everything must be forgotten except some report in which the Senator has a particular interest?  I was quite prepared to be indulgent with the Senator's criticism but when he goes around looking for spectres behind every comma, dot and crossing of a &ldquo;t&rdquo; in a Bill, the genuineness of his criticism becomes suspect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the Senator completely misunderstood, too, the effect of Section 6 <Col N="989" /> under which the Commission, after a special review, will submit a report to the Minister and will, in the course of submitting that report, say whether they were requested to have an inquiry or give the reasons why they decided not to have an inquiry.  I cannot understand the Senator's doubts about the effectiveness of that section.  I may add that the introduction of this Bill was not to water down the effectiveness of the 1953 Act, as the Senator would like to suggest, but rather to make its implementation more expeditious and effective in so far as it provides that, instead of having to inquire into the whole scope of the practices in all aspects of a particular trade, the Commission may now, if they decide that only one aspect of the practices requires their attention, confine themselves to that particular practice. Again, rather than being embarrassed by the operation of the 1953 Act, we are introducing this measure in order to make for better implementation of the purposes of the 1953 Act.  The Senator need have no doubts about that.</P>
    <P>Senator McGuire quoted Deputy Booth who, on the Second Reading in the Dáil, referred to the chaos and confusion that was introduced into a certain industry.  The chaos and confusion to which he referred was in the builders' providers' trade.  The Order made in respect of builders' providers by the Commission contributed nothing to what he termed chaos and confusion. The inquiry was conducted and the Order made in 1956 which was one of the worst years in the record of builders' providers' business.  Many of the builders' providers, particularly the older ones, stated that the Order was responsible for the difficulties the trade was experiencing at that stage On the other hand newcomers into the trade stated that following the review, they found that something beneficial had happened to the builders' providers' trade; the builders themselves found that the conditions under which they operated in the matter of buying the raw materials of their trade had improved; they were able to operate in a much more satisfactory position because of the element of competition <Col N="990" /> that the Order infused into the builders' providers' trade.  If there was chaos, it was largely caused by the recession that occurred in building in 1956.</P>
    <P>I do not think there are any other points I have to make.  In general, I welcome the manner in which the Bill has been accepted and I assure the House that the general consensus of opinion expressed here that the Bill will make for the better operation of our restrictive trade practices legislation is shared by the Government.</P>

      <P>This is a Bill to enable part of the funds of suitors vested in the Accountant of the Courts of Justice to be utilised for three specific purposes, namely, to finance the rebuilding of the Abbey Theatre, to finance the repair and renovation of the buildings of the Society of King's Inns and to provide for the creation of a Capital Fund for the maintenance of the Society's Library and to recoup the Exchequer a sum advanced in 1944 by way of a grant-in-aid for the rebinding of books.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The funds of suitors consist of cash and securities belonging to suitors transferred or paid into or deposited in Court.  They can only be used for the benefit of suitors entitled.  However, part of the funds consist of unclaimed dividends and balances that have been accumulating for more than 200 years.  These are what are known as the dormant funds, which may be defined as funds in accounts that have not been dealt with for 15 years or longer.  The total of the funds in Court on 30th September, 1959, exceeded £8,862,000 of which the dormant portion was represented by a sum of about £860,00 made up of cash to the value <Col N="991" /> of £315,000 and securities to the nominal value of £547,000.</P>
    <P>It might be thought that there could be found standing in the name of the Accountant of the Courts of Justice actual funds to the above mentioned amounts whether cash, money on deposit or investments.  In fact, this is not the case as cash and securities to the amounts respectively of £325,150 and £130,000 have been withdrawn from the funds of suitors under the authority of various Acts of the Parliament of Ireland and the Parliament of the United Kingdom for purposes which included the building and improving of the Courts of Justice and enlarging the Law Library in Dublin. The Acts in question afforded an indemnity to suitors for any loss they might sustain backed by the Consolidated Fund.</P>
    <P>From what I have said, it will be apparent that not all of the Court funds are concrete things vested in the Accountant of the Courts of Justice but that a portion of these funds amounting in the aggregate to the sum of £455,000 is represented by nothing more than the liability of the Central Fund&mdash;which has replaced the Consolidated Fund&mdash;to indemnify suitors against any loss.  The Bill proposes the withdrawal of a further sum of £323,000 and provides, of course, for a similar indemnity backed by the Central Fund.  The effect of the withdrawal of this amount will be to exhaust the so-called dormant funds when account is taken of the fall in the value of the dormant securities the market price of which is some £85,000 below their nominal value. There will, of course, be a further accumulation of dormant funds with the passage of time but the present Bill will exhaust this source of supply for the present.</P>
    <P>Coming now to the purposes for which the moneys are to be utilised, the first of these is to finance the rebuilding of the Abbey Theatre.  A suggestion that the State should provide assistance towards the cost of rebuilding was first put forward in 1937.  Although the idea was received favourably by successive Ministers for Finance, the matter had not come to a <Col N="992" /> head when, in 1951, the then existing building was damaged by fire and left unfit for further performances.  Alternative temporary accommodation was obtained in the Rupert Guinness Memorial Hall and afterwards in the Queen's Theatre which is still being used.</P>
    <P>In December, 1954, an undertaking was given by the Government that, subject to the approval of the Dáil, they would supplement whatever funds the directors of the Abbey had or might have to rebuild the theatre on the old site in accordance with plans to be approved.  Negotiations were then entered into for the acquisition of an adjoining public house with a view to enlarging the site.  These premises were eventually acquired in 1957 and a sum of £26,000 was voted by way of Supplementary Estimate in 1957-58 in respect of their acquisition.  Plans for the new theatre prepared by Mr. Michael Scott, in consultation with Monsieur Pierre Sonrel of Paris, have since been received and approved by the Minister for Finance and it is hoped that the contract for the work will shortly be placed.</P>
    <P>The Abbey has been accepted by the Government and by the people generally as a national theatre with long standing cultural traditions associated with the Irish revival as regards both the national language and the dramatic arts.  Although it is conducted by a private company, the National Theatre Society, it has received annual State assistance since 1925-26.  The current year's provision under this head is £14,000&mdash;Subhead B of Miscellaneous Expenses Estimate.  So long as the grant continues the Government exercises the right of appointing one of the directors.</P>
    <P>By its articles of association, the company is precluded from declaring dividends or paying directors' fees and in the event of the winding up of the company, its assets could not be distributed amongst shareholders but would have to be applied to an approved cultural purpose in Ireland. There is a covenant with the Minister for Finance not to use the new theatre that is to be built for any purpose other than the purposes <Col N="993" /> specified in the articles of association and not to assign, transfer, underlet or part with the possession or control of the premises or any part of them without the Minister's consent.</P>
    <P>It is not possible as yet to give a firm estimate of the total cost of the building proposed to be erected and what proportion thereof will be provided by the National Theatre Society itself which is the owner of the site.  The figure of £250,000 mentioned in Section 2 (1) (a) of the Bill represents the limit of the contribution to be made from the funds of suitors.</P>
    <P>With regard to King's Inns, some two years ago the Chief Justice approached the Government on behalf of the Benchers, who are the controlling body of the Society of King's Inns, to ask for financial assistance because of the difficulties they were experiencing in maintaining the Society's buildings and running its Library notwithstanding that heavy increases had been made in the fees and subscriptions which constitute the Society's principal source of income.</P>
    <P>Later, there was a meeting between the representatives of the Benchers and the Taoiseach at which the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Justice were present at which the matter was fully discussed.  As a result of these discussions and the inquiries which followed, it became evident that the buildings, which were erected at the beginning of the last century, were in danger of falling into ruins unless money could be found to undertake an extensive programme of renovation and repair and that this danger had been much increased by the appearance of dry rot.  Such a programme, it was estimated, would cost about £45,000 to complete.</P>
    <P>Expenditure on this scale is quite beyond the resources of the Society which unlike some of the English Inns of Court has benefited from no rich endowments.  At the same time, the running of the Society's Library has been a heavy financial burden.  Its only income is a grant of £433 a year which was authorised by the Copyright Act of 1836 when the privilege of receiving free books was withdrawn and the <Col N="994" /> whole of this sum has to be expended on the purchase of books and is, in fact, insufficient for that purpose.</P>
    <P>King's Inns was the last work in Dublin of James Gandon, the architect who was responsible for some of our most beautiful buildings.  There is, I believe, agreement amongst those best qualified to judge that the building of which King's Inns constitute the north wing is one of the finest buildings of its kind in Dublin.  In the Government's view, it is well worth preserving. The Library contains a very valuable collection of books.  As well as being used by students and barristers it is open to the public on certain conditions and permission for reading and reference is freely given.  Subsection (4) of section 2 of the Bill provides for the payment to the trustees of the Society of sums totalling £70,000 of which the sum of £25,000 is for the creation of an investment fund and the application of the income thereof for the maintenance of the Library or the general purposes of the Society, the balance being earmarked to recoup or defray the cost of expenditure incurred or to be incurred on the Society's buildings.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned earlier, the funds of suitors have been resorted to from time to time for public purposes.  In general the direction of these appropriations has been for such purposes as the building of the Four Courts, the Public Record Office, the Bar Library and purposes in connection with the Superior Courts in Dublin.  Their use should, I think, be restricted to special cases of a &ldquo;once and for all&rdquo; type which are of a national character though outside the ordinary field of State expenditure.  The Abbey and King's Inns are such cases. It will be observed that, as in the case of previous withdrawals, the Bill affords a complete indemnity to suitors by which they will be absolutely protected from any possible loss.</P>

      <P>I am so pleased with this kind of activity by the State that I do not propose to be critical.  Indeed, I do not propose to discuss Abbey policy, but in view of the statements made in the Dáil I should like the Minister to reassure us in his concluding speech that the people <Col N="995" /> will be amply protected with regard to this £250,000 and that their title to any property there will be clear.</P>

      <P>I think, first of all, we should all like to thank the Minister for his most informative and full introductory remarks.  We welcome the kind of historical details which he was good enough to give us about the King's Inns and the Abbey Theatre.  I simply want to point to the deplorable delay in the rebuilding of the Abbey Theatre. It was partly destroyed in 1951&mdash; eight years ago&mdash;and presumably we shall not have our proper national theatre for another two years.</P>
      <P>I hope the Minister will do all in his power, now that the money has been found, to speed up the rebuilding of the National Theatre.  As I said, it is accepted by the nation as the National Theatre.  I think it is only right to put on record that a former member of this House, W.B. Yeats, was, in a sense, the original creator of the Abbey.  In a biography of him it says that one afternoon, in a garden in the west of Ireland, the idea came to him and to Lady Gregory, and some others, and it is to that afternoon conversation that we owe the Abbey Theatre now.  We are fond of it; we are very critical of it.  It has perhaps declined from its acme but it can recover.  I think it is a sad thing that three successive Governments have allowed that theatre in its original form to lie as a derelict ruin.  Perhaps the Minister will urge on the rebuilding of it as soon as possible.  It is very disappointing for tourists from America and elsewhere to see the present premises which are quite unsuitable and lack the historical atmosphere of the previous building.  I congratulate the Minister on finding the money.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise simply to add my voice to the voices of other Senators in thanking the Minister and the Government for spending money in this way.  The reason I rise on this occasion is that I suppose I am the only member of the Seanad who has <Col N="996" /> been at the same time a director of the Abbey Theatre, a member of the King's Inns and a constant visitor to its library.</P>
      <P>The ordinary Dubliner is quite unaware of the historical nature of King's Inns.  The front of the building faces the derelict Broadstone railway station, where practically nobody ever goes nowadays and the number of people in Dublin who see the garden front of Gandon's building must be quite small. An even smaller number have seen the hall, which, apart from Trinity College, is the finest dining-hall in Dublin. The number in Dublin, or in Ireland, who have seen it must be very small. It is a great pleasure to me to know that that hall is to be kept in a good state.  Many generations of law students, barristers and judges have dined there night after night in good society, with good conversion and convivial living, and preserving the best traditions of the Irish Bar in ideal circumstances. I am extremely pleased as a member of that profession that the hall is to be preserved in good condition.</P>
      <P>Fewer people in Dublin know the Library than know the hall or the history of the building. King's Inns is a little settlement at the end of Henrietta Street scarcely known to the average Dubliner; yet it has a most attractive library with not alone a very fine collection of law books but also a very fine collection of pamphlets and other books relating to Irish history, many of which are unique.  It has always had to be run on too little money.  I think from the cultural point of view that for the Government to put some money into the building up of that library, to maintain the King's Inns dining hall and the Abbey Theatre, is at least one measure which will go through the Seanad with great rapidity.</P>

      <P>There is very little to reply to on this debate except perhaps to Senator Barry's question in which he asked me to ensure that in so far as this is a gift of £250,000 for the rebuilding of the Abbey the public interest will be protected.  I think I made it clear in my opening statement that in the event of the winding up of the <Col N="997" /> company, the premises cannot be disposed of or alienated in any way except with the consent of the Minister for Finance and for certain approved purposes.  The articles of association also provide&mdash;if his remarks refer to the making of ordinary profits&mdash;that the directors may not make profits.  I think there is no danger that the interests of the public will not be properly safeguarded and they are in fact safeguarded in the articles of association.  I do not think there is anything further I might add.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann hereby approves of Control of Imports (Quota No. 50) (Superphosphates) Order, 1959.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. J. Lynch) Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. J. Lynch)</NameTxt>
      <P>Quota Order, No. 50, is the Order which restricts the importation of superphosphate. The Order applies both to single superphosphate and to triple superphosphate. Licences are granted freely for the importation of triple superphosphate. My intention is that this arrangement should continue until such time as the home fertiliser industry is in a position to meet the demand for triple superphosphate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senators will recall that, in October, 1956, the then Government announced that they had decided to arrange for the supply of superphosphate to Irish farmers at world prices, while ensuring that the entire output of the Irish fertiliser industry would be taken up. The implementation of this decision involved the suspension of the 20 per cent. customs duty on superphosphate and the payment of a subsidy to home manufacturers, representing the difference between their economic price and the price of imported superphosphate. <Col N="998" /> In addition, it became necessary to pay a freight subsidy to the Irish manufacturers in order to equate the cost of Irish superphosphate with the cost of imported superphosphate delivered to any part of the country.</P>
    <P>Subsequently, in the 1958/59 fertiliser season, a further subsidy of £4 per ton on both imported and home single superphosphate, as announced in the Government's <i>Programme for Economic Expansion</i>, became operative. The object of this further subsidy was to achieve a rapid expansion in the use of phosphates on grasslands which is one of the main objectives of Government policy.</P>
    <P>As a result of the subsidy scheme, a substantial increase in home production of superphosphate is developing. Plans for increased production, not only by existing manufacturers but also by new entrants to the industry, made it clear to the Government that home production will soon be sufficient to meet the entire home demand for superphosphate, due allowance being made for the increased user of superphosphate by Irish farmers as a result of the subsidy scheme.</P>
    <P>The Government also had regard to the threat of dumping in this country of low-priced Continental superphosphates. In these circumstances, while not interfering with the subsidy, which enables the farmers to obtain their supplies at world prices, reduced by the £4 per ton subsidy, the Government considered it essential to control the imports of superphosphates in the interests of the Irish superphosphate industry and the Order now before the House for confirmation was made by them.  Under the Order, arrangements will be made to allow for imports of superphosphate to balance any shortfall which may arise until the plans of home manufacturers for increased production come to fruition.</P>
    <P>I should say that the statutory requirement is that this Quota Order will cease to have effect under Section 4 (2) of the Control of Imports Act, 1934, within six months from the date of its being made, unless it is approved by each House of the Oireachtas by a resolution passed before the expiration of six months.  The Order imposing <Col N="999" /> the restriction in this case dates as from 1st August, 1959.  It was made by the Government on 28th July, 1959, and therefore it must accordingly be approved before 28th January, 1960. I confidently commend the Order to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Fine Gael Party opposed this Order in the Lower House and that was a decision with which I am in complete agreement. Before considering exactly what this Quota Order means, it is necessary for us to take a view of the fertiliser industry and the special facets of it that are different from those of any other industry.  The first thing you must remember is that there was only one fertiliser or sulphuric acid manufacturer in this country up to the present and at the moment there is still only one.  There is, in fact, a second manufacturer who has stated that he intends to set up a sulphuric acid plant which is necessary for the production of superphosphate but so far that has not been done.  In fact, therefore, the production of superphosphate here of the single type referred to by the Minister is a monopoly. It is entirely in the hands of one manufacturer, or, if not in the hands of one manufacturer, he holds a controlling interest in all the plants that make up the entire production unit for vitriol or sulphuric acid in this country.  In fact, he has nobody to compete with and the price of superphosphate can be fixed at any level he desires, if there is no competition from abroad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Up to some years ago, there was a 20 per cent. tax on superphosphate. This was a prohibitive tax.  For four years, all the tax that was paid totalled £85.  That, I think, is proof enough that it was a prohibitive tax. You might think, therefore, that the industry was completely efficient, that the price was as low as it could be, that 20 per cent. was not so much, but when you come to consider the type of industry it is and the type of article it manufactures and the volume of trade, one finds that five per cent. represents a fortune, and that the sales of superphosphate involve <Col N="1000" /> such large sums of money that 20 per cent. was an efficient prohibitive tax, as evidenced by the fact that for the past four years I scrutinised, the total amount of duty paid was £85.  Somebody, presumably a manufacturer or that individual to whom I have referred, brought in a quantity for trial purposes.</P>
    <P>In 1956, we had a decision of the Government to remove this tax and in order that the 1,500 people engaged in the superphosphate industry should not lose their jobs and so that, at the same time, the Irish farmers could be quite sure of getting superphosphate at world prices, the then Government guaranteed that they would pay the difference between the Irish price and the imported price.  At that time, it was freely admitted that the Irish units were not wholly efficient and in fact that very large sums of money&mdash; I think £1,000,000 was mentioned&mdash; would need to be spent to bring the Irish units up to efficient production standards.  It was hoped as the years passed that this subsidy would vanish as the Irish manufacturer became just as efficient as his English or Continental counterparts and able to compete with them on equal terms.</P>
    <P>We now have this Quota Order and the Minister has just stated that he hoped home production would soon be up to the level at which imports of single superphosphate would be unnecessary. I want to give my personal opinion that it is up to that level now and that in fact while he will freely give licences for triple superphosphate for compounding&mdash;as he said he would&mdash;because it is not manufactured in this country, still, he will find himself in the position of not giving any licence for the imports of superphosphate.  The net result is that this instrument we are asked to pass now is a more efficient blockade than the 20 per cent. tax which prohibited the import of single superphosphate over a period of four years.</P>
    <P>There is a grave danger that the Irish farmer will no longer get his single superphosphate at world prices. I know there is a subsidy of £4 per ton which has come about since.  That is a very good measure but the moneys for that are distinct from the <Col N="1001" /> moneys for the first subsidy.  The first subsidy was as a result of the easing down of both sections of the Land Project; the second subsidy was largely financed by the compulsory ending of Section B.  The net result of this measure will be to let out the Government on the first subsidy and then to leave them with the second subsidy to be paid for by the two withdrawals of money from the Land Project funds.</P>
    <P>It is an extremely intricate piece of finance and I think I should explain. When a man goes to buy something, he has to bargain.  Over the years, he finds the cheapest supplier.  When there is no single superphosphate imported into this country, as I believe there will not be, who will be able to say the price at which superphosphate will be imported?  Nobody will know. You must remember the sort of market you are dealing in.  I know a man who has gone into the fertiliser business.  He compounds his own fertilisers. He set forth from Ireland one day to find out if he could import slag direct.  That is already done by five or six firms and has been done for two decades.  He contracted one firm in London and was told they would not supply him with slag.  He then went to Germany and contacted a second firm which was supposed to have no affiliation with the first.  Yet he was told the minute of the day when, and the place where, he interviewed the first man, and the answer on the second occasion was the same as the first.</P>
    <P>This kind of thing is breaking up all over the Continent, as it is breaking up here.  Various firms are now compounding fertilisers besides the large firms here.  If there is no import of single superphosphates in this country, the Government fixing of an imported price may be faulty.  When one is dealing with large <i>cartels</i>, of which there are probably only two or three on the Continent of Europe, it is difficult to know what price will be fixed for imported superphosphate.  Is it the price fixed for the academic man who merely wants to have a figure, or is it the price that a keen buyer can get by saying: &ldquo;For the next five or six years, I can give you an order for so many <Col N="1002" /> thousand tons; what reduction per ton will you give me on ruling prices?&rdquo;  I do not know, but there is a grave danger that one of the subsidies for single superphosphate will disappear.  That would be of benefit to the Government. I am not saying that the Government would wish it to disappear, but certainly the virtue of keen bargaining cannot exist when the Government merely go out as an academic buyer who will spend no money.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned the threat of dumping of low-priced Continental superphosphate on the Irish market&mdash; that is a nice, round-sounding phrase &mdash;and this threat might mean the disemployment of certain employees of manufacturers here.  I can see the Minister's difficulty.  One must look at it this way.  When we sell our produce abroad at the moment, we are competing in markets with farmers who are paid subsidies before their goods are sold.  For instance, there is the deficiency payment on beef, the deficiency payment on eggs and the deficiency payment on grain.  The farmer sells his grain to the mill at 45/- a barrel, but three weeks later his deficiency payment of 15/- comes from the Government.  We have to compete with that 45/- per barrel. We have to compete in that meat trade where the deficiency payment can be as much as 39/- per cwt.  But at the same time we must not compete with dumping of Continental superphosphates. I can see the Minister's difficulty.  It would be solved completely if it were a fact&mdash;as the Minister seems to believe but I do not believe&mdash;that we are not capable of manufacturing all the superphosphate we want here.</P>

The Minister implied we were not up to full production.  I maintain we always were.  Are we not to be allowed to use any of the superphosphate at world prices?</P>
      <P>What is the world price?  I hold that the dumping price of Continental superphosphate may well be the world price.  I do not know how you will solve the problem between the 1,500 employees and the farmers who must sell on a dumped world market, but I say you have admitted that the farmers in future will not enjoy the first subsidy.  I know you are in an extremely difficult situation.  At the same time, if the Government faced up to the undertaking given by their predecessors&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>You are implementing it but at the same time you are now saying that there is a threat of dumping of low priced Continental superphosphate and therefore you are putting a quota restriction on the import of single superphosphate.  In my view, therefore, it is not being implemented. The Irish farmer will no longer get the benefit of the first subsidy. Whether the first subsidy might be greater or less than the second subsidy, I do not know.  I do not know what the price of dumped continental superphosphate will be, but, if it were only £5 per ton, dumping at that level would mean that the £4 subsidy would be a far lesser subsidy than the first subsidy which is now being dispensed with, in my view.</P>

      <P>It may be that I am not too quick on the uptake but I fail to see what exactly the Senator is complaining about.  His first remarks seemed to have regard to sulphuric acid, an industrial raw material used in the manufacture of superphosphate but used also in many other manufacturing industries.  The Senator said we <Col N="1004" /> had only one producer of sulphuric acid.  I must admit that was news to me.  I thought we had none and that all our supplies were imported.  However, I take the Senator's word for it.  The price of sulphuric acid is of equal importance to others engaged in manufacturing processes in which that commodity is essential.  If the price were causing hardship and if it is true that there is a stranglehold on that raw material, we would have heard bitter complaints from those engaged in manufacturing processes in which sulphuric acid is required and those making the complaint would have their advocates here and in the Dáil. We would know all about the cornering of the market by those engaged in the manufacture of this very important raw material.  We would have heard of the abuse of privilege.</P>

      <P>That would appear to be the principal ground on which the Senator based his case against the making of this Order.  It would be alarming if he should prove to be right. I am not prepared to accept, without further inquiry, that he is correct.  As I have said, there are other manufacturers using sulphuric acid and they would have complained bitterly if the position were as the Senator has stated. They would have their advocates here and in the Dáil on both sides of the House.  If the Minister saw that there was an abuse of a privileged position, surely he would take action and do something to remedy the situation, as any Minister would?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sulphuric acid is imported and, if there were any inclination to exploit, then the acid could be imported and such exploitation prevented.  It would appear from the Senator's remarks that the price of superphosphate manufactured here is somewhat higher than <Col N="1005" /> the price at which it could be imported. That argument applied at one stage to cement.  It was stated it would not be possible to manufacture cement here and sell it at the same price as the huge concerns on the Continent could produce and sell it.  Some of us remember the criticism and the misrepresentation when it was proposed to start the manufacture of cement here.  In the long run, it paid off and to-day we have arrived at the position in which we can produce cement cheaper than it can be imported.</P>
    <P>We must take the long view.  If we close down on the manufacture of superphosphate, the international combines may gang up to sell at a cut price for a short time.  Having stopped the wheels in the mills here, they would then proceed to rake off as much as they could from the Irish farmers.  That has happened elsewhere; it could happen here.  There are times when a surplus can be sold under the cost of production. There was a time when cement was sold here cheaper than it was sold in the country of origin.  With a growing demand for superphosphate, there will be the possibility of an expansion in the industry.  Production will increase; more people will be employed. I hope that that will happen and I hope the price of the home-manufactured article will be fairly competitive.</P>
    <P>I hope, at any rate, that the position will ultimately be arrived at in which we will be able to produce all our superphosphate needs at a reasonably economic price, but we must always have regard to the fact that we are producing an article at home for a small market.  Not being able to go into the economics of the matter, all I can do is express that hope.  I take it that the Minister is reasonably satisfied that that position can be attained and that is why he is asking that this control be kept.  I regard it just as a question of keeping that control.  I should not be as anxious as the Senator seems to be to remove all control.  The Senator may argue that those people selling superphosphate on the Continent are in a combine and that if you sought a quotation from continental countries, you would not get the correct price.</P>

      <P>Senator Donegan's point apparently is that what will be quoted to us is not a reliable figure.  I think that can be got over if we have a record over the past two years of what the prevailing price has been and use it as the basis of a free world price.  In the next year, if there is any variation upwards, <Col N="1007" /> then I think the doubts raised by Senator Donegan will be very well founded.  I think the Minister should try to keep the price at the level at which it has been for the past couple of years so as to demonstrate to the agricultural community that the Government are implementing their promises and at the same time, giving perfectly legitimate protection to Irish industry from indiscriminate dumping.</P>

      <P>How often will you be offered a dumped price?  Senator Donegan is in business and is familiar with the principles on which dumping or cut-prices operation of any description is based.  It is a last ditch effort on behalf of any business-man or combine to put a colleague out of business.  Of course we hear about international <i>cartels</i> in manures, cement or other commodities, and especially in raw materials necessary for industry, but we know very well the price we would have to pay today if we were paying world prices for sugar.  The same argument was used in the case of sugar. We know very well the price we would have to pay for cement and perhaps we may be fortunate enough to know in a few years' time the price we would have had to pay for superphosphate and phosphatic manures.  Surely if we value the industry we have built up here for the manufacture of phosphatic manures, it is up to the Government, in furtherance of their policy of early and late grass&mdash;which is supported by all the producers and farming organisations&mdash;to <Col N="1008" /> give to the manufacturers of those commodities a reasonable measure of support?  That is what this Quota Order sets out to do.  I think it is reasonable and right and I am quite sure the majority in this House will find themselves in agreement.</P>

      <P>I think the Senator thought that I was attacking a particular firm.  I was not.  The clear point is that if the dumped price were £5 a ton and the present price is, say, £13, less £4, which is £9, and if the Government gave a subsidy of £4 2. 6, then every Irish worker in the superphosphate industry would be safe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to compliment Senator Donegan on making a valiant attempt to justify the Fine Gael somersault in the Dáil.  I must admit I was completely taken by surprise by the attitude of the Leader of the Opposition there.  He spoke about the necessity for making phosphatic manures available to farmers and then suddenly said he was going to oppose this Order.  I suggested during the course of the debate that I was doing nothing more than implementing his own decision, or at least that part of it which referred to ensuring that the bulk of the Irish industry would be taken up.</P>
      <P>Both Senator O'Reilly and Senator Carter put their fingers on the weakness of Senator Donegan's case by asking him: what is a dumping price?  A dumping price is regarded in international trading spheres as the price at which a commodity is sold abroad when it is less than the price at which it is sold on the home market.  The occasion for selling a commodity abroad at a price lower than that at which it is sold at home arises, perhaps, in only two instances&mdash;when there is surplus production at home or when there is a competitor growing up in the export market, a competitor supplying the same market whom the original supplier wants to put out of business.  That is the root of the Order in this case, I can assure the Seanad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The difference between the price of imported superphosphate and the economic ex-factory home price per <Col N="1009" /> ton over the past few years amounted to 15/- in 1956-57.  It was the same in 1957-58 and 22/- in 1958-59.  As a result of the subsidy between the world price and the economic, home-manufactured price, there was a certain increase in the use of superphosphate by Irish farmers but as a result of the making available of a subsidy of £4 a ton under the <i>Programme for Economic Development</i>, there was an increased use and as a consequence increased plans for the production of superphosphate by the Irish fertiliser industry.  While it is perhaps, true to say that there is only one producer of sulphuric acid in the country there are in existence four producers of superphosphates and these four and other entrants into the industry plan very much increased production.  I know what the Senator is suggesting by his wry smile&mdash;that of the four I mentioned who are already in the business, one is by far the greatest and that is the one, I take it, to which he refers as the sole producer of sulphuric acid.</P>
    <P>The Senator probably knows better than I do that in the production of superphosphate, there are two main raw materials, phosphatic rock, which we have to buy from North Africa, and sulphuric acid.  As he knows, phosphatic rock represents about 80 per cent. of the constituents of superphosphate and sulphuric acid the balance.  He probably knows also that sulphuric acid is produced here from imported sulphur or pyrites.  We have &ldquo;oodles&rdquo; of pyrites in this country and if somebody could use it for mixing with phosphatic rock to make superphosphate, we should be very happy.  We could at least eliminate the importation of sulphur.</P>
    <P>These are the fundamental facts, but, as I have already said, as a result of the two subsidies, the subsidy to equate the home price with the world price and the £4 subsidy, there was increased user by Irish farmers and increased production by existing Irish producers and plans for further increased production of superphosphate by the existing and by new entrants into the fertiliser industry.  The Dutch fertiliser industry is the traditional <Col N="1010" /> supplier and naturally these industrialists want to hold their Irish market.  When they saw this new business being done in Ireland, this new productive capacity, it was only natural that they should take the usual steps a strong international <i>cartel</i> will take and by various methods of subsidisation, produce at dumping prices.</P>
    <P>They tried to do the same thing here and it was to protect the prevailing economic situation that the Quota Order was introduced and to ensure that the total output of home production of superphosphate would be taken up.  But in so far as it is a Quota Order, it also provides for the importation of whatever amount of superphosphate is required by Irish farmers and that Irish producers will not be able to produce in our home factories.  We shall know in that way what the world price is.  I think it will be necessary to make another Quota Order when this one expires and that means that a certain amount of superphosphate must be imported and again in the second Quota Order period, we shall know what the world price is.</P>
    <P>I would say confidently that I hope the time will be short until we will have sufficient production here to avoid altogether the necessity of importing superphosphate, and not only that, but I am sure we shall have sufficient superphosphate production to generate lively competition between home manufacturers.  That, of course, will tend to keep prices down.  If we can keep prices down to world level, the necessity for the first subsidy will have disappeared.  There will be no necessity to give Irish producers a subsidy to equate prices at which superphosphate will be made available to Irish farmers with the prices at which it could be got by importing it.  I think that makes the picture as it appears at the present time fairly clear; that dumping was about to commence by different means, by devious methods and was in fact in operation; of that there can be no doubt. I cannot see how the Senator could justify the argument that the Irish Government should pay the difference between the dumping price and the home economic price when the undertaking given, in the first instance, was <Col N="1011" /> to provide a subsidy on the basis of the difference between the world price and the home economic price.</P>

      <P>As Senator O'Reilly pointed out, the same argument was made when we were trying to build up the cement industry.  Senator Carter produced another instance in the case of sugar.  I am not going to say that one Government or another were responsible for building up our cement or sugar industries but the fact is that we are in the very happy position that we can produce sugar at lower cost than any other country in the world and, so far as cement is concerned, we can export quite substantial quantities of what is produced here.  I do not know if that stage will be reached as far as superphophate is concerned but certainly with the increased production envisaged and the comparatively small difference now between the home economic price and the world economic price, I do think that stage could well be reached.  There is every case for the adoption of this Quota Order by the House and unless the Senator can make a better case for <Col N="1012" /> it than he has done so far&mdash;even though I commended him on it; he made the best of a bad case&mdash;I fail to see why he, like the Deputies of his Party, should feel it necessary to file into the Division Lobby to do nothing but effect the disemployment of the Irish fertiliser industry workers&mdash;&mdash;</P>
