      <P>On the last occasion, I made the point that the Seanad should take a view of this legislation which it should not take of ordinary legislation.  This is not in the category of ordinary legislation to which the Seanad can put down amendments to be accepted or rejected in the Dáil. The only purpose of the Seanad in voting against this measure is to delay its coming to the people and enabling them to exercise the franchise.  That point cannot be emphasised sufficiently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The system of P.R. it is proposed to abolish by this measure operates in only three provincial areas: Malta, Tasmania and Gibraltar.  The various list systems have been discredited on the Continent in recent years.  Recently, <Col N="488" /> France has seen fit to bring in the straight vote and the single seat constituency in order to provide itself with effective government.  Italy is in chaos at present due to lack of government caused by the multiplicity of Parties in that country.  There is no doubt that if same people could get control of the government there, the Italian Government would also introduce a measure such as that being brought before the Irish people by our Government to abolish this system, which places emphasis on statistical representation and ignores the important factor of providing the community with a Government.</P>
    <P>On the last occasion, I pointed out that this system, which it is proposed to introduce here if passed by the people, exists in the old democracies of Britain and the United States of America, and it operates very well in Canada and New Zealand also.  Only recently, it enabled the Canadian people to reject decisively a Liberal Government that had ruled Canada for a number of years and give power decisively to the alternative Conservative Government.  I was also concerned to rebut the dishonest parallel drawn by Senator Stanford in drawing an analogy between this country and South Africa.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>In that context, I pointed out that in South Africa and the Six Counties, the whole way of life is bedevilled by sectarianism.  The real split is caused by sectarianism.  The constituencies are gerrymandered in order to keep single, monolithic Parties in power and further their own interests.  There is no parallel between the situation there and the situation in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As statistical material in support of that contention, I might quote some figures in connection with election results in the Six Counties during the early 20s when they had a system of P.R. and the results which followed when they abolished P.R. and brought in the straight vote.  In the election of 1921, there were 32 Unionists elected in the Six Counties area, and there were 12 Nationalists elected under an extreme system of P.R., that is, if you <Col N="489" /> include as Nationalists, National Republicans and Sinn Féin.  It is very significant that in 1925 the Nationalist figure remained the same, 12 still, under this extreme system of P.R.</P>
    <P>In 1929, the Six County Government abolished P.R. and introduced the straight vote system.  The result was that, in 1929, there were again 34 Unionists, as there were in 1921 under the P.R. system that existed at that time, and 11 Nationalists, if you include in the Nationalist group Nationalists, Republicans and Sinn Féin.  There was one Nationalist loss to Labour.  There was no Unionist gain.  In 1933, 34 seats went to Unionists and 11 to Nationalists, under the straight vote system.  Any analysis of these figures in 1921 and 1925, before P.R. was abolished, and the figures in 1929 and 1933, after P.R. was abolished, shows quite clearly that the system of election did not make one whit of difference to Nationalist representation in Parliament and that where sectarianism exists and constituencies are gerrymandered to suit the majority sectarian Party, the system of election is an entirely irrelevant factor.  It is quite significant that the minority in this country, the only minority that exists, namely the Protestant Unionist minority, have no fears in the matter either.</P>

      <P>It is quite clear that the idea behind the P.R. system is on the run in Europe as a whole as an exact statistical representation system, and I think in our time we will see it go.  However, the argument does not alone rest on that.  The argument further rests on how this system has operated here over a number of years. I think we should get down to an analysis of that.  Has it operated here well?  I do not think it has.  I think the straight vote system will make for a real improvement to giving us effective Government.  One has only to look, first of all, at the elections prior to the one when the first Coalition Government came into power to see what I mean by that.  In 1932 and 1933 there were two elections in order to provide the people with a Government, two elections in successive years.  In 1937 and 1938 there were again two elections which the people had to face in order to provide themselves with effective Government.  In 1943 and 1944 there were two elections in successive years before the people could decisively exercise their choice and give themselves a Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach's only concern on these occasions was to provide the people with a Government which had the consistent support of a majority in Dáil Éireann.  If any Government is to function it must have a disciplined group of people in Parliament supporting that Government.</P>

      <P>Otherwise you have chaos and anarchy.  In 1932 and 1933, there was grave danger of the country degenerating into anarchy because of the extra-judicial actions of certain people who had supported the Government prior to 1932.  There was ample evidence that this system of P.R. was wasteful in leading to this duplication of elections every four or five years.  In 1948, we had a Coalition Government for the first time.  It lasted for three years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>It might be no harm to analyse why that first Coalition Government fell, because the manner of its falling was typical of the weakness inherent in the Coalition Government idea.  It fell because a classical minority splinter group, the Clann na Poblachta Party, had a row among its own members.  It was a classical splinter group and, within its own members, rows and dissension broke out and two Ministers in that Party, represented in the Coalition Government, broke very decisively; the result was the Government itself was forced to break up.  Now, that will not happen if you have a single disciplined Party&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;which consistently supports the Government in Dáil Éireann.  If a particular Minister happens to disagree with the view of his other Cabinet Ministers, in such a Government supported by such a Party, there will not be any split in the Cabinet, or any withdrawal of support by a small segment of the Party supporting the Government.  The inherent weakness in the Coalition idea is that you have members in Government, representative of various Parties, who are responsible primarily not to the Government in which they are participating or to one major Party supporting the Government but, as in this particular case, to a small <Col N="492" /> group of nine or ten in a Party; and, in that particular case, two of the Ministers in the Cabinet were supported by nine or ten members of a splinter group and, when that group broke up and withdrew its support, the Government itself was forced to break up.</P>
      <P>However, I do not think the situation then, bad as it was, was anything like as bad as the position which existed when the second Coalition Government went into its death throes&mdash; and that is only two short years ago. In February and March of 1957 we had the ludicrous position, which was a laughing matter to the people of the country at the time and put us in a ludicrous light, where three members, the members of a three-Party splinter group&mdash;this time, again, the shrunken Clann na Poblachta Party&mdash;were able to upset a popular Parliament, Dáil Éireann, composed of 147 members. We had a Government at the time staggering along with various troubles and dissensions.  What toppled them? Three members out of a Parliament of 147.  The three members of Clann na Poblachta withdrew their support in February 1957 and then the Taoiseach was forced to abandon Government and go to the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That sort of situation cannot be allowed to happen here again and a lot of thinking people who never voted for Fianna Fáil in their lives before also thought in March 1957 that that situation should not be allowed to happen again.  I think anybody who analyses the situation then will agree that the reason we got the majority we did in March 1957 was that a lot of thinking people saw that that sort of ludicrous situation could not be allowed to happen again if the country was to progress in any degree whatsoever.  We are now merely reiterating the decision that was made then rejecting the coalition form of Government.  This measure of ours is a reiteration of the people's wish, as expressed in March 1957, and their utter rejection of the coalition principle.  This measure on which we are asking the people to decide, will merely ask them to reiterate their votes of March, 1957, rejecting Coalition Government not merely for <Col N="493" /> one statutory term but for ever.  That is the main purpose of the measure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The only reason the P.R. system staggered along for the number of years it did&mdash;it did not work well&mdash;was that, until recently, people were very sharply divided on the Treaty issue and on the various constitutional issues of the 1930s, issues which divided the people sharply into black and white, for and against.  That sharp division which went down through all strata in society, and all professions and people, no longer operates, so that the disintegrating effects of P.R. have become evident in recent years and in all likelihood will probably continue to get worse if the system is not got rid of, and I am confident the people will get rid of it.</P>
      <P>To put it in a nutshell, the proposal is one to give the people more effective government and the net issue involved is whether you believe in government or statistical representation.  Which do we want&mdash;decisive effective government or Parliament as a talking shop, a debating society representative of minute interests and groups in the community?</P>
      <P>That is the real issue and, mind you, some years ago, in 1924, the Leader of a then minority Labour Party in the House of Commons was not concerned with perpetuating himself or his Party by some fancy method of P.R.  As reported in column 2022, Volume 172 of <i>Hansard</i>, Mr. Herbert Morrison, speaking on behalf of a number of minority Labour Party members on a measure which was put to a free vote of the House of Commons and decisively rejected, that the straight vote system in Britain should be abandoned and P.R. introduced, said:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;P.R. is a philosophy which is not unnatural to small new parties struggling to get a footing on the electoral field, and not having much staying power or pluck to fight.  It is also perfectly natural to decaying political parties, who are doomed to extinction in the course of time, and who can only retain their position by elevating the power of the minority <Col N="494" /> and subjecting the power of the majority.  It is perfectly natural to them, but it is not natural to strong men and women who want their country to be governed wisely and firmly, and I hope, therefore, that the House will not accept that type of government.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In other words, the P.R. system is not natural to strong men and women who want their country to be governed wisely and firmly.  Surely those words should inspire us in this matter and enable all Parties to face up to the challenge of giving the people that firm, effective and organised government that is so necessary.</P>
    <P>Only recently, it was the view of many responsible people who, I venture to say, are still in the Fine Gael Party.  In 1947, the Electoral (Amendment) Bill was being debated in the Seanad.  It was introduced by Deputy MacEntee, the then Minister for Local Government, and it proposed an alteration in the constituencies and the present Leader of the Fine Gael Party in the Seanad, Senator Hayes, as reported in Volume 34, column 1035 of the Seanad Debates made a very categorical statement which showed that, at that time anyway, he was thinking responsibly.  He is still in the Fine Gael Party and he is still the Leader of that Party here, thanks be to God, and I hope that even at this late stage he may begin to think as responsibly as he thought ten years ago.  The statement is a very categorical one:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;These seat constituencies are not as good, from the point of view of representation and workability, as the British single non-transferable vote constituency.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>It might be no harm to mention again the very categorical utterance of the Senator on that occasion:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Three seat constituencies are not as good, from the point of view of representation and workability, <Col N="496" /> as the British single non-transferable vote constituency.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I agree throughly.  The important thing is not representation; the important thing is to protect democracy. There is a very admirable definition of democracy in the book <i>Election and Representation</i> by Professor Hogan, a professor in U.C.C., and in none of the three essential ingredients of democracy which he sets out does the question of representation or exact representation arise.  The first of these ingredients is that the governed must have the power to change their governors without recourse to violence. I suggest that that is fairly well known as that provision is already embodied in the Constitution.  It must be done every five years.</P>
    <P>The second ingredient is that there should be a known and equal system of law, safeguarded by an independent judiciary, as distinct from an arbitrary law which does not have regard to the protection of the rights of the ordinary citizen and the third essential ingredient which he gives is that every law-abiding citizen should have the freedom to speak as he likes, to think as he likes and to vote as he likes, without the fear of being victimised, as a consequence, by his employer, whether his employer happens to be a private individual, a public or a private body, or even the State.</P>
    <P>The question of exact minute representation does not arise at all in discussing the question of democracy. There should be such representation or such participation of the people as is consistent with the provision of government for the people and the safeguarding of fundamental rights. These rights are fundamentally guaranteed in our Constitution and we have an independent judiciary to protect them.</P>
    <P>There is another point that comes back to this question of minorities or created minorities again.  My point is that there is only one minority in the real sense of the word, but there are plenty of created minorities.  Any man in the street can create a minority himself.  We have a very highly integrated community here in this <Col N="497" /> country of ours.  Thanks be to God, there are no extremes of wealth or power or status or position.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DominickMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>We have no extremes. We have the two major national Parties which are properly organised vertically and not horizontally.  They cut up through all strata in society. The two national Parties include people from various categories of society&mdash; professional men, trade unionists, farmers, businessmen.  They are not organised on any class basis.  I fail to see why we should bring into the Constitution or into our system here any of the class conscious Parties which so bedevil politics elsewhere.  It is a very good thing, and it is a source of strength in our community, that the two major national Parties, Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael, are organised on a vertical rather than a horizontal basis.  Anybody who knows this country can see that.</P>
      <P>I come from a country area as do many other Senators.  I know businessmen, farmers and trade unionists living around me, who all have the same ambition in life and roughly the same economic status in their own particular category, and yet who may vote for Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael or Clann na Talmhan.</P>
      <P>This is an integrated community. Therefore, why create minorities? What is the point?  Minorities in an integrated community only start dissension, breed trouble and strife.  In fact, the net conclusion&mdash;and the record is there&mdash;is that these created minorities are merely created by particular political leaders who are anxious for power and the only function of the political Parties which result from created minorities is to give power and office to a few grasping men who make up that minority.</P>

      <P>They hold the gun to a responsible Party's head at certain times and say: &ldquo;We want Ministry A or Ministry B.&rdquo;  Clann na Poblachta <Col N="498" /> is a classical example of how such a splinter group can function and hold the gun to a responsible Party's head.  I see no reason at all for a number of artificially created small Parties in this community&mdash;in an integrated community.  Two or three major Parties which develop over the years can absorb all shades of thinking and views which exist in a community.</P>
      <P>Senator Stanford in his criticism of this measure spoke about the stability of stagnation.  He disagreed fundamentally&mdash;he can correct me if I am wrong&mdash;with the development of Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil over the years.</P>

      <P>I agree with Senators Stanford and Sheehy Skeffington on this question of stability being open to a dangerous interpretation.  You may have stability at a lower level; <Col N="499" /> to that extent I am with the Senator. My proposition would be that the stability which would result from a measure like this would be a dynamic stability, a progressive stability and a stability which would at every election enable the people to have an alternative system put before them.  To that extent, the straight vote system would provide a dynamic which would always enable Parties to be responsible to the community and to produce their policy before an election so that the people could decisively accept or reject whatever political Party they wanted.</P>
      <P>The straight vote system will give that dynamic which will enable us to have stability and at the same time enable a change to be made decisively and definitely so that there will always be an upward progression in politics and in the views expressed by political Parties.  The straight vote system will provide that dynamic which is so necessary.  I think that the tendency of the P.R. system is towards giving this stagnant effect in political life. Under the present system of P.R. people are never given the opportunity of deciding decisively to accept or reject.  You only have shifts round the middle.  You have one Party shifted out of office by a few votes and another Party coming in by a few votes.  That has been the pattern here in recent years and it will be the pattern <i>ad infinitum</i>, if we do not wish to change it.  Under the present system you will never have the pendulum going one way or the other decisively. You may have people of no ability being elected, time in, time out.</P>

      <P>In my view P.R. inherently develops towards stability of stagnation, whereas under the straight vote system people can make a change decisively and provide the dynamic. The exact quotation of Senator Stanford will be found at column 330, Volume 50, No. 5 of the Official Report.  It is as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The other system will stabilise...&rdquo;</P>

      <P>By perpetuating Parties and people in Parliament the P.R. system leads inevitably to stagnation and that tendency has been fought against in this country to a certain extent by one Party which has refused to take part in bargaining.  The straight vote system will lead to progression upwards instead of stagnation, whilst it will enable the people to make a change decisively.  That is why I am concerned that this measure should get the approval of the Seanad.  It is a measure designed to strengthen democracy, the institutions of the State and ensure that our people will be able to use the democratic institutions and provide themselves with a Government at the same time.</P>
      <P>The other leg of this proposal is the question of the single seat constituency. I think that whatever the merits or demerits of the straight vote system may be, every reasonable person&mdash;I have spoken to all of them&mdash; is in agreement that the single seat system is the very best one.  Apart from the issue of the transferable vote, the idea of the single seat system, which is one leg of this measure, is a very good one.</P>

      <P>I have no doubt that the single seat system will give you a better public representative.  In the Dáil it will produce Independent representatives of the type of Deputy Sheldon and others who supported this <Col N="501" /> measure although they were under no Whip from the Fianna Fáil Party. That type of Independent mind will always get in.  I have no doubt that the good Independent, when standing in his constituency, will always get in under the single seat system.  I further say that the political Parties will be forced now to select better candidates. A candidate must be good in order to get in, in a small area of 20,000 to 30,000 people who know him and know his position in the community.</P>
      <P>A candidate must be a good candidate if he is to succeed in that type of constituency.  Political Parties will have to select better and better candidates in order to secure the election of their particular man in such a constituency. I think that a closer relationship between such a candidate and his constituents will result.  This will place greater emphasis on the T.D., apart from being a delegate from the constituency, being a legislator in Parliament. It will place greater emphasis on his importance as a public representative besides being a delegate from his constituency and he will be participating more closely in the Government of the country.  Deputy Sheldon brought out that point very well in the Dáil, that there will be more emphasis on the T.D.'s primary function, which is that of a legislator rather than that of a delegate.</P>
      <P>The single seat idea is unanswerable, in my view.  Those with any association with politics know the demoralising competition going on in constituencies between T.D.s in the multiple seat constituencies.  There are four or five Deputies writing about the same thing, making representations about the same thing and competing against one another.</P>

It will enable him to act better as a legislator and, all in all, it will lead to the development of a better type of person as a representative in our national Parliament.</P>
      <P>Before I finish, there are one or two more things I should like to say. Senator Stanford, who spoke eloquently against the measure, expressed a certain wish&mdash;I think I am quoting him exactly this time&mdash;to shift the emphasis from Government to Parliament.  I think that was the tendency of his remarks.  That is impracticable in this day and age.  In the classical days of 200 years ago, when Britain was the classical example, Parliament was representative not of the mass of the people but merely of a particular oligarchy.  That was a time when Parliament was composed of men who wrote long speeches and spoke eloquently for hours on end. That day has gone.  The primary function of Parliament, in this day and age, is to act as the people's representative and to give the people a Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamStanford" hpid="Professor Stanford Professor Stanford">
      <NameTxt>Professor Stanford</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Senator is commenting on my remarks, may I just say that what he means is that the 18th century is 200 years ago?  Is that what it comes to?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not get that point.  The point I am trying to make is that I disagree with him on that fundamental desire of his to shift the emphasis from Government to Parliament. In this modern age, the State has rightly made a great intrusion and rightly it has taken over a lot of things that were unheard of in the <i>laissez faire</i> days.  That is a good thing and I agree with the Labour Party in that respect.  We in this country have taken the lead decisively in that respect. The State here has entered many fields, with great success.  I do not need to elaborate on the success of Bord na Móna or Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann to provide a basis for that argument.  The State has a responsibility, in this day and age, to provide an economy which is worth while for the people in the community.  To that extent, I think emphasis on Parliament <Col N="503" /> rather than on Government is something which is impracticable at present.</P>
      <P>The point made by Senator O'Brien earlier on was that the Government, in introducing this measure, was distracting the community, that this was a distraction and therefore unnecessary.  I fail to see that.  Surely, if a Government are working well and decisively, they can attack on many fronts at the one time?  Even though we place much attention on this measure&mdash;and rightly so&mdash;and regard it as of particular importance, the Government are going ahead on all the other fronts on which Senator O'Brien would like them to go. The White Paper issued last year provided for a realistic, long-term planning and organisation of all our resources, to raise the standard of living over the next five to seven years. Senator O'Brien will agree with that, and that is sufficient evidence in itself that the Government are thinking decisively in the economic sphere as well as in the constitutional sphere.</P>
      <P>In the 1930s, the Fianna Fáil Government of that period were able to do the same thing&mdash;they went along on the constitutional sphere and that did not deter them from progressing in the economic sphere as well.  In that context, I can do no better than quote from the <i>Irish Review and Annual</i>, a supplement to the <i>Irish Times</i> published on the 1st of January of this year.  In its economic section, it refers to the Government White Paper and the developments arising out of it in the industrial and agricultural spheres.  It emphasises the expansion of funds, for instance, for the Industrial Credit Company, from £2,500,000 to £20,000,000; it deals with the subsidy for phosphatic fertilisers and with the new cattle credit scheme arranged by the N.F.A.; and with the availability of capital from the banks because the banks are cooperating on account of the confidence they have in the Government of the day.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not dealing further with that, but there is one <Col N="504" /> matter there which is rather pertinent and I should like to finish on that point.  It is an answer to Senator O'Brien's argument that this measure is one of distraction and that there is no progress on other matters.  The <i>Review and Annual</i> I have mentioned says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;A bewildering succession of new developments marked the year 1958 in the Irish economy.  New events and new ideas crowded the scene, and a new spirit, very different from the dejection of 1956 and most of 1957, motivated the actors.  No sector of the economy was left untouched by these developments&mdash; agriculture, industry, external trade, finance, and the Government sector were all affected in varying degrees by the quickening tempo of economic activity and the recovery of confidence in future prospects.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>If that is regarded as distraction, I feel the people will welcome that form of distraction.  I see no reason why, while pressing ahead on the economic side, the Government should not introduce this measure to ensure that future Governments will be able to act decisively and effectively in the economic sphere in the future, as this Government are doing at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I find myself in trouble because I am in opposition to the last speaker.  He thinks I shall support a mere talking shop and says that what he wants is an efficient Government. I shall try to demonstrate where we disagree.  I must be brief, as many speakers have been too long about this.</P>
      <P>I shall start off by asking the Taoiseach, who is present, who has asked for this change?  The Taoiseach himself stated in public that it will be a considerable struggle to do this job. He has said: &ldquo;You must take off your coats to get it put through&rdquo;. There is no public demand for this. The people who have used this system for almost 40 years have not grumbled at it.  Therefore, we must examine that system itself, because of the criticism of it which there has been in the last four months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="505" /> On paper, P.R. seems to be a good system.  It was admitted by people like Arthur Griffith, who is dead, the Taoiseach who is alive, thank God, Winston Churchill who is also alive, and John Costello who was the Leader of the previous Government, that it was a good system and a fair system. I think it is the duty of this House to examine in what way did that system so fall down in the past two years, and only in the past two years, as to compel the Leader of the Government to attempt to bring this change into operation.  Have we had that kind of examination of this system by Government speakers during the past four or five weeks?  I do not think we have.  Every speech we have heard from the Government side, including the last speech by a very promising young man, Senator Lenihan, have all been die-stamped out of the Party office.</P>
    <P>If one goes back over the systems of electing Governments, it will be found that there were four or five systems.  The first one was force&mdash; you got government by force.  The second one was that which gave you a Government by caste, by class.  In the last century, you got government by limited franchise; later on, at the beginning of this century, you got government by full franchise for males, and in our time we got government by complete franchise for all people, whether male or female, over 21 years of age.  Then, in some countries, you obtained P.R. I think that development was progressive and I want to ask can we undo any one of these steps without uneasiness?</P>
    <P>At the moment, the Prime Minister of Ghana, one of the new countries which are growing up in the African continent, has, I think, rather primitive, and if I might say so, aggressive, ideas about government.  He was interviewed about a month ago and a report of that interview can be found in the columns of the world's Press.  It concerns a proposal of his that perhaps in that country they might dispose of elections.  He said they could do that only by having an election about it.  They would have to give the people a referendum, but, if the <Col N="506" /> people by referendum agreed to have no more elections, then it would be a completely democratic process.  I do not want to use words, or put words into the mouth of anybody on this side of the House, that might offend the Taoiseach, but that is the position that we should be careful about, that there should be no more elections.</P>
    <P>We have not been proud of many things in this country, but, since 1922, we have been proud in talking to Englishmen, Canadians and Australians and all the people being quoted here in this House and in the other House, that we have a system of election that is of the fairest possible kind.  I think we did feel a bit superior about having that system whereby we could elect our parliamentarians, and I want to ask: are we throwing something away by discarding it?  The Taoiseach himself said many years ago that we were very lucky in having P.R. and I often felt, when speeches were made about the British, that P.R. is a bit too intelligent for them.  We are a much more intelligent people and I do not think we should discard P.R. and go back to the British system.</P>
    <P>In our private lives, do we get our own way about anything?  I certainly do not get my own way about anything in my private life.  By the time I have finished dealing with my bank manager, my business associates, and my family, I find I must adjust myself to every one of their points of view, and I am surrounded by frustration. I am surrounded by unkindness, the kind of thing the Taoiseach quarrels about.  I am neither a lawyer nor a mathematician, but I do think that I have to put up with that kind of thing in my private life, my business life, my community life and my public life. There is not one of us in this House who is not uneasy, in the most efficient way of being uneasy, when we start to reduce standards as we are reducing them by this Bill, when we try to play smartly as we are playing smartly now.  I was going to say &ldquo;when we play politics&rdquo; because we have all guilty consciences occasionally about the way we do play politics, but I want to say in this House now, so that it will be recorded in the debates, that <Col N="507" /> there is a short-lived cleverness in politics.  I think the Taoiseach is one of the men in this House who should realise that.</P>
    <P>Why should we not have trouble in Government?  Why should Government not be troublesome?  Why should we not have to take account of the minds of the people who disagree with us?  I have to live with my fellow people in a very troublesome way; I have to give way to them in many directions.  I have to forgo many of the things I want. Whether I am in a family, in a private business, in a private community, in a large community, in a Government, even in a Cabinet, as the Taoiseach is, I will find I have to adjust my point of view.</P>
    <P>But what kind of a quick solution policy is this we are proposing now? It is pitched for the simples&mdash;and there are many simples in our land. Therefore, it is a great wrong for a man to do who knows what a wrong it is.  Every one of us here knows that life is not like that.  In families, in communities, in Parliament or even in Cabinets, do those of us who are not simples not know that this provides no solution of any kind for any of the difficulties that confront this country at the moment?  When those simple people have been induced by the tar barrel&mdash;and they will be induced by the tar barrel&mdash;to agree to this, will they have done anything that will solve these problems that are before us now?  We will get an improvement of some kind from a Government point of view for, maybe, five or ten years.  A temporary realignment of men might happen but it will be only temporary because the Irish people will not be pigeon-holed indefinitely.</P>
    <P>When it is all done, we shall have to ask ourselves: &ldquo;What did we do it for?&rdquo;  Our last stage will be far worse than our first because you will only temporarily change the results of the game by changing the rules of a game.  But, if you begin all over again, you must begin with a very disillusioned people and it is we in <Col N="508" /> this Parliament who will have made that disillusionment possible.  I want the Taoiseach to stop this before it goes any further, before he unleashes something he might not be able to contain.  I appeal to the Taoiseach to stop it, above all, because it is unfair and because he said before that it is unfair.</P>
    <P>Bear in mind that the difficulties of Government and the difficulties of men in their private lives are not perhaps laid on us by God for anything except our completion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOGrady" hpid="Mr. O'Grady Mr. O'Grady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Grady</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like, at the start, to pay tribute to the speech made by Senator Cole which, in my opinion, was the most useful contribution yet made to this debate.  If our friends on the opposite benches are sensible men, they will keep a copy of that speech for future reference because, unlike them, he holds out hope, which they seem to have abandoned. I, for one, cannot understand why they take such a pessimistic view of the future.</P>
      <P>Senator Cole also made a very useful contribution with reference to what has been described as the minority.  He pointed out that these men, naturally enough, after the change of Government here and having regard to their previous outlook, were slow to come in and to take a full part under the new position which had arisen, but that the younger generation are now happily playing their part.  As Senator Cole has said, they realise that, under the new system of the straight vote, they will have an opportunity of getting the fair representation which they failed to get under the P.R. system.  It is a fact that, under the P.R. system, they have secured only half the representation to which their numerical strength would entitle them.  I hope, and I think every man and woman in the House hopes that, under the new system, they will come in and play their part.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must all remember that, in days gone by, that minority supplied many of our greater leaders.  I need only mention the names of Wolfe Tone, Lord Edward Fitzgerald, Robert Emmet and, later, John Mitchel, <Col N="509" /> Thomas Davis, and all the others. Please God, in the future we will obtain new recruits from that minority who will play their full part in the political life of this country and who will provide us, as they did before, with men of the standard of Charles Stewart Parnell.  If they do, I think we can look forward to a happier and a better future in this country.</P>
    <P>I think that, if it were necessary to point out how that could be done, I would refer any of those who might be interested to what has happened in another national organisation in which the minority have played a full and a major part.  I refer to the National Farmers' Association where they have come in and given of their ability. That ability and that capacity has speedily been acknowledged by their colleagues in that organisation in which they have been elected to the highest positions of honour and responsibility. I make bold to say that the same remarks hold for the trade unions.  I am sure that, in the trade union movement, the fact that as man at one time belonged to the minority but is now playing his full part in that movement will not debar him from being promoted to the highest position.</P>
    <P>We are told there is perfect unanimity on the other side of the House and that they are all solidly of opinion that this change is the most ruinous ever contemplated for the people.  I doubt if they have that much solidarity behind them.  I have read most of the speeches made in the Dáil and I observed that there was a notable exception.  A very prominent member of the Fine Gael Party and a former Minister of the Coalition Government, if I remember rightly, took no part at all in the debate and, as far as I can recall, voted only once in the Divisions.  That is very far from the unanimity we have heard about.</P>
    <P>Was that the view of the Fine Gael Party in the days gone by?  I just happened to see a report of a speech made by the Vice-President of the Cosgrave Administration, Earnán de Blaghd, who was also a Minister for Finance.  Speaking recently at a meeting of a debating society in Bray, at which he presided, he is reported as <Col N="510" /> follows in the <i>Irish Press</i> of 10th instant:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;If we have a multiplicity of Parties the coalition is formed after the election and not before it and the voters are given no opportunity on it or on the programme adopted for the purposes of the coalition until too late&mdash;that is until after the next election.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The system which enabled a Government to be formed by a single Party or by a more or less permanent coalition of Parties was more democratic than that under which opposing groups sink their differences after the election and adopt programmes which were never put before the electors at all.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I do not believe that under a straight vote the next election would give Fianna Fáil such an overwhelming majority that the Opposition would be reduced to impotence.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now, I am sure that neither Senator Cole nor Earnán de Blaghd would be accused of being strong supporters of Fianna Fáil but they gave their views independently.  I wish that those who are at present opposing this motion would take these views into account&mdash;&mdash;</P>

This kind of bickering across the House is not likely to commend itself to the support of the people at large, nor of those who will read the reports.  If we could get away from these petty bickerings perhaps we would do better work for the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it is freely admitted, on all sides, that where you have P.R. on it causes a fungus growth of small Parties with unstable Government and consequent damage to the economy, by scaring away would-be investors, <Col N="511" /> both national and external, as capital is very sensitive to political unrest. For examples of the disastrous consequences which may arise, and which have arisen in recent times, we have only to turn to Iceland during the recent fisheries dispute when the Coalition Government fell because of the defection of one small section of that Government.  In Finland a similar state of affairs obtained during the recent Russian threat and a similar state has obtained in France over the years.  It is the position of France that has convinced me that the sooner we change the system the better it will be for the future of our people.</P>
    <P>In Italy at the present time you have a stalemate and I should like everybody seriously to consider what might happen here in the future.  All the Leaders of the principal Parties in this House are now getting on in years. They cannot last for ever and if we look into the future, say, in ten, 15 or 20 years' time, when new generations will have grown up, you may have a new alignment of Parties altogether.  If the P.R. system is to be continued you may have 15 or 20 different Parties, with none strong enough to form a Government.  Then the bargaining will have to take place; you will have Governments collapsing as happened before and the country will be left in the position in which Italy finds itself, with a stalemate and no Government.  That has frequently happened during various crises in France over the past 15 to 20 years.</P>
    <P>These are the reasons I feel very strongly on this issue and why I appeal to the Seanad to allow this measure to pass and to leave it to the ultimate authority on all such subjects &mdash;the people.  If they wish to make a change let them.  If they want to retain the present system they will vote for its retention but it is our duty to point out the defects in the present system, and its dangers to the State and the rising generation.</P>
    <P>As we are all aware, Fianna Fáil has at present an overall majority and will continue in office for the full term.  Undoubtedly Fianna Fáil has <Col N="512" /> done well under P.R. and Fine Gael and the Labour Party, and other Parties, should not be so terribly fond of it.  They have not made so very much progress under the system.  Fine Gael has not gained so much under it and the Labour Party was stronger numerically in 1923 than they are to-day. Why have they not progressed? What is there to debar either of these Parties, or any other Party that might arise, from proclaiming a policy that will have wide national appeal under capable leadership?</P>
    <P>These are the two points which make it essential, and possible, for any Party to get the support of the people.  Neither Fianna Fáil nor any other Party can form a Government and continue in office without the support of the people.</P>
    <P>The mere fact that Fianna Fáil have been in government for such a lengthy period is due to the fact that they had a policy and that they had a Leader. Mark you, all the remarks of the Opposition have, with a few notable exceptions, been directed to abusing that Leader.  Why?  Because they have failed to produce a Leader themselves and they are jealous of the Fianna Fáil Party and its Leader.  That is why they are cutting their own political throats, because I do not believe personal abuse of any political representative is going to gain the support of the Irish people.  They will find that out in the near future when the referendum comes up for a decision by the people.  They will be taught and other lesson of the type frequently taught them in the past.</P>
    <P>I do not see why if either of these Parties, or any other Party, should come along and provide the people with an alternative policy, and with capable leadership, they could not go to the country and get a clear majority, as Fianna Fáil hopes to do in the next election.</P>

      <P>Well, the people will decide that.  I do not support to be a prophet at all.  I say that in all sincerity.  Senator Cole stole my <Col N="513" /> thunder.  I had a few points in mind before this debate started but he has come along and has made them with more authority than I could command.</P>
      <P>There is nothing to prevent any of these Parties, even under the new system, from putting their policy before the people.  They failed to do that in the past.  Because of their failure, I think they should be the strongest supporters of this change.  It is not the system of voting that makes the difference; it is the policy and the leadership which can enable any Party to get a sufficient majority.  I should like to emphasise that for the benefit of those whom it may concern.</P>
      <P>It is argued, of course, that under the new system Fianna Fáil will gerrymander the country.  I think that is a physical impossibility for any Party even to attempt, and the Fianna Fáil Party is not composed of fools. Fianna Fáil realises that in order to have a good Government you must have a good Opposition.  Senators in opposition may sneer at it if they will, but for that reason, I advise them to examine their past with a view to improving their policy and leadership if they hope to form a Government ever again.  There was a time when Fine Gael could hope for sufficient support from the people to enable them to form a single Government.  I hope they will reach that position again and if they fail I hope Labour will fill the gap.  We must have a strong Opposition because only thus can you have good Government under our democratic system.</P>
      <P>It is said that the constituencies can be gerrymandered and the Opposition have objected to the appointment of a judge of the High or the Supreme Court&mdash;&mdash;</P>

It is said also that the youth of the country are not taking part in our political life. Such remarks are not calculated to get the young people to take a serious interest in promoting the welfare of the nation.</P>
      <P>If the Opposition would take to heart the very sensible advice tendered to them by an Independent member of the House, Senator Cole, they could benefit by it, and the nation, as a result, would profit accordingly.  I sincerely hope the House will pass the Bill and leave it to the people of the country to decide by free vote whether they want the present system of P.R. to continue or whether they want to change over to the direct vote.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>As a relatively young man who came into politics in 1954, I have nothing but reverence for the men of the past.  I regard this Bill as the most important one to come before the Oireachtas since I was privileged to enter it.  I have given it quite a lot of study and the first thing that struck me was the very clear analogy between the main argument used by the Taoiseach for the abolition of P.R. and his behaviour in regard to the measure itself.</P>
      <P>The main plank of his argument is that it leads to Coalition Governments. I do not concede that, but he says Coalition Governments are bad because they can bargain after the election and do not need to put their policy of bargaining before the people prior to the election.  I do not agree that that is a sound argument but it was used by the Taoiseach.  Why then did the Taoiseach not state before the last election that he intended to introduce this Bill?  I am sure this matter has not come up in the last two years. If the Taoiseach has been considering this matter I am certain he has been considering it for more than two years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Why did he not say at the last election: &ldquo;If I am elected and if I have a majority in the Dáil and the Seanad&rdquo;&mdash;as, of course, he would have&mdash;&ldquo;I shall seek a referendum from the people for the abolition of P.R.&rdquo;?  If he submits that it is politically dishonest for two or three groups <Col N="515" /> elected by the people to come together and form a majority Government after the election, is it not dishonest for him to do what he is now doing&mdash;submitting this matter to a referendum by the people because of his majority in the House&mdash;when he did not say he was going to do so before the election?  I should like him to answer that.  I think it is a serious charge that he did not include it at the last election in his election programme of statement of policy and I think it is incumbent on him to answer that charge when he replies to the debate.</P>
    <P>I do not want to quote Malta, Gibraltar or anywhere else.  I leave that to statisticians or people who, perhaps, have a better opportunity to study them than somebody who does not have as much time as perhaps he should have to devote to politics.  The first thing that strikes me about this Bill is something that I do not think has been mentioned yet&mdash;the danger of the individual member becoming what I call a proprietary politician, the man with the safe seat, or the type of man who is not fair-minded and who tries to seek all the favours for his own side and tries to use his position as a member of the Oireachtas to get favours and positions for his supporters. He may find himself at the end of five years of government in an impregnable position in that constituency. That is a most dangerous possibility.</P>
    <P>I do not say the present Government have a large number of that type of person among their members nor that we on this side have them, but I believe it is a dangerous possibility that any individual could be in a position in which he could get quasi-permanent positions for his supporters as temporary postmen, or other appointments in post offices by the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs. There is the danger that he could get all those minor posts which do not come under the Civil Service Commission given to his own supporters and thus make his position impregnable after, say, five years.</P>
    <P>I have found all over Ireland individual conditions the type of which <Col N="516" /> persists in areas where certain individuals have succeeded in that aim.  I shall not mention names or places but there is a place in Ireland where a housing society has been formed and the people of that area believe that, if they do not go to a particular, individual in the Party, they will not get a loan or a grant to build a house or get a grant for the reconstruction of a dwelling.  There is a great danger that if such persons became numerous on any side of the House, and behaved in that way in single member constituencies, they would become impregnable, and arguments on policy, on legislation carried out by the Government in office, would not matter twopence.  Such men would occupy those seats until they died, not because of their ability as legislators nor the ability of the Government they supported to carry out a policy or to behave in accordance with the people's interests, but on the basis of the favours they could curry, the jobs they could get and the posts they could ensure would be given to their supporters in such areas.</P>
    <P>There is a further grave danger in this measure if it goes through.  At present there is freedom for the individual politician to hold independent views even though he is a member of a Party.  I shall not go very much outside this country&mdash;P.R. suits us here and that is all that matters&mdash; but we all know there are safe seats in English constituencies.  If the holder of such a seat rebels against the Party line he is not selected the next time. If such a person for the time being at election time is at variance with his Party he cannot be re-elected. Similiarly here, if there are single member constituencies and the sitting member rebels on a certain point he cannot be re-elected to the Dáil because the official Party candidate would stand against him and would have all the Party machinery behind him to ensure that his opponent would not be elected.</P>
    <P>I submit that under P.R. it is possible for a member to be re-elected even if he rebels against his Party, if he has a majority who will <Col N="517" /> support him and who will vote for him as they have a right to do.  They may vote No. 1 for the man who rebels and No. 2 for the official Party nominee and in that way the general policy of the Party will be taken into account.  The votes could support the Party they wanted to support with the second or third preference votes.</P>
    <P>Similarly the safe seat should not exist.  No politician is entitled to a safe seat in the Oireachtas.  There are people who have made safe seats for themselves under P.R. not by any attempt to curry favour but by their legislative ability and hard work here. They are entitled to those safe seats, but no one is entitled to a safe seat who has not worked for it, who has not general ability for the position.  I submit that if this measure is carried there will be in the Oireachtas certain safe seats which can be filled by Party nominees because their names might gain favour for the Party but who at the same time might never stand in the constituency, who might be &ldquo;absentee landlords&rdquo; and might never do as much as address a meeting in that constituency.  They would be quite safe because they Party majority in the constituency would be rolled out for them like a steamroller.</P>
    <P>The people in that constituency would not be getting proper representation. I do not think Party politics are the ideal thing; I do think that the people of the constituency are entitled to a varied representation.  They are entitled to have a member who will listen to them, a member who will put forward their claims and a member who will represent in Parliament the interests of that constituency, be it industrial, agricultural, cattle rearing, wheat farming, or whatever activity happens to be the big thing in the constituency.  These people are entitled to select a man who will represent their way of life and their way of gaining a livelihood.  Under the proposed system the candidate might be a person with a great big name from Dublin and nobody else could run against him.</P>
    <P>I believe it is an injustice to hold the referendum on P.R., as has been <Col N="518" /> suggested by the Taoiseach, on the same day as the Presidential election. Is it in order for me to discuss that?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume I can discuss it later.  The former Minister for Finance raised what appears to me to be a very important issue on the passage of this Bill through the other House.  Because of the particular nature of our country the division of it into constituencies of 20,000 people will mean that there will be a town versus a country complex produced and the scales will weigh in favour of the town.  The unit of 20,000 people, which will mean about 10,000 or 12,000 votes, will give in many country constituencies a town majority.  At the first election I do not think the interests of town versus country would come up but in succeeding elections and in succeeding years there is not the slightest doubt that the people will wake up to the fact that there is such a division, so that the townspeople in a constituency will prefer a townsman whereas country people will prefer to elect a country man.</P>
      <P>Is it not a fact that, in such circumstances, instead of taking the whole of the people into consideration the rural T.D. will be looking after the interests of the country people whereas the urban T.D. will be agitating for greater social amenities and lower prices for food?  Senator Lenihan referred to the division of the country vertically rather than horizontally. There are many more ways of dividing it than on the basis of income or position, and this is one of the ways of dividing it.</P>
      <P>If you take my own constituency, the town of Dundalk, according to the 1956 census, has a population of 20,154. The town of Drogheda has a population of 17,008.  The total population of the constituency of Louth is 69,000 people.  The Constituency Commission is instructed as follows; and I quote from the Bill:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;...having due regard to geographical features and established <Col N="519" /> administrative and territorial divisions...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>No matter what way that county is divided there must be a preponderance of urban votes in those two constituencies. You would have to take the town of Dundalk as a unit and, therefore, you would have an urban constituency there.  In the town of Drogheda you would have to add 3,000 people to it to make it again an urban constituency with a very small agricultural minority.  In the rest of Louth, if it is to be divided in that way, you would have an agricultural constituency, so that if this measure goes through you would have two urban Deputies and one rural Deputy. In election after election the townspeople will say: &ldquo;We will not elect a countryman because we are townspeople&rdquo;; and the country people will say: &ldquo;We will not elect a townsman because we are country people.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The constituency of Louth also gives us very good opportunities for study on this question of the abolition of P.R.  Take the case of the last five elections.  In the last election the people of Louth elected two Fianna Fáil members and one Fine Gael; at the previous election, two Fine Gael members and one Fianna Fáil; at the previous election, one Labour member, one Fine Gael member and one Fianna Fáil member; and at the previous election two Fianna Fáil members and one Fine Gael.</P>
    <P>Under the proposal in this Bill these people will not be given a choice.  If they are in one of these small constituencies where a Labour member is not standing, then they have no chance of voting for Labour.  If you have, as in the present situation, an area which is an economic, geographical and historical unit, you may have at a time a consensus of opinion that would support a Labour member.  Is that economic, geographical and historical unit to be deprived of the opportunity of electing a Labour member?  I believe the present units are of the right size. The other units will produce the urban versus rural divisions and will also disfranchise certain members of the population.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="520" /> With regard to minorities, I want to speak as a man who has no axe to grind in relation to 1922 and has nothing to give the men of 1916 to 1922, including the present Taoiseach, except reverence and goodwill for the part they played during that period.  They have done a very good job in relation to minorities.  It was not easy at the foundation of this State to satisfy minorities.  I am certain that minorities had some idea about what was going to happen to them and that in many cases they were square pegs in round holes.  It is a credit to the men who founded the State and those who followed them that the minorities have blended with the majority, that there is no such thing as a religious minority versus majority but that the State is a unit in which we all can live, as our fathers and mothers brought us up to live, as people who have no axe to grind and who respect the laws.  One of the big arguments for P.R. is that it has achieved that situation and in doing so it has shown us that it would be an absolute mistake to remove it. If we do, we upset the applecart.</P>
    <P>Is the Taoiseach certain of what will happen in relation to the views of religious minorities and other minorities when he passes this measure?  I am not sure.  I do not know in what way these minorities will behave.  I do not know what views the religious minorities have and I do not think they should have ever been asked to express them or decide upon them.  The <i>status quo</i> was excellent.  It gave them their place in the community and, having taken their place, it is unfair, unwise and undemocratic to uproot them.  As Senator Barry said, P.R. in this State represents progression from government by force and class to government by limited franchise, and from there to full franchise.  Now with P.R., we are one step ahead of the rest of the world, and we should stay there.  As I said, the religious minority should never be asked to express their opinions, once having taken their place proudly in the State.  They should be left enjoy their place and live with us as brothers, as they are doing, thank God.</P>
    <P>Some of the criticisms of P.R. arise from the fact that we have not perfect <Col N="521" /> P.R. here.  Such is the case because of the interference during a revision of the constituencies made in the 1930s. I submit that the &ldquo;three-seater&rdquo; is not the perfect example of P.R.  The idea of P.R. is that, in a given area with a given population, a member can be elected who has the support of a quota of votes from his particular minority. I submit that the perfect P.R. for Ireland would be 100 members in five-seat constituencies.  That would mean that in the five-seat constituency, representing perhaps 120,000 people or 130,000 people, there would be a seat for the person who could represent 20,000 to 30,000 people, or one-fifth of the total.  When we created &ldquo;three-seaters&rdquo; we created the situation that it was too hard for that minority to become elected.  In fact, as will be the case if this measure goes through, the scales swung in favour of the large Party.</P>
    <P>I shall take a practical example.  In the constituency of Louth the Fianna Fáil Party got a total of 14,600 votes. For that number of votes they received two seats in the Dáil, or one seat per 7,000 of the votes.  The Fine Gael Party got 12,600 votes, and for that number of votes they received one seat.  In fact, unintentionally&mdash; because that constituency has been a &ldquo;three-seater&rdquo; since the inception of the State&mdash;we have gerrymandering. The situation is that you have too great a difference between the number of votes that the minority has to expend to gain a seat in Parliament and the number of votes which the majority has to expend.  If there were a five-seat constituency you would find that, while there would be a discrepancy&mdash;mathematically there must be&mdash;it would not be 5,000 votes per seat gained.</P>
    <P>I understand that in the mid-1930s 17 &ldquo;three-seater&rdquo; constituencies were created.  In the following election the Government won 16 of them.  Unintentionally, I submit&mdash;because I do not want in any way to cast reflection on the Taoiseach and the members opposite&mdash;it is the gravest gerrymandering.  Most of the criticism of P.R. arises from the fact that we have had &ldquo;three-seaters,&rdquo;<Col N="522" /> which were created by the present Taoiseach in the mid-1930s, and the system was intended for five-seat constituencies.</P>
    <P>I submit that this measure is indicative of the intolerance of Fianna Fáil to government by anybody else. The argument put forward by the Taoiseach, that the reason P.R. was bad was because it produced two Coalition Governments, is not an argument that government by coalition is bad but that government is bad if it is not Fianna Fáil government. I sincerely believe that this measure is intended&mdash;whether it will or not I do not know&mdash;to perpetuate Fianna Fáil in office.  As things stand, it could almost bring about such a situation at the next election.</P>
    <P>I notice that the former Taoiseach, Deputy Costello, expressed the same view at the Fine Gael Árd-Fheis. But he said that in the long run it will not serve the Fianna Fáil Party at all.  I think it is a measure of the intolerance to government by anybody else which is a facet of the philosophy of the Fianna Fáil Party.  We, on our side, are not intolerant of government by anybody else.  We are not intolerant of representation by minorities. We are not intolerant of the members of any minority coming into any House of the Oireachtas and making their statement.  We are not intolerant of people who do not say: &ldquo;Yes, yes, yes&rdquo; all the time.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Grady made the case that in our Party we are not at one. I think that, on the whole, we are at one.  There has been a great degree of unanimity in our Party.  If there has not been complete unanimity, as there has been on the far side, it is because of the nature of the Party over there.  It is a dangerous thing to have this monolithic group which never says may.  It is much better that there should be some discussion on measures such as this and that different views should be expressed.</P>
    <P>As Senator George O'Brien said, this is a portmanteau question.  The electorate will be asked: (1) Do you want to do away with P.R.?  (2) Do you want to substitute a single, nontransferable <Col N="523" /> vote?  (3) Do you agree with two foolscap pages of provisions for the proposed commission?  Do Senators not agree that it is unique &mdash;almost like the man who won £300,000 in the pools&mdash;for all of you people forming a group in the Fianna Fáil Party to have the view that every provision in those two foolscap pages is correct?  Is there anyone among you who believes that somewhere in those sections and sub-sections covering these two foolscap pages, there is not some provision with which you do not agree?  Of course, there must be many such among you, but you will not admit it.  You are monolithic and you believe that everything the Taoiseach does is right.  I believe he will do a grave injury to the Irish people if he proceeds with this measure and I, for one, will oppose it here and in the country.</P>

      <P>I shall not answer that.  I do not want to pursue the matter further, but I hope he proves a decent follower of James Connolly.  I should like, at the outset, to express my disappointment at the fact that the debate here has followed the same lines as the debate in the Dáil, namely, quotations, irrelevancies, contradictions and more quotations. The debate could have been much more effective and the speeches considerably shorter, had these irrelevancies been left out.  We are in a different category here as compared with the members of the Dáil.  The <Col N="524" /> system of election is their main concern; it is not ours.  We are here as responsible citizens and it is not necessary for us to follow all these contradictions, irrelevancies and quotations resorted to in the other House.  I shall not indulge in any quotations, or irrelevancies, I hope, but later I shall refer to a few remarks made by the Leader of the Opposition in the opening of the debate in the Dáil.</P>
      <P>As far as I am concerned, the issue is quite clear.  The question has been asked: &ldquo;Why now?&rdquo;  The answer is that this year there will be a revision of constituencies and it would be absurd not to deal with this matter simultaneously with the required revision of constituencies.  We are satisfied that it is desirable the system of election should be changed.  Remembering that if at one stage in the Dáil the Leader of the Opposition, the Taoiseach, and everybody else agreed that P.R. was the correct system then, they ought all equally now agree that it is no longer correct.  It was weak government in Germany that led to Hitler's being able to seize power.  In Italy, Mussolini got into power for the same reason.  Both these men achieved office because of weak Coalition Governments&mdash;Governments consisting of several Parties.  Had there been strong efficient Governments in these countries, neither of these men would have come to power.  It was their seizure of power that led the people of Europe into the wholesale slaughter and carnage and all the tragedy of the second World War.</P>
      <P>Here, in 1933, a somewhat similar step was tried.  We had the Blueshirt movement.  The Blueshirt organisation was to march on Dublin.  But we were fortunate in having a strong Government in office and that Government said: &ldquo;You shall not march on Dublin.&rdquo; The Blueshirt movement was frustrated.  Military organisations seize power when Governments are weak. There are, of course, different systems of P.R. and I do not propose to delay the House by describing those systems.  Suffice it to say that, in the main, they make for multiplicity of Parties, splinter groups, and weak government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="525" /> It is mean argument to say that Fianna Fáil are doing this for their own political aggrandisement.  The Taoiseach has been accused of doing this for the benefit of his own Party. It should be remembered that legislation is for the future, and retrospective legislation when introduced is looked at askance by everybody.  Legislation, in the main, is for the future.  The purpose of this Bill is to safeguard the future and to ensure that what happened on the Continent of Europe in the not so distant past will not happen here in the near or distant future.  This measure is safeguarding posterity.  It is to ensure that what happened in Germany and Italy will not happen here.</P>

      <P>They did it constitutionally&mdash;we do not argue that&mdash;but each of them broke down and each of them left a debt.  It is no joke for the Fianna Fáil Government to have to try to rectify the mistakes <Col N="526" /> of their predecessors.  The Coalition Governments disintegrated and left a debt.  In the first instance, Fianna Fáil had to introduce the drastic Budget of 1952 to deal with that situation. But the next Coalition Government did exactly the same thing; they left a string of debts after them.</P>

      <P>If I must, I must.  I have just stated the facts.  The effect of the abolition of P.R. and the introduction of the straight vote will not debar anybody, any party or any individual, from going up for election. It is extraordinary that that has to be repeated but it has been said so often on the other side of the House that this innovation, this alteration in our Constitution, will deprive small Parties of their rights.  It will not deprive any Party of their rights; it will not deprive any individual of his or her rights.  I have no doubt that several Independents will be elected to the next Dáil, if and when, as I hope it will be, the straight vote system is introduced and the Constitution amended to that effect.  Independents and representatives of other Parties will be elected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a defeatist attitude to assume that we will have only one Party and that Party will be Fianna Fáil.  Fianna Fáil may be, and I expect it will be, <Col N="527" /> a big Party, but I do not think the Opposition should assume that they will be composed of diminutive Parties. Supposing they were, they would be as large an Opposition as there was when the Cumann na nGaedheal Government were in office from 1922 to 1927. We have heard the Leader of the Opposition complimenting the Labour Party on the good work they did when acting as a small Opposition because the majority of the Republican representatives were outside the House at the time.</P>
    <P>I emphasise that there is no bar against any Party or any individual going up for election and the people who are criticising us for bringing forward this proposal must remember that they tried to set up barriers when they sought to introduce a provision that nobody would be allowed to stand as a candidate for either House of the Oireachtas without declaring that he would take an oath of allegiance to a foreign King.  That was a barrier against individuals or Parties standing for election.  There is no barrier now against any individual or any Party standing for election.</P>
    <P>There is no necessity to go into what other persons said and the contradictions of somebody else and all the quotations on this matter.  I emphasise that it will be for the benefit of our nation, if this change is made in the Constitution.  There is no necessity to go into the debate on the Constitution of 1937 or to deal with the criticism that individuals elected to the Dáil and the Seanad who were unanimous that it was a good thing at the time are now convinced that it is a bad thing and should be abolished.</P>
    <P>I must, however, without going into quotations, refer to the tone adopted in the Dáil by the Leader of the Opposition in opening the debate on this Bill.  He indicated at the start that our constituencies were quite different from the constituencies in Great Britain.  He said we were a uniform people and that our constituencies could not be divided into Labour, Tory or Liberal constituencies. <Col N="528" /> He pointed out that we were a uniform electorate whether in city or country areas, so far as our politics are concerned.  The proposal is that a commission be set up under this Bill in an endeavour to be supremely fair and to avoid criticism and in providing for this commission for the fixing of the constituencies, the matter was taken out of the hands of the Department of Local Government which ordinarily deals with the revision of constituencies.  To be fair and to avoid criticism, the Government decided not to leave that task to the Department of Local Government and tried to put it above any reproach by proposing this commission.</P>
    <P>At the start of his speech Deputy Costello pointed out that the constituencies could not very well be gerrymandered.  He later said &mdash; and these are the only words I shall quote because they give an indication of the mentality of the man and the tone which he gave to the debate &mdash; speaking of the judge who would be appointed as chairman of this commission, at column 1030, Volume 171, of the Official Report:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I will appoint CD. who is a tool of the Government in power, who is what the late Kevin O'Higgins would have called a legal careerist, who got his job on the bench because he was the lick-spittle of a political Party. That is the system supposed to give us impartiality and supposed to create public confidence in this white sepulchre, the commission set up under this Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Chair may object to unparliamentary language.  I have never heard any in the Seanad, though we have had interruptions, but, to my mind, that statement&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="An Leas-Chathaoirleach An Leas-Chathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator should not pursue that line. The Dáil conducts its own business and it is for the Ceann Comhairle to decide, as he so desires, on the orderliness of any statement made.  It is not for us to do so.  The Senator will appreciate that point.</P>

      <P>I accept your direction, Sir, but am I not entitled to <Col N="529" /> comment on a statement made in the other House by the Leader of the Opposition?  Perhaps I shall be allowed just to make a remark.  It was a terribly bad lead to give to the other House and to this House, but if the Chair says I may not pursue it further, I am quite satisfied.</P>

      <P>No, Sir; I had no intention of doing that.  So far as I can see, greater latitude is allowed in the other House than is allowed, rightly, in this House.  If the Chair does not debar me from referring to the bad example given by the Leader of the Opposition in the other House, I shall say that it was a terribly bad lead to give to pass such remarks about a member of his own profession who may be in the High Court or the Supreme Court and to call such a man a lick-spittle.  There is no more disgusting term that could be used when one thinks of the literal meaning of the word.  I think it was an awful remark to make.</P>
      <P>I cannot sit down without referring to a remark made by the Leader of the Opposition in this House when he said that the Constitution of 1937 was only an amendment of the Constitution of 1922.  Where he got that fantastic idea, I do not know.  I am sorry he is not here to hear me say it.  The Constitution of 1937 contains no word whatever of an amendment of the Constitution of 1922&mdash;nothing whatsoever. It is an entirely new Constitution. Whom does he think he could deceive by saying that this is only an amendment of the Constitution of 1922? Those are the words in his speech, and, if the House wishes, I can quote the reference, but I do not think it is necessary. He said this Bill was brought in for political reasons by the Taoiseach and for no other reason.  That is all wrong.  We are safeguarding the future of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fianna Fáil, having a majority, are doing the correct thing in ensuring <Col N="530" /> that posterity, for which all legislation must be framed, will be safeguarded by the passing of this Bill through the Oireachtas and placing it before the people in a referendum.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1943" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>It is amusing to hear the Government speakers trying to defend this Bill.  Every time there is a new slogan.  The Taoiseach always has a new slogan.  At one time, the thing to save the country was the language.  On another occasion, he used to tell the people not to change horses crossing the stream.  On still another occasion, it was the straight road.  Now it is the straight vote.</P>
      <P>I have been in the House since 1943. I have fought elections since 1934, when I first went into public life.  I fought six general elections.  On a few occasions, they were elections which were not needed, but because of vanity and a desire for power, the Dáil was dissolved in the middle of the night and the Taoiseach ran up to the Park.  He had a majority then, but because of two by-elections, when Seán MacBride and Paddy Kinnane won the seats, the Taoiseach ran up to the Park and dissolved the Dáil. Why?  Because he was afraid that the Clann na Poblachta Party at the time were getting too strong.  A general election was held.  What was the result?  Clann na Poblachta won ten seats &mdash; some of them in the City of Dublin.  I was one who went a long way towards putting the Fianna Fáil Party out of power.  I was in the National Labour Party then.  Five of us held the balance of power.  The night before the Government was changed in 1948, pressure was brought to bear by some people that we should vote Fianna Fáil back.</P>

      <P>What happened?  I was elected by the people of Wexford in opposition to Fianna Fáil.  I am not sorry that I changed the Government at the time.  I am proud of the action I took on behalf of the people I represent.  Why?  Because we released the prisoners in 1948 from the Curragh.  We took the gun out of politics and we brought peace and <Col N="531" /> harmony to the people.  That cannot be denied.</P>
      <P>No case has been made by the Taoiseach or any of the members of his Party in this or the other House. I listened to the finest speeches here last week delivered by such learned men as Senators Hayes, O'Brien, Stanford and others.  They gave their views against P.R. from this side of the House.  What has been said on the I other side of the House?  All the Fianna Fáil speakers had to say is that it would be all right and that the Bill would save the country.</P>
      <P>Every country in the world was mentioned. I have literature in my possession at the moment which was sent me by Irish people in Australia where an election took place only last year &mdash; in November, 1958.  What is said in this literature?  You must vote for every candidate.  That was the type of literature distributed throughout Australia.  It shows the list of candidates and it also shows how to vote. That voters must vote for every candidate is clearly stated.  That is all wrong, of course, in a little country like ours.</P>
      <P>When I was fighting an election throughout County Wexford, there were big posters on the gable ends of the houses.  What was on the posters?  &ldquo;If you do not vote Fianna Fáil, vote for the Constitution.&rdquo;  The Taoiseach told the people to vote for the Constitution in 1937 but in 1959 he says it is wrong.  He wants the straight vote.  Here is an extract from the <i>Evening Herald:</i>&ldquo;New French law abolishes P.R. in local elections.&rdquo; But the French statesmen tell us why, whereas the Taoiseach has not told the people why.  He refers only to coalitions.  Here is what this item says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The French Cabinet has adopted a law abolishing P.R. in local elections in all towns of up to 120,000 people.  The decision is expected drastically to reduce Communism and Communist Parties.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Why does the Taoiseach not say he wants this Bill to keep out Sinn Féin, the Labour Party and the Farmers' <Col N="532" /> Party?  Why is he not honest about it, like the French people?</P>
    <P>He also said that a Coalition Government was like a game of pocker. I think he has the best poker players in his own Party because, when he formed a Coalition Government in 1951, I came to this House on a stretcher to put back the inter-Party Government. I failed.  Why?  Because of the bargaining with four jokers.  He had four jokers in the pack.  Where are the four jokers to-day?  Who made the bargain to bring the then Deputy Cogan who had been in every Party, an ex-Civic Guard, into the Hospitals Commission?  Was that not a bargain?  Let the Taoiseach deny that if he wishes.  We made no bargains. We had our mandate from the people who elected us.  To-day I should like to talk about unemployment and emigration, because I am a worker.  I listened to the policy and the programme put before the people in the last general election and I thought the Taoiseach would be doing what Deputy Costello did when he went to the radio in 1948 and brought home the tradesmen to Ireland.  That progress went on until 1951, when the sabotage occurred.  The housing drive was stopped then.</P>
    <P>Senator Carter spoke here the other night and I am glad he is here now.  I cut this out of the paper and it is a pity the Taoiseach is not here to hear it.  I wonder if Senator Carter believed this. Another Senator spoke here to-day and said there are no poor in the country.  This cutting says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Families are starving in Granard; work schemes call to Government.  There were families in Granard living in a state of semi-starvation, said Mr. T. Gilbride, at Longford County Council.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There is a county council calling on the Government to do something and some of them are Fianna Fáil people. Another councillor said it was never so bad; he was 26 years on the council and had never seen the position in regard to unemployment so bad.</P>

It is a sad thing that when we have two or three big organisations uniting&mdash;there is a united trade union movement now &mdash; we are discussing a Bill to take away the rights of the plain people.  There are big obstacles before those who seek election to the Dáil.  One must have £100 and one must get a certain number of votes or the £100 will be lost.  Now we have this obstacle, a straight vote.  Can anyone here tell me what is the use of a candidate going down to Clare, if the Taoiseach is not President and has to stand again in Clare?  What hope would he have of beating him?  None; it could not be done.  Moreover, the country seems to have been cut up to suit that Party.</P>

Is that not gerrymandering? Then Fianna Fáil say they have a policy.  Where is their policy, where is the programme they preached to the people?  They are in now on false promises.

He said the Taoiseach was the greatest living man in the world, that &ldquo;he kept you out of the war.&rdquo;  I looked up the Official Debates of six years ago.  There was a debate on defence in the Dáil on <Col N="534" /> the 29th May, 1953.  Deputy Cowan was speaking at the time and Deputy Dillon asked him if he would let him say a few words.  As we all know, it was during the emergency.  Here is the quotation, as given at column 369 of the report:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Mr. Dillon: I wonder whether the Deputy would allow me to provide a quotation?  I understand that Deputy Rooney was challenged to-day about a quotation upon which he was not able to put his hand.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach: No, they were not in this country.</P>

      <P>This Bill has been brought in solely to do away with small Parties, but Fianna Fáil did not say that at the last election.  They did not tell the people: &ldquo;Give us an overall majority and we will deprive you of the right to vote 1, 2, 3 in the next election; you will mark the ballot with an X and that will be all.&rdquo;  Fianna Fáil are in here on preference votes, too, because they vote 1, 2, 3 for themselves. It is rather a strange thing that, after all the years of Government, there is nothing to be talked about in the Dáil or Seanad to-day but how the people will vote in the next election. If the present Government run full <Col N="535" /> time, the people will not be asked to vote until 1961 and God knows how many will be called away before then. The people to-day are not worrying how they will vote in the next election. If one goes to the boats and trains, one sees them fleeing out of the country because the country has failed them badly by not making progress.</P>
      <P>This Bill is brought in solely because the new generation is coming up.  Four of them were elected in the last general election in spite of great opposition. The writing was on the wall then.  The Government then came along and said: &ldquo;We will try to counteract these fellows so that they will not get a majority; and how will we do it?  We will bring in a new Bill which will change the Constitution and we will have a straight vote.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I wonder where Fianna Fáil would be in years gone by if that had taken place under the other Governments? Would they have the overall majority to-day?  No, they would not.  It is about time the Government did something practical instead of bringing in red herrings of this kind.  Anyone who has been in public life and has had to fight elections against a big Party &mdash; as we in the Labour Party have had to do, just like the Farmers' Party and now the Sinn Féin Party &mdash; knows very well that we cannot get the funds and the motor cars to fight our election. We have to fight with small means and now this obstacle is to be thrown up against us.  It will take away the rights of the people.  There is not a ha'porth else in it.  There is no use in saying it is for the good of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I admire Senator Mrs. Connolly O'Brien, who made a fine speech last week.  Certainly, she could not say anything but what was straight and honest.  She said she would have to vote for the referendum but that when she got her ballot paper she would vote &ldquo;No&rdquo; and she hoped the people outside would do the same.  That is something other people will not say. She was honest when she said she was compelled to vote for the referendum but when she would get her ballot paper on voting day she would vote <Col N="536" />&ldquo;No&rdquo; and she asked others to do likewise. It is our job here to tell the people outside what is going on about this P.R.  They are asking down the country what is all this talk on P.R. about, and what does it mean?  They do not understand it.  It was all right up until now.</P>
    <P>I remember voting once in County Wexford in an election contested by two candidates, Sir Grattan Esmonde and Sir Roger Sweetman, for the British House of Commons, and the voter placed an X opposite the name of the candidate he preferred.  That was a long while ago and, under our Constitution, the people were given the right to vote 1, 2, 3 and 4, or right down the whole list of candidates, but now that system is being abolished.</P>
    <P>There are many people listening to me who would not get No. 1 votes but who would get second, third, fourth and fifth preferences under P.R.  I got 5,000 first preferences in the last election in Wexford and if anyone should say anything against P.R., it is I, because P.R. beat me, but yet I am not afraid of it.  I have won the local elections every time under it, but I am thinking of the other people who contest elections with me and who would have no chance under the straight vote.</P>
    <P>If the Government were wise and if the Taoiseach were honest and wise, he could contest the Presidential election, but let him withdraw this Bill because it is only going to put the country to expense.  The people do not want that expense; taxation is too high at the present time.  I should like to see this money being spent on providing work for the labouring people.  Spending it on this referendum is a waste of public money.  We get a list of statistics every month from the Office of Works, and from those statistics we can see that there is an army of people waiting for something to be done for them.  They are not worrying about how they will vote in the next election.</P>
    <P>It is a regrettable state of affairs that people who made supreme sacrifices for this country, the working class people, are to be denied proper representation in Parliament.  One or two of their representatives might be <Col N="537" /> elected, but what good is that?  The small farmer will be shoved out.  The Taoiseach and the Minister for External Affairs would like to see Fine Gael in, and probably they could join hands then and have no Opposition. Maybe that is what they want, but I think it is wrong to deny to any section of the people their proper representation. The people know how to vote under P.R.  They have been learning how to do so all down the years, but now they can make only one choice and can do nothing for the candidates they like next.  The Taoiseach said that P.R. was all right, that it was fair, but now he is telling the people that it is all wrong.  Who is going to trust a statesman who, in 1937, said it was all right and in 1959, says it is all wrong?</P>

You criticise the Coalition for not doing everything, but what help did you give the Coalition, when they were in office? Fianna Fáil published all the slander they could put into print.  They showed the loaves of bread&mdash;they showed everything in that publication but the reduction in the butter price, but all those things have gone up again in price since Fianna Fáil returned to power with a majority.</P>
      <P>Young men in other organisations in politics are getting up and talking about this Bill, but I see other honest men listening to me who will not say anything themselves but who will think the more.  I should like to hear every member of the Government Party stating the case on this Bill, but only a very few of them have done so.  Men of learning have spoken in this House in favour of our stand on this Bill.  We have had the university professors&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I have instructions to do that from my trade union and from the people. What happened the workers previously when Fianna Fáil had a majority? We had standstill Orders, but what will we have with a one-man power and with a lot of yes-men?  Where will the people come in?  They will not be thought of at all.  It is the Opposition who keep the Government active, and this Government have done nothing since coming into office two years ago.  I suppose, a Leas-Chathaoirligh, I might not be allowed to mention that they have had the money from the food subsidies and from the prize bond scheme.  They have all the money that the Coalition brought in.</P>

It is something which will upset them.  I remember an occasion when there were three elections held on the one day.  There was a Presidential election and a local election, and in the cities and the towns there were three ballot boxes. There was general confusion.  There were three boxes&mdash;a box for the votes for the President, a box for the county council votes and a box for the urban council votes.  A great many of the people were confused.  Some votes meant for the county council box went into the other two boxes and votes intended for one or other of the remaining two boxes went into the county council box.  We shall have confusion again this time.  Why is it that this is brought in now?  Is it not brought in now because the Taoiseach is thrown into the circle again?</P>

      <P>Do the present Government think that, because they have <Col N="540" /> an overall majority, they can do what they like?  We are told that every man is to be free to work out his own salvation.  I want to quote from the election card of a candidate for the House of Representatives in Australia in 1958.  Here is one of the ideals set forth:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;In the conflict of ideas and the welter of proposals which contend for the support of free people there emerges one central fact.  It is that man was born not only to be free but to enjoy that freedom in the sight of God and his fellow men.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That is the stuff that is given out in Australia where they have P.R.</P>
      <P>I shall end my speech with this final quotation.  It is from a speech made by Pope John XXIII in 1955 when he was Patriarch of Venice.  He is a strong advocate of social justice for the workers and in his Christmas message of 1955 he said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;There are three things that call for our brotherly aid: poverty, unemployment and the dismissal of workers.</P>
      <P>It is tragic to read in the newspapers that factories have been shut, that short time has been introduced, or, even worse, that workers have been dismissed...</P>
      <P>I appeal to industrial leaders, to their technicians and to economists, and I beseech them in the name of the Almighty, to remember that intelligence and wealth were placed at their disposal, not to balance the books, but help them be ministers of Providence to the advantage of the human family.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Those words should be borne in mind by the Government.  They should remember that if they have a majority it does not entitle them to ride roughshod over the people with legislation such as the Bill we are discussing here to-day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JaneDowdall" hpid="Mrs. Dowdall Mrs. Dowdall">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Dowdall</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say a very few words &mdash; I mean a very few words &mdash; on this subject.  Since the foundation of this State, perhaps there has not been so much discussion on any measure that has come before the <Col N="541" /> Houses of the Oireachtas as on this proposal to change the electoral system.  It would be difficult, and for me impossible, to think of any original new ideas for or against this measure so I shall confine myself to dealing with three arguments put up by opposing speakers to the proposal.  The three arguments come under three heads &mdash; (1) that the change will deprive minorities of fair representation; (2)  that its real purpose is to perpetuate Fianna Fáil in Government for all time in this country and, (3) that the time is inopportune.  Briefly, I would like to deal with those points.</P>
      <P>I have some figures here.  The first argument is, theoretically, very attractive&mdash;that P.R. is beneficial to minorities.  In fact, it has been proved that it is not so attractive or so beneficial. It is undoubtedly true that if you had a minority of 15 to 20 per cent. evenly distributed throughout the country it is likely that that minority would not get 2 per cent. elected to the Dáil.  As well as being a fairly large minority, they must also be geographically well situated to get elected.  That, I understand, can be done when there is gerrymandering but in this country we have a minority&mdash; what is called in general terms a minority &mdash; of 7 or 8 per cent. and they get, in fact, only 3 per cent. representation in the Dáil under the present electoral system.  I think that under that system they are being badly treated.  In Britain now, under the straight vote system &mdash; I make no apology for quoting Britain&mdash;there is a minority of 1/2 per cent. of the population which gets 7 or 8 per cent. representation in Parliament.  I think these few figures will prove, therefore, that the claim that under P.R. the minorities are well treated is not so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second argument is, I think, very unflattering to the electorate as a whole.  In what way do Opposition Parties hope or think that Fianna Fáil can cushion itself against a change in public opinion?  Do they think that, for all time, Fianna Fáil will have all the answers?  In this regard, I find it most disappointing that the speakers of the Opposition Parties &mdash; especially <Col N="542" /> the younger ones, the lawyers and learned young men &mdash; are so terribly depressed or lacking in hope for their future.</P>
    <P>I do not like mentioning names but, in one case, a learned young man spoke at very great length last week. He referred us to the Constitutions of practically all the nations of the civilised world and their electoral forms, but he was so depressed and depressing that if I felt as he feels at his age, I certainly would have nothing to do with politics.  I would probably take up bee-keeping or something.  How do people think that any Party can say cushion itself against the swing of public opinion that, for all time, they will remain in power and no other Party can get into power?  Public opinion will settle that.  What is lamentable, I think, is the lack of hope for the future that these other Parties seem to have.</P>
    <P>The third argument is that the time is inopportune.  The answer has been given very well to that argument.  It is that, with the rearrangement this year of constituencies, we can combine that rearrangement with this change in the electoral system.  We are not changing it.  We are asking the electorate to do it which, to my mind, is the most democratic way to do anything.</P>
    <P>It is said that good government brings prosperity.  I claim that the electoral system that elects Governments can have a very big say in the prosperity of the country.  I hope the Seanad in its wisdom will see fit to pass this Bill.  We are criticised very much already &mdash; sometimes rightly so &mdash; but I think we would be quite wrong, with our limited powers, to try even to hold up this Bill from going to the people and from giving the people the right to decide on this matter.</P>
    <P>A point was made last week by Senator Stanford and, as a member of the other sex, I resent his giving as a good example what happens in Switzerland under P.R. where learned and less-learned gentlemen went to the polls last week and decided that women should not have votes.  Even though that is a roundabout way of making my point, I think I can claim it is another argument against P.R. <Col N="543" /> When these nations are quoted as if they had a perfect system, in my own way I find great fault with them.  In that particular case, I had very great fault to find with the Swiss for not allowing women to vote.  I hope that the Seanad in its wisdom will pass this Bill and allow the public to make the decision in this matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>This proposal to abolish P.R. is the most important to come before the Oireachtas since the foundation of the State.  It is a most retrograde step.  I hope that when it comes before the people, in a democratic way, they will reject it.  I am delighted that the Fianna Fáil Party are now converted to democracy and that, at this stage, they are willing to allow things to go to the people for decision in a democratic way.  They did not believe in it at one time but it is their belief now and it is good to see that they have been converted to that way of thinking.  When it comes before the people in a democratic way, I know they will reject this measure. In my opinion it is a direct and a blatant attempt to prevent Parliament being representative of the views of the people because it will interfere with the legitimate rights of minorities.</P>
      <P>I believe also that it is contrary to our democratic tradition and that it will lead to unrepresentative Parliament, to arrogant government, and that it may pave the way to dictatorship. In addition, it will render more difficult the ending of Partition, for which we are all sincerely hoping in our day.  I believe also that it has not been demanded by the people; therefore I claim that in present world conditions, and in our economic circumstances as they are to-day, it will impair rather than assist the solution of national problems.  Everybody knows the circumstances to which I refer.  They are the figure of 85,000 people unemployed, and the figure of over 70,000 who had to emigrate last year; high taxation, high cost of living and the poverty to which Senator O'Leary referred a few moments ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Carter contradicted Senator O'Leary in regard to a statement which he made but he cannot contradict <Col N="544" /> me in this statement.  Is it not true that at a Fianna Fáil meeting held three weeks ago, Mr. Austin Sheehy, local secretary of the Longford Fianna Fáil Cumann, said that he never saw such poverty and that in 60 houses which he had visited, doing Legion work, in County Longford, an average of three people had emigrated from each of those houses?  That was said by Mr. Sheehy when he was referring to circumstances in the country at the present time.  In my opinion this proposal emanates&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I hope the <i>Longford Leader</i> hears that the Senator has referred to it as a Party rag.  In my opinion, this proposal emanates from a decision arrived at by the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste.  One way or the other, the Taoiseach, whether or not he is elected to the Park &mdash; and I do not think he will be &mdash; has made up his mind to leave active politics.  We know that in the past we had a cultured personality in this country.  It was &ldquo;Vote for Dev,&rdquo;&ldquo;Let Dev lead the way,&rdquo;&ldquo;Let Dev lead you to prosperity.&rdquo; There was nothing about the rest of the Fianna Fáil Party.  If the Tánaiste should be the new Taoiseach&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>I am entitled to say how this proposal came about and give the reasons for it.  I believe the Tánaiste is not wanted, even in the Fianna Fáil Party, by Deputies who <Col N="545" /> have been elected by farmers, because he stated that the farmers had grants for this, that and the other thing and that they were on feather-beds.  You have also got the revolutionary section who claim that the Party has gone too much to the Right, that they are Conservatives and that now they are more British than the British themselves. They know they are going to split and the only way to keep together is to say: &ldquo;We will do away with P.R.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>In my opinion this proposal comes from the Taoiseach and from the Tánaiste and from nobody else.  I thought that this should have been a national issue above politics and above political Parties but, unfortunately for the country, the Taoiseach does not think so because he first introduced this at the Fianna Fáil Árd-Fheis. Neither does Senator Seán Ó Donnabháin think so because he got up and attacked us on this side of the House and spoke about the Blueshirts trying to march on Dublin and about a strong Government putting them down.  I want to say that the Blueshirts&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Those things were raised and at the same time we were supposed to have strong Government. The question was raised in Leinster House about interruptions and assaults at meetings &mdash; and this can happen in the future if you have strong one-Party Governments with nobody in Leinster House to stand up for the downtrodden or the minorities.  When the Taoiseach was asked about the lack of protection for ratepayers and for people paying for the upkeep of the country he said it was not the business of the Government to make people and causes popular.</P>
      <P>As I stated, this measure was first mooted at the Fianna Fáil Árd-Fheis. In my opinion this House is the place where the Taoiseach should have first introduced it.  On the last day of the debate we had a controversy on this matter and Senator Lenihan directed our attention to the <i>Irish Press</i> for the middle of October and said that we would see there where the matter was discussed at the Fianna Fáil Árd-Fheis. I read the report and not one single person spoke against it.  As a matter of fact it said that all rose to their feet to applaud the Taoiseach when he introduced this measure.  In other words, they all rose to applaud the man who had found out that he was wrong in 1919 and in 1927 when he spoke in favour of it, and that he was wrong in 1937 when he put it into the Constitution.  In 1957, however, when he somersaults, we all somersault with him and we all find out, 40 years later, that we have been all wrong.  Could it not be that the Taoiseach is wrong now, as he was in times gone by?  He has admitted that he was wrong in the past; perhaps he is wrong again.  He was wrong four times out of five, because that is his own admission, and in all probability he is wrong the fifth time also.</P>

      <P>The measure we are discussing is described as the Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill. In my opinion, the proper title for it would be: the &ldquo;Fianna Fáil Ascendancy Bill&rdquo;.  That word &ldquo;ascendancy&rdquo;<Col N="547" /> has a bad smell or taste in this country, but there is not the slightest doubt in the minds of the majority of the people at present that the aim of the Bill is to rivet Fianna Fáil in power for as long as possible.  Senator Mrs. Dowdall smiles, as well she may.  A few moments ago, she said that the young people in Fine Gael who had spoken up to this seemed to be depressed and lacking in hope.  I suppose I would count myself as one of the younger members of the Fine Gael Party and we would not be depressed or lacking in hope if we had in power at present a Party who believed in justice, in charity, and in equality.  Instead, we have a Party who know all the rules of the game, a wily Party, steeped in deceit and corruption, and I have no doubt that they will try to gerrymander as they did in 1947 when they tried to defeat the aim of P.R. by making 21 three-seat constituencies. But things did not go as they thought at that time and they do not want to make the same mistake again; so, as has been said previously, they changed the rules of the game.</P>
      <P>It may be no harm to refer to the history of P.R. in this country.  We are now asked to impose on the people of the Twenty-Six Counties the British and the Six-County system.  We know that Arthur Griffith was one of the founder members of the P.R. Association here and that he started it in 1911. At, that time, he said in <i>Sinn Féin</i>&mdash; these references may be verified in the National Library:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;We believe the strength of the Irish legislature will reside in including from the beginning representatives of every section of the nation. We desire to see the evil growth of political bossism checked under Home Rule and every section of our community given free speech in an Irish legislature.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>We know that the aim of this Bill is to take representation from minorities and from different sections of the community.  In a further issue of <i>Sinn Féin</i> on 25th February, 1911, Arthur Griffith also wrote:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;P.R. secures that the majority of the electors shall rule and that <Col N="548" /> minorities shall be represented in proportion to their strength.  It is the one just system of election in democratic Government.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Nobody can say that Arthur Griffith was coerced by the British into making those statements in the organ of Sinn Féin which at that time was seeking to secure our freedom from the British Government.  We in Fine Gael regard Arthur Griffith as one of the founders of our Party and we are proud of him. That is not merely one of our Party traditions; it is a national tradition.</P>
    <P>It was not Lloyd George or anybody else who inspired that view of Arthur Griffith, and we know that the activities of the P.R. Society in their advocacy of the system from an Irish point of view resulted in the system being embodied in the Home Rule Scheme of 1912.  The war intervened and we find that the first election here under P.R. was fought in Sligo.  That was done, not at the dictates of the British Government or any other Government, but at the request of the people of Sligo because they found that the system we had up to that had led to chaos.</P>
    <P>Many of the Fianna Fáil speakers claim that P.R. will not disfranchise minorities.  It might be no harm to quote what the Taoiseach said as reported at column 2341, Volume 171, of the Dáil Debates of the 16th December, 1958:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;My attitude towards P.R. has been called into question.  I remember back in 1919 when it was introduced here.  It was an English measure.  There is no use in talking about where it arose &mdash; it was an English measure and it was in that respect that we had to deal with it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I am surprised at the Taoiseach trying to fool the people of Ireland by saying it was an English measure.  The Taoiseach, the man who states that now, spoke in favour of P.R. in 1919. He spoke again in favour of P.R. in 1927 and he embodied it in the Constitution of 1937.  Does the Taoiseach now want to say that it was an English measure and that it was inspired by the British Government and by the English people, although he put it into the Constitution of 1937?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="549" /> The Taoiseach was in favour of P.R. in 1919.  We gained our freedom in 1922 and in an Irish Parliament, composed of men like Arthur Griffith, Mulcahy, MacEoin, Cosgrave and others we had this declaration:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Dáil Éireann sitting as a Constituent Assembly in this Provisional Parliament, acknowledging that all lawful authority comes from God to the people and in the confidence that the national life and unity of Ireland shall thus be restored hereby proclaims the establishment of the Irish Free State and in the exercise of undoubted right decrees and enacts...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>&mdash;the Constitution of 1922.  Article 26 of that Constitution provided that Dáil Éireann should be composed of members elected to represent constituencies determined by law and that the system of election would be in accordance with the principles of P.R.</P>
    <P>That was one of the first acts of this House away back in 1922, to proclaim its existence, to declare the manner in which it would control its own affairs and the manner in which people would be elected to Parliament. I hope nobody will tell me that people like Griffith, Mulcahy, MacEoin and Cosgrave, who took over this country from the British in 1921 and who fought to put the British out of this country, were then willing to adopt a British system at the dictates of the British Government and enshrine it in our Constitution of 1922.  There was no fear of their doing that.  They were Irishmen, inspired men who were there to do their best for all sections of the community, irrespective of class, creed or politics, and they wanted to give fair play to all sections, including the minority.</P>
    <P>The founders of this State adopted P.R. and it was continued by them until 1932.  In 1932 we had an election again under P.R. and the Fianna Fáil Party came in as the largest Party and took over the Government. If the Government between 1922 and 1932 had done away with P.R. they might have kept the Fianna Fáil Party out of power but they believed in and recognised the rights of Fianna Fáil <Col N="550" /> or of any other legitimate Party which was prepared to work within the rules of the Constitution, and did not try to prevent them entering this Parliament.</P>
    <P>In 1937 the Taoiseach embodied P.R. in our Constitution.  At that time the Taoiseach was around 55 years of age.  He was surely a mature man and if the system was as wrong as Senator Ó Maoláin tried to make us believe &mdash;the defects in it were discovered only in the last few years &mdash; and if the Taoiseach was the brilliant, far-seeing man we were told he was in the past, why did he not, with all the able lieutenants he had at his side, see these defects in 1937?  It had been in operation then for almost 18 years. If it had any of those defects we hear about now, surely the Taoiseach and his able lieutenants should have been able to see them before that?</P>
    <P>As reported at column 1343, Volume 67, of the Dáil Debates of the 1st June, 1937, the Taoiseach, speaking on the Constitution, said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The system we have we know; the people know it.  On the whole it has worked out pretty well.  I think that we have a good deal to be thankful for in this country.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is the Taoiseach, not Gerry L'Estrange or anybody else, speaking. It is the leader of the Irish people.  I do not think that I or anybody else in our Party could put it as well.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach was not satisfied with that but continued:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We have to be very grateful that we have had the system of P.R. here.  It gives a certain amount of stability and on the system of the single transferable vote you have fair representation of Parties.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It gave stability in 1937.  It gives instability in 1959.  You got fair representation of the Parties in 1937 and he does not want fair representation of Parties now.  It leads to a multiplicity of Parties and because the Parties are not supporting the Fianna Fáil Government and are not prepared to toe the Party line, the whole system is wrong.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="551" /> It might be no harm to quote what the Taoiseach said in the Seanad on 4th February, 1959, as reported at Volume 50, column 254:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;From 1938, that is, for the past 20 years, looking at the working of this system, I have on many occasions pointed out that, if it should lead here to a multiplicity of Parties...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>From 1938 on!  Whom does the Taoiseach think he is fooling in this House?  In 1938, 1939 and 1940 he had a majority in the Dáil and he could have changed the terms of the Constitution without a referendum.  If in 1938, 1939 and 1940 he thought it was wrong, all he had to do was to bring in a simple Bill and have it passed here.  He would not even have to refer it to the people.  I believe he did not think that in those years but now he is trying to believe that he did.</P>
    <P>On the 1st June, 1937, the Taoiseach said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I think we get, probably, in this country more than in any other country, better balanced results from the system we have.  If you take the countries where P.R. exists, you get better balanced results than you get in the other countries. I think we get the benefit of P.R. in reasonable legislation here better than in any other country that I have read about or know anything about.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Again, those are the Taoiseach's own words.  They are not my words.</P>
    <P>I listened to Fianna Fáil Senators here to-day lamenting the fact that Hitler and Mussolini came to power because of P.R. and weak government. Mussolini and Hitler were in power at that time.  Had the Taoiseach not his eyes open?  Could he not see then what Fianna Fáil see now?  Or does it take the Fianna Fáil Party 20 years to open their eyes and see things as they should see them?</P>
    <P>We have heard statements made to-day about P.R.  It might be no harm to point out that the General Elections of 1938, 1943, 1944, 1948, 1951, 1954 <Col N="552" /> and 1957 were all held under P.R. and there seemed to have been no objection during all those years.  There was not a word from any of our Ministers or any of the Deputies.  I defy any Senator here to quote where anyone of them objected to P.R. in the past 20 years.  It was all right; it got them into the county councils or elected them to the Dáil or Seanad.  Then, lo and behold, in 1958 they wake up suddenly.  The Taoiseach says that P.R. is all wrong and must be changed. They chime in to a man behind him and say: &ldquo;Yes, P.R. is all wrong and we must change it.&rdquo;  It now becomes &ldquo;the British system of election&rdquo; and they must get rid of it.</P>
    <P>In my opinion, the Taoiseach and the Fianna Fáil Party now want this country to adopt the British system. In an effort to secure the votes of the unthinking, they appeal to the anti-British feeling inherent in our people by suggesting that the present system of P.R. was imposed on us by the British in 1919.  I do not want to repeat myself but, if it was, why did de Valera enshrine it in the Constitution of 1937?</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamOBuachalla" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Senator will refer to the Taoiseach under his proper title?  It is very wrong on the part of the Senator to refer to the Taoiseach as &ldquo;de Valera&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry, Sir.  I shall refer to him under his proper title in the future.</P>
      <P>We had the argument that P.R. was imposed by the British.  That kind of argument is used by Senators who are reasonably intelligent people.  It is something similar to the arguments they used before about Britain.  They told us: &ldquo;The British market is gone for ever, thanks be to God.&rdquo;  They told us that if every British ship was at the bottom of the sea, we could do without the rest of the world.  They told us that we would whip John Bull, right, left and centre.  They know there are people who may fall for that and who may rush in for Fianna Fáil if Fianna Fáil can get them to believe that this is a British system &mdash; something imposed on us by the British.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The British system of election &mdash; the <Col N="553" /> straight vote &mdash; may suit Britain, a highly industrialised country where you have two large Parties with some people supporting Labour and employers and others supporting the Conservatives.  I do not think it is a system that will suit this country.  I claim that the abolition of P.R. will interfere with the legitimate rights of minorities.  We have freedom in the Twenty-Six Counties under our present Constitution and under our present system of voting.  The minorities are protected and they have certain rights. They can put forward their candidates, and they have a reasonable chance of having them elected.  But under the new system they will have very little chance of having their candidates elected.</P>
    <P>Now the Fianna Fáil Party want to eliminate Labour, Clann na Talmhan, the National Progressive Democrats, the Independents and also the Fine Gael Party, because we know that on the 7th January, Deputy Blaney, who is a young impetuous Minister, perhaps not as wily as some of the older people, stated in the House that if this referendum goes through, Fine Gael will have had it.  We know now that as well as trying to get rid of the other Parties, they are trying to get rid of the Fine Gael Party.</P>
    <P>We had the Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy S. Lemass, sneering in the Dáil at the ideas Arthur Griffith had on P.R.  In June, 1912, Arthur Griffith wrote in relation to what was coming in the Home Rule Bill of 1914:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;If democracy is to survive as the working principle of government, it can only survive in the admission of the minority to a share of representation with its strength of the Government of the State.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I should find it hard to accept that Fianna Fáil should have any liking for minorities.  When Fianna Fáil were in a minority away back in the 1920s, they had very little respect for the majority view at that time.  Now that they are themselves a majority, it would, I suppose, be hard to expect them to have any respect for minorities. It may be of interest to quote what Mr. Gallagher, a great friend of the <Col N="554" /> Taoiseach, stated in his book entitled <i>The Indivisible Island.</i>  In chapter 15, he said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;One of the greatest wrongs that can be done to a minority in a democratic State is to deprive it of its political right, particularly of its electoral rights, for these are so often a shield for the rest.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That quotation was referred to in the <i>Irish Press</i> of 2nd June, 1957.  The <i>Irish Press</i> now wants to get rid of P.R. and wants the straight vote system here, but at that time the <i>Irish Press</i> advised its readers that this book was a fully documented account of how the Six-County minority is deprived of its rights, of how, for the benefit of the Stormont junta, democracy has been extinguished and they said that this book must be read by every Irishman and, having been read, it must be broadcast to the rest of the world.  Yet, that is the system they now want us to adopt.  Those were their views on 2nd June, 1957; they have somersaulted in the meantime and their views to-day are diametrically opposed to the views they held at that time.</P>
    <P>Let me quote the Taoiseach now. Away back in 1927 he stated that minorities should never be denied representation and if it was the object of those who advised the abolition of P.R. to wipe out minorities, then they would never get any support from him. They would get no support from him in 1927.  He is prepared to-day to abolish P.R. on his own.  He does not want the support of anybody in his proposal to wipe out P.R. and to suppress minorities.</P>
    <P>We believe in the legitimate rights of all minorities.  This is an agricultural country and, as a farmer, I claim that farmers should be represented in Parliament, if they wish to be represented there.</P>
    <Speaker pid="VictorCarton" hpid="Mr. Carton Mr. Carton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carton</NameTxt>
      <P>As farmers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>As farmers, as a minority group.  We could have a Socialist Government here interfering with the rights of farmers in different ways.  I see nothing wrong in the principle of producers coming together, putting forward candidates in an election, having them elected to Parliament <Col N="555" /> to fight for their rights, for justice and for fair play.  I claim the farmer minority is entitled to representation.</P>
      <P>We all know that the trade union movement is the biggest in the country. If this measure is passed and if we adopt the straight vote system, will we have a situation in which the doors of Leinster House will be closed in future to a Jim Larkin, to a James Connolly or to any other legitimate representative of the 800,000 workers in this country?  I claim Labour are entitled to be represented in Parliament.  Nobody can deny that both those sections make the largest contribution to our national economy.  If they are denied representation, they will still be subject to all the penalties of citizenship, whilst denied their fundamental right as citizens; it will be a case of taxation, rates, rent, and everything else, without representation.</P>
      <P>If this Bill is passed, the Labour Party will get it very hard.  They may get a possible two or three seats out of a total Dáil of 144 or 145 seats. They will have a very slender chance of getting any more than that.  Fianna Fáil are the largest Party in all but two of the constituencies at the moment.  Under this proposed new system, Fianna Fáil, the largest Party, stand to gain because it is the largest Party whose candidate tops the poll on the first count who will get the seat.  At the moment, small Parties&mdash; Independents, Labour and others&mdash; command something in the region of 500,000 votes.  If this proposal is carried, all their rights will be eliminated. I do not approve of that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If Sinn Féin are prepared to come into Parliament, to put forward candidates for election, to recognise the duly elected Government of the country and accept the authority of Parliament, then they should be in a position to command representation. We had people at another stage of our history who were not prepared to accept the authority of Parliament, but they had a safety valve.  They had P.R. and that gave them a chance of securing seats in Parliament.  They ultimately availed of that chance and they entered the Dáil in 1927.  That <Col N="556" /> safety valve should be left and if Sinn Féin wish to put forward candidates, who have a reasonable chance of being elected, they should be in a position to do so; but that can be done only under the system of P.R.</P>
    <P>A man should have the right to stand for any Party because, when we consider the matter properly, it is the individual candidate who counts and not so much the Party.  If good men are nominated on behalf of a small Party, they should at least &mdash; I say &ldquo;at least&rdquo;&mdash;have a reasonable chance of election.  They have that chance under P.R.  They will not have it under this proposed new system.  We know what happened in Northern Ireland when P.R. was abolished in 1929.</P>
    <P>I claim that the straight vote system will lead to unrepresentative Parliament and to arrogant government. Instead of proportional representation according to Party strength, we shall have disproportionate representation. No other system of election is as fair as P.R.  This straight vote system is the greatest gamble on earth, and we should not take gambles in this country at the present time.  If the country were properly managed, there would be full and plenty for everybody. There is work to be done by everybody; there are problems to be solved by everybody.  It is the duty of the Government to solve these problems instead of discussing this measure at length here and elsewhere.</P>
    <P>As I said, this proposed system is the greatest gamble on earth.  In 1945, the Labour Party in England polled 48 per cent. of the votes and they got a two to one majority of the seats in the House of Commons.  In 1951, Labour polled 48½ per cent. of the votes, one half per cent. more than they got in 1945, and they lost the election to the Conservatives, who polled around 44 per cent. or 45 per cent. of the votes.  In 1953, in South Africa, the Nationalist Party, with 590,000 votes, secured 92 seats, and the United Party with 608,000 votes&mdash; 10,000 or 12,000 more &mdash; got only 43 seats.  They did not get even half the number of seats&mdash;and that is the system we are asked now to adopt here.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="557" /> It may be no harm to quote the Tánaiste.  Even on 10th November, 1933, he was aware of the dangers that might arise under this system as they have arisen in South Africa.  In 1933, at a Fianna Fáil Árd-Fheis, it was proposed that the system of P.R. should be changed and the British system introduced and the Tánaiste said at that time that P.R. was certainly a better system than that which had prevailed heretofore and that which was then in operation in Great Britain.  The system which operated in that country might well give a minority a very substantial majority in Parliament.  It had done so in Britain and could do so here under the system of the single member constituency and the non-transferable vote.</P>
    <P>Those are not the words of Gerald L'Estrange but the words of the Tánaiste, who may be the next Taoiseach.  Nobody can put the matter better &mdash; at least, I cannot.  Those are the words of the Tánaiste about the proposal he is now asking the people to support, a proposal which would lead, to quote his own words, to a minority Government, a proposal which would be undemocratic and which might result in a policy being put into operation which had not the support of the majority of the people.</P>
    <P>We have heard a good deal about the chaos in France and we know that P.R., as we know it here, operated in France for only one year, 1945-46.  The real trouble in the past was not P.R. but the fact that Parliament was elected for five years and Deputies could elect a Premier to-day and put him out to-morrow, and their own seats were still safe as Parliament ran for five years.  That is not our system, but it is the reason why they had so much trouble and so many changes of Government in France.</P>
    <P>We have heard so much recently of the French system that it might be no harm to quote figures from the recent French elections.  I have taken the figures from <i>Figaro</i> and <i>Paris Soir</i> and I now quote:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Communist Party got 20.76 per cent. of the votes and 2.2 per cent. of the seats; U.N.R. got 26.47 <Col N="558" /> per cent. of the votes and 40.4 per cent. of the seats; S.F.I.O. got 13.79 per cent. of the votes and 8.6 per cent. of the seats; the Radical Socialists got 2.01 per cent. of the votes and 2.8 per cent. of the seats; other Parties and Independents got 36.97 per cent. of the votes and 46 per cent. of the seats.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I hold no briefs for the Communists but they got over 5,000,000 votes in the election in France and got only ten seats.  It took 500,000 votes to secure the election of one single Communist to the French Parliament, while the Government Party secured a seat with approximately 19,000 votes.  We have no Party in this country like the Communist Party.  We may have some Communist cells, an underground movement, but we have no Communist Party.  Our Labour Party is a Party which believes in full social justice and is a good Christian Catholic Party.</P>
    <P>Does the Government want to get into power with one-tenth of the votes it would take to elect another Party? It may have been all right to do that in France, but I claim there is no reason, good, bad or indifferent, for adopting similar tactics in this country. I entirely agree with the Taoiseach and with the Minister for External Affairs and if we had a Communist Party, I would stand behind them in any efforts they might make to put down that Party, but I shall not stand behind them in their efforts to crush minorities which are as well entitled to be represented in this House, and this Parliament, as Fianna Fáil or any other Party.</P>
    <P>The British system which the Fianna Fáil Party want to foist on us here has led to minority government, as I have told the House, in Great Britain. In Britain over a period of 19 out of 24 years, the Conservative Party have dominated the Government, even though they had a minority in the country.  In 31 British elections, the Labour Party lost 224 seats, when on the basis of its electoral voting strength, it should have lost only 39 seats.  Accordingly, I believe it is certain that if P.R. is done away with, we will repeatedly have minority Governments in power, and Parliaments in <Col N="559" /> which a majority of the people of the country will be denied representation.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil will have to admit that they came out all right under P.R. If we look at some figures of elections, we will see that, in 1951, Fianna Fáil polled 46 per cent. of the votes and got 47 per cent. of the seats.  Fine Gael polled 25.5 per cent. of the votes and got 26½ per cent. of the seats. That is not a system with which anybody can quarrel.  It gives fair representation to the people.  There are dangers inherent in the straight vote system, especially in this country, where we have two big Parties at the present time.  It is said that there is not much difference between these Parties, but I claim there is a lot of difference, but still it must be admitted that we have two Parties who are to the right of the centre of the road. We all know that in any country where there is the straight vote system, there will never be two Parties to the right of the centre of the road.  If there is in power in these countries such a party, there will be in opposition to them in all probability, a Socialist Party.  Remember that could easily happen here.</P>
    <P>We have many thousands of our kith and kin in Great Britain and if anything went wrong with Great Britain's economy, if they had to come back home and if we had this system, it could happen there would be an area with 10,000 people voting and a candidate getting 3,500 votes might get the seat.  If many people had to come back to this country and if there was unrest in that area, we could easily have what is known on the Continent as a Popular Front, with all these people coming together with Sinn Féin perhaps or some other Party, forming a Popular Front here and getting such a Government in power.  I do not think that any of us want to see a Government of that description in this country.</P>
    <P>We also agree that if this Bill is passed &mdash; and I do not believe it will&mdash; Fianna Fáil, through manipulation of the constituencies and gerrymandering &mdash;there is no use saying they would not do it; it has been done in the past <Col N="560" />&mdash;could get anything from 100 to 126 seats.  We know that they could then rivet themselves in power.  If we take the 1957 votes, Fianna Fáil is the largest Party in 39 out of the present 40 constituencies.  If the distribution of votes was in any way evenly divided in the different constituencies and if Fianna Fáil got the same vote as in the last general election &mdash; I will be truthful and say that I believe they will not&mdash; they could get 141 of the present 147 seats.  That is on the figures in respect of the 1957 election.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Sullivan the other day quoted something about what happened in Galway where Fine Gael headed the poll and was not elected. He claimed it was not fair representation because he headed the poll and was not elected.  Galway was one of those three-seat constituencies which Fianna Fáil made in 1947 so that if they had only 1 per cent. of the votes more than the other Party they would get two seats out of three.  Fine Gael got representation there because their other candidate was elected.</P>
    <P>Let us take the votes in regard to the County Galway in the last election. Fianna Fáil polled 11,783; Fine Gael, 8,135.  The result of that under P.R. in a constituency where they tried to defeat P.R. by making it a three-seat constituency, was that Fianna Fáil got two seats and Fine Gael got one. To-day on the straight vote system and if this Bill should go through, Fianna Fáil would get three seats for 11,783 votes and Fine Gael would get no seat for 8,135 votes.  Therefore, Fianna Fáil would get a seat for every 3,924 votes and Fine Gael would not get a seat at all despite the fact that they had 8,135 votes in that constituency. Certainly, under this system Fine Gael would get no representation in that constituency.</P>

The standard of living of each and every one of us in this country depends upon what the people of rural Ireland produce and export profitably abroad.  It could well happen that the townspeople would be able in small constituencies to outvote the country people.</P>

      <P>Let me take my own constituency, Westmeath.  If you divide up Westmeath in all probability you would have north and south.  You would have the town of Mullingar and the town of Athlone.  Nobody but people from Mullingar or the town of Athlone will have an opportunity of being elected in Westmeath.  The same would apply all round the country because the constituencies will definitely be built up round some big town.  Any man who is worth his salt in an election gets 1,000 personal votes. You will have an urban Dáil.  There is no denying that.  The people who produce all will not have fair representation.</P>
      <P>We know that the seats will be divided up on the basis of from 20,000 to 30,000 persons.  There are about 9,000 votes cast in any constituency. Therefore, a seat could be won on 3,500 votes, more or less representing 1,000 families.  As there are roughly from three to three and a half persons in each family, a Deputy could be elected to Parliament representing 1,000 families.  What sort of a Dáil would that be?  I claim that, under the present system, you would get a much better type of representative and a much better Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also claim that the abolition of P.R. can lead to arrogant government and dictatorship.  It could be a plan for permanent dictatorship here for years to come by keeping the one <Col N="562" /> Party in office.  We know that power leads to corruption.  We want a Government where everybody can get a fair crack of the whip, irrespective of class, creed or politics.</P>
    <P>When I speak of arrogant government, I want to say this: On the votes at the last election, Fianna Fáil could get 141 out of 146.  Let us say that their popularity is on the decline and let us further assumes that they get 100 to 120 seats which they can easily get under this system if it goes through; you will have no Opposition to stand up for the rights of the people.  You will have no Opposition to fight for fair prices for the farmers and a fair wage for the workers or anybody else.</P>
    <P>I want to know what happens where Fianna Fáil have a clear majority on the county councils.  The very same thing will happen when they have a clear majority in this House. Fianna Fáil have a clear majority on five county councils in Ireland and the inter-Party have a majority on 21.  On the 21 county councils the Fianna Fáil Party, although they are in the minority, get fair representation on the general county councils and on all the subsidiary bodies.  In the five councils where Fianna Fáil have a majority there is pure dictatorship.</P>
    <P>With regard to the five county councils, Fianna Fáil can nominate three men to the General Council of County Councils from each county. The five nominate 15 Fianna Fáil county councillors.  Five times three make 15 Fianna Fáil councillors and no other man ever gets a look in.  On the other hand, on every one of the councils where Fianna Fáil are in the minority every Party has a fair and just representation.  They are not denied representation on any one of the 21 county councils.</P>
    <P>I want to go further.  In the County Clare, Fianna Fáil have 17 and all others have 14 members.  Fianna Fáil have a very slender majority.  Every subsidiary body is filled by Fianna Fáil and no inter-Party member can get a chance.</P>

Many of those young county councillors in County Clare may be expecting to be, or may be, in the Government in a few years' time and if they are doing this at the present time it is only natural to expect they will do it here if they get this overall majority. I am pointing out what a strong Government with no Opposition can do. There is opposition in County Clare, they are only in a majority of three, but they do this in County Clare&mdash;&mdash;</P>

That is what strong government can do and that is what can happen if the Taoiseach gets an overall majority.  We have Deputy William Murphy in Clare with 9,000 votes and Vincent McHugh with two and a half quotas.  They are able men; I would say they would be better than the backbenchers of any Party, better than the backbenchers of Fine Gael.  They are denied representation on any single body in County Clare.  The Chairman of Clare County Council is here and he cannot deny that.</P>
      <P>The very same thing happened in County Galway.  Only Fianna Fáil get a look in there.  We have Fintan Coogan, T.D. who got 5,000 or 6,000 in the general election and he is denied representation on any of those bodies. That is very unfair.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach knows this is going on as well as anyone else.  That work was well done and was so much to the liking of the <Col N="565" /> Taoiseach that he nominated the Chairman of the Clare County Council to this Seanad on every occasion.  He has said: &ldquo;Well done, thou good and faithful servant; because thou hast been faithful over few things, I will place thee over many.&rdquo;  He brings him in here into the Seanad.  There is no denying that the Taoiseach knows it is going on.  He has been putting his ear to the ground and he is not as sanctimonious as he may look or as he lets on to be.</P>
      <P>All this is altogether wrong.  It shows what Fianna Fáil can do and will do.  That is the reason we in this House have such fear.  If they went before the Irish people and if everything were done in a straight fashion and above board, we would have no fear; but the people who are past masters of this kind of thing can make sure, when they get a majority, that they will kill &mdash; or try to kill &mdash; Fine Gael, Labour or any other Party which tries to raise its head.</P>
      <P>The abolition of P.R. and the adoption of the British system will also make more difficult the ending of Partition.  Again and again, here and outside, the Taoiseach has said that Partition is our outstanding problem. He told us on numerous occasions that it is the one problem nearest and dearest to his heart.  He had a plan to end Partition in 1932 and I think he had a plan to end it at every election since then.  If he were serious about it, the last move in the world that he would make would be to give even the appearance of seeking one-Party domination in a united Ireland.  The representatives of the Northern Government themselves know how it has worked there. They know what they have been able to do with majorities.  The Unionists in Northern Ireland, who know so much about the straight vote, who know exactly how the straight vote works, who know how to keep down minorities, are not going to come in here as a minority themselves under this system, because they know that there can be one-Party domination and that they would never get a chance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We were all very glad to hear the <Col N="566" /> views of Senator Stanford, Senator Sheehy Skeffington, Senator Fearon and other Senators who can be looked upon definitely as independent Senators.  We admire them for the stand they have taken on this Bill.  I can do no better than quote the words of Deputy Dockrell, a member of the minority in this country, as spoken in the Dáil on the 13th January, 1959, and reported in Volume 172, column 412, of the Official Debates:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Taoiseach touched lightly on the question of the North.  The abolition of P.R. can by no stretch of the imagination be deemed to be a help towards the solution of Partition. The fact that the North did away with P.R. in 1929, or whatever year it was, is no excuse for the South trying to do away with it in 1959.  Some day when Partition will have gone &mdash; it may not be in my lifetime, but some day it will have gone &mdash; the bringing together of our people will be made all the easier, I believe, if we have a system here which readily accepts minorities, a system which will have become so accustomed to the handling of minorities that, out of that handling, there will have developed a very fine instrument of parliamentary democracy.  Such a system will make the united Ireland to which we all look forward that much easier.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I could not put this point better than he has put it.  The really important words are those in which he points out that, if we have a system here which readily accepts minorities, a united Ireland will be made easier than under a system where minorities may be trampled upon.</P>
    <P>I said in my opening remarks that this Bill has not been demanded by public opinion.  There was a general election last year; there were other general elections in 1954, 1951, 1948, 1944, 1943 and in other years.  We heard no reference to P.R., to the abolition of P.R., in any of those elections.  It was never put before the people of this country.  The Government were elected &ldquo;to get cracking&rdquo;, to end emigration and unemployment and not to put up the cost of living or reduce <Col N="567" /> the food subsidies.  They never mentioned P.R. in any of their election speeches and they were not elected to abolish P.R.</P>
    <P>All the time, the Taoiseach has been telling us that people should come together and let their policies be known before elections so that the electorate will know what they are going to do.  He has told us that Parties should not come together afterwards, but should place their policy before the people so that they can vote on it.  Surely he cannot come in here and tell us that the people of Ireland, in the last election, voted for the abolition of P.R., or gave the Government any mandate to abolish it?</P>
    <P>They never said they were going to do it; yet the Taoiseach, at column 996 of the Official Report for 26th November, 1958, when he seemingly referred to the demand for this measure which was evident to him, stated:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It has been suggested that there has been no public opinion, no voice asking for this.  All I can say to the Leader of the Opposition is that, if he thinks that, he must have had cotton wool in his ears from 1948 to 1951 and from 1954 to 1957, because everywhere I went through the country, everyone I met wanted to know when were we going to get rid of that system which was going to ruin the country.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We know he was abroad most of the time from 1948 to 1951, and I do not believe he heard that clamouring at any time from Fine Gael supporters. He might have heard it from Fianna Fáil supporters who were dissatisfied because they were not in office.  P.R. seems to be all right for this country when it elects Fianna Fáil to office, but it is completely wrong for this country when it elects any other Government to office.  He heard those stories during the years the inter-Party Government were in office.</P>
    <P>I have been in public life for 17 years.  I am a member of a county council, of the General Council of County Councils and other bodies, <Col N="568" /> and I have not heard in all these bodies during the past 17 years&mdash; even during the years 1948 to 1951, or the years 1951 to 1954 &mdash; one solitary whisper of a demand for the abolition of P.R.  There is no doubt that if a young Fianna Fáil enthusiast in Westmeath County Council, or anywhere else, thinks the Taoiseach is thinking in a particular way, he loves to put down a motion at a council meeting and have his name in the paper.  Fine Gael councillors do it and Fianna Fáil councillors love to do it also, but, as I said, during those 17 years, there was not even a single whisper to that effect.  I do not know if even the most insignificant organisation in the country, at any time during the past 20 years, has called for the abolition of P.R.  There was a resolution at the Fine Gael Árd-Fheis in 1933.  That is a long number of years ago and there has not been a resolution, even at a Fianna Fáil Árd-Fheis, calling for the abolition of P.R. since then.</P>
    <P>The Church in this country advises the different Governments, advises the people, if it sees things are wrong or going wrong in particular times, and never once, in my memory, has any churchman called for the abolition of P.R., or asked that it be changed and that we have the straight vote in order to lead to better Government and better Parliament.  We have the brains of the country in our universities and I do not think any such call has ever come from any of them.  As a matter of fact, I cannot find any evidence, even amongst Fianna Fáil supporters, to show that this Bill is wanted.  I found nothing but praise for the old system of election but then suddenly this year the Taoiseach discovered that it is a freak.  Senator Ó Maoláin tells us the foundation is wrong from the very beginning and that there are serious defects in it.  Why were these serious defects not found in it in the past 20 years?</P>
    <P>We are told by the Fianna Fáil Party that we will get a better type of Deputy and will have less &ldquo;deadwood&rdquo; in the Parties under the straight vote system. We were told to-day by Senator Lenihan that we will get a better type <Col N="569" /> of Deputy, but I want to say that we will get the Deputy the Party bosses want us to get, and no other.  That is the greatest disadvantage of the proposed change.  It will lead to the growth of power of the Party.  You will have the Party machine choice of candidate.  The choice of the candidate will rest with the machine and not with the people.</P>
    <P>I should like to quote the present Pope, as reported in the <i>Irish Catholic</i> of 23rd December, 1958.  Pope John XXIII was calling on the faithful to participate actively in the political life of their country and carefully to select their parliamentary representatives.  If this Bill goes through, the people cannot participate actively or select the best men.  They will have only to vote for the men thrust upon them by the Party machine.  The Pope stated:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Voters must choose their representatives with the greatest wisdom and knowledge because their choice is of particular importance in a democratic régime in which the representatives of the people have legislative power.</P>
    <P>The moral rectitude, the practical capacity and the intellectual powers of parliamentary deputies are for the people of a democratic régime a matter of life and death, of prosperity or of decadence, of recovery or of perpetual ill condition.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If this Bill goes through, the people will have no choice, good, bad or indifferent. The Party conventions will be held and the Party bosses will rule.</P>
    <P>It might be no harm to quote An tAthair Ó Heideain, O.P., M.A., who wrote in the <i>Standard</i> of the 15th December, 1958, as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Under P.R., a Party supporter is given a choice between several candidates; in West Galway, for example, three were put forward by Fianna Fáil and two by Fine Gael. In a single member constituency, however, a Party would put forward only one candidate and electors who wanted to support the Party's general policy would have no choice but to vote for him.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Even taking Westmeath, where I <Col N="570" /> have always seen 12 to 14 candidates at an election, the people can go out, select and vote for the candidate they think best, even irrespective of a Party.  In a position like that, as Pope John XXIII said, the moral rectitude, the practical capacity and the intellectual powers of the candidate can be taken into consideration. A voter can weigh up the intellectual powers and the intellectual capacity of the 14 candidates.  He can say: &ldquo;These particular five candidates are the five best men.  I judge them as such: I will vote for them 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.&rdquo;  However, under the new system, he will become only a cog in the Party machine.  The Party bosses will do the work.  If he is a Fianna Fáil man they will select the candidate and he will toe the line.  The other Parties will do the same.  The people themselves will have very little power.  The Party bosses will have all the power.</P>
    <P>I want to read this quotation from the <i>Irish Press</i> of 29th January last.  It is a report of the Taoiseach's speech when winding up the debate in the Dáil on the 28th January.  He is reported as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;As he understood it, the whole purpose of representative democracy was to try to get into Parliament members who would represent the constituency that elected them. That was done far better, in his opinion, by the system of single-member constituency and the nontransferable vote than by the system they called proportional representation. Surely the best form of representation was that the people in a single constituency would vote for the person they thought best represented their views with regard to their own interests and the national interest.  You got that by the single-member constituency.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Who, in the name of goodness, does the present Taoiseach think he is codding?  The people have no choice. The Party select the man and the electors have only to go out and put their &ldquo;X&rdquo; before his name, if this measure is carried.  They have no other say, good, bad or indifferent.</P>
    <P>But, under P.R., the electors had the chance, as the Taoiseach said, of voting for people who represented <Col N="571" /> their views.  They have not that chance under the Taoiseach's proposed system, good, bad or indifferent.  It is not right that certain Ministers should try to mislead the people.  In Longford, on 18th January last, the Minister for Health, Deputy MacEntee, made a speech which was reported the following day in the <i>Irish Independent.</i>  He was speaking about P.R. and he is reported as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;From the point of view of public interest it produces many undesirable, in fact, positively harmful situations.  Chief among them was that it gave the Party bosses so much power that between them they had almost absolute control of Parliament.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Nobody ever heard anything farther from the truth than that.  In a constituency such as Westmeath, the Party bosses would nominate five candidates in Fianna Fáil's case and perhaps five candidates in Fine Gael's case.  The Party bosses could nominate five.  The people went out and voted for their choice and elected two or three and the Party bosses had no power.</P>
    <P>I am wondering now if the Minister for Health, Deputy MacEntee, is annoyed here with the power the present Taoiseach had and the Fianna Fáil bosses had over their candidates for a long number of years.  I claim that Fianna Fáil and the Taoiseach have continually, over the years, dictated to the Party conventions as to those whom he wanted selected as candidates.  As reported at column 2338 of Volume 171 of the Official Report of Dáil Éireann, the Taoiseach said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;There are the rivalries of various kinds that occur in multiple-member constituencies.  They will not be there any longer.  The rivalries that occur are very disedifying and tend to bring democratic representation into disrepute.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If they have had those things at Fianna Fáil conventions, it would be much better if the Taoiseach did not put them on record in Leinster House. I know that these things have happened and that the Taoiseach has had the last say.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="572" /> We know that the Roscommon Fianna Fáil Convention in 1957 got instructions to select a certain candidate. He is in this House.  I believe he would make a much better Deputy than some of the other candidates.  The convention met.  They did not select him.  They sent three names.  Headquarters refused to sanction the three selected and called another convention for the following week.  They met again and the convention refused to select the particular candidate that headquarters wanted.  They sent up the other names.  Lo and behold, they were sanctioned with the addition of the other candidate, nominated by the Fianna Fáil National Council.  That appeared in the local papers and there is no denying it.</P>
    <P>In 1952, at the Wicklow by-election, a Fianna Fáil candidate was selected by the people.  As the Taoiseach said a few months ago in his remarks which I quoted to the House, the people should have the say.  The Fianna Fáil National Executive turned nominees down.  They would not allow them to go forward, as their Party nominees, to the people.</P>
    <P>The same happened in Carlow-Kilkenny when the daughter of a former Minister for Agriculture was selected. The Fianna Fáil Party bosses and the Party bosses of the organisation refused to ratify the selection of that candidate.  The same happened in Sligo-Leitrim with a Fianna Fáil candidate and it also happened in Kerry. Therefore, instead of, as the Taoiseach stated, the people having the power under the new system, the reverse in fact is the case.  The Party bosses will have more power now than they had in the past.</P>

      <P>I think the greatest result of the new system will be that the people will not have a choice of selecting from a panel of candidates the man they want to represent them.  Senator Lenihan stated in this debate that the proposed system will give us a much better type of Deputy. He went on to say that good Independents can be elected and will be elected.  I think he is contradicting the Taoiseach there because the Taoiseach himself admitted that what he wants are two large Parties &mdash; no Independents.  The Taoiseach and Senator Lenihan cannot be right at the same time.</P>
      <P>Senator Lenihan said that the new system will give us a better type of Deputy.  Deputy Seán Flanagan said something similar in the Dáil.  It might be no harm to quote what Deputy Seán Flanagan said in Dáil Eireann on 10th December, 1958, at column 1787, Volume 171.  He said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;There is far too much deawood in this House, people coming in on the third or fourth count in a five-member constituency and doing nothing.  That is one of the reasons why I hope that P.R. will be abolished and one of the reasons why I am sure the new system will lead to a better Parliament, a Parliament with less deadwood.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>As I said, Senator Lenihan referred to something similar to-day.  I do not agree with him and I think the people are better judges, any time, of the candidates who go before them than the political bosses.  The political bosses&mdash; and I say this as one who knows a little about politics &mdash; are more inclined to select the good Party man.  One thing is certain, that is, that Fianna Fáil have always done that and if they are in a strong Government, they will continue to do it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When speaking about deadwood and <Col N="574" /> about men being elected on the fifth and sixth counts, at the bottom of the poll, I might mention that the Minister for Lands was elected on the tenth count with 5,902 votes, 1,000 short of the quota, in 1951 and that, in 1954, in Dublin South-East, the Minister for Health was elected with 6,391 votes, on the last count, 1,000 short of the quota. When speaking of deadwood, are we to regard as deadwood the Minister who is in Health and the Minister who is in Lands at the present time?  Apparently Fianna Fáil and the Taoiseach have no objection to putting deadwood into two of the most important Ministries in this State.  That is what that means, if Senator Lenihan and Deputy Seán Flanagan and other members of the Fianna Fáil Party are correct in what they say about P.R.</P>
    <P>Let us come to the question of stability and strong government.  This is the argument that is commonly used for the abolition of P.R. &mdash; that the British system, that is, the system of the straight vote, would give a strong Government.  I want to say that strong government is no substitute for good government.  What we want at present is good government, not strong government.  This little country of ours unfortunately, I might say, has had ample experience of strong government. We have had experience of strong government from Oliver Cromwell and Lord Salisbury, the British Tory leader, who in the Parnellite days proclaimed that 20 years of resolute government would be a cure for all Irish ills.  Does the Taoiseach want to follow in the footsteps of Lord Salisbury and say that 20 years of strong Fianna Fáil government is a cure for all Irish ills?  Fianna Fáil are now using the language of the oppressors as well as the system of the oppressors.</P>
    <P>It should be the concern of each and every one of us in this House to get and to retain good government.  You have strong government in many countries throughout the world and many of them have not been good Governments.  We know power is not necessarily beneficial and that power corrupts.  We know that there was strong government in Germany and in various other countries.  You can say <Col N="575" /> that there is strong government in Russia to-day; that there is strong government in Poland &mdash; and we know what they did in 1956 with the Catholics when there was an uprising. There is a strong Government in Yugoslavia and in Red China, but surely that is not the kind of government we want?  They are the people who talk more than anyone else about the rights of the people, about the people's democracy and about peace. They never stop talking about peace at the U.N.O.</P>
    <P>Nobody can deny that we have had stability here, no matter what the Taoiseach or any other member of the Fianna Fáil Party may state.  Since the foundation of this State, we have had only five changes of Government, in 36 years, and three Taoisigh.  There is no other country in the world which can claim that record.  From 1922 to 1932, we had a Government of young men, a Government which had a hard task and which took over from the British. They helped to build up this State; they founded the Civic Guards and our Irish Army, of which we are all so proud; they started the first of our industries; they started the Shannon scheme, which was said to be a white elephant at that time; they started the first of our beet factories and there is no denying that they were what could be described as a strong and efficient Government.  They had to be a strong Government because of the opposition which they met at that time from people who did not believe in the rights of the majority of the people, people who were then in a minority but who were not prepared to obey the laws of the country.</P>
    <P>We know they continued in office, and we had stability, from 1922 to 1932.  There was a change of Government then and Fianna Fáil came into office in 1932 on a series of promises which they made to the people and which they never fulfilled.  The Governments from 1932 to 1948 were, in many ways, strong Governments and stable Governments, because, as Senator Hayes stated, they were able to carry out executions; they had the economic war and they were even able to reduce our cattle population&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>In any case, they were referred to as a strong Government and they did those things.  From 1948 to 1951, we had a change of Government and that Government was attacked by Senators on the far side of the House.  As an attack has been made on Coalition Governments and as they are supposed to be the reason for and the cause of all our woes and troubles, we should be at least allowed to make certain references to their work.  We were told to-day by Senator Ó Donnabháin of the huge debt the Coalition Government left in 1951. Despite the fact that I listened to the Minister for External Affairs in County Louth talking about those debts, and despite the fact that other Ministers made the same accusations, the Taoiseach, to give him his due, admitted in Cork that they were left £24,000,000 of Marshall Aid in the &ldquo;kitty&rdquo; when the change of Government came in 1951.  There was even £6,000,000 of that money available when the Agricultural Institute was being set up last year.  The inter-Party Government spent only £16,000,000 in three and a quarter years; Fianna Fáil spent the other £8,000,000 in six months.  Senator Seán O'Donovan is wrong when he says that debts were left because the Taoiseach himself admitted in Cork what I have said.</P>
      <P>The Government elected in 1948 trebled our exports, doubled our output, built hospitals, houses and schools and, as Senator Sheehy Skeffington said, the T.B. sufferers know the good work that was done by that Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Do we in the Twenty-Six Counties want the stability and strong government they have in Northern Ireland, where elections are a mere farce, where half the constituencies are not even contested and the results are known beforehand?  Is strength the only quality required in a Government? Unfortunately, the bitter message of history is that Governments can be stronger than they are wise.  We have had many strong <Col N="577" /> Governments here, but I doubt if they were sufficiently wise.  What we want is good government and in order to have that, we must have a Government supported by the majority of the people.  You are sure of getting that kind of Government under P.R.; you cannot be certain of getting that under the system now advocated by the Taoiseach.  You had minority government in Britain for 18 out of 24 years; we could have minority government here for the next 20 years.</P>
    <P>This is what the Taoiseach had to say on 20th January, 1948, as reported in the <i>Irish Press:</i>&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;A Government is strong only if it has a majority in Parliament because with our system the Government depends on the majority it has in Parliament.  It is a weak Government if it has not a strong majority.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now, the Taoiseach goes on:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is not strong merely because it has a parliamentary majority.  If it can be suggested that a Government is not supported by the people then the Government by that very fact is a weak Government.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We are asked by the Taoiseach and Fianna Fáil to adopt a system which may give us minority government for years to come and we are asked to do that in the face of views already expressed by the Taoiseach, notwithstanding the fact that he is on record as saying that no matter what majority a Government may have in this House, it is a weak Government unless it has a majority of the people behind it.  A Government elected under P.R. has because of that fact, a majority of the people behind it, while a Government elected under the straight vote may very well be a minority Government.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil claim they want strong government.  They have that at present; they have a majority of 12 or 14 and I wonder if they consider that is not strong enough to carry out their policy.  Do they want a Government such as exist in countries abroad?  Why cannot this Government with a large, sound and solid majority behind them feel completely <Col N="578" /> stable and able to carry out the promises they made before the last election?  I am afraid the whole theme of the debate as we have heard it here is that stability and security and Fianna Fáil are one and the same thing.</P>
    <P>We have been told that P.R. leads to Coalition Governments but Coalition Governments were formed here only in 1948 because of the failure of Fianna Fáil to live up to their promises up to them.  The Taoiseach has spoken at length about Parties making false promises, but if Fianna Fáil had lived up to their promises and fulfilled the wonderful things they promised the Irish people, there would have been no change of Government in 1948. No matter what has been said on the other side, it was a proud day for the country when Labour, Fine Gael, Farmers and Clann na Poblachta came together with one aim alone &mdash; to do their best for all sections of the community, irrespective of class, creed or politics.  There is no denying they did that during their term of office.</P>
    <P>Going through the Dáil and Seanad debates, I find that on no fewer than 16 occasions did the Taoiseach speak about and condemn Coalition Governments. I should like to know what was wrong with the Coalition Governments of 1948 and 1951 when they were all right in 1927 when Fianna Fáil were trying to form a coalition with Labour and with the Farmers, if they could get them.  The Taoiseach tried it at that time but because he failed then, he has hated Coalition Governments ever since.</P>
    <P>Speaking about bargaining as reported at column 2346, Volume 171 of the Official Reports the Taoiseach had this to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Everyone who was living in this country in 1948 knows perfectly well it does mean that&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He was speaking of bargaining</P>
    <P>&ldquo;&mdash;&mdash;and if there is any doubt in anyone's mind as to whether it would mean that or not, they have only to turn their minds back to 1948 and ask themselves what happened in 1948.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="579" /> He goes on:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;...but bargaining between the other Parties took place; they got some Independents to help them, and they came back and pretended they were elected as a Government by the Irish people.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach was speaking there about the Parties that came together at that time to form a Government and do their best for all sections, but his words tell us exactly what Fianna Fáil did in 1951.  They got some Independents to help them, and they came back and pretended they were elected as a Government by the Irish people. We know that Fianna Fáil were a minority in 1951.  The Taoiseach told us in the Seanad and he stated in the Dáil that he had no objection if Parties came together before an election and made the promises they intended to meet, but he did not do that.</P>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil Party met and published a 17-point programme.  The promises made in that programme were not made from a platform in the heat of a general election.  They were made in the Fianna Fáil Party rooms and signed by no less a person than the Taoiseach.  This programme was formed after the 1951 election despite the fact that the Taoiseach says now that all the bargaining should be done before an election.  It is wrong if Fine Gael or anybody else does it but it is quite in order when Fianna Fáil does it.  Point 15 of that programme was: &ldquo;To maintain the subsidies and to reduce the cost of living.&rdquo;  That point in the programme was deliberately ignored in less than nine months when Fianna Fáil reduced the subsidies and increased the cost of living.</P>

      <P>As I say, the bargaining was done.  As a result of this 17-point programme the five Independents came in and voted for Fianna Fáil and the people at the next election threw the five of them out.  I am sorry the Taoiseach is not here now <Col N="580" /> because I would ask him a question in relation to the following quotation from a speech he made as reported at column 995, Volume 171 of the Dáil Debates of the 26th November, 1958:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I have no doubt whatever that, had we been in and had there been a second election in 1948, we would again have got the power, but we required in each case two elections to secure it.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>They would have gone to the country in 1949 as they did in 1933 after the 1932 election, as they did in 1937 after the 1936 election and in 1943 after the 1942 election.  I am delighted Senator Lenihan is bowing his head in agreement. I should like to ask him this question.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  If there was no bargain with the Independents that they would not lose their seats for three years, why did the Taoiseach not go to the country in 1952?  It was simply because he had an agreement with those Independents that he would not go to the country.  Those people were rejected by the electorate in the 1954 election.  I defy contradiction on this because it was told to me by a man who was a Fianna Fáil Senator and who had lost his seat in the 1954 election.  This is what he told me: &ldquo;The Taoiseach came into the Fianna Fáil Party rooms when they were putting the names of their candidates on the Seanad ballot paper and he said: &lsquo;The names of Dr. ffrench O'Carroll and Mr. Cogan must go on that paper.&rsquo;&rdquo;  The names of Dr. ffrench O'Carroll and Mr. Cogan went on that ballot paper.</P>
      <P>Shortly before that at column 30, Volume 110, of the Dáil Debates of the 18th February, 1948, the then Deputy Cogan said of the Taoiseach, Deputy de Valera:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Just as King Herod sought to destroy an Infant rival, so Eamon de Valera sought to destroy a new Party in the field.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He goes on to criticise the Taoiseach but despite that Deputy Cogan and <Col N="581" /> Deputy Dr. ffrench O'Carroll were made Senators.  They were rejected at the last Seanad election and one of them has since been appointed on a commission at roughly the same salary he would get if he were a member of the Seanad.  What I want to ask is: will somebody stand up here and contradict that statement?</P>
    <P>We are also told that P.R. leads to a multiplicity of Parties.  That is not in accordance with the facts.  I should like to produce the evidence I have to the contrary.  We shall take it that four members constitute a Party, and in 1923 we had four Parties in this State.  You had Sinn Féin, the Cumann na nGaedheal Party, the Labour Party and the Farmers' Party.  Three of those Parties were represented in the Dáil and the other Party was sulking outside the gates like little children.  They had not dumped their arms at that time or made up their minds to come into Leinster House and accept the Constitution of the State.  Applying the same yardstick, in 1959 we have only three Parties as against four Parties in 1923.  In fact more Parties were born and died under P.R. than came to maturity.  In the intervening years you had the People's Party, the National League, the Farmers' Party and the Centre Party, but we have had only three large Parties here for the past 36 years.  The two major Parties at the present time have over 120 of the 147 seats.</P>
    <P>When we have heard so much about France and about the new system of election, it might be a good argument to say that 18 Parties went forward at the last French election and 12 or 14 of those Parties have representation in the French Parliament.  Therefore, it is not in accordance with the facts to say that P.R. leads to a multiplicity of Parties.  As I state, we had four in 1923 and we have only three Parties now.  If P.R. goes, another danger is that it will drive Parties underground.</P>
    <P>We all understand the Irish people and know what they are capable of doing.  They will have their freedom. They fought for it for 700 years.  They fought against the British and they will not be denied their freedom now by <Col N="582" /> any political Party.  If Parties are denied representation, they will not disappear overnight.  There is an old saying that you can lead the Irish, but you cannot drive them.  The more you try to trample on the Irish people, the more they will defy you.  If they can get representation under P.R., they will seek it through the normal channels in keeping with the Constitution; but if they are denied that representation, they may seek other means of making their presence felt.</P>
    <P>The danger of such developments is quite obvious.  It has happened before and it can happen again.  Suppose the right of representation in the Dáil and Seanad were taken from the Labour Party in the morning?  They are strongly organised at present.  If they wanted to in the future, they could cripple this country.  No one can deny that, when the strength of the trade unions totals 800,000.  I am not saying they should do so or that it would be right for them, but they could not be blamed for doing it, if their rights were taken away.</P>
    <P>As far as Sinn Féin are concerned, so long as we have P.R., the safety valve is there.  They can utilise their energies in trying to get representation in Leinster House and in using Parliament to gain their ends; but if you take that representation away and keep them out, as this Bill will do, you will definitely drive them underground.  The safety valve is there and it would be a bad day's work if it were taken away. I want this to be clearly understood. I make no defence of anyone who goes out with a gun against any established Government here.  It has never been the history of our Party.  As far as we are concerned, we are consistent in that since 1921.  But, at the same time, if we deny those people in Sinn Féin their legitimate rights, we are driving them underground and driving them, perhaps, into violent ways.</P>
    <P>In 1927, after the murder of Kevin O'Higgins by people who did not subscribe to legitimate government, by people who were driven underground because they claimed at that time they were not getting their rights &mdash; or at <Col N="583" /> least what they thought were their rights &mdash; the present Taoiseach made a better case in support of my argument than I would be able to make.  In Volume 40, column 53, of the Dáil Debates, the Taoiseach referred to the fact that many people had taken up arms here and said this about strong government:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Ministers opposite know only one way in which to solve them!  Anyone who gets in your path, &lsquo;squelch him, by God, squelch him&rsquo;, as Carlyle said of Ireland. That is the only policy apparently that the Executive Council knows how to put into operation.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach was talking about strong government at that time.  It was too strong for him then.  He said they were too strong and that all they wanted to do was to squelch the people and walk on them.  Now he wants to get into power again a Party that will be sufficiently strong to squelch the people in the future.  He goes on:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;If you deny people who are animated with honest motives, peaceful ways of doing it, you are throwing them back upon violent ways of doing it.  Once they are denied the peaceful way they will get support for the violent way that they would never get otherwise. There is no use in my preaching that doctrine to the Executive Council.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach stated at that time that they would turn towards violent ways. If we deny our young people their rights and take from them what they are entitled to, the danger is you may have here in years to come a Castro such as we have seen in Cuba recently. They will fight for their freedom and let nobody take it from them.</P>
    <P>As I said, the abolition of P.R. could easily result in a minority getting the majority of seats.  That gravely weakens the authority of Parliament to speak for the people. Nobody can deny that.  In the last few years, I notice that the minority group in this country &mdash; I refer to the I.R.A. &mdash; have claimed the right to use arms without the authority of Parliament. <Col N="584" /> The challenge from those people was met by reasserting the authority of the majority.  But if the Government were a minority Government, how could they effectively answer another minority?  It would be very hard for a minority Government to try to put down another minority; but when they are in a majority, as they would be if elected under P.R., they would be entitled, in the name of the majority they represent, to crush any conspiracy, whether against the lawfully elected Government of the Twenty-Six Counties, the Government of the Six Counties or any other country.</P>
    <P>The danger is that these people, when they go underground, can go back on history and quote the Taoiseach's words to any of us here or they can throw them in the Taoiseach's face, as I shall do now. Remember this is the Taoiseach, who is now asking us to accept his views in regard to P.R. and asking the people to put him into the highest position in the country.  In Volume 28, column 1400, of the Dáil Debates, he stated:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;When we were involved in civil war... I for one, when the flag of the Republic was run up against an Executive... stood by the flag of the Republic and I will do it again.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I was glad to hear Senator Lenihan to-day say that it is important to protect democracy.  Democracy was getting very little protection in those days from the Leader of the Fianna Fáil Party, the man who is Taoiseach and the Head of the Government to-day.  He said then:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;When we were involved in civil war... I for one, when the flag of the Republic was run up against an Executive,... stood by the flag of the Republic and I will do it again.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>If P.R. is abolished Sinn Féin, the I.R.A. and others may be driven underground and they may be inclined to adopt the attitude the Taoiseach adopted in 1929.  Remember, it was 1929.  It was not away back in the days when he was a wild revolutionary boy.  In 1929 he was the Leader of the Fianna Fáil Party.  The young people in Sinn Féin to-day are imbued with the same ideals and if we take away the safety valve of P.R. and deprive them of their right of coming into Dáil Éireann they may go underground; they may take up the gun and <Col N="586" /> stand by the flag of the Republic, as the Taoiseach stated he had done and was prepared, in 1929, to do again.  If he was prepared to do so again in 1929, one cannot blame the young people to-day doing in 1959 what the Taoiseach was prepared to do in 1929. He was a mature man then.</P>
      <P>He was questioned about the authority of Dáil Éireann to speak for the people and he made this astounding statement &mdash; at least it is astounding to me &mdash; at column 1398 of Volume 28 of the Official Report:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;We are asked to state clearly what our attitude to this House is.  I have on more than one occasion said exactly what our attitude was.  I still hold that our right to be regarded as the legitimate Government of the country is faulty, that this House itself is faulty.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Does he still think it is faulty?</P>
      <P>Unless the Taoiseach is prepared to come in here now and withdraw those words, these young people are entitled to say to the Taoiseach: &ldquo;This House is faulty and, if the National Assembly is faulty, have we not a perfect right to take up arms against a faulty Government and a Government that is not in order?&rdquo;  Surely, those arguments can be used to-day by the young people if we take from them the right which they have at the present time under P.R. and which a wise and good Government gave them in the Constitution of 1922 and for which we, the successors of that good Government, are prepared to fight at the present time.</P>
      <P>Fianna Fáil have a very healthy majority in the Dáil.  I think they have a majority of ten or 12.  Why cannot they get on with their plan for the country?  They told us they had a plan.  We have 85,000 unemployed at the moment.</P>

      <P>I do not need this month's <i>National Observer</i>, or anything else.  That is a well-known fact in relation to both unemployment and emigration.  I told the House earlier &mdash;Senator Mullins was not here&mdash;about the Secretary of the Fianna Fáil Party who stated at a meeting in Longford three weeks ago that he never knew such poverty to exist; in six houses that he visited, an average of two out of three had emigrated in the last two or three years.  That was not my experience.  That was the experience of the Secretary of the Fianna Fáil Party.  It would be much better if the Government tried to do something about these problems rather than introduce a Bill dealing with our electoral system.</P>
      <P>Senator Lenihan dealt at length to-day with a statement that appeared in the <i>Irish Times.</i>  We all know we were told we would have a £100,000,000 plan three years ago.  It has been put into cold storage.  Of course, we shall hear a great deal about these plans in the next six or eight months.  It would be much better for the country if the Government would get down to doing the work they were elected to do &mdash; reducing the cost of living, providing employment, ending emigration and making credit available.</P>
      <P>In 1919 and in 1927 the Taoiseach was in favour of P.R.  In 1937 he enshrined it in the Constitution.  He comes along now and tells us it is wrong.  We are asked now to accept the recommendations of a man who says that the system he favoured in 1919, 1927 and 1937 is wrong.  There is no denying the wheel has come full circle as far as the Taoiseach is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a revolutionary proposal which may well have very serious repercussions on the political system and on the people as a whole, repercussions which none of us can foresee now.  We are taking a leap in the dark. I believe we should retain the system we have, the system which, as the Taoiseach himself said, has worked well, which the Tánaiste told us has <Col N="588" /> worked well and which even the Minister for Health, Deputy MacEntee, told us in 1953 had worked well; the Minister for Health said that the Irish people have P.R. and they should not let anybody take it from them.  I appeal to the people now not to let anybody take it from them and not to let anybody impose on them the British or the Six-County system of election.  The only solace the Taoiseach and his Government can offer to our suffering people to-day is to tell them to forget their troubles: &ldquo;You are all right.  We will give you this referendum instead of the reforms we promised you.&rdquo;  That is how Fianna Fáil are &ldquo;getting cracking&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I am entitled to discuss this Bill because people fought for the rights of freedom and free speech in Dáil Éireann and in this House.  There has been some criticism, and Senator Lenihan referred to obstructionist tactics and one thing and another, but we are entitled to debate the Bill here and let the people know what exactly they are voting on.  Fianna Fáil would like to keep them in the dark, rush them into the polling booths and get them to vote &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;.  We appeal to them on this question to vote &ldquo;No&rdquo;. No better example can be quoted than Senator Mrs. Connolly O'Brien who was nominated by the Taoiseach, and who stated that when she goes into the polling booth, she will vote &ldquo;No&rdquo; and that she advises and has advised the people to vote &ldquo;No&rdquo;.  I know she was in an awkward position and she has said that she will vote for the Bill in the Seanad but will advise the people to vote against it.</P>
    <P>We are being asked to pass this Bill on the advice of the Taoiseach.  I ask the people not to take his advice or his judgment because he has been consistently wrong over the past 40 years. His own words in this House and in the Dáil have proved that he has been consistently wrong.  He was wrong in the past when he refused to enter Parliament and said he would never enter it, but entered afterwards.  Was he right when he said he would not take the oath and then took it?  Was he wrong when he made the promises of 1932, about derating and so on, and did not keep them?  Was he wrong when he <Col N="589" /> said he would abolish the Seanad and was he right when he set it up again? Was he right when he said that the office of President of this little country was costing too much, that we were not like the British Empire and could not afford it and that we should abolish it?  If he was right then, is he right now when he seeks the office of President for himself?</P>
    <P>Was he right in 1951 and 1954 when he promised to maintain the food subsidies and reduce the cost of living?  If he was right when he promised to maintain the subsidies and reduce the cost of living, surely he could not be right when he did away with the subsidies and raised the cost of living by over 30 points, as he did in two Budgets?  Was he right &mdash; I claim that no man in a Christian country could be right&mdash;to advise his Minister for External Affairs to vote for a discussion on the admission of Red China into the United Nations?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>During this debate, there seems to have been an idea that P.R. gives every man one vote and an equal vote.  In the course of her remarks, Senator Miss Davidson the other night quoted an extract from the <i>Daily Mail Yearbook</i> in support of her statement in which is stated &ldquo;To the now well established usage of &lsquo;one man, one vote&rsquo; is added the rider &lsquo;one vote, one value&rsquo;.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I should like to examine for a moment what actually happens under P.R. and to see whether or not that works out.  I wonder do all Senators realise that under P.R. as we have it here, no elector who votes for a man who is elected on the second or subsequent counts, ever gets his second or subsequent preferences counted.  The same applies to the runner up, if it happens to work out that there is a runner-up.  If a man is elected on the first count with a surplus the voter will have his second vote counted.  His vote will count only for a fraction in any event, but his paper may not be used beyond his second vote.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, some people vote for a freakish candidate and their papers may be used each time counting for a full vote even as far as the tenth or twelfth vote.  I myself have been at the counting of the votes in the old North Dublin days where we counted as far as 17.  Then again on the transfer of a surplus, the vote is only valued for a fraction.  As I have said, on an elimination, it is valued as a full vote.  Again at the transfer the papers that are counted are taken at random and a man voting for a candidate who is elected on the first count is not sure that his paper will travel on.  His may be one of those left in the bundle after it is counted for the second time to make up the quota for the man who has been elected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In other words, the more freakish the candidate a man picks to give his No. 1 vote to, the more votes that elector gets, whereas a man who may vote for a popular or a fairly popular candidate gets only his first vote and does not get his second or subsequent <Col N="591" /> vote into circulation.  In view of that, I wonder how anyone can say: &ldquo;One vote, one value; one man, one vote&rdquo;. The whole system is loaded so heavily against majorities that it is actually, to my mind, desperately unfair.</P>
    <P>I happen to have held that view for 40 years.  I happen to be one who was trained under some P.R. representatives in 1919 to act as an official counter in the first P.R. election here. Since I understood this system &mdash; and I learned it then &mdash; I have held those views.  It is not a question with me of this thing coming up now because the Taoiseach says it.  I am very glad to have the opportunity of recording my vote for this because these have been my personal views on it.</P>
    <P>I wonder do the people who talk about injustices to minorities understand what has been happening.  Do they understand that at least the straight system gives every elector an equal vote?  Whatever faults it may have, it has not got the fault whereby one man gets one vote and another may get ten or even more, if you have bigger constituencies.  I, for this reason, welcome the Bill.  There are other reasons which I shall deal with later, but I think that, in itself, is enough to condemn it as grossly unfair.</P>
    <P>I do not see why any minority should be allowed ten or 12 votes, while the man who may vote for the popular candidate has only one.  It is through those means that minorities get small representation.  If they are only very small minorities and by being able to get that sort of help as against the man who supports the majority Party, they are able to get a few people elected for a particular point of view. Even in relation to our own Parliament and as it appears in relation to other Parliaments, in a number of cases some of these people seem to forget their duty to the country altogether and simply set out to force the point of view of the section of the people they claim to represent.  Nothing else seems to matter because P.R. in every country, in the course of time, leads to a multiplicity of Parties.</P>
    <P>We have been asked by some of the people here where is the multiplicity of Parties.  Actually, as the Minister <Col N="592" /> for Defence said in the Dáil, we had 21 since 1948.  All were not able to get representation and the multiplicity of Parties beyond what we have has not developed.  That is due to Fianna Fáil, the largest Party, refusing to coalesce. We gave the people an opportunity of having an alternative.  If Fianna Fáil, despite all the urging to join even a national Government, had succumbed to that demand, I would say that by now we would have a multiplicity of Parties and we would definitely have arrived at a difficulty in forming a Government.</P>
    <P>In my view the primary function of an election is the formation of a Government. I hold that is far more important than giving equal representation to every small number of people who get together in the country and think they have a right to be in the Government.  It works out, when you get those coalitions of a number of Parties, that the smallest Party can hold up the Government.</P>
    <P>We have seen other States being left without a Government for as long as four months.  We have seen where they have actually arrived at dictatorships. Hitler came to office and power purely and simply through the failure of the Parties elected under P.R. in Germany to form a Government.  Do we want that sort of thing to develop here?  We have been lucky up to the present, because, as I have stated, Fianna Fáil have refused to coalesce and have been the largest Party.</P>
    <P>That position may not continue.  Nobody knows what the future will bring, but judging by the history of every other State that we know of in Europe, working through some system of P.R., we will definitely reach the stage of a multiplicity of Parties in a Coalition Government which will be subject to all the ills that have developed in those various States.  Can we afford it?  Can we afford to have a Government the members of which are pulling against one another internally and not able to give the leadership that is necessary to a developing State?  Particularly at the present time, when the Free Trade Area is threatening, are we going to be able to compete and develop in such circumstances?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="593" /> We have heard talk about this Bill not helping the widows and orphans and the unemployed.  What way have we of doing better for them unless we develop?  There is nobody in the Dáil or the Seanad who would not like to do better for those people, as far as our resources permit.  If we do develop, I say &mdash; I do not care what Government are in power &mdash; that one of the first things they would do would be to help, if they could do it.</P>
    <P>We have it thrown at us by Labour that they do not see how this will happen.  It certainly will happen because it will avoid the sort of friction and the ills which follow from coalition government.  It will at least give the country a chance of having stable government &mdash; not necessarily one with a huge majority.  I do not think that Fianna Fáil will get under this system anything like the figures that have been mentioned, when the next election comes along.  I doubt if it would do any better than it has done in the last election or even in some of the earlier elections.  It does not necessarily follow that it will be a huge overall majority at all.  One would not have to go very far in arithmetic at school to realise how wrong are some of the calculations made here.</P>
    <P>It has been stated that we are anti-democratic in trying to put this Bill through.  It is beyond my comprehension to see how one could be anti-democratic, when one is putting the matter to the people to decide by free vote.  My knowledge of democracy and my understanding of the meaning of the word makes nonsense of that argument. When the people are to have the last say in the matter, when it is being put to them to decide it finally by a free vote, I cannot see how it can be said that this is anti-democratic.</P>
    <P>I wonder why none of the Opposition, in any of the speeches I have heard, have faced up to the results which have happened in practically every country in Europe that has had P.R.  Even those which have been successful under it are considering changing it now.  Apparently, they have their own reasons.  Fianna Fáil as a Party has no reason whatever <Col N="594" /> to quarrel with P.R., as far as results go.  If we were thinking just on those lines, I do not see why we should alter it at all.  We have been the largest Party for a very long number of years.</P>

      <P>Even when things went blackest against us in 1948, we were still the largest Party.  We have had the reins of Government for much the biggest part of the period.  From that point of view, as a Party there is no reason at all why we should quarrel with P.R.  The reason I am opposed to it, and I believe it is the reason of everybody in the Party, is the results which have followed it in other countries.  I cannot see what would prevent that happening here, as Parties develop as they will certainly develop under P.R.</P>
      <P>I think it was Senator Stanford who expressed concern about what we were going to give to the young people coming along after us.  I, for one, should not like to leave a legacy to the young people coming after me as a result of which they would have to face some of the things people have had to face in Europe, that they have even now in Italy, and that they have had in four countries in the last few months.  I should not like to leave that sort of legacy to the young people, when we can take steps which will reasonably prevent it, judging by the experience in other countries.</P>
      <P>Nobody is attempting to stop anybody from going up for election. After all, it is not Fianna Fáil which prevents anybody from getting a vote; it is the people.  If a man can get the vote he will be elected, no matter what he stands for.  Every man has got an equal chance of getting a vote. No matter what his label is, he is going to get through if the people want him to do so.  I wonder why the Opposition do not face up to that?  So far, nobody on the other side has attempted to refute that argument.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Judging by the results in other countries, democracy has failed under P.R.  For that reason, the best system we can see is that of the old straight <Col N="595" /> vote, because the countries which use it have been able to change their Governments when the people thought it was necessary to do so.  They have been able to carry on a stable economy and they have avoided all those risks and losses which have occurred in other countries through lack of a proper Government.  Unfortunately, instead of hearing about a vital question like that, we have heard the same type of propaganda, and false propaganda at that, used against the Constitution, the Constitution which is now approved, accepted and joyfully hailed by everybody.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope we will not have a repetition of that.  I hope we have grown up in that respect.  We remember all the things said then. Some of the things said about this have been just as bad.  For instance, Senator Sheehy Skeffington said there is no guarantee of a very large majority under the straight vote system and that on a few occasions in England there were not large majorities; but then he went on, as reported in Volume 50, column 465 of the Seanad Debates:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;One of the major reasons for asking for the abolition of P.R. falls to the ground if you admit that.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Now, I do not for a minute admit it. I do not know of anybody in the Fianna Fáil Party who was present at the meetings to discuss it and who wants to put this through because of the big majority which will come to Fianna Fáil.  Fianna Fáil is quite confident in itself that it can hold its own under any system.  It has been almost too sickening to listen to the pessimism of some of those on the other side about their chances under this.  It is nothing like that that has put Fianna Fáil in its present position. That is due to its confidence in itself, because it has its programme and because it gets down to work on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fianna Fáil can always take its chance and take its beatings if necessary, <Col N="596" /> and will be able to do it in the future, with the new people coming on, owing to the way they are being trained.  Fianna Fáil are not doing this in order to get a large majority. It is done because we do not want to leave the legacy I spoke of to the people who will come after us.  There certainly will be changes of Government and we want to see, for the sake of the country, no matter what Government is in power, that there always will be an Opposition to take over if necessary so that the interests of the country will not suffer, so that if the people think one Government is going wrong they will have an alternative Government to which they can hand over control.</P>
    <P>We have been asked why the present time has been chosen to bring in a measure such as this.  The reason is that we have now an overall majority, that the time is normal, that it is the first time which could be called normal when we had an overall majority.  This measure would never be brought in by a Coalition Government. It is clear from the way the Parties which support a Coalition Government have spoken about this Bill, that it would not have a chance of a snowball in hell of getting a reading under a Coalition Government.  This is the first opportunity there has been.  We heard a lot about 1937 and we have been asked why it was not done then.  This is the first opportunity since 1937 that there has been to bring in a measure like this.  For my part, I am very glad that the Government have seized that opportunity.  I hope that the people will be wise enough to adopt this change in the Constitution.  I think they have grown up in wisdom, particularly after their experience of the Coalitions which were bad enough for this country but which, I will admit, were not as bad as what happened in other countries.  I hope that the people will realise what we are trying to save them from.</P>
    <P>The real reason for the Bill is the results that have developed under P.R. in other countries. We are trying to avoid having that happen here.  There is also the urgent necessity for development in view of the emergence of the European Free <Col N="597" /> Trade Area, and other competition. We want to build up this country in the way in which the patriots who gave their lives for it sought to see it built up.  Those are the reasons for this Bill and if anybody could show us how to avoid all the difficulties that occurred with P.R. in other countries I am sure we would be open to reason.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>In speaking as one of the Independent representatives in the Seanad, I am very conscious of the heavy burden that falls on us Independents, and of the many unfair charges to which we leave ourselves open in trying to perform our task. My first opposition to this measure comes from the fact that the people are not told what they are voting on because the Bill seeks to institute something as sacred as a change in our Constitution, without having the necessary commission to give a factual report on what is happening, to give us the proper setting of the history of Europe and not the pocket-book edition that ascribes every failing in Europe to P.R.</P>
      <P>What we want are facts and, up and down the country, I have met intelligent people who are crying out for facts.  They have not got them in this debate and I do not think that the Dáil or Seanad are the proper bodies to give the necessary, non-Party, impartial, scientific investigation of the issues at stake.  That has not been done.  It should be done here and, until it is done, we are asking the plain ordinary people of this country to vote on something of which, as is evident from the speeches which members of this House and the other House have made, they have but a very hazy recollection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Why did these various ills arise in Europe?  That is something that is above politics and that bears impartial investigation.  Let us know of the various Governments that have functioned in various European countries. Let us have the opinions of the scholars concerned on the reasons for the downfall of those countries.  All that is lacking at present and I hold it is grossly unfair to the people of this country to face them with a task, without giving them the necessary information.  I <Col N="598" /> can claim myself to be in a very happy position in that fortunately I am a young man, thank God.  I was not party to all the bitterness that has come into this country.  Our generation, thank God, has been spared that, but we are looking for something more in the future.  We regard this as our country, just as the elder statesmen, the elder members of the Dáil and Seanad, regarded this country in 1918 and 1921.  You elder members wanted a thing for yourselves.  You wanted to get facts and figures.  You did not want to be tied up with the Parnellite split and all the other animosities that had crept into our effort to get self government in the 30, 40, 50 years preceding 1916.  That is what we, the younger generation, are asking to-day.</P>
    <P>I have been privileged to know many of the branches, many of the officers of our splendid rural organisations.  I have been privileged to make some little contribution to their advancements, I hope, by travelling, very often at night, 40, 50, 60 miles &mdash; I did it twice in the past week &mdash; to give those people factual accounts, at least facts as they appeared to me as a scientist, and material put down in such a manner that any scientist can investigate and find any flaws in the arguments, if there are any.  That, after all, is the only approach to progress. It is the scientific approach.  It is the scientific method about which we hear so much to-day, and our future depends on that.  What have we got? We have got our excellent rural organisations completely disgusted with Party politics in this country.</P>

      <P>The issue, as I see it, is the question of the ills of this country being cured by altering our system of election, and the referendum based on that.  I am just developing the case that the people need information and that information can be supplied to them only by a proper commission.  When we have that done, then we can look forward with pleasure and with confidence to the judgment of the people as a whole. But remember, changing the Constitution, <Col N="599" /> as stated by Senator O'Brien, is one of the most delicate and one of the most sacred tasks any country can undertake, because, if we can change the Constitution without a commission, without impartial report, if we can change it merely by a simple majority of the population at any one time, it can be turned into an issue in Party politics.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We now have the Government advocating this.  Will it then give rise to other combinations in future advocating something different?  Therefore, I am afraid we are not giving the Constitution the protection we should give it and not treating it as the sacred instrument that it is.  When the Constitution was enacted in 1922, it was necessary to have a two-thirds majority to change it.  Now I see that provision, that very safe provision, has been altered to a simple majority.  I think that is very dangerous, especially at the present time, when an effort is made to treat this <Col N="600" /> issue as a case simply against coalition government.  It is brought in close to our two recent Coalition Governments, and is close up to the very difficult international situations they encountered.</P>
    <P>I for one hold and I applaud the sentiments expressed by Senator Murphy, as Leader of the Labour Party, when he paid tribute to the work done by all Parties, in all Governments, in their efforts to establish the independence of this country.  That is the spirit we need at present, and it is the only spirit that will ensure that our people can have confidence in the protection afforded them by our Constitution, and can develop the country in the way that our generation wishes.</P>
