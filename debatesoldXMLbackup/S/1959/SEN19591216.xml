      <P>The purpose of this draft Order, which has been laid on the Table of the House, is to guarantee further borrowing to the extent of £550,000 by St. Patrick's Copper Mines Ltd., Avoca.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In February, 1958, the Oireachtas approved an Order made under the State Guarantees Act, 1954, for the purpose of guaranteeing the borrowing of an amount of £1,300,000 approximately by St. Patrick's Copper Mines Ltd.  That sum was used by the company <Col N="1265" /> to bring the copper mines at Avoca into production and to repay a loan of £350,000 that had been guaranteed under the Trade Loans (Guarantee) Acts.</P>
    <P>This company has been in production since October, 1958.  After a period, difficulties were encountered in connection with the grade of the ore, since it transpired that the copper content was appreciably lower than had been anticipated.  The cause of the difficulties was, partly, that low grade material associated with the old workings formed a relatively high proportion of the mineralised rock being processed by the company.  As a result it took longer than anticipated to reach mineralised rock with a copper content as high as that hoped for.</P>
    <P>It was necessary for the company to consider methods of overcoming the difficulties associated with the low copper content of the ore and after careful study of the possible courses of action, the company decided to open up deposits at Tigroney on the east side of the Avoca river.  Exploratory work has been carried out at Tigroney and the company propose to mine 1,000 tons of ore per day from that area.  In addition, the company's operating methods on the west side of the Avoca river will be altered and mining will be carried out on a selective basis with every effort being made to secure the maximum tonnage of highly mineralised ore to the exclusion of low mineralised material.</P>
    <P>At the commencement of its activities, the company hoped that a substantial revenue would be derived from the sale of pyrites which is a by-product of the industry.  In fact sales of pyrites have been extremely limited, and the revenue which the company hoped would accrue, has not materialised.  At the present time there are a number of projects under consideration which would provide a market for Avoca pyrites but it is not possible at this stage to give any definite indication as to the prospects of such projects coming to fruition.</P>
    <P>With the object of overcoming these difficulties, the company placed before <Col N="1266" /> me a proposal which involves a State guarantee of a loan of £550,000.  The proceeds of the loan would be used, <i>inter alia,</i> to finance conventional mining at Tigroney and for selective mining on the west side of the Avoca river.  The company have expressed the opinion that assuming the price of copper does not fall below £232 per ton&mdash;the price ruling at the date of the application for a State guarantee of the additional loan&mdash;the carrying out of the new development work envisaged would enable the company in due time to discharge its liabilities in respect of State-guaranteed loans.</P>
    <P>While the company may be able to raise and process ore of the quality and quantity estimated, it is recognised that the success of the Avoca mines is closely associated with the price of copper.  When the original negotiations with St. Patrick's about commercial development of the Avoca ore deposits were proceeding, the price of copper was £430 per ton.  This high price was due to international stockpiling.  Since then, the price has fallen steadily and was at one time as low as £180 per ton.  The price during the past 12 months has varied from a low point of £209 to £267 and the present price is around £247 per ton. It is impossible to forecast the trend of future copper prices but the company's estimate is that the long-term price will be in the region of £240 per ton.</P>
    <P>The company which made the loan of £1.3 million to St. Patrick's in 1958 has agreed to lend the additional amount of £550,000 to St. Patrick's.  I understand that it is the intention that the new loan will be consolidated with the existing loan, the security for which is a first mortgage on the assets of St. Patrick's Copper Mines Ltd.</P>
    <P>The Government's decision to guarantee the additional loan has been taken only after very careful consideration of the present position of the company.  There is a reasonable prospect that the new development work which the company proposes to undertake will lead to production on an economic basis.  Great importance must be attached to the fact that nearly 500 men are employed by the <Col N="1267" /> company and a further 50 will be employed in connection with the new operations at Tigroney.  The industry is important to our export trade as its entire production is sold on foreign markets and represents an important item in our industrial exports.  There can, however, be no certainty that the project will be a success but in my view the chances of a successful outcome are sufficiently good to justify guaranteeing the additional loan.  It cannot be denied that there is an element of risk in so doing but I consider that it is a risk which should be taken.</P>
    <P>I recommend to the House that it should approve of the draft Order which is laid before it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>The statement by the Minister now shows up the nonsensical attitude taken by the Party then in Opposition to this proposal when it originally came before the Dáil.  If one wanted to make statements now similar to the speeches then made, one might say that not only are the Government giving away copper but paying people for taking it away as well.  One might make that sort of statement about it and speak at considerable length but I do not want to do so.  I want to ask the Minister a question.  I appreciate that the last guarantee was implemented in the sense that it was a guarantee.  Has any payment been made under the last guarantee?  Has any sum of money been paid to any person or corporation who made a loan to St. Patrick's copper mines?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I gathered from the way the Minister spoke that there was in fact a payment, but I could not be quite sure.  As far as I was concerned the phrase was not clear.  That is the only point I want to raise about it but I think it does show that to safeguard the employment of 500 people, we are spending a good deal of money.  If the price of copper did change, it would safeguard their employment through time and it might be worth while and that, of course, is the risk to which the Minister referred at the end of his statement. But if there has been no payment made <Col N="1268" /> up to the present under the existing guarantee for £1.3 million&mdash;this will increase it to approximately £2,000,000 &mdash;there is a contingent liability, and, assuming that the moneys were borrowed by St. Patrick's Copper Mines in Canada, a contingent external liability.  I should be grateful if the Minister would address himself to that point when he is replying.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OwenSkeffington" hpid="Dr. Sheehy Skeffington Dr. Sheehy Skeffington">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>From the beginning, I opposed the whole principle upon which this company was set up to exploit these mines, and upon which the mines were handed over on lease to a Canadian concern.  If it were not tragic, I think it would be funny to say that now we are being asked a second time to lend money to these people in order that they may at some further distant date be able to pay us back the money we lent them.  We are now being asked to lend another £550,000, making a total of over £1,000,000 and the security being given to us for this loan is the mines which we originally leased to the company.</P>
      <P>In fact, then, we lease our property to a company, we lend them the money to start working the property, and they say they cannot do it on the money we first gave them, and that they are afraid they cannot pay back that money unless we lend them more.  We say: &ldquo;That is all right; we shall lend you some more money, in order that you may be able to pay back the first loan.&rdquo;  When we have done that to the tune of over £500,000 the first time, they say to us: &ldquo;We still cannot pay you back, and we still have not been successful&rdquo;, even with all the Canadian know-how about which there was so much talk.  To that we say: &ldquo;On the security of what we first leased to you, we shall lend you another £550,000 or we shall guarantee a loan for such an amount.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not an expert in high finance; I am not a supporter of the private enterprise capitalist system of finance and administration; but I think in fairness to such a system that this type of proposition is not a representative example of the efficient way to operate it.  I felt at the beginning, and I feel now, that we should have had the courage to allow the people <Col N="1269" /> who did the dangerous, risk-bearing work of prospecting, Mianraí Teoranta, to do the development also, and to do it at a slow and steady rate which would suit the needs of this country, basing their development, not upon the necessity to satisfy world markets immediately but the determination to satisfy our home demand for copper; then to proceed slowly, as they have done in similar concerns in other small countries&mdash;in Finland, in relation to other metal ores&mdash;in order to our own needs, rather than rapidly to assuage the greeds of foreign investors. But we were told then: &ldquo;This is not the way to do it.&rdquo;  I remember one Senator telling us in effect: &ldquo;After all, we should be very pleased to get Canadians to come over here and risk Canadian money because, if we were to develop it ourselves it would be Irish money that would be lost if it went wrong.  We have persuaded these guileless Canadians to come here and risk their money and you are being very ungrateful about it.&rdquo;  How grateful should we look now, that we have leased the whole enterprise to foreign controllers, lent them the money to develop it, and now propose to lend them more money to pay us back?  I do not think it makes us look either intelligent or efficient, and I do not think it can any longer be held that it is mainly Canadian money which is being risked.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned that the copper content in the ore, in the aggregates, turned out to be lower than was anticipated originally.  I understand from his statement that this applies chiefly, as it were, to the primary workings.  I should like him to quote a percentage figure there. It is a very low percentage&mdash;it was one-point-something that was given to us first for the extraction of copper &mdash;and I should like to ask what is this lower copper extract figure now, in terms of a percentage?</P>
    <P>In my opinion the big original mistake here is indicated by the Minister's words when he says the &ldquo;entire production&rdquo; of these mines is sold &ldquo;in foreign markets.&rdquo;  I think that illustrates the entirely faulty emphasis we <Col N="1270" /> have placed on this from the beginning. The necessity to sell fast in world markets has, in fact, been a major factor in producing this type of crisis.  We have not been producing in relation to our needs in Ireland but in relation to a market price which fluctuates very considerably, which has at times dropped considerably lower than it is now, but which is nothing like what it was before.</P>
    <P>I admit that if we had developed these mines ourselves we would also be affected by world prices, but the pace of our development would have been geared to suit our own country and we should not now be so much at the mercy of world price fluctuations.</P>
    <P>Even if they are successful in extracting a higher rate, and in the long term I am not pessimistic about that, the results will be that foreign enterprise will squeeze the mines dry, sell the product as fast as it can abroad, and we shall be left with worked-out mines.</P>
    <P>When the Government had the opportunity of making a choice, between private development, with all that that usually implies of risk-taking, risk-bearing, initiative and so on, and public development, with the community bearing the brunt of possible loss but also publicly deriving the benefit of possible profits, it seems to me they decided they would have not quite one and not quite the other&mdash; they would not have an altogether private enterprise scheme nor an altogether public enterprise system&mdash; and the compromise they made was to say in effect: &ldquo;If this enterprise makes a profit, it must be kept very strictly in private hands, but if it turns out to be a dead loss the community will have the honour of footing the bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Both Governments, and it is both, because the other Government were responsible for insisting that the mines be developed on these terms, by their timidity have now put themselves in this ridiculous position in which they find that they are successfully getting the worst of both worlds.  So far, the <Col N="1271" /> mines have not made a profit, but, so far from any loss being borne by the private and foreign interests, the Government are asking us under this Order to assume the honour of underwriting the loss.</P>
    <P>I think it is evident that within the terms of free enterprise in the capitalist world this company has been unable to find the money privately, as an economic proposition, and I should like to hear the Minister's comment on that fact.  They have not been able to float a loan in Canada or in Ireland among private investors, except with a cast-iron State guarantee of a further £500,000.  That indicates in the terms of the private enterprise system that the scheme is not capable of being privately underwritten, is not regarded in investors' minds as a good, sound, economic proposition, and it is into such a proposition that the Minister is here today asking this House to be prepared to pour another £500,000 of taxpayers' money.</P>
    <P>Having decided then that we are to get the worst of both worlds&mdash;if there is a profit we must not get it, and if there is a loss we insist on recouping it &mdash;I should like to ask the Minister what happens in a year's time if the company comes back again and says: &ldquo;In order to pay you back, or pay the interest on what has already been lent to us, we should like you to lend us another £500,000&rdquo;?  Would the Minister give us some indication of what will be the limit?  Is the sky the limit?  Have both our Governments let themselves become so far involved and committed that we shall be bound to keep pouring money down the mine?  Is there any limit?</P>
    <P>Supposing for the sake of argument, even at the risk of losing a certain amount of political prestige, the Government are forced to the view that there is a limit, that this in fact is the limit, what happens to the company then?  Does it go bankrupt?  I should like the Minister to tell us what might happen if this loan were to be refused.  He has not told us what the alternative was, and I should like him <Col N="1272" /> to dwell on that in his reply.  What would have happened if he had said: &ldquo;No&rdquo;, or if this House and the other House said: &ldquo;No, we are sorry.  We are so short of money that we feel we cannot now legitimately underwrite this further loan?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I suggest that the company would have to go bankrupt; it would have to cut its losses and we should have to cut ours.  I would also suggest that then we would have the opportunity of doing what we should have done in the first place, by developing this whole enterprise at a slower pace, one that suits our country, and not necessarily the world merchants and financiers and the quick profiteers tempted by high prices of copper.  I personally feel now that this is the time for us to resume control and, if we are to underwrite losses, let us do it now for our own benefit, and resume these mines and their workings to be developed by the State.  Let us not say we cannot do that until after we have thrown away another £500,000.  Let us do it now.  For that reason, I propose to vote against the confirmation of this Order.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>For Senator O'Donovan's information, might I, first of all, put this whole matter in its proper perspective?  Senator Sheehy Skeffington attempted to do that, but he did it with a very strong prejudice against the mode of operation in existence at the moment in Avoca. Mianraí Teoranta expended up to £500,000 on exploration work in this area and, having established that there was copper ore of an economic content present there, the inter-Party Government decided that the time had come when the ore should be worked on a productive basis.  They decided, therefore, to lease the mines to a Canadian company, now called the St. Patrick's Copper Mines Limited.  The nonsensical attitude to which Senator Sheehy Skeffington referred was, I take it, that adopted by the present Taoiseach, who was then in Opposition.  He said that, having regard to the price of copper at the time, the mine was being given rather cheaply to the Canadian interests. He thought that the price of copper might hold, or remain very near its <Col N="1273" /> then price, for longer than it in fact did.  As I have said, the price fell very sharply.  It fell as low as £180 per ton from £430 per ton.  That was the main opposition to the transaction which the Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy Norton, and the Minister for Finance, Deputy Sweetman, carried out with the Canadian mining interests.</P>
      <P>Since then, as I have stated, the company found that as a result of meeting up with old workings the copper content of the mineralised rock that they were processing was not as high as had been anticipated. It transpired that in the old days, before miners were equipped with the techniques available now, they stopped at certain points at which they met with difficulty.  It was thought that these difficulties arose because of their lack of modern mining techniques. That may or may not be the case, but at any rate they left in their wake aggregates of material that proved to be lower in ore content than had been anticipated.  That was one of the difficulties with which St. Patrick's Copper Mines met.</P>
      <P>Their mill capacity was much higher than the amount of ore they were able to extract on the west side as a result of certain difficulties. Following an examination on the east side of the river they discovered that by an admixture of the higher grade ore found there with the ore they were already mining on the west side, they would get ore of a sufficiently high grade to merit economic production. I do not quite understand the Senator's question as to what payments have been made to people who have interested themselves financially in the project.  To date, interest payments have been made regularly, but no capital payments of any kind have been made.</P>

      <P>The company is meeting the interest payments.  As a result of the difficulties which were run into, the company found themselves short of money.  The other financial difficulty arose because of certain weaknesses prevailing in the Canadian Stock Markets.  I understand it is very difficult at the moment to raise money for any purpose in Canada.  That added to the company's difficulties.  It did not reflect any particular weakness in this particular project from the Canadian point of view.  Other undertakings in Canada which might have the appearance of greater success are experiencing similar difficulties in procuring capital.</P>
      <P>As far as the suggestion made by Senator Sheehy Skeffington goes, that we have given away everything and got nothing in return, the fact is that the investment in Ireland in terms of share capital made by the St. Patrick's Copper Mines Limited amounts to $5,000,000 plus $1,000,000 additional raised by way of loan in Canada, making in all some $6,000,000 investment. I take it that has been expended, or committed, to the extent that when they came to require more money, having regard to the difficulty of raising money for any purpose in Canada, they were forced to ask the Government here for a guarantee of this further half million loan which they were able to negotiate here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was asked in the Dáil, as I have been asked here to-day by Senator Sheehy Skeffington, about the copper content of the ore.  I was given figures as to the content on both the east and the west side in the course of negotiations. I regard the matter as a financial transaction and, from that point of view, I regard the information given to me as confidential.  As I said in the Dáil, I do not think I would be permitted to disclose what the content is. The Senator mentioned a figure of 1.1 per cent.  When I say that the content of the ore procured latterly on the east side of the Avoca river was slightly less than that, the Senator can draw his own conclusions.  It is hoped by the admixture of this ore procured <Col N="1275" /> on the east side to bring the copper up to an economic level.</P>
    <P>With regard to his question as to what would happen should this House refuse to approve this Order, or should the company 12 months hence find themselves requiring further loan assistance by way of guarantee under the Act, those are hypotheses upon which I do not want to make any statement. The fact remains that the company are satisfied that they can, with this assistance, work these mines and market the copper produced on an economic basis, a basis that will enable them to repay after a time the loans they have got.</P>
    <P>I think I should point out that this company is one of high international repute.  When the prospecting stage had been completed by Mianraí Teoranta it was found, I understand, by the previous Government that no other company was willing to undertake mining operations in Avoca.  As well as that, I believe that even if a company were to be found in this country, there would be some doubt as to whether they would be sufficiently equipped, from the point of view of technique and experience, to work these mines properly.  I understand that was one of the considerations which motivated the Minister for Industry and Commerce, in 1956 I think, to negotiate this agreement.</P>
    <P>The attitude taken in the Dáil by members on the Opposition side was referred to only slightly by Senator O'Donovan but if this is the brainchild of the Government of which he was a member, it has come home to roost on this Government, and we have to find the money and take the risk of giving the necessary guarantee.</P>

      <P>I should like to press the Minister to give us the copper extraction rate.  It seems odd that we should be asked to guarantee £500,000 but that we are not to be told the basic facts.  The Minister said that is a confidential matter but I should like the House to press him <Col N="1276" /> to quote the figure.  What was the original forecast and how much lower is the present figure?  There is another question I should like to ask the Minister.  He said that he was not prepared to go into the question of what will happen if we do not guarantee this loan.  I should like him to say what alternative is before us.  He suggested that we have no alternative. Is that really what he means?  If it is not, I think he should take the House into his confidence and say what the alternative is.</P>
      <P>I have a third question.  The Minister said that no other company could be got originally to work these mines. I should like to ask him was any other company or body of companies offered the same terms and advantages as were offered to this company?</P>

      <P>Perhaps I did not make my question clear to the Minister. It was not a trick question.  I am most anxious to ascertain the facts about the original guarantee in the case of £1.3 million.  Was the money spent in this country or was it spent in Canada?  Was it raised here or was it raised in Canada?  The Minister tells us £.5 millions will be raised and spent in this country.  This £.5 million is working capital.  Perhaps, if the Minister does not feel it is confidential&mdash;and, in any event, I do not think it can be&mdash;he will tell us was part of the £1.3 million working share capital spent in this country?  I hope that makes the question clear.</P>

      <P>By far the greater proportion of that money was spent in this country.  There were, of course, as the Senator will appreciate, certain capital items of equipment which had to be purchased abroad but they did not involve a very high figure.  At this stage, I cannot give a breakdown of the figures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Sheehy Skeffington repeated the question about the copper content. I told him that I was unable to give that in the Dáil and I still feel that I cannot give it here today because the copper content of the ore is a matter which might affect the financial structure and the disposal and resale, <Col N="1277" /> etc., of the shares of the company. Neither am I prepared to base any statement on the hypothetical questions he has put except to say that a number of courses of action will have to be looked into.  Assuming the money was not given, I understand it may be the case that the existing mortgage would have to be realised to get whatever value there is in it.  It may be that we would seek some other organisation to undertake the mining operations from this point onwards, and it may be, too, that Mianraí Teoranta might undertake the mining operations on behalf of the State.  I should like to suggest if the Senator considers that is the best solution&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1278" /> Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Minister for Finance (Dr. Ryan) James Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to increase the salary of the Comptroller and Auditor General from its present level of £2,400 a year to a figure of £2,850 a year, with effect from 1st January, 1959.  As the House will recall the office of Comptroller and Auditor General exists pursuant to the Constitution, article 33.1 of which reads:</P>
      <P>There shall be a Comptroller and Auditor General to control on behalf of the State all disbursements and to audit all accounts of moneys administered by or under the authority of the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>In common with judges, the Comptroller and Auditor General's salary is determined by statute.  His salary has, in the past, been increased on each occasion on which judicial salaries have been increased.  It was fixed at its present level by the Comptroller and Auditor General (Amendment) Act, 1953. When first fixed by statute in 1923, the salary of the Comptroller and Auditor General was slightly in excess of that paid to the head of a Department of State&mdash;to the extent of £37 per annum, in fact.  The relationship varied from time to time over the years but, when the salary was re-determined by the Act of 1953, virtual equality was restored.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a result of the Civil Service pay adjustments which have taken place since 1953, the salary of the Comptroller and Auditor General is now some £250 a year below that of a head of a Department.  A slight differentiation in favour of the Comptroller and Auditor General was regarded as acceptable at the time the post was created.  The present salary of a head of a Department is £2,647 a year. Bearing in mind the increased responsibility falling on the Comptroller and Auditor General in connection with commercial audits for State-sponsored bodies, it is considered that a salary <Col N="1279" /> of £2,850 a year would now be appropriate. This would represent an increase of 90 per cent. on the salary enjoyed by the Comptroller and Auditor General in 1939.  The comparable percentage increase for the head of a Department is 87 per cent.</P>
    <P>It is proposed that the increase should take effect from 1st January, 1959, which is the date from which it has been agreed to increase the salaries of judges.  I commend this Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>The office of the Comptroller and Auditor General, as the Minister said, is a constitutional function, and his salary falls to be fixed by statute.  It is interesting that when the original salary was fixed for the Comptroller and Auditor General, roughly speaking, there was very little difference between his salary and that of a head of a Department.  It was lower than the salary of a Minister but he has now passed out Ministers by about £700.  That is the interesting thing about this Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will introduce a more important Bill in a moment&mdash;the Finance Bill.  Under Section 10 of that Bill, as I understand it, he will take back a good proportion of this increase in respect of the current year, contrary to income tax practice up to the present.  This cannot be construed as a promotion in the ordinary course of events or the ordinary application of an incremental scale.  Nor is it overtime paid in the ordinary way.  It is an increase of salary which has been put through by statute.  According to Section 10 of the Finance Bill which will come before us immediately, the Comptroller and Auditor General will have to pay income tax on it in the current year, contrary to the ordinary course up to the present.  I think that is a most reprehensible thing.  We can discuss the matter on Section 10 of the Finance Bill, which applies also to the increases which were given recently to the judges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OwenSkeffington" hpid="Dr. Sheehy Skeffington Dr. Sheehy Skeffington">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>One does not like to be invidious in relation to <Col N="1280" /> one person but this Bill forces us to consider just one person.  I am shocked by the terms of the Bill.  We are asked to increase the salary of an official who has £2,400 a year by something very close to 19 per cent.  I am surprised that the Minister for Finance did not in some way justify the difference of treatment here while mentioning the parallel he established between this increase and the increase in judicial salaries down to the lowest grade.  In relation to these last we were asked to believe by the Government that a ten per cent. increase was all that could possibly be given to compensate for a 15 per cent. increase in the cost of living.  The Minister now establishes a parallel with these judicial salaries.  Yet he has asked for an increase of 19 per cent. in the case of this particular salary without showing us in what way the circumstances of the Comptroller and Auditor General are different from those of a district justice, or any other judge for that matter.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Donovan pointed out that we will be considering another Bill presently asking for a six per cent. increase in the salaries of pensioners who are now getting less than £100 a year.  Six per cent. is considered enough for them, but 19 per cent. is to be added to the salary of somebody already getting £2,400 a year, and who is now going to shoot up to £2,850 by the terms of this Bill.  It is going to be back-dated also to January 1st.  I do not think the Minister has been sufficiently explicit in showing us why, when 10 per cent., six per cent. or four per cent. is considered sufficient in relation to other salaries or pensions&mdash;this salary, too, as he mentioned, was adjusted in 1953 as were the salaries of the judiciary&mdash; why, I ask, it has become necessary in this particular case to increase it by 19 per cent. in all, instead of the ten per cent. which the Government asks us to believe was a fair, just and an absolutely maximum figure in relation to the salaries with which the Minister has just asked us to compare this?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister for Finance why he does <Col N="1281" /> not employ commercial auditors to audit the accounts of many of our State sponsored companies.  Commercial firms must have invaluable experience to give to State sponsored bodies.  I know that the accounts of many of our larger State sponsored companies are audited by the servants in the Comptroller and Auditor General's office.</P>
      <P>It is the duty of the Minister to satisfy this and the other House that this is a good system.  In public life in our town we have a municipal gas works.  We were advised several years ago that instead of being satisfied with the audit given to us by the Department of Local Government it would be far better for us if we used the wide experience in commercial affairs of a first class reputable firm of commercial accountants.  We are probably not using the brains of experienced men who are engaged in auditing in highly competitive outside business. Their invaluable experience is not being used.  Instead we are using the Comptroller and Auditor General.</P>
      <P>I should like if the Minister would tell us why this is so.  Perhaps he would look into the matter and see if there is a point in what I am saying? I thought this was a matter that should be brought to the attention of the Minister for Finance.</P>

      <P>To make a proper comparison in relation to the salaries of judges and so on would take a long time, indeed.  Senator Sheehy Skeffington mentioned district justices.  I find that since 1939 the salaries of the district justices have been increased by 92.5 per cent.  This increase will put the Comptroller and Auditor General up by 19 per cent.  Actually, he has not done so well.  There have been so many changes, some in favour of the one and some in favour of the other, that when you go back over the whole <Col N="1282" /> time, they work out more or less on a par, taking them as whole.</P>
      <P>I mentioned that, when the Comptroller and Auditor General was appointed first, it was considered that he should get a little more than the head of a Department but, for some few years past, he has been getting considerably less than the head of a Department.  I thought it only fair that we should give him more than the head of a Department to make up for it.  We may find that in three or four years' time some adjustment may be necessary either in the case of the head of a Department or the Comptroller and Auditor General.</P>
      <P>In regard to Senator O'Donovan's point, I think it would be better to discuss that on the next Stage when it may be possible to enlighten him on the point he made.  It is a point which I do not at all agree puts the facts in their true light.</P>
      <P>I think it is true to say that the responsibility and the work of the Comptroller and Auditor General have increased very, very much indeed.  To some extent it may be due to the fact that he has taken on a large number of businesses outside the civil service for audit purposes.  There are various reasons for that.  I think it would not be appropriate to go into it at this stage.  It would be quite in order to do it when the Appropriation Bill comes before the Seanad because there will be an Estimate there appertaining to the Comptroller and Auditor General.  We can discuss it on that occasion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Minister for Finance (Dr. Ryan) James Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill provides for the implementation of the scheme for P.A.Y.E. which was described in the White Paper circulated to Senators last month.  The scheme is based on the recommendations in the First Report of the Commission on Income Taxation.  It has the support both of employers' and employees' organisations.  Its purpose is to spread the incidence of income tax more evenly over the year and make easier the discharge of liability.</P>
      <P>The Bill does not deal with the scheme in the detail appearing in the White Paper because much of the detail will be covered by regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill is divided into three parts, the third of which, comprising Sections 15 to 18, is of interest to all taxpayers, whether or not they will be affected by the introduction of P.A.Y.E.  This part contains proposals for certain general alterations and adjustments in personal reliefs and allowances.  These changes are designed to facilitate the administration of P.A.Y.E., but they <Col N="1284" /> will apply to all individual taxpayers. This part of the Bill comes into operation on the 6th April, 1960.</P>
    <P>Part II, consisting of Sections 3 to 14 contains the provisions directly related to the proposed scheme of P.A.Y.E. and its operation.  Part I deals with the Short Title and construction of the Bill and the coming into operation of Part III.</P>
    <P>Under Sections 3 and 4 of the Bill the scheme of P.A.Y.E. will in general apply to employed persons who are liable to income tax including directors and pensioners.</P>
    <P>It is not, however, applied to three classes.  The first of these classes is State employees and employees of four other bodies who already have schemes for deduction of tax from their emoluments and have their own Departmental assessors.</P>
    <P>It is obviously not necessary that the new scheme should apply to this class as the existing schemes have operated to the satisfaction of all concerned. However, as stated in the Dáil, I am prepared, if the great majority of persons in any of the excepted bodies wishes to enter the new scheme, to give the matter most careful consideration. If it appears in all the circumstances that such persons should be included, I will introduce legislation in the next Finance Bill to bring them in as from the 6th April, 1961.  Furthermore, if any such persons are admitted to P.A.Y.E., a tax remission will be made available to them in the last year of employment, analogous to that provided in Section 14 for persons brought under P.A.Y.E. by the present Bill.</P>
    <P>The reason why a half year's tax is remitted for persons now being brought within P.A.Y.E. is that if the scheme were to start in April, 1960, instead of in October, 1960, they would be paying the equivalent of twelve months' tax in the first six months of 1960-61.  The tax remission merely secures that, in that period, they will pay only six months' tax.</P>
    <P>If persons assessed departmentally were to come under P.A.Y.E. and were to be granted a remission of a half year's tax for 1960-61, it would <Col N="1285" /> mean that they would pay no tax at all from the 6th April, 1960, to the 5th October, 1960.  In other words, they would secure a six months' tax holiday.  I should like to emphasise at this stage, to remove any misconception, that other workers are not being allowed a six months' holiday from tax.  They will pay twelve months' tax in 1960-61 and in each succeeding year.  Manifestly, persons assessed departmentally cannot be accorded better conditions than other workers.</P>
    <P>There is, therefore, no substance in the suggestion that persons assessed departmentally are being offered less favourable treatment than persons brought into P.A.Y.E. by this Bill. On the contrary, if persons assessed departmentally were to be brought in as from 6th October, 1960, and given a half-year's tax remission for 1960-61, they would be put in a much more favourable position than persons brought in by this Bill as it stands. They would get a six months' tax holiday in 1960-61.  That is to say, they would only pay six months' Income Tax in 1960-61.  On the other hand persons brought in by the Bill &mdash;even with the tax remission provided by Section 14&mdash;will still have to pay in 1960-61 the equivalent of twelve months' tax.  On the 1st July, 1960, they will be billed for the second instalment of tax for the year 1959/60 under the existing basis. Then, as from the 6th October, 1960, tax will be deducted under P.A.Y.E. for the second half of the year 1960-61. They will thus, in that year, bear twelve months' tax in all.</P>
    <P>Any benefit from the remission being granted by the Bill to persons coming under P.A.Y.E. will not be felt immediately but will be discernible when the person has ceased to hold his employment.  If any body of persons outside the scope of the Bill as it stands wish to avail themselves of my offer and to come in, they will get terms which will put them in the same position as other employees who are now included in the Bill, by giving them appropriate relief in the last year of employment.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1286" /> The second class excepted from P.A.Y.E. by Section 4 of the Bill comprises cases to which it would not be practicable to extend the scheme.  The third exception is where a person is in receipt of earnings chargeable under Schedule D and at the same time has emoluments falling under Schedule E and where, for his convenience, the whole of his earned income is dealt with in a single assessment under Schedule D.  This is the usual method of dealing with a professional man who engages in private practice and also holds an appointment related to his profession.</P>
    <P>Section 5 embodies the kernel of the new scheme.  It provides that, as from the year 1960-61 onwards, Income Tax on emoluments within the scope of P.A.Y.E. is to be computed by reference to the actual earnings of the year of assessment&mdash;and not by reference chiefly to earnings of the year preceding the year of assessment, as hitherto.  It also provides for the making of the appropriate tax deductions and repayments by employers.</P>
    <P>Section 6 empowers the Revenue Commissioners to make the necessary regulations as to the assessment, charge, collection and recovery of Income Tax under P.A.Y.E.  The regulations will provide for collection of tax on a cumulative basis, that is the tax will vary week by week&mdash;or month by month if the employee is paid monthly &mdash;with any fluctuations in earnings. When earnings increase, the deductions for tax increase accordingly.  When earnings fall, the tax likewise falls; and the employee, instead of paying tax, becomes entitled to a repayment if earnings fall below a certain amount.</P>
    <P>Section 7 contains penalties for neglect in complying with the regulations. It imposes a penalty of £20, together with a continuing penalty of the same amount for every day on which the non-compliance is continued.</P>
    <P>Section 8 authorises the charging of interest where an employer does not pay over the tax to the Revenue in due time.</P>
    <P>The employer with a small number of employees earning a fixed remuneration <Col N="1287" /> and in constant employment is catered for in Section 9.  Under a simplified procedure he will be enabled to pay over to the Revenue, by means of stamps to be affixed by him to a stamp book, the tax he has deducted.</P>
    <P>The need for Section 10 arises out of the contemplated change over, for 1960-61 and succeeding years, from the previous year's basis of assessment to the basis of the current year.  The change will mean that earnings for the year 1959-60 will not constitute a basis of assessment.  In order to prevent an improper advantage being taken of this fact, Section 10 secures that, where the emoluments for 1959-60 exceed those for 1958-59, the excess is to be added to the 1959-60 assessment, except where the excess is due to such factors as promotion in the ordinary course of events, increments and overtime.</P>
    <P>Under Section 11 the provisions of the Income Tax Acts as to the recovery of Schedule E tax are to apply, with appropriate modifications, to the recovery of any amount of tax which an employer will be liable under P.A.Y.E. to pay to the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    <P>Section 12 makes deductions under P.A.Y.E. rank as preferential payments in cases of bankruptcy or insolvency.</P>
    <P>Section 13 incorporates various supplemental provisions, such as abolition of the requirement for raising formal assessments under Schedule E save in a small proportion of cases.</P>
    <P>As I have already mentioned, Section 14 is intended to ensure that a person will not, by reason of his being brought within the provisions of the P.A.Y.E. scheme, pay more than approximately a year's tax in the year 1960/61 in respect of remuneration. This is done by remitting half the tax on earnings in 1960/61 in appropriate cases.  If this were not done, in addition to paying half the tax for 1959/60 in July, 1960, a taxpayer would pay the whole of the 1960/61 tax as well&mdash; or tax for a year and a half in all.</P>
    <P>Section 15 marks the beginning of Part III which, as I have said, is of <Col N="1288" /> interest to all taxpayers.  It effects general amendments in the personal allowances so as to facilitate the operation of P.A.Y.E.  This section raises the existing unmarried personal allowance from £150 to £234, the married personal allowance from £310 to £394 and the allowance for widows or widowers from £175 to £259.  These increases are in compensation for the termination of the reduced rates of tax, which at present are 2s. 9d. in the £ on the first £100 of taxable income and 5s. 6d. in the £ on the next £100.  The termination of these reduced rates is provided for in Section 18.</P>
    <P>Sections 16 and 17 make certain alterations in the interests of simplification for P.A.Y.E. purposes.  Under Section 16 the rate of earned income relief is altered from one-fourth on earnings up to £800, plus one-fifth on earnings from £800 to £1,800, to a uniform rate of one-fourth on earnings up to £1,800.  Under Section 17 the life insurance relief is amended by making it allowable as a deduction from income, rather than from tax.</P>
    <P>The broad effect of the amendments in this part of the Bill will be that some 57,000 persons who now have to pay £11 11s. a year or less will be relieved entirely from income tax.  All other individual taxpayers, about 150,000 in number, will gain some relief.  The gross cost of the reliefs is over £1 million a year but this will be largely offset by the increased inflow of revenue resulting from P.A.Y.E.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I would like to say how much I appreciate the goodwill which employers and employees have shown towards the scheme.  Its successful operation will, of course, depend on a continuance of the co-operation which has already been forthcoming from them.</P>

      <P>This Bill implements the recommendation by the Commission on Taxation and in view of the sad fate that has befallen many recommendations by commissions, the Minister is to be congratulated on implementing this recommendation. Apart from the recommendation of the <Col N="1289" /> Commission being a basis for these provisions, there is also the well-known fact that the existing system has over the years become increasingly irksome to many salary and wage-earners.  This is surely the case if we take the extreme example of the agricultural labourer who has to pay tax when the farmer who employs him, and perhaps three or four other labourers, do not have to pay it at all.</P>
      <P>The people who welcome this change are wise to do so for two reasons: first of all, it will make it easier to discharge the liability because it will be spread evenly over the year.  A Deputy in the Dáil said he could not see much difference between having the whip applied to you all the time and having it applied twice a year.  However, on the whole, I think salaried people would prefer to have the liability deducted evenly and, having been under both systems, I can vouch for the fact that it is much easier, the reason being that people will not spend what they do not get.  It is all right to suggest that you should devote your income to different purposes <i>pro rata</i> but that just does not happen to the ordinary person.</P>
      <P>There may be a slight difference in the operation of the system but in essence it is the system which has been applied in the Civil Service and large corporations for a considerable time; everybody would agree that the collection of that tax does not give rise to nearly as much trouble as the collection of tax from people who have received the money a year or a year and a half before, particularly where their incomes are reduced. As was pointed out in the Dáil by at least a couple of speakers the welcome now being extended to this system may not be quite so apparent by the middle of the year 1961.  There is no doubt that there will be initial difficulties in it but time should iron them out and perhaps in four or five years' time the system will be running smoothly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Most people would agree that it is a great pity that the Minister for Finance of the day and the Revenue <Col N="1290" /> Commissioners of the day did not adopt the system, or something like it, which was first adopted in Britain about 17 or 18 years ago.  If there should be a further increase in the cost of living, as certain gentlemen on the London Stock Exchange seem to think so forcibly, you might find complaints about this taxation by the spring of 1961 or, more likely, by the summer of 1961.  If the cost of living goes up substantially and the amount which is being received from week to week in wages is reduced, difficulties may arise.  Despite that, most people would agree that, from the human point of view, it will be a better system.</P>
    <P>Certain questions arise in this connection. I do not understand although the matter was debated in the Dáil, why the cost should go up.  I take it that matter has been carefully considered and I notice the Minister in his reply in the Dáil did say that very little of the time of the inspectors of taxes was given to Schedule E tax.  That answer has the doubtful merit of appearing slick though I do not suggest it was intended to be slick.  The inspectors of taxes are a very small part of the staff engaged in the collection of income tax and anybody would appreciate that a very small part indeed of the time of the higher grade and senior inspectors is given to the collection of Schedule E tax which is the simplest part of the system, complex though that part is.  Therefore, I cannot understand why, if you take 57,000 people out of assessment and if some part of the work is to be done by employers, the cost should go up. I can appreciate the fact, set out in the explanatory memorandum, that in the early stages the introduction of the system will cost a good deal of money. We have all seen that in connection with large-scale administrative operations.</P>
    <P>There is one other point I should like to make, a point which is running through certain sections of the Bill. Section 5 is, in fact, an increase in taxation in the normal way, that is to say, where people's incomes in an age of inflation increase <i>pro rata</i> or in some relationship with the inflation. <Col N="1291" /> Section 5 says that, in the year 1960-61 or any subsequent year, the emoluments shall be computed on the amount of those emoluments for the year.  Therefore, there is there an increase in taxation.  Let us not forget that this increase will apply to a class in the community who have been the hardest pressed, both by inflation of the currency and taxation of income.  I appreciate why this section was put in.  It was put in for administrative reasons.  At the same time, I do not see why the effective rate of taxation should be increased to enable the system to be administered.</P>
    <P>Section 10, as I read it, impacts on a person like the Comptroller and Auditor General who gets an increase now, whatever the amount may be. Unless the Revenue Commissioners interpret that increase under a specific Act of the Oireachtas as being a similar excess of an ordinary character in relation to the year 1959-60, he will have to pay tax this year on the extra money he will receive under the Act we have just passed.  The same applies to the legislation for the judges.  Subsection (2) of Section 10&mdash;where I notice the administrative class is well covered&mdash; states that subsection (1) shall not apply to any excess arising from: a promotion in the ordinary course of events, that is to say, an assistant county manager who becomes a county manager&mdash;the ordinary application of an incremental scale of emoluments; overtime paid for at ordinary rates&mdash; which applies to the wage earner&mdash;or to any other similar excess of an ordinary character.  Are we to take it that the meaning of that section, as it is in the Bill, is that people who have to wait a great deal longer for an increase related to the cost of living than other people will be penalised again in relation to the manner in which tax will be assessed on them in respect of the current year's income?  If that is so, if my interpretation is correct, then it is a fantastic and inequitable change in the present system of taxation.  Where a man gets promotion, a new job with, presumably, a much higher salary, it is not to apply at all; but where a man <Col N="1292" /> now gets a belated increase in his salary to cover a number of years' increase in the cost of living, my interpretation is that it is to apply.</P>
    <P>Of course, the Minister will tell us the kind of case this is intended to cover, the case where some large combination would pay a large sum to one of their employees just before the new system came into existence. I am not concerned with that kind of case.  We all know it would be possible, unless some section like Section 10 were put in, that that kind of thing could be done.  However, I do not think we can take a better example than the case of the Comptroller and Auditor General, which we have just had.  It is not a promotion in this case; it is not the ordinary application of an incremental scale of emoluments; and it is not overtime paid for at ordinary rates.  It was not intended, I take it, to apply to that kind of a case, and it is desirable that the Minister should make that quite clear to us.  I believe that in the new circumstances, with a large number of people taken out of the system, this section could apply to a substantial number in the community.  It does not apply to the Comptroller and Auditor General and the judges and justices alone, though perhaps they are a suitable class to take, in view of the fact that their salaries are borne on the Central Fund.</P>
    <P>Section 14, implementing as it does paragraphs 26 to 28 of the White Paper on Income Tax, represents constructive thought in relation to an extremely difficult matter.  It seems to me to be about as reasoned and as effective an approach in a theoretical way to this solution of an extremely difficult practical problem in taxation as one could expect.  If we might look historically at the famous case when people struck to get back their 11 days, I take it this is one half year which nobody will strike to get back?</P>
    <P>The drafting approach to the Bill is to be commended also as it lays down the principles and leaves the administrative details to the regulations.  I take it that in any new system the <Col N="1293" /> Minister and the Revenue Commissioners will be as anxious to get as much goodwill as possible for the Bill?  In the Dáil a Deputy referred to the mechanical ingenuity which the Bill showed in simplifying the British system.  It is only fair to the people who were engaged on the preparation of the Bill to say there is a good deal more than mechanical ingenuity shown.  The thought that went into it may come out at the other end as a mechanical ingenuity, but there is a good deal more in it than that.</P>
    <P>In addition to the main point I make about Section 10, there is also a point in relation to Section 15 and personal allowances.  A certain trend was evident in relation to income tax, where the married allowance was increased gradually through the years, whereas the allowance for unmarried persons was not increased.  It seems to me that that trend is being reversed in Section 15.  Again, I think I can understand the reason for it.  When you add it all up, in fact, unmarried persons are getting a bigger proportionate increase in their allowances than are married people.  Again, I think that was done for administrative convenience also.  I take it it was done primarily to get the agricultural labourers out of the income tax paying class and, of course, to that extent, it is to be commended.</P>
    <P>The principle has been accepted that there is some ratio between the allowance for a married person and an unmarried person.  Before the war, the allowance for an unmarried person, if you took the basic figure, was £125. In the case of a married person it was £225.  The differential widened during the years, a small effort being made by the last Government of £10 but, at least, it showed a commendable approach in the case to ease the burden where it weighed hardest.  I should like, perhaps, if the Minister would say something about that section in his reply.  I should be grateful if he would advert to the considerations which led to what appears to be a reversal of the trend adopted since the war but if it be the case that, in fact, the differential is narrowed as compared with what it was before the war, I do not <Col N="1294" /> know that one could defend it in present circumstances.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think we should exaggerate the importance of this Bill, which really effects only minor administrative changes in the collection of income tax under Schedule E.  The changes are, no doubt, good as far as they go.  They bring the system here in line with that in Great Britain and Northern Ireland. I think it is well to stress that this Bill does nothing whatsoever to remedy the fundamental injustices of income tax in this country, that the problems which will eventually engage the attention of the Commission on Income Taxation still remain to be solved and that all that has been done at present has been to make certain suggestions with regard to Schedule E and Schedule A and other minor points.  In other words, I think what is happening is that an old coat is being patched when what the country wants is a new coat.  If enough is spent on patching an old garment, it becomes more difficult to persuade people to purchase a new one.</P>
      <P>I am perfectly aware of the difficulties of the Income Tax Commission. I am not for a moment pretending that the difficulties are not very great.  But I do want to suggest that this Bill really makes only a very minor administrative change which does nothing whatsoever to meet the case put forward in the Seanad and elsewhere by people who consider that the system of direct taxation in this country is quite unsuitable to the circumstances of the country and is a source of a great deal of hardship and a great deal of injustice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The increase in the personal allowances for unmarried and married people, widows and widowers is, of course, to be welcomed, and also the simplification of the earned income relief.  Anything which simplifies the income tax code is welcome.  But, of course, the amount collected will very largely be compensated by the abolition of the reduced rates of tax. It is estimated by the Minister that, when full allowance is made for that, a number of people who now <Col N="1295" /> pay tax will pay less and a good many will pay none at all.  But, as we are also told that the general yield will be greater after the operation of this Bill than before, the only conclusion we can draw is that another considerable number of people will pay more as a result of this change than if the change had not taken place.</P>
    <P>There is one point that has not been made in the debate in the Dáil; that is, that the personal allowances will benefit taxpayers under every Schedule, not only Schedule E, whereas the main provision of this Bill which, presumably, from what the Minister has said, will bring additional revenue, will affect only Schedule E.</P>
    <P>I make no secret of the fact that I am speaking on behalf of the Schedule E taxpayers, mainly because most of the people who send me to the Seanad are graduates of the University with salaries&mdash;people of that kind&mdash;and I consider it my duty to represent them. I am quite certain that the people who pay under Schedule E are the people who are most hardly hit in the income tax code.  Everybody knows that a small section of the population pays a quite disproportionate amount of the tax and that large numbers of people in the country&mdash;farmers, business people and professional people&mdash; escape a good deal of the tax which they should pay if the method of collection were more suitable for the circumstances of this country.  So that, as far as I can make out, the main effect of this Bill will be that the Schedule E taxpayers will be more efficiently fleeced than they have been up to this, that more will be extracted from their pockets.  That, we are told, is one of the objects of the Bill.</P>
    <P>As against that, what benefit does the Schedule E taxpayer derive?  The great argument put forward in the Dáil and here is the hardship found by the half-yearly payment, that people find it so difficult to accumulate the sum necessary for the half-yearly payment. Personally, I think that argument is exaggerated.  People have to accumulate sums for other nonrecurring payments.  They have to pay <Col N="1296" /> their telephone bills.  They have to pay their E.S.B. accounts, their rent, instalments on hire purchase.  All sorts of payments have to be met at irregular intervals and yet people manage to accumulate them.  I frankly think that this argument about the extreme hardship of having to accumulate sums to pay income tax twice a year has been rather exaggerated. However, I am prepared to admit that the new method may be a convenience to certain people, in fact, to a great many people, but I think it only fair to state that the price they pay for that convenience is that as a class they pay more and not less.</P>
    <P>The reason I think they will pay more is that evasion will become more difficult.  When tax is deducted each week, evasion becomes impossible. Another reason is that the tax is collected immediately after a person's income begins and that, immediately after it rises, it is collected at the higher rate.</P>
    <P>Furthermore&mdash;a point on which great emphasis was laid in the Dáil&mdash;this Bill provides for a very harsh and drastic collection of arrears.  If the Bill is implemented harshly, according to the text as far as I can read it, all outstanding arrears extending over many years could be collected in the first half-year of the operation of this Bill when it comes into law, with the result that numerous Schedule E taxpayers would receive no income at all for six months while the arrears are being collected and, indeed, for a great deal longer.  So that, therefore, the benefits which this Bill confers on the Schedule E taxpayer tend to be greatly exaggerated.  I admit that there could be a slight convenience in having the tax deducted weekly or monthly but, at the same time, unless I am wrong, in the long run the taxpayers will pay more and, therefore, it is not a matter of great congratulation for the Schedule E taxpayers.</P>
    <P>The Bill, of course, is unquestionably burdensome on employers.  There is no getting away from that.  Employers now become unpaid tax collectors. Very large employers who are able to afford computers, like some of the large British firms, will not find it so difficult; <Col N="1297" /> the very small employer will be able to avail himself of the method in the Bill of payment by stamps; but, as was stated in the Dáil, there are a number of medium-sized employers in this country who will find the operation of this Bill very burdensome.  In spite of the simple mechanism provided, it will involve them in disputes with their staff from time to time, which must be very unpleasant.  It will undoubtedly involve a great deal of additional clerical work.  The small employer is entitled to be remunerated for that extra work.  To the extent to which he is doing the work of the tax collector, he should be paid.  Therefore, I suggest that employers should be allowed to deduct a small percentage of the amount they collect to remunerate them for the onerous services they have to undertake.</P>
    <P>On the other side, when the employers fall into arrears under this Bill, they will have to pay interest on the amount withheld at the rate of 12 per cent. per annum.  Were it not for the fact that the Minister stated in the Dáil that this was meant to be a penalty, I should have found it hard to believe, because under the ordinary laws relating to usury in this country, anything like 12 per cent. is looked upon as a usurious rate of interest.  However, we have been assured that this is meant as a penalty, a penal rate.  I suggest that if an employer has to pay a very heavy interest on what he has not paid to the Revenue Commissioners, he is entitled to some relief to remunerate him for the trouble and expense which is involved in the collection of what he does pay.</P>
    <P>Some calculations should be made with regard to the saving to the Revenue Commissioners and that, in some way or other, should be transmitted to the employers who are now taking their place.  It is being assumed that there will be a great saving as a result of this new system.  I hope that will be so in the long run, but so far as I can understand it in the short run, at the moment, the staffs of the Revenue Commissioners have been greatly augmented in recent <Col N="1298" /> months.  They are working overtime. The result of this Bill is that the staffs of the Revenue Commissioners are working harder than they ever worked before.  However, we hope that, as arrears are collected, and as the machinery comes into operation, there will be savings.  I suggest, if there are such savings, that the employers who will be doing some of the work previously done by the Revenue Commissioners should receive some compensation.</P>
    <P>Therefore, it seems to me that this Bill may confer certain benefits on the Revenue authorities.  It makes evasion more difficult; it provides for an extremely efficient method of collection of arrears; but it will not confer any benefits on employers.  On the contrary, it will impose burdens on them.  As regards Schedule E taxpayers, it is perfectly true that they will get the same additional allowances as everybody else and they will not have to accumulate sums to make half-yearly payments; but in the end, unless I am quite incorrect in my calculations, they will pay more and not less.  It seems to me that really what will happen is that they will have their feathers plucked one by one but more feathers will be plucked. If a plebiscite were to be taken in a farmyard amongst birds, I do not know whether they would prefer to have 52 feathers plucked out one a week, or prefer to have perhaps fewer feathers plucked out, twice a year.</P>
    <P>That seems to be what will happen. The wretched taxpayer is to have his feathers plucked every week and in the long run, he will suffer a loss because he will pay more instead of less.  One of the purposes of this Bill is to render the administration more efficient, to stop evasion, to collect arrears and to close all the gaps in Schedule E.  There are not many gaps in Schedule E&mdash;I am prepared to admit that&mdash;but the few remaining gaps are now being closed.  As I said, this leaves the fundamental inequity of the income tax code just exactly where it was before.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of the civil servants and other excluded <Col N="1299" /> classes.  It may be that what the Minister said meets my point but the matter is rather complicated.  We are all agreed on that.  Therefore, I should like to put on record that there is a case to be met, although, as far as I could follow the Minister, he may have met the point raised by civil servants and other excluded classes.  The majority of civil servants, apparently, would like to be included in this scheme.  They would have small deductions at more frequent intervals like other people and would like, I suppose, to have their feathers plucked more frequently.  They would also like to come in under the scheme to get the apparent remission of one half year's tax which the people under the scheme will apparently get.</P>
    <P>As I understood the Minister, he said that if the civil servants, by a vote, determined that they wish to come into the scheme, a similar remission period will be made on their retirement, or death, when their income ceases.  That in itself contains two injustices.  One is that the young civil servant may have to wait 40 years before he gets the same remission of taxation as the ordinary person under the scheme will get immediately.  In that case, when he does get the remission, I think interest should be paid on it by the Minister.</P>
    <P>Another point is that it is assumed that it is only six months' remission that P.A.Y.E. taxpayers will enjoy. But, as far as I can understand this extremely complicated measure, it is quite possible that some of them will receive more than six months' remission, so that, even if this scheme should come into operation for civil servants, they would still have a grievance.  They would have to wait many years for whatever tax remission they would get and, when they did get it, they would not get what is the uniform and average amount of the other salaried workers but the minimum amount.  There would still be a differential treatment of an adverse character.</P>

      <P>My observations on this measure will be very brief <Col N="1300" /> because it is a Bill of a highly technical nature which does not lend itself to a long discussion.  First of all, I must say that I welcome the Bill because I believe it provides a more efficient system of income tax collection than has been in operation heretofore.  It will make for the more even distribution of income tax among the different sections of the community, that is, in regard to the tax for which they are liable.  It will also bring about a position in which evasion of income tax will be more difficult.  That is a very important consideration when according to a recent statement, there are arrears outstanding to the amount of £10 millions, some of which, I suppose, will be found to be irrecoverable in respect of income tax and corporation profits tax.</P>
      <P>That indeed is a very large sum and if this Bill goes any distance towards obviating a situation of that kind, it will be very welcome.  Some people, of course, look upon the evasion of income tax as a normal thing, something which can be justified, but when we consider the effect it can have on the other sections of the community, it is not so harmless as we are given to understand.  What happens when there is a certain amount of evasion of income tax is that other people have to bear the burden and that is why I am in favour of a more efficient system, as I think this will be.  As Senator O'Donovan said, this is the beginning of the working of the system and no doubt, as time goes on, unforeseen difficulties will arise but if they do, there should be a way of getting over them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator O'Brien mentioned public servants and he seems to regret that public servants have not been brought within the scope of this measure.  I do not know that they have any great complaint because I imagine that public servants are subject to a kind of P.A.Y.E. system already as their tax is deducted at the source, monthly in the case of civil servants and quarterly, I think, in the case of teachers, so that they have already in operation for themselves a kind of P.A.Y.E.  The fact that they want to come directly under this scheme proves it is very <Col N="1301" /> acceptable to them.  I think it is acceptable to all sections of the community because it will make for more efficient and equitable collection of income tax.</P>
    <P>I imagine it will also bring about certain economies in the administration because I believe that when income tax is deducted at the source, fewer officials will be required for its collection.  That, in itself, is some consideration.  I know the Minister would like to effect economies.  That is his policy and he has already given earnest of it.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Brien finds fault with the existing income tax code.  We are now changing the system and if, as he said, the present code is outmoded, then we are breaking new ground with this Bill. I have heard references to the unsuitability of the code here and elsewhere. Some people, when speaking on those lines, give the impression that they want income tax abolished altogether.  That would be a good thing if it could be done and all of us would be in favour of it if those who advocated it could show us an alternative source of revenue which is required to keep our social services going.  Those who advocate the abolition of income tax are, I think, indulging in wishful thinking; they would be on surer and more practical ground if they advocated a reduction in the standard rate of tax.</P>
    <P>We are glad that the Minister for the first time in years has been able to give a reduction in the standard rate of income tax for the present financial year and we hope he will be able to continue on that very desirable course. This measure, I think, will make the task of collecting income tax simpler. If there is one thing more than another needed by the ordinary people, it is a simplification of the regulations governing the assessment of income tax.  It is very difficult for the ordinary man to understand the regulations and to know the allowances and reliefs available.  The Revenue Commissioners issue an explanatory memorandum with every application they send out but it is still difficult for the ordinary person to grasp the significance of the various reliefs given. In many cases, people must go to an expert or some semi-expert for guidance and advice and that represents an <Col N="1302" /> additional tax on them.  I am glad that the allowances, the reliefs to be given in the future, will be more generous under the P.A.Y.E. system.</P>
    <P>Again, I wish to express my appreciation of what the Minister has done in bringing in this new system.  I believe the fears expressed by Senator O'Brien have no foundation.  He referred to the relationship between employers and employees in regard to this Bill, but I, for one, cannot see any friction arising between the two groups as a result of the operation of this system.  I have seen reports in the Press in connection with the P.A.Y.E. scheme but I have not seen that any employer or group of employers expressed any apprehension about the working of the scheme as between themselves and their employees.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I have had some experience in the past of the problem of income tax as related to employers. The system adopted by the Revenue Commissioners for collecting arrears brought the scheme into ill-repute because, in many cases, the amounts which employers were required to collect from their employees was over half their weekly earnings.  As far as I know, what happened in practice was that in many cases an employer did not collect the amount due, and he was &ldquo;stuck&rdquo; if an employee left his employment before the full amount of arrears was collected.  That is the only good reason I can see for the introduction of this system but, allowing employers to collect arrears over a longer period would have removed a great deal of the necessity for the introduction of this cumbersome P.A.Y.E. system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suppose we must be realists and accept this measure but I believe that Senator O'Brien has made a case for the type of employer that predominates in this country, the small employer.  Anyone who read the Report on Companies a year or so ago will have seen that the vast majority of people who work here in industry, and who will be most affected by P.A.Y.E., are employed in small industries. Now it will be necessary for a small industrialist to employ a very confidential clerk to administer the <Col N="1303" /> P.A.Y.E. system.  It may mean that the person now in charge of a small mechanical system of bookkeeping may not be suitable for this work and a person of high status in industry, paid a higher remuneration, will be required to do it.  It will also mean that, where mechanical bookeeping is employed, larger, more expensive and more comprehensive type of equipment will have to be put into operation.  If you like, these are administrative details, but I think Senator O'Brien was right to point out that such burdens are likely to fall on this type of employer.</P>
    <P>Many small employers do not have time to make their case before various commissions, such as that inquiring into income tax.  They are engaged in the battle for existence in a competitive system, may be on the export market or home market, and their responsibility is to see that their businesses are efficiently managed.  Therefore, it is well that we have professors and other people to study these matters and point out the burdens which will be placed upon employers.</P>
    <P>If not under this measure, then under some other the Minister for Finance&mdash;possibly when he introduces his Finance Act this year&mdash;should make some provision to recoup employers for the extra expenses involved in the P.A.Y.E. system which, as is suggested, will be of great benefit in the collection of revenue.  The people who collect this revenue will have a heavy burden placed upon them, and at least they ought to be allowed the cost of collecting it.</P>
    <P>I have often spoken against the P.A.Y.E. system because in essence I think it is inflationary.  During the recent petrol strike a letter appeared in the Press from the trade unions detailing the wages of employees of the petrol companies.  These wages were shown less their contributions to a pension fund and less their contributions to social welfare.  I have always felt and, indeed, a previous Minister for Finance, Deputy McGilligan, stated in this House that he also had the feeling employees would look on the net amount which they received in their weekly pay packet as the <Col N="1304" /> amount that was being paid to them. They would say: &ldquo;That is what I get for my week's work,&rdquo; and would not say: &ldquo;That is what I get plus the money that was paid into my pension fund, plus the money that was paid into my social welfare fund to see that my wife, children and myself are looked after in case of illness, plus the amount paid into Revenue for my tax responsibility.&rdquo;  For that reason I feel it has an inflationary effect and it may encourage further demands for new rounds of wage increases.  I believe that aspect of it should be fully and widely publicised so that its implications may be known.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I again stress the point I made that, this being a country of small industries, the Minister for Finance should include each year in the Finance Act a section which will give the necessary allowances to cover the cost of collecting income tax under the P.A.Y.E. system. In that way I believe he will encourage employers because at present they feel that all the burdens are being placed on them.  Many burdens of this nature are a disincentive to industry, a disincentive to enterprise, and if the Minister for Finance in asking employers to collect this money for the good of the country also considers the burden they have to carry, and allows them the cost involved he will receive their co-operation.  By doing that, I believe he will get better results in production and enterprise.</P>

      <P>This Bill embodies recommendations set out in the first Report of the Income Tax Commission and, as such, is to be welcomed by the Seanad in so far as those recommendations go.  In order to bring a note of reality into this argument about whether we should retain the income tax code or not, it might be no harm to mention a recommendation in the introduction to that first Report in which it is stated:</P>

    <P>We have not so far considered fully the possibility of substituting for income tax an alternative form of taxation.  All the representations promised us have not yet been received. However, we think it right to <Col N="1305" /> say that, from the information so far before us, we do not see any possibility of recommending a form or forms of taxation that could substitute completely for taxation on incomes.</P>
    <P>That attitude was criticised in the Dáil and has been criticised here by Senator O'Brien.  I think it is a very unrealistic sort of criticism to which Senator O'Brien gave vent.  What are the facts and the figures in regard to the matter?</P>
    <P>Income tax and Corporation profits tax yield a revenue of £28,000,000 a year.  That is practically a quarter of the total revenue got in by the State. In any suggestion as to abolishing income tax, surely there should be the counter, or practical, suggestion of how that £28,000,000 is to be got?  People talk about sales tax, purchase tax and expenditure tax, but they are all sides of the one coin.  They are a form of indirect taxation.  Already in our customs and excise duties we have a very considerable range of goods brought into that form of indirect taxation yielding revenue to the State. When one comes down to analysing the goods which can be made subject to such a purchase tax, I fail to see to what extent the State could profitably enter that field of taxation, remembering the wide range of goods already subject to indirect taxation in the form of customs and excise duties.</P>
    <P>The key to the whole matter can be found by inference from the last sentence of the Commission's report on this matter; they say they can see no possibility of recommending a form of taxation that could substitute completely for taxation on incomes.  There is, perhaps, a limited field in which the State might go into the realm of purchase tax, but I do not see that field producing anything like the £28,000,000 revenue which is produced at the moment from income tax and corporation profits tax.</P>
    <P>If the State could enter into the field of purchase tax, that would yield a few millions per year; a modest sum of that nature might mean, in turn, the raising of the level of personal allowance and a reduction in the standard rate, but that is the limit of the modest objective at which we could hope to <Col N="1306" /> aim in that direction.  There is no point in wild talk about abolishing income tax, without, at the same time, making some suggestions of an adequate and practical character for raising alternative revenue to replace the revenue obtained through the medium of income tax and corporation profits tax.  There is some scope for reducing the incidence of income tax to a limited extent, but only to a limited extent, by consideration of a purchase tax.  Therein lies the reality of the matter.</P>
    <P>The principal argument against income tax is that, because of its collection twice yearly on earnings in the previous year, it has proved an irritating, or a disincentive, factor in many cases.  Indeed, in reverse, that is the great argument in favour of indirect taxation of every kind.  Indirect taxation is paid every time one buys an article and one does not, therefore, feel the impact of it to the same extent. The introduction of P.A.Y.E. is an attempt to meet that weakness in the income tax code&mdash;this six-monthly demand which only annoys people, acts as a bar to enterprise and is a constant burden in its bulk sum form.</P>
    <P>P.A.Y.E. introduces the principle of painless extraction, the same type of painless extraction as exists in regard to indirect taxation.  It is an attempt to meet the weakness in the collection of income tax.  In future, income tax will be paid weekly or monthly, as the case may be.  To that extent, it will cease to be an irritant and will cease to be a disincentive factor.  It will have a certain stabilising influence because it will be paid more or less painlessly.  It will have the same anaesthetic effect as indirect taxation. Psychology plays an important part in all this and, from the psychological point of view, a good deal of the grumbling and the complaints so prevalent up to this about income tax will cease to have effect.  The antipathy to paying income tax will disappear.  By bringing its collection into line with the painless extraction inherent in indirect taxation, adverse criticism, incipient grumbling and complaints will disappear.</P>
    <P>The pattern of life to-day is that <Col N="1307" /> pretty nearly everything is paid in instalments. Life assurance is paid on a weekly basis.  Household commodities, motor cars and so forth, are bought on hire purchase.  Whether we like it or not, that is the mood of the age; people dislike saving in order to pay money down.  They prefer to pay in instalments.  They prefer hire purchase.  P.A.Y.E. is an attempt to bring the pattern of taxation into line with the mood of the people.</P>
    <P>In addition, this new system will bring considerable benefits to both the taxpayer and the Exchequer.  It is pointed out in paragraph 59 of the explanatory memorandum that:&mdash;</P>
    <P>The loss of revenue from the proposed alterations in the Income tax code is estimated at £1,000,000 in a full year but a system of P.A.Y.E. where Income Tax is deducted by reference to current earnings may be expected to yield an additional £980,000 in a full year.</P>
    <P>There will be a shift away from people who may not be in a position to pay income tax towards people who are in a somewhat better position to meet their commitments in that regard.  The State will, therefore, get more.  In effect, that is what it means. The less well-off sections will get relief to the extent of £1,100,000, whilst those who have hitherto avoided meeting their obligations will be caught in the net to the extent of an additional £980,000.  From that point of view, the scheme rationalises the present system inasmuch as the Exchequer will get more from those who are better equipped to pay, whilst those who are less well off will pay less tax or, in some cases, none at all.</P>
    <P>Like some of the other speakers, I was concerned at first about the burden this system would place on employers. That burden was a very real consideration having regard to the manner in which the scheme is operated in Britain and the complexity of the code as a whole.  The framers of this Bill, however, have done an excellent job in that regard. They have taken the British system <Col N="1308" /> and adapted it to suit our circumstances. That is an example we could follow with benefit in many directions. We should study carefully the systems in operation elsewhere and adapt them to our own needs.  A small country like ours could do that with great profit, making full use of the research done elsewhere.</P>
    <P>The burden which I feared might be too heavy on employers has been reduced considerably by the decision to have a uniform rate of taxation up to £1,800 a year.  That should make deduction very simple both from the point of view of the employer and the employee.  I suggest that the Revenue Commissioners would do well to issue an explanatory leaflet for the benefit and guidance of employers.  Everyone in receipt of a taxable income up to £1,800 a year must pay 5/3d in the £; in the leaflet, details of the deductions to be made, family allowances, insurance policies, and so forth, could be set out.  I suggest the Revenue Commissioners should consider that. Such a leaflet should be made available to employers and their office staff in order to assist them in the collection of income tax under the P.A.Y.E. system.</P>
    <P>Apart from the effect on employees generally, it is a good thing all round that the code has been simplified.  There was a feeling in the country for years that the income tax code was complex and beyond the ken of the ordinary person.  This measure does a lot to remove that feeling.  It does so, of course, by making a flat rate relief for earned income of one quarter up to £1,800 and by raising the personal allowance by £84 on salaries up to £1,800.  Hitherto, there were six different ways of computing six different rates of taxation up to £1,800.  Instead of that complex situation, there is now a single rate of computation up to £1,800.  That is done by having a flat rate of one quarter for earned income relief and by abolishing certain zones of taxation for the first £100 and £200.  The personal allowance compensates for abolishing the reliefs on the £100 and £200.</P>
    <P>The increase in the personal allowance is welcome.  I agree with Senator <Col N="1309" /> O'Donovan in his appeal that the differential should be increased in favour of married persons in respect of that personal allowance.  That is a very proper attitude to take.  In future, reliefs in regard to the personal allowance level should take cognisance, to a greater extent, of married people and of widows and widowers.  This measure gives a flat increase of £84 on the personal allowance all round.  To that extent, it is uniform.  It is very welcome and it will be appreciated by many people and it is a policy which should be followed in future in any modification of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The raising of the lower level will afford immediate relief to the lower paid sections of the community and will not involve Revenue in any great loss.  It might be no harm to have an analysis of what extent any gains to the lower paid sections of the community have been offset or negatived by administrative costs of collection.  For that reason, an increase in the personal allowance is the proper way to approach any reliefs to be given in the income tax code.</P>
    <P>Broadly speaking, this is a measure which should be welcomed by the Seanad because it simplifies a code which was too complex in the past, and because it introduces this psychologically easier way of paying taxation than that operated in the past which was found to be burden some on some of the people who had to pay tax.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCrowley" hpid="Mr. P. Crowley Mr. P. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to welcome this Bill as some of the other speakers have done.  All thinking people will undoubtedly welcome the general principles on which the Bill has been designed.  I want, however, to refer briefly to two aspects of the Bill, one of which has been referred to by Senator O'Brien.  He has spared me the job of going into it in detail, but I wish to elaborate a little further on what he has said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator O'Brien pointed out that quite a substantial number of taxpayers are State employees of one kind or another and they are already paying what is, in effect, current taxation on current income.  I want to point out also that in addition to that very large number, we have quite a substantial <Col N="1310" /> class of people who, so far as I can see, are, to all intents and purposes, also paying current tax on current income. I am aware that there are a number of what have been described as private enterprise concerns in which, by agreement, or arrangement, or established practice, tax is, in fact, deducted at source from the salaries of the employees concerned.</P>
    <P>While this Bill is under examination in this House, we should get our minds quite clear as to what is involved in that point.  As I see it, the ordinary taxpayer who pays his tax in two instalments when it is demanded, does so in respect of income earned over the preceding 12 months of employment. Consequently, by the time he has the second instalment paid, he is, in effect, three months, and in some cases, nine months, in arrears.  In the case of the people whose tax is deducted at source, it seems to me that they are paying current tax on current income.  That is how it appears to my unprejudiced mind.</P>
    <P>If we are to understand that there is a concession in this Bill by which the first of these categories of taxpayers is to get a remission of some six months' tax, we shall be doing an obvious injustice to a large number of people if something is not done to give people in a similar category some measure of relief&mdash;people who have always paid their tax, so to speak, on the nail.</P>
    <P>Perhaps I might quote an example to make it more clear.  A firm operates a system under which on 1st January and 1st July each year, it pays an instalment of tax on behalf of each of its employees.  In turn, the firm deducts at source, by weekly or monthly instalments, either the weekly equivalent or the monthly equivalent to which they are entitled, from the individual.  Over a period of ten months in this case, deductions are made from 1st February to the end of November in each year.  In fact, therefore, the employees of that firm this year will, in the normal way, be liable for the tax right to the end of next November.  On the introduction of this Bill as I see it they will in addition become liable for taxation, for current <Col N="1311" /> tax on current income from 1st October next.</P>
    <P>The net effect of that, no matter how one looks at it, seems to be that a substantial number of people will this year be paying, in effect, 15 months' tax in 12 months.  To a certain extent, perhaps the Minister might claim that their case will be provided for in the assurance to which he refers by which they will be remitted a half year's tax on termination of employment or on death.  I submit that does not meet the case.  I think that an injustice will be done to these people, unless the Minister can assure us that by one measure or another these people will be treated in the same way as people who in the normal course will come under the new P.A.Y.E. system.</P>
    <P>That also illustrates an aspect of the Bill on which I should like an assurance from the Minister.  I hope to hear him on the point and I hope my suspicion is not correct, that, in effect, this Bill will secure additional taxation equivalent to about three months' tax from a very large number of taxpayers for the current year.  I wish to hear the Minister on that point and I hope, as I say, that my suspicion is not well founded.</P>
    <P>The second point I want to make is that it seems to me that apparently there has been a change, so far as I can judge, somewhere over the period of the past two, three or four years in the method of assessment of taxation. I should like to hear from the Minister whether I am right or wrong in this assumption.  It appears that over the period of the past two, three or four years for the purpose of arriving at what is called earned income relief, the Revenue authorities allow only a calculation of the amount of that earned income relief on the net amount of income after deductions have already been made for medical insurance, mortgages, loans, annuities and so on.</P>
    <P>If that is so&mdash;and it appears to be so from correspondence I have had on the subject&mdash;it seems to me that something has happened in the past two, three or four years to change the <Col N="1312" /> system.  As I and a large number of other people understood it, a person would be entitled to earned income relief in respect of the gross income before these deductions were made. The effect is that the individual taxpayer concerned has, in fact, been assessed for some £14 more of income tax this year than he would have been assessed for some 5, 6 or 7 years ago. I should like, before the new system comes into operation, to have the Minister's assurance that that aspect of this matter will also be given some further consideration.</P>
    <P>I welcome the principle of the Bill.  I also think the people who drew up the scheme itself are to be complimented upon the simplicity upon which it has been built.  I welcome the Bill, subject to hearing the Minister on the two points I mentioned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOQuigley" hpid="Mr. O'Quigley Mr. O'Quigley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is to be commended on a number of grounds but I do not think it is a Bill that anyone can really welcome because it suggests a continuation of the present high level of income tax, particularly upon those who have suffered more under it over the years and who have got fewer reliefs than they were entitled to by reason of the decline in the value of money.  I think the Bill is to be welcomed only in the sense that it makes the payment of taxation somewhat easier.  It falls somewhat into the category of legislation such as they have in Continental countries which provides that a person who has to undergo a term of imprisonment for three years may do it at weekends. This Bill is that kind of Bill. People will still have to bear the same amount of punishment.  The only difference is, as Senator O'Brien said, that it means plucking the feathers 52 times in the year instead of perhaps, four different times.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill is probably welcomed by people who are excluded from its provisions in Section 4 for the reason that it means that those who have not being paying their due share of income tax up to the present will now be called upon to do so.  If similar energetic steps are taken in regard to all other sections of the community <Col N="1313" /> who are liable to income tax on account of the real income they have, the standard rate of income tax would probably be substantially reduced and at the same time, the personal allowances, which Senator Lenihan advocates should be increased, could also be increased.  For that kind of reason, I think this Bill is to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>Apart from anything else, there has been a demand by people who are paid weekly salaries and wages and who are liable to income tax that some system such as this should be devised so that they will not find themselves faced at Christmas, or when going away on holidays, with a big bill from the Revenue Commissioners. The P.A.Y.E. system will eliminate much of that kind of hardship. Undoubtedly, there has been real hardship in cases where people were eventually overtaken by the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    <P>As regards the public servants who are excluded from this Bill, it is hardly correct to say that they have the same system of tax deduction as is being provided in this Bill.  I understand that considerable hardship exists among public servants even under the present system of deduction at source.  That arises from a number of factors.  The principal one is one which affects people in the lower income brackets but who are none-the-less liable to income tax.</P>
    <P>Oftentimes a person earns overtime. Let us say he earns overtime in 1958-59. He does not earn any overtime in 1959-60 but he has to pay income tax in respect of overtime which he earned in a previous year, in a year when he is on a lower rate of pay.  That has caused considerable hardship to public servants.  If it is not intended to extend the P.A.Y.E. to public servants, there is no reason that I can see why the present system could not be applied in a manner which would enable people who fall into that category to pay their income tax in more equal deductions than under the present arrangements. Senator Ó Ciosáin made reference to the fact that the Revernue Commissioners had £10 million arrears of income <Col N="1314" /> tax which they had to write off as irrecoverable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonKissane" hpid="Éamon Ó Ciosáin Éamon Ó Ciosáin">
      <NameTxt>Éamon Ó Ciosáin</NameTxt>
      <P>Income tax and corporation profits tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOQuigley" hpid="Mr. O'Quigley Mr. O'Quigley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>If that is the case &mdash;and I take it the Senator is correct &mdash;it is deplorable that that situation should have arisen because it can arise for only one reason, that is, that sufficient staff was not made available to the Revenue Commissioners to mop up this £10 million which could have been recovered and need never have been lost if a few extra staff had been made available.  That outlook in regard to providing sufficient and adequate staff for the Revenue Commissioners illustrates the truth of the saying about spoiling the ship for a ha'porth of tar. For the £10,000 that might have been spent by way of providing additional staff, £10 million was lost to the State. The consequence of that is that the taxpayers who have been paying their tax day in, day out, have to shoulder a greater burden than they need.</P>
      <P>With regard to the Bill, it may, indeed, incorporate a very simple system of taxation but anybody who reads it will find, as Senator Ó Ciosáin said, that it is a highly technical Bill indeed. I know that by reason of the fact that income tax in arrears is always collectable one cannot codify the existing taxation law, but some serious effort should be made by the Minister to make available to the taxpaying public a booklet&mdash;I do not think an explanatory memorandum would be sufficient &mdash;setting out people's liabilities.</P>
      <P>Section 16 (2) reads as follows:</P>
      <P>Section 4 of the Finance Act, 1951, shall be construed and have effect as if a reference to subsection (1) of this section were substituted in subsection (2) for the reference to subsection (1) of section 2 of the Finance Act, 1952.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know what that means.  I do not think any person earning £6 or £7 a week, with no legal training but who would have the Finance Act, 1952, available will understand the reliefs to which he is entitled or the liabilities to <Col N="1315" /> which he is subject, under that subsection.</P>
    <P>I understand that the Income Tax Act, 1918, is not available for purchase in this country.  Nevertheless, people are expected to know the law.  Even though the Government Publications Sales Office in this country cannot supply people with the text of the law, they are expected to know and observe it.  There is an old legal maxim that every man is expected to know the law. Is it not stretching that maxim a bit too far when our citizens have not available to them the main statute governing income tax?  That emphasises the absolute and urgent necessity of providing income taxpayers with an up-to-date booklet setting out the provisions of the different Acts intelligibly. I further suggest that such a booklet should be provided to every person liable to income tax, as of right.  When any new Finance Act is enacted, amending the income tax law, a loose leaf should be enclosed with the assessment form by the Revenue Commissioners to be inserted into that booklet.</P>
    <P>Senator Ó Ciosáin referred to the explanatory memorandum sent by the Revenue Commissioners.  We would require several further explanatory memoranda to understand the first one issued.  It is quite unfair that people should be asked to take the word of the tax gatherer on trust.  They should understand and see clearly, after a certain amount of study, all the allowances to which they are entitled.  I am satisfied some people are paying more income tax than that for which they are liable because of their total ignorance of reliefs they are entitled to claim.  I ask the Minister seriously to consider the provision of some kind of information for our taxpayers particularly as, if my information is correct, the Income Tax Act, 1918, cannot be purchased in this country.</P>
    <P>The six months' assessment granted to persons to be brought in under the P.A.Y.E. scheme has given rise to a certain amount of discontent among people who have paid income tax by way of deduction from their salaries at source over the years.  The reasons for the discontent and sense <Col N="1316" /> of grievance are twofold.  They feel that, being in the same category as those to whom the new P.A.Y.E. system will apply, they should be entitled to the same relief as those who will get it under this Bill.  They feel that equality is equity and that that principle should be applied to them.  In the second place, they feel that as they have always paid the last halfpenny in income tax&mdash;and, as I suspect, some of them have probably paid more than they were liable to pay&mdash;if some accommodation and some remission is being provided, some encouragement is due to those who have borne more than their share of the revenue of this country all over the years.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Health indicated on the Committee Stage of the Bill in the Dáil that, if those being excluded were brought in at some later stage, the relief provided under this Bill for people brought in under it would not be provided for those people who are now excluded.  The Minister for Finance who was here this afternoon can say: &ldquo;I did not say that.  That is what the Minister for Health said.&rdquo;  Nevertheless, he ought to give the matter serious consideration. These people have a sense of grievance that they are not getting the benefit which another section of the community in the same standard as regards salary and taxation will get under this Bill.</P>
    <P>The position can be put in this way.  If two people are paying income tax on the same salary scale and are entitled to the same allowances over a period of thirty years, the man under the P.A.Y.E. system will pay tax for 29½ years and the other man will pay tax for 30 years. It may be that no immediate benefit will accrue to the person brought in under the P.A.Y.E. system but, from the long-term point of view, that benefit will accrue to him.  The advantages to people at present paying income tax by deduction at source on entering the scheme as a scheme are somewhat open to debate.  I do not think any firm conclusion has been reached by the people excluded as to whether they should opt to come <Col N="1317" /> into this scheme and request the Minister to bring them in under it. The present position in relation to people whose income tax is deducted at source is that if a man dies or retires in the middle of an income tax year, say if he dies in October, an assessment is made for the penultimate and the ultimate year of his earnings and in some circumstances that may result in a refund of income tax.  The ramifications as to why that is so are more complicated than I could explain clearly to the Seanad but I am quite satisfied from an examination of the position and from information supplied to me that a refund may occur.</P>
    <P>I mention that because I would ask the Minister what will be the position of people who retire from employment in the middle of an income tax year. Will there be an adjustment similar to the adjustment I have spoken of and to which the people at present are entitled?  Will there be such an adjustment in respect of the people under the P.A.Y.E. system?  That would have some bearing upon the attitude of people excluded from the P.A.Y.E. scheme under this Bill.</P>
    <P>The changes made under Section 17 in relation to reliefs in respect of life insurance premiums, as I understand the position, will mean in some cases&mdash; I do not know to what exent this will arise&mdash;that people will be required to pay more than they had to pay before the changes which are made in this part of the Bill.  That seems wholly unfair. People who take out insurance premiums invariably calculate their liability to tax and the reliefs they are entitled to obtain by reason of the premiums they are paying.  If, on the basis of the law existing at the time they contracted for the insurance, they felt they were to be liable for a certain sum in income tax and they now find that sum increased, it is most unfair to those people.</P>
    <P>Reliefs, once given, should not be taken away and I do not know any other provision in relation to income tax where reliefs of the kind given in respect of life insurance premiums have been reduced by any Finance Bill to date.  If what I say is correct, that people will get less by way of relief in <Col N="1318" /> respect of life insurance premiums under the changes being made in this Bill, it will have an adverse effect upon savings and people will be less disposed in future to take out insurance policies because they will not know with any certainty that the reliefs in operation at the time of taking out the policy will not be reduced.  That would be running completely counter to the whole policy of the Government and indeed of all Parties in regard to increasing the volume of savings among all sections of the community.</P>
    <P>There is only one other matter to which I should like to refer, that is, the reference by Senator Lenihan to the fact that this Bill followed the pattern of what had been done in Great Britain.  My view is that what suits Great Britain is generally not suited to this country because of the disparity in the standard of living and income and because of the different type of economy in Britain.  However, it is a most pernicious doctrine to say that we should look around other countries, see what they are doing and then copy what they have been doing. We have sufficient skill, resource and brain-power to devise any schemes we require to meet our problems.  We may not always have the finance to match the schemes we devise but it is a most pernicious doctrine to suggest that we should spend our time looking over at Great Britain to see what they are doing and that we should become a nation of imitators of Great Britain.</P>

Senator Lenihan said we could profit by the experience of other countries and benefit from their research.  He did not say we should tamely imitate or follow everything which happened in Great Britain or anywhere else.  He said we could adapt an efficient system, which worked successfully and effectively in Great Britain or elsewhere, to our own needs.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DominickMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>As I see it, in this Bill we are not dealing with the principle of income tax or the question whether income tax should continue to be collected from those people fortunate or unfortunate enough to have to pay it.  As I understand the position, income tax is collected from a comparatively small section of the community and, generally speaking, will continue to be collected from that same comparatively small group after the enactment of this measure. In the past, however, there has been a well-grounded suspicion amongst people who pay income tax, the wage and salary earners, that the collection of the tax was not carried out equally amongst all the people in that group; in other words, that it was possible, by one device or another, for some wage or salary earners to get away without payment of the income tax they might have owed.  Naturally enough, that left a sense of grievance amongst people who regularly had to meet their full income tax bill.  As I see it, this P.A.Y.E. system will spread the income tax collection more evently amongst those in employment but will do nothing at all to make the collection of income tax more certain from people in employment who have other incomes and who do not come under Schedule E.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of the employees who were fairly sure to pay the income tax rightly due under legislation, perhaps the most certain to pay, the people who were caught immediately and for the last penny, were the employees of the State.  Under the system as it operated up to now, those people had the income tax due immediately deducted and it was collected from them inevitably and completely.  The new system will not apply to them.  It will apply to other wage and salary earners and, <Col N="1320" /> in effect, it will give to the people to whom it applies a tax holiday for some six months.  That is necessary and it is obviously impossible to deal with it in any other way.  With the introduction of the new system there will be this time lag of six months, but the people to whom the new arrangements will not apply will not have this six months' tax holiday.</P>
    <P>When dealing with the Bill in the Dáil, the Minister for Health, as far as I could understand, gave an undertaking that such people, if a majority so wished, could be brought in under P.A.Y.E. arrangements subsequently. There would not be this six months' time lag but arrangements would be made to give them a rebate of income tax when they came to retire.  Naturally enough the people affected, the people given this sort of offer, feel they are not being treated fairly.  After all, these are the people who, all the time, have had to pay their income tax completely and immediately.  It was deducted at source immediately it became due, immediately they came within the income tax range.  I should like the Minister to take another look at that problem and see if he can devise some arrangement whereby these people would be treated on a similar basis as other wage and salary earners.  I am not quite clear&mdash;I hope the Minister will enlighten me&mdash;as to the classes of people who are being excluded from this new system.  I know that State employees are being excluded, but there was a reference to people in other employment who have arrangements with the Revenue Commissioners to have income tax deducted at source.  I wonder could the Minister give us information in that respect or is it confidential?  I hardly imagine it is but there have been various newspaper reports which confuse employees of semi-State organisations. One statement says that the new system will apply to them. Another says that they are one of the excluded grades.</P>
    <P>Another excluded section of wage and salary earners are those people whose employers are outside the State. This is mentioned in the report of <Col N="1321" /> the Income Tax Commission, which says, at the top of page 16:</P>
    <P>Persons for whom P.A.Y.E. could not be operated for practical reasons, for example, the employee whose employer is not resident in the State and who is paid from outside the State.</P>
    <P>Would the Minister enlighten me as to what would happen in respect of employees of undertakings the head offices of which are outside the State but which have some sort of branch or establishment in the State?  I should imagine that once there is an establishment and some system of paying them locally, it would be possible to bring such employees under the P.A.Y.E. arrangement and I should be glad if the Minister would enlighten me on that matter.</P>
    <P>I welcome the measure.  It is a very good arrangement to bring P.A.Y.E. into operation.  It is welcomed by the trade unions even though it does really nothing about spreading the burden of income tax over the whole people.  Nevertheless, the more prompt and regular system of collection is to be welcomed, instead of the previous method of having bills sent half-yearly.</P>
    <P>I also very much welcome the fact that in the new arrangement, there is a simplification.  In effect, it means that many wage and salary earners whose incomes are on the low scale are relieved from paying income tax. The amount which they have had to pay was small but on the wages and salaries that they had, it was some burden on them.  I am glad that under the new arrangement quite a number of people will be relieved altogether from paying income tax.  It would have been too expensive, probably, to collect the rather small amounts involved in their case.</P>

      <P>I quite agree with Senator O'Donovan that there may be initial difficulties in getting this scheme going.  It would be too optimistic, indeed, to expect otherwise.  We are making every attempt and the Revenue Commissioners are making every attempt in the regulations which <Col N="1322" /> they are now preparing in anticipation of the Bill being passed to see that the scheme will run as smoothly as possible.  Many people believe&mdash;in deed, I thought so myself in the beginning&mdash;that when this scheme comes into operation, there will be less reason for the number of officials necessary under the existing scheme and, therefore, that there could be a saving in administrative costs.</P>
      <P>The point was mentioned by Senator O'Donovan.  He quoted me as saying that 57,000 people who are at present paying income tax would no longer have to pay it and that that would mean a very big saving to the Revenue Commissioners in time.  In fact, it does not, because, under the new scheme, they will have to certify these 57,000 people as being free from income tax.  They will, therefore, have to go through all the steps that are necessary to find out whether a person is liable to income tax or not and, of course, there will be many more than the 57,000.</P>
      <P>In fact, under the new scheme, everybody who is working in industry or in an employment will come under survey and a card will be handed to his employer telling him that he is liable for tax and over what level tax should be collected or, alternatively, his employer will be told that he is not liable for income tax.  So that, in fact, at least for a while, there will be more work than there was in the past because a very big number of people who were working in industry in the past were just ignored.  No notice was taken of them but notice will now have to be taken of them. However, as time goes on, I have every hope that the system will work smoothly and there may be a saving in staffs and so on in time to come.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the Comptroller and Auditor General&mdash;it is no harm to mention his name because he is taken as an example of a man who might suffer hardship if he came under this scheme next year&mdash;of course, if you look at it, he does not.  If he does not come under it, he will be assessed next year on his income this year and, therefore, he will have to pay income tax and perhaps surtax on the amount <Col N="1323" /> we voted him here to-day.  Suppose he does come under P.A.Y.E. next year, he would then have to pay, if he was working in outside employment, let us say, first of all, a half-year's income tax on 1st July on this year's income and then he would go on to P.A.Y.E. for the remainder of the year and, of course, the P.A.Y.E. amounts would be payable on his earnings, which would include the increase that we give him here to-day.  So, I cannot see that it would make any difference to him whether he came under P.A.Y.E. or not.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Donovan pointed out a clause in the Bill which said that if a man had anything abnormal by way of income, that might be added to his 1960-61 income and the 1960-61 income of the Comptroller and Auditor General would therefore be increased by what we gave him here today. There is a clause in the Bill which makes that provision but it is put in principally to deal with increases that might be given purposely for evasion of income tax.  That is what we had in mind in that regard.  It is fairly obvious that the increase given to the Comptroller and Auditor General was not given in order to evade income tax.  I could not answer, of course, for what the Revenue Commissioners might decide in this case but I think they would at least have in mind that there was no intention on anybody's part to try to evade income tax in giving him the increase we gave him here to-day.  I should say that as the civil servants will not come under P.A.Y.E. next year, the case does not arise.</P>
    <P>The changing of the basis from previous years to the year in question was not done, as Senators might think, for administrative purposes.  It was done because that is the whole idea in this scheme of P.A.Y.E.  Remember, it means, &ldquo;Pay as You Earn&rdquo;.  In other words, income tax is deducted from every week's wages before you get them.  You must necessarily deduct on the year in question rather than on the previous year's earnings. The question, therefore, of administrative convenience did not arise.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1324" /> It is true that unmarried people get a bigger proportionate relief than other people.  They all get equal relief of £84 but the reason, as I explained in my introduction of this Bill, was that it would be very complicated to work this scheme if we continued our present method of payment of income tax.  As Senators know, the present method is that, having given all reliefs, we take the amount liable to income tax and say: You pay 2s. 9d. in the £ on the first £100, 5/6 in the £ on the second £100 and 7s.in the £ after that.&rdquo;  That would be a very complicated system to work for the employer.  In working out this scheme the Revenue Commissioners thought it would be better to have a straight rate with no reductions on the first £100, or the second £100, or anything like that, and that it would be much more simple for everybody to work.</P>
    <P>To get away from a low rate on the first £100, and not so low a rate on the second £100, we had to exempt the first £84 so that nobody would be worse off as a result of the change. That is what happened.  By making that change, something like 57,000 people now liable to income tax will no longer be liable.  Everybody who comes under this scheme will be somewhat better off.  In some cases, I admit, they will only be better off by £1 and in other cases they will be better off by £18 to £20.</P>
    <P>We had to get a straight scale with the same amount right through in order to make it workable for employers and employees.  In doing so, we had to make the sacrifice of losing something like £1 million.  Senator O'Brien said that this is only a minor administrative change.  He is quite right.  There is no change in policy in this Bill, no financial or economic policy in it.  Income tax remains much the same, or a little bit lower if you like.  This is merely a Bill for the collection of income tax.  That is not policy.  It is just an administrative change, if you like an administrative policy.  To that extent Senator O'Brien is right in saying it is a minor Bill and does not make any great difference to the policy that has been pursued in regard to income tax up <Col N="1325" /> to the present.  It does provide for what we believe to be the more efficient collection of income tax&mdash;as somebody here put it, a more painless method of extraction.</P>
    <P>I think some Senators have an idea that the Revenue Commissioners and I were more or less forcing this scheme on the country.  That is not true.  I can say quite truthfully that the Revenue Commissioners did not like this scheme.  They would have preferred to stay as they are.  They did not want this departure from the present system but, when the Commission reported, the Government considered the report and said: &ldquo;We shall adopt the scheme put forward by the Commission.&rdquo;  Then the Revenue Commissioners fell in, as they always do, with Government policy and tried to produce the very best scheme they could.  Taken all round, I think they have produced a simple and a good scheme, as schemes go.</P>
    <P>Personally, I must say on examining this, that I do not think it will be very burdensome on employers.  Somebody said that it is all right for the big employer because he can get an accounting machine to do the work for him.  I am told that these machines are by no means expensive.  If a man has, say, 18 or 20 people who are liable to income tax, he will probably get one of those accounting machines, and it will probably pay him to have one, but as far as a small number are concerned I do not think any employer can plead that he will be put to a great inconvenience.  After all, he is not asked to make any great calculation. The way it works out is that when he gets a card for the employee who is liable, he is told he must collect 5s 3d in the £ on a certain amount for this employee and it is not a very big matter.  As a matter of fact, he will not even be asked to calculate the amount at 5s 3d in the £ because he will get a ready reckoner to do it for him.  Therefore he will not have to tax his intelligence too much in making out what he must deduct from any particular employee.</P>
    <P>Somebody raised the point that <Col N="1326" /> employers should be compensated for this work.  I do not know that there was any demand of any kind from employers generally on that score.  If anybody reads the report of the Commission he will see that those who have worked the scheme have found that the time taken by an employer, or his clerk, to collect the amount that should be taken from any particular person is very, very small indeed.</P>
    <P>Everybody will admit that the British scheme is very much more complicated than ours but I notice in this report that the Belfast Society of Chartered Accountants, who have been working the British scheme for many years, say that where a small employer has only one or two persons employed sometimes he does not make any attempt to understand the system and sometimes leaves it to his accountant or somebody else to look after it.  The last part of this paragraph states&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Where, however, there are a substantial number of employees there is no doubt that the cost could be valued as a proportion of the wages clerk's time spent in preparation of the wages.  To give a very rough estimate, it could perhaps be said that where a firm is employing fifty or more persons the cost to operate the system would be a sixth or a seventh of the wages clerk's salary.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The estimate there, in a more complicated system, as the British system is, is that looking after the income tax of 50 or 60 employees would be roughly about one day's pay to the clerk who looks after the wages.  Our system is simpler but actually we have not such a big number of employers who will have 50 or 60 employees who will be liable to income tax. When sample checks have been taken and the number of employers with employees taken into account the number exempt is rather surprising. As far as the employer is concerned he has no trouble because the Revenue Commissioners find out if employees are exempt or not and he is told that the employees are exempt up to a certain sum above what he is paying <Col N="1327" /> them.  I think we should let this go on for some time before we talk about the cost which this scheme will involve for the employer.</P>
    <P>The next point raised was in regard to the interest payable.  I explained in the Dáil that giving the Revenue Commissioners power to collect one per cent. per month on amounts outstanding was not an attempt to collect a large amount of interest from the people concerned.  It was put in to prevent their holding up accounts, so that they would pay promptly and, as Senator O'Brien pointed out, it is considered more a penalty than a method of compensating the Revenue Commissioners for outstanding accounts.  I think it will have that effect because no employer would think it good business to hold accounts in his bank in order to save overdraft interest, if it cost him 12 per cent. per annum to keep money for that purpose.</P>
    <P>I am afraid there is a great deal of confusion about what a person gains by coming into this scheme and what a person loses by not coming in.  Let us take an example of two types of person coming in, of a person working with an ordinary employer and of a civil servant.  That is the best illustration. The person in ordinary employment, as is stated very clearly in the Bill, pays his income tax which is due on the year 1959-60 on 1st July.  He, therefore, has to pay a half year's tax in the first half of the year 1961-62. That person pays, of course, on the previous year and that goes on and on until he retires.</P>
    <P>When he comes under P.A.Y.E., from 6th October until the end of the financial year, he pays as he earns so that he pays one half year's income tax in the first half of the year and the other half weekly or monthly, as the case may be, in the second half.  He pays the full year's income tax in the year 1960-61&mdash;there is no doubt about that.  When I come to present a Budget, that will be the basis on which the calculation is made, that there will be a full year's income tax paid next year.  At least <Col N="1328" /> it will be collectable&mdash;whether paid or not, I do not know.</P>
    <P>To take the civil servant&mdash;in the present year, 1959-60, the civil servant pays his income tax.  It is true that he completes payment of income tax by 31st March but he pays on his income for 1958-59, the previous year. He does not pay on the earnings of the year in which he is paying.  If the civil servant were to come under this scheme and were to be allowed to pay no income tax for the first half of 1960-61, he would be paying on P.A.Y.E. for the latter half and would pay nothing for the first half, so that he would have a distinct advantage over the person working in industry because nobody working for an outside employer coming under this scheme will get what is referred to here as &ldquo;a half year's holiday from income tax&rdquo; or remission of income tax for a half-year.  Everybody will be compelled to pay a full year's income tax next year even though half of it will relate to this year and half to next year.  From that on, they pay on the earnings of the year in which they are paying.</P>
    <P>When it was explained in the Dáil that if civil servants decided to come under this scheme&mdash;I am very doubtful if they will because the advantages are not all on the side of coming in in the case of civil servants; for people outside, I think the advantages are on the side of coming in&mdash;they would be paying a full year's income tax every year just the same as the people outside.  But when it comes to the final year, when a civil servant is about to retire, he will get a half year's remission.  That is the same provisions as applies to people are Senators know that if people are working in a job outside and liable to income tax, in the final year they work, they will pay&mdash;suppose they stop work on 6th April; that makes it convenient for me to give an example&mdash;they will be paying a half year's tax on 1st January and the other half in July.  They would pay tax a half year after retiring.  Under P.A.Y.E., that will not happen and in that case they get a half year's remission. <Col N="1329" /> There is no reason why a civil servant or anybody else should get it any sooner than he is getting it.</P>
    <P>Senator Burke returned to the difficulties of the employer.  I think his fear was that it would be difficult for the employer to carry out this scheme, that it would be hard to understand. That is the first point.  I should say that it is intended to issue a guide to employers which will give all sorts of example tables and tell them as far as possible what to do in various circumstances. They will be helped in every way and if an employer has any doubt, somebody from the office of the Revenue Commissioners will be only too glad to call and explain it to him. I do not think they need worry about that aspect.</P>
    <P>Another case Senator Burke made was that the wages clerk might not be a suitable person to carry out this task because, the Senator said, it would require a good deal of privacy and would be of a confidential nature.  That consideration gave us a good deal of trouble when we tackled this scheme at first.  It was evident that if the commissioners said to the employer, in the case of a particular employee: &ldquo;You may pay this man £10 a week and after that, deduct,&rdquo; the employer may have had a suspicion that this man was heavily involved in the bank and he would say: &ldquo;Now, I know I was right.  I know he is involved in the bank.  From his income, I know he must be getting big relief or otherwise that amount would not be allowed tax-free.&rdquo;  We could not scrap the scheme for that, and there is a clause in the Bill which gives the employee the option, if he has anything outside his own employment and if he does not want it disclosed in his card, to say to the inspector of taxes: &ldquo;I will settle that direct with you.&rdquo;  In other words, a man who is working for an employer and who is heavily involved in the bank and does not want the employer to know it can say to the inspector: &ldquo;Do not refer to the business in the bank; you can refund that direct to me later on,&rdquo; and that can be done.</P>
    <P>Alternatively, if an employer suspects <Col N="1330" /> that a man is getting income from another source and in a case where, perhaps, it would not be good for the employee if that suspicion were confirmed, the employee can say to the inspector: &ldquo;Do not refer on my card to the income I am getting from the other source.  I shall pay direct on that.&rdquo;  That can be done.  The person concerned can always keep his business confidential if he wants to do so. The only thing he must agree to is that in the particular employment, the employer will deduct.</P>
    <P>Coming to Senator Lenihan's speech, undoubtedly income tax has disadvantages.  We all admit that.  He would be a very brave man who would say he found nothing wrong with the payment of income tax, but, as Senator Lenihan pointed out, the whole trouble is to find a substitute for income tax.  It yields a very big amount, between £20,000,000 and £30,000,000, and no Government could face the issue of saying: &ldquo;We shall abolish income tax,&rdquo; without substituting for the greater part of the yield, anyhow, revenue from some other form of tax.  I could not suggest anything that would yield anything like the same amount.  One might be able to suggest some taxes that would replace part of the income tax yield, but only part.  Whatever we do, I am afraid income tax will remain in some form or another, at some level or other.</P>
    <P>As I said already, and this arises on Senator Lenihan's speech, employers will be provided with a guide and I think I should also mention that employees&mdash;covering the point raised by Senator O'Quigley&mdash;will be supplied with what is called a &ldquo;quiz&rdquo; in which every possible question that has so far occurred to the Revenue Commissioners will be included and the answers given.  When this has been issued and if Senators think of other questions that should have been asked, perhaps we can issue a supplement later on containing any additional questions suggested.</P>
    <P>It would be very difficult to issue a memorandum or booklet, as suggested by Senator O'Quigley, telling <Col N="1331" /> each person exactly where he stands in regard to income tax.  We all know that the income tax code is very complicated and I do not think it would be possible for anybody to tell each income taxpayer exactly what applies to him.  Sometimes even the Revenue Commissioners cannot do that; sometimes they are told by the Courts that they are wrong.  On the whole, I think what we are attempting to do now is the best thing, that is, to ask all the questions that might arise for an employee under the P.A.Y.E. system and provide the answers.</P>
    <P>Senator Crowley gave a certain example which I think is this: employees working in a certain firm&mdash;I know one firm like this myself but I do not know if it is the same as Senator Crowley has in mind&mdash;have their income tax paid for them by their employers on 1st January and 1st July. I am not sure of the dates in the case I know but I accept Senator Crowley's as correct.  Then, from 1st January up to the end of November, they collect the tax from their employees. As Senator Crowley has said, when P.A.Y.E. comes into operation next year, these employees will be paying under it from 1st October onwards and, therefore, there will be overlapping for the two months, October and November, when they will also be paying income tax through their employers.</P>
    <P>In such a case, it is obvious the employees are in arrears at a certain stage because, when the employers pay the Revenue Commissioners on 1st July, they have not got the money, but continue collecting it from their employees until the end of November. All I would suggest is that they make some arrangement to clear up the arrears next year a little more quickly, in order to have them cleared by 1st October.  I might add we are suggesting that all around because it will give the new system a better chance of working.</P>
    <P>Senator Crowley said there was a change in the method of assessment as regards earned income allowances.  I <Col N="1332" /> am told there is no change.  The same thing has been going on for years and years, and the easiest thing is to give an example.  A man earning £1,000 a year is paying £200 a year bank interest.  The Revenue Commissioners say he is assessable on £800 and then take off earned income allowance, personal allowance, married allowance &mdash;if he is married&mdash;and insurance allowance, and he is assessed on the balance.  Senator Crowley made the point that such a man should get earned income allowance on the gross amount, the £1,000, but I do not think it would be fair to the State to do that because, if he is assessable only on £800, he should not get earned income allowance on £1,000.  It is conceivable I could work out a case, where Senator Crowley's recommendation would be carried, in which we would owe such a man money at the end of the year, if his interest were high enough as compared to his total income.</P>
    <P>I think I have answered the two questions put by Senator O'Quigley on the explanatory memorandum and with regard to civil servants.  There are no changes as far as life insurance is concerned.  In the past, as Senators are aware, if a person were paying £20 a year to a foreign company, he got relief on half of that, £10, and that was deducted from his income tax.  It always came in at the end of the sheet.  Having given the full assessment of income tax owed, the Revenue Commissioners deducted a certain amount for life insurance and then showed a net total.  The change made now is that instead of doing it that way, saying £20 is paid to a foreign insurance company, £10 will be free of income tax, that is deducted from a man's income and we go on from that.  In the case of an Irish insurance company, a deduction of two-thirds the amount is given and the procedure is the same.</P>
    <P>I do not think Senator O'Quigley was serious in suggesting that we should not try to build our experience on the failures and the defects of systems in other countries.  I think we should study this scheme, as the Commission did, as to how it works <Col N="1333" /> in other countries and find out what weaknesses there were.  Usually other countries are quite willing to tell you what are the weak points in their schemes, which we can strive to avoid and, instead of building up our own experience, we can start with experience from other countries and try to get a better scheme.</P>
    <P>I was asked by Senator Murphy about the people excluded from the P.A.Y.E. system.  They are civil servants and in that sense they include those paid by the State, such as teachers, Gardaí, and Army personnel. There are other groups also and there is a history in relation to the fact that they have their own special way of paying income tax.  They include employees of the Dublin Port and Docks Board, the Irish Lights, the Bank of Ireland and the Church of Ireland.  Various statutes were passed from time to time dealing with these bodies and, if you like to put it that way, it was arranged they would have what is known as their own assessor, who collects income tax from them.</P>
    <P>I need hardly tell Senator this assessor is very closely in touch with the Revenue Commissioners and he deducts the proper amounts from these groups.  While the tax is deducted from source, it is possible these groups might prefer the P.A.Y.E. system to what they have, and what is provided in the Bill is that if any one of those bodies, by an obvious majority, wants to have P.A.Y.E. applied, they can come along and, in accordance with the undertaking I gave in the Dáil, I shall put the necessary amendment in the Finance Bill next May.  It would be impossible to put an amendment in now because we do not know whether any, or all of them, would be anxious to come in under the P.A.Y.E. scheme.</P>
    <P>There are three headings under which certain people are exempt or will not come in under the scope of this scheme.  The first are those who have their own assessors.  The second are those who, as Senator Murphy mentioned, are working with a foreign company.  We have no power over a <Col N="1334" /> foreign company.  We cannot collect but, if there is an agreement made, I daresay it can be arranged&mdash;I am not sure actually if it can, but it may be possible&mdash;if the company concerned and its employees are anxious to come in under this scheme.</P>
    <P>The third category is that of professional men in particular who are partly assessed under Schedule D and partly under Schedule E.  The best example of such people is dispensary doctors.  The dispensary doctor gets part of his salary from the local authority.  In addition to that, he earns fees from his private patients.  It would be very, very difficult to collect from a person such as that under this scheme.  It is easy enough to collect on his salary as a dispensary doctor, but it would be well-nigh impossible to collect on every fee he gets.  Such people must, therefore, be left out. These are the three classes left out of the scheme.  That, I think, answers Senator Murphy's point.</P>

      <P>If the Minister's view of the Revenue Commissioners' interpretation of &ldquo;ordinary character&rdquo; is correct, then we are all in sympathy with them.

      <P>I think there is a slight gain if the Minister's interpretation is correct.  What I am concerned about is that certain contingencies are provided for and I was <Col N="1336" /> trying to draft a sub-paragraph (d) following on (a), (b) and (c) in regard to an ordinary application for compensation for an increase in the cost of living.  I can understand why a promotion should be accounted for, but I cannot understand why (b) and (c) should be provided for if you are not to provide specifically for the other cases.  We have &ldquo;or to any other similar excess of an ordinary character.&rdquo;  It depends on the interpretation of &ldquo;ordinary character.&rdquo;  On the Minister's assurance that this is related to meet a stunt to give somebody £1,000 in the interregnum, it is quite satisfactory.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the £84 calculation though I do not understand it.  It produces this interesting result. Where a single man got an allowance of £150 the allowance now becomes £234; that is nearly 50 per cent.  In the case of a married man, however, who got an allowance of £310, he will now get an allowance of £394, or not very much more than about 30 per cent.  Single people come off much better than married people.  Surely that is contrary to general State policy and contrary to the basis of the present income tax code.  I was wondering if there is any possibility of remedying that.</P>

      <P>The Minister has indicated that a certain kind of questionnaire will be sent to employees setting out various questions by the Revenue Commissioners, as I understood the Minister, as to the actual assessment of income tax for which the employees are liable.  I think that goes some distance to meet the position of the people under the P.A.Y.E. scheme. In that connection, it seems to me that that form should carry some notice that it is in the interests of employees that they should answer all the questions fully.  We know perfectly well that the prospective taxpayer will greet any such notice with a degree of cynicism. He will feel that he is merely being lured on to his destruction.</P>

    <P>On that point, perhaps the Seanad understands completely what I am saying.  On this section of the Bill, I raised the objection that it does not make his liability clear to the person who wants to know his position in the income tax year 1960-61.  This manner of amending Finance Acts by reference to other Acts and deleting and substituting references in other sections of previous Acts sounds terribly clear, I am sure.  It is a wholly bad principle.  This Bill&mdash;and indeed there were remarks made in debates upon other Finance Acts which I dare not refer to&mdash;could be made clearer as could all the laws relating to liability under the Income Tax Acts.  I see <Col N="1339" /> no difficulty whatever in doing that. If people want to know their liability in the financial year 1960-61, they should be able to look at the Finance (No. 2) Act, 1959.</P>

I am saying the liability should be set out clearly in one complete Act.  It should be set out in the whole of this Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Minister for Finance (Dr. Ryan) James Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to give statutory force and effect to the pensions increases payable from the Exchequer or other public funds, including the funds of local and harbour authorities, which were announced in the Budget last April.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1340" /> Under the Bill, pensions which were calculated on the salaries payable prior to the general Civil Service pay increase of 1st November, 1948, are to be increased by 6 per cent., and pensions calculated on the salaries payable during the period after the pay increase of 1st November, 1948, and before the pay increase of 1st November, 1952, are to be increased by 4 per cent.  No increase is being given on this occasion to pensioners who retired on or after 1st November, 1952, with full benefit from the higher rates of salary which came into operation on that date.  It has been decided that whatever moneys could be made available for pensions increases this year should be applied for the benefit of the older pensioners whose pensions were calculated on pre-November, 1948, and pre-November, 1952, salaries.  These pensions are lower than the pensions of their colleagues who retired after 1st November, 1952, and they have accordingly been given priority in the matter of pensions increases.</P>
    <P>Because it would be anomalous if a pre-November, 1952, pension were increased above the pension of a colleague who retired with the same rank and service in November, 1952, or subsequently, there is a limitation in this Bill, as there was in the Pensions (Increase) Act, 1956, that no pension may be increased above the pension that would be payable if the pensioner had retired with the same rank and service on 1st November, 1952, with the benefit of the pay increase given on that date.  In some cases pensions have already been brought up to the November, 1952, level, or very near it, under previous legislation, and these pensioners will not accordingly be entitled to any further increase or only to a small one.  As the limited increases in these cases have been the subject of some comment, I would like to point out that all these pensioners are now getting the same pensions as their colleagues who retired in November, 1952.  If the increases payable in some cases are small, it is because these pensioners needed only small increases to bring their pensions up to the November, 1952, level. <Col N="1341" /> These pensioners, together with the pensioners who retired in the three years from November, 1952, to October, 1955, now from a group which will be considered as a single class for the purpose of any further increase in pensions.  As I have already explained, the moneys available this year have been applied to the relief of pensioners who have not yet reached the November, 1952, level.</P>
    <P>In some cases, the pay increases corresponding to the Civil Service pay increases of 1st November, 1948, and 1st November, 1952, were granted on other dates.  Provision has been made in the Bill to enable the actual date of the corresponding pay increase to be taken in determining whether a 6 per cent. or a 4 per cent. increase is payable. Accordingly, in referring to the 1st November, 1948, or the 1st November, 1952, I should wish to be taken as referring also to any alternative dates that may be adopted under the Bill.</P>
    <P>The classes of pensions to be increased are described in the Schedule to the Bill.  Only civil pensions are covered by this Bill; the increases in Army and Military Service Pensions will be covered by separate legislation. Part I of the Schedule to the Bill covers retired Civil Servants, Teachers, Gardaí and other civil pensioners whose pensions were calculated on the remuneration payable before the pay increase of 1st November, 1948, or the appropriate alternative date.  These pensions will be increased by 6 per cent.  All other pensions covered by Part I of the Schedule to the Pensions (Increase) Act, 1956, and which have not yet been raised to the November. 1952, level will be increased by 4 per cent. subject to the overriding maximum which I have already explained. The increases will be calculated on the existing pensions, including any increases under previous Acts.</P>
    <P>The widows and children of Ministers and other holders of parliamentary offices and the widows of Gardaí, etc., are covered by Part II of the Schedule.  Local authority pensioners are covered by Part III and harbour authority pensioners by Part IV.  Most of the widows' pensions in Part II of <Col N="1342" /> the Schedule are payable at basic rates fixed prior to 1948, to which the 1949 and 1956 pensions increases have been added.  These fixed rate pensions will all be increased by the 6 per cent. appropriate to pre-November, 1948, pensions, and the new rates will apply to all pensions granted in future, as well as to existing pensions.</P>
    <P>Generally, pensions covered by the Bill were calculated on the annual salary payable at the date of the officer's retirement.  In a few cases, however, pension was calculated on average salary for the three years preceding retirement.  A special provision has been made in Section 7 of the Bill to allow part of the 6 per cent. or 4 per cent. increase to be given in such cases.  The increase allowed will be proportionate to the part of the three-year average period which fell before the 1st November, 1948, or the 1st November, 1952, respectively.</P>
    <P>Prior to the pay increase of 15th January, 1951, the remuneration of some officers, mainly in the Civil Service, was affected by a restriction known as the &ldquo;supercut&rdquo;.  The supercut originated as a reduction in the cost-of-living bonus on higher Civil Service salaries and it continued over into the consolidated salary rates after 1946 until it was partially restored in 1948 and completely in January, 1951. It had also, of course, affected pensioners who retired before January, 1951, and whose pensions were based on salaries as reduced by the supercut. Under Sections 3 and 4 of the Pensions (Increase) Act, 1956, the pensioners who retired prior to January, 1951, were given either a revision of pension to restore the supercut reduction or the appropriate percentage increase under the Act, whichever was the more favourable.  Following representations from the pensioners concerned, these sections have been amended by Section 2 of the present Bill to restore the supercut reduction in all cases and to allow, in addition, the appropriate percentage increases under the 1956 Act and this Bill. Under this provision, the basis of these pensions will now be brought into line with the position of other ranks of the Civil Service whose pensions were <Col N="1343" /> based on salaries in which the cost-of-living bonus element was not subject to reduction.</P>
    <P>Authority for the appropriate increases in pensions payable from the Exchequer will be found in Sections 3, 4 and 7, while Sections 5 and 6 provide for the increases in pensions payable by local authorities and harbour authorities.  These latter increases will be subject to the approval of the Minister for Local Government or the Minister for Health in the case of local authority pensions and to the approval of the Minister for Transport and Power in the case of harbour authority pensions.  The increases allowed will in all cases follow the pattern and the conditions of the increases in Exchequer pensions.</P>
    <P>Section 10 of the Bill contains various consequential provisions such as, for example, the application to the increased pensions of the statutory provisions which applied to the original pensions.  It also provides that any increase under the Bill shall not be assessed as means for the purpose of an Old Age Pension or a widow's noncontributory pension.</P>
    <P>The cost to the Exchequer of this Bill is estimated at over £70,000 in a full year.  In the current year the cost will be over £38,000.  Adding the increases in Army and Military Service Pensions which will be covered by separate legislation, the total cost to the Exchequer of this year's pensions increases will amount to almost £130,000 in a full year.</P>
    <P>I commend this Bill to the House for its approval.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>I can say only one good thing about this Bill and that is that it is a comprehensive Bill for once.  It covers a wide range of State, local Government and harbour authority ex-employees.  Having said that, I find it impossible to say anything else in defence of a Bill whose purpose seems to be, having named these various pensioners, to prevent large numbers of them from getting even a brass farthing under the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In a passage which I quoted the other day on another Bill in relation to the judges and their salary increases, the Taoiseach in the Dáil said that it <Col N="1344" /> would be &ldquo;a dereliction of duty&rdquo; on the part of the Government not to compensate the Judiciary for a change in money values which had amounted, he estimated, since 1953 to about 15 per cent.  As a result of that, it was proposed by the Government&mdash;it has since been decided by all of us&mdash;to give a 10 per cent. Increase to judges.</P>
    <P>We decided earlier on today that, in view of the same circumstances, we would give an increase of nearly 19 per cent. to the Comptroller and Auditor General.  These people have now had their salaries increased as from the 1953 level, because it seemed urgent and imperative to the Government, in view of the marked increase in the cost of living which affected these people, as it affected all others, to give them a marked increase, to enable them to cope with the situation as it had changed since 1953.  Yet these pensioners to whom the present Bill refers are to get nothing at all more than what they might have hoped to get in 1952!</P>
    <P>I find that quite scandalous, and I am prompted to ask the Minister how he dared to come before the House and put these two quite different views.  In the case of well-paid public officials the Government holds they must get an increase of 10 to 19 per cent. over the 1953 rate.  In the case of past servants who have given equally good service to the country and to the local authorities which employed them, he says: &ldquo;You shall not get anything more than what would bring your pensions up to the 1952 rate.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Why is it a &ldquo;dereliction of duty&rdquo; not to raise by at least 10 per cent. the salaries of the Judiciary and the Comptroller and Auditor General and why is it not also considered to be a dereliction of duty on the part of the Government to say that pensioners shall get nothing over and above what would have enabled them to live at the cost of living of 1952? I feel the Minister must give an answer to that question.</P>
    <P>I well remember the Bill brought before us in 1956 which gave an increase of from 6 per cent. to 15 per cent. to various grades of pensioners.  I described it as a niggardly Bill.  It <Col N="1345" /> was a niggardly Bill, but for niggardliness it is completely beaten by the present Bill.  The present Tánaiste, who was then Deputy MacEntee, on the 14th of November, 1956, said in the Dáil, apropros of the 1956 Bill, that he had only one criticism of it and that was that it was &ldquo;meagre indeed&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Of course, the Tánaiste was then in Opposition.  Yet the increase given to these people by the Coalition Government, an increase of from 6 per cent. to 15 per cent. for the lowest grades, was regarded by the then Opposition, which is now the Government, as an increase which was meagre indeed.  Yet all these people are now mentioned in this Bill as being entitled to no further increase whatsoever.  How does the Minister justify that?</P>
    <P>Is it that, when in Opposition, the present Government allowed the Tánaiste to criticise the 1956 Bill as meagre indeed but were consciously calling for something which they had no intention of honouring if they had a chance to honour it?  How can the Minister explain that by the provisions of this Bill people given that &ldquo;meagre&rdquo; increase in 1956 are now explicity precluded from any further increase whatsoever?</P>
    <P>In 1956, it was revealed by the then Minister for Finance that something like 1,500 persons were on pensions of less than £100 a year, a very little bit more than the old age pension, which is now about £71.  On 10th March, 1959, the Minister told Deputy T. Byrne that 85 Civil Service pensioners were getting less than £50 a year and that something over 730 were getting from £50 to £75 a year, and 227 were getting from £75 to £100, making a total of about 1,000 pensioners now getting, still getting despite the 1956 increases, less than £100 a year pension.</P>
    <P>Our hearts were wrung this afternoon by the same Minister on behalf of a public servant now struggling along on £2,400 a year whose salary has consequently to be increased by a further £450 a year.  There are about 1,000 retired public servants struggling <Col N="1346" /> to live on less than £100 a year pension. It is for us in the strongest terms to cry &ldquo;Shame&rdquo;, on behalf of those people.</P>
    <P>How many people, under Sections 3,4 and 7, are totally deprived of any increase under this Bill?  How many pensioners of the various classes referred to in this Bill will, by reason of these sections, be totally deprived of any increase?  What number of Civil Service pensioners who will get something under this Bill will suffer deductions by reason of these three sections, Sections 3, 4 and 7?  What, in money, will be the approximate total amount saved by such deductions made by reason of the provisions of these three sections?</P>
    <P>It was stated in the Dáil a few days ago that by the provisions of this beneficent Bill, some pensioners will get as little as 6d. a month and some as little as 3d a month.  I feel that that is nothing less than insulting behaviour towards those retired servants of the State and local authorities.  In answer to a question in the Dáil the other day, figures were given of the number of retired civil servants affected by this Bill.  I am not quite sure whether that answer, which adds up to a total of about 1,400 people, represents the total number who will get anything under the Bill.  How many persons will get anything, even 3d a month under this Bill?  Different figures have been quoted in the Dáil, but the position is not quite clear.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned, not counting further pensions which will be proposed for the Army later, an expenditure figure of about £70,000.  On an average, would it be right to say that these pensioners are getting something like from £10 to £50?  I do not know; it depends on how many people are involved.  What is the average increase?</P>
    <P>Now, these pension increases, where there are any, are to be back-dated to 1st August, 1959.  The same Minister told us this very afternoon.  In the case of an increase of £450 a year, representing 19 per cent., in the salary of the Comptroller and Auditor General that the Government propose to back-date that increase to 1st <Col N="1347" /> January, 1959.  Why this difference in treatment between the well-paid official now working for the State and the wretchedly-compensated pensioner who formerly worked for the State and is struggling to live on a miserable pension?  Why is it considered necessary to back-date increases in judicial salaries and in that of the Comptroller and Auditor General to 1st January, while increases in pensions under this Bill are to be back-dated only to 1st August?</P>
    <P>I am shocked and I think many people are shocked&mdash;certainly, they would be shocked if they read this Bill&mdash;by the amount of ingenuity called upon and expended in an endeavour to complicate the issue almost indefinitely for these unfortunate pensioners, many of whom are living on as little as £70 a year.  In this Bill, I see an immense amount of work and, I might almost say, of muscular effort put into the production of the required tightness of fist on the part of the Minister.  This is a tight-fisted measure which, having talked at great length about what will be conceded to whom, winds up by giving even to the best-treated only compensation for what might have been theirs in the light of the cost of living of 1952.</P>
    <P>This Bill is a disgrace to the country.  I feel ashamed of it and all of us ought to feel ashamed of it. I know that, personally, the Minister is a most kind-hearted man.  He and the Government must feel shamed by a Bill of this kind, which is taking advantage of the helplessness of these people, because that is what it comes to.  The pensioner suffers from one grave disability.  He has lost the strike weapon.  The pensioner cannot go on strike.  Consequently, he is treated as an inferior citizen.  If he were still there on the job, if he could fight his corner by threatening strike action, I suggest that such a niggardly and shameful measure would not be brought before us.  Since these pensioners have not any weapon, save appeal to public opinion, it is for us here, in their name, to cry &ldquo;Shame&rdquo; to the Minister and the Government.</P>

      <P>Like Senator Sheehy Skeffington, I am thoroughly disappointed at the provision made in this Bill for retired employees who were formerly paid out of public funds and whose pensions are now paid out of public funds.  Reading the Bill has made me indignant.  I fully feel the sense of indignation and shame that Senator Sheehy Skeffington has expressed in relation to some people who will be offered as little as sixpence a month or in some cases threepence a month.  It is an outrageous insult to those people to proffer them such an amount.</P>
      <P>The position is worse as far as the people who retired since 1952 are concerned. As I understand the position and as appears to have been stated by the Minister for External Affairs in the Dáil, no increase in respect of people who retired since 1952 will be paid under this Bill.  I have here the <i>Irish Statistical Survey,</i> on page 34 of which is a table showing the price index numbers, and for the year 1952 the price index to base 1953, 100. is 95, and in 1958 it is 116.6 which I estimate to be an increase in the consumer price index of 22 per cent.  What this Bill means, if I understand it correctly, is that, although there has been an increase in the cost of living of 22 per cent. since the 1st November, 1952, the people who retired since that date are to get nothing whatever under this Bill.</P>
      <P>If you take the increase in the cost of living since 1956 when the last increase was given, the index figure in 1956 was 107.2 and in 1958 it was 116.6, which is an increase of nine per cent.  We have had in 1958 a round of wage increases for salaried and wage-earning classes and all of these, or the vast majority of them, got a minimum of 10/- a week.  The second round of wage increases stemming from the increase in the cost of living brought about by the 1957 Budget and other circumstances is under way and has almost concluded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot understand how there can be any justification for denying people an increase in pensions having regard to the nine per cent. increase in the cost of living that has taken place since 1956 when pensions were last increased. <Col N="1349" /> It is no case to say that some of the people who retired were given certain percentage increases in their salaries before they retired.  There are people who just missed those increases and they will be caught out under this Bill.  It is a shameful and scandalous state of affairs that people who are now in their seventies, perhaps some of them up to 80 years of age, should get such a poor showing from the State to whom they rendered such splendid service in their time.  As Senator Sheehy Skeffington said, they have no potential at the ballot box because of decreasing numbers, through death, and they have no strength to enforce their demands.</P>
    <P>I notice that the Bill is making provision in Section 2 for giving retrospective effect to the abolition of the super-cut in respect of certain grades of civil servants to whom the super-cut as defined by the Minister, applied at the time they went on pension.  That reference brought to my mind the position of teachers.  There was a revision of salaries in 1946 and there was a lump sum payable as part of the new arrangement for national school teachers.  One-third of that lump sum was paid by the inter-Party Government between 1948 and 1951; another third was paid by the Fianna Fáil Government between 1951 and 1954. If my recollection is correct, there still remains a balance of one-third that has never been paid in respect of these people.  It was always argued that people who did not fall on the right side of the date line, happened to be unlucky, but it does seem that once the Minister can give retrospective effect to the abolition of the super-cut and thereby benefit the pensions of higher paid civil servants, there is every justification at this stage for paying to teachers that one-third of the lump sum paid to people who retired after the 1946 salary arrangement in respect of national teachers.  That is 13 years ago.  There are very few of them left by now, I should imagine, but even those few should, in their declining years, at least get that recognition of their service to the State.</P>
    <P>The pensions of many people would not be increased very substantially even at the rate of four per cent. or <Col N="1350" /> six per cent. under this Bill.  I should have thought that, when provision was being made for an increase in pension, a substantially larger increase would be payable in respect of those who are on the lower rates of pension.  That would be necessary in order to meet the hardships which these people have undoubtedly suffered by reason of the increase in the price of food as a result of the abolition of the food subsidies. I do not want to reopen a discussion on the 1957 Budget but there can be no doubt that these people did suffer considerable hardships as a result of that Budget.  The Minister probably takes the view that that was inevitable but he ought to make the same recompense to those people as has been made to people who were in employment, on account of these increases in living costs.</P>
    <P>Senator Sheehy Skeffington has made the point very well that if an increase of ten per cent. could be back-dated to the 1st January in respect of the Comptroller and Auditor General and the judges, then those increases in respect of the rise in the cost of living which resulted from the Budget of 1957 ought to be back-dated to a much earlier date than the 1st August, 1959.  The Minister for Justice stated in the Dáil that the reason for back-dating the judges' increase to the 1st January, 1959, was that the judges had applied for an increase in salary around 1957 and that by reason of certain circumstances which arose, through no fault on the Minister's part, that was held up until this year.  The great bulk of the increase in the cost of living has been caused by the changes made in 1957 and the Minister might well have made retrospective to the 1st January, 1957, the increases to be granted under this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is a mockery.  It should be withdrawn and a measure introduced that would at least do justice to those people who have given long and loyal service to this State.  The Bill provides increases of six per cent. for those pensioners who retired before the 1st November, 1948, four per cent. for those who retired before the 1st <Col N="1351" /> November, 1952 and nothing for those who retired since 1952.  It does that despite the fact that the cost of living has increased, is increasing daily and now stands at an all-time record of 147 points.  In reply to a question in the Dáil last week, it was stated that over 180 articles out of roughly 190 had increased in price in the last few years.  We also know that money is losing value.  Those people were at least entitled to an increase of 15 per cent., 20 per cent. or 25 per cent.</P>
      <P>By deliberate Budgetary action in 1957, the Government inflicted hardship on those pensioners unable to fend for themselves.  That Budget alone increased the cost of living by over 12 per cent.  When a Government takes such action it is up to that Government to adjust as quickly as possible the pensions of those people.  As Senator O'Quigley and Senator Sheehy Skeffington stated, those people are at least entitled to have their pension increases back-dated to the 1st January, 1959.  If we are prepared to do it for those in well-paid positions, surely those living on pensions of from £2 a week upwards are entitled to the same recognition from the State?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was on Budget day this year that the people got the first indication from the Minister for Finance that it was proposed to introduce a Pensions Bill during the year 1959 to cushion them against the increases brought about in the Budget.  High hopes were raised in the minds of all pensioners.  They were again raised only a month or so ago when the pensioners saw that district justices and judges were to get increases of from £3 10s. per week to £10 per week, increases, as a matter of fact, from £175 per annum to £385 per annum.  It is only natural to expect that pensioners living on £2 or £3 per week would say: &ldquo;If the State can give those increases to people with good jobs, surely they will give us something worthwhile in this new Bill?&rdquo;  Now we have the Bill.  The Fianna Fáil mountain has been labouring for the last five months and has produced a mouse.  Some <Col N="1352" /> people are to get increases of 6d. per month, which is 1½d. per week; others are to get 3d. per month, which is something like ¾d. per week.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>It may be a little less; that is as near as I can get to it. I am not in favour of giving the same percentage increases to all sections. If you give a four per cent. increase to a man with £100 a year, you are giving him a total pension of a little less than £2 per week; if you give it to a man with £500 a year, he will get roughly £10 per week.</P>
      <P>The 1957 Budget increased the price of the loaf from 9d. to 1/2, an increase of 5d.; and the price of butter from 3/9 to 4/4, an increase of 7d.  If a pensioner had to use six loaves in a week and 2 lbs. of butter, it would mean an increase for him of almost 4/- per week.  The Minister has not gone the full way to meet those people.  We all know that when the cost of living increases it pinches hardest the people in the lower income group and the man with the small pension.  The man with the pension of £2 or £3 per week has to try and exist on bread, butter and tea.  The man with £7 or £10 per week has his choice of foods.  The man on the small pension is definitely hardest hit and he is getting very little relief in this Bill.</P>
      <P>The 1950 Act gave increases ranging from as high as 50 per cent. to those in the lower income group down to increases of 20 per cent. for pensioners in the higher category with over £400 per annum.  The 1956 Act was very much criticised at the time by the people then in Opposition but now in Government.  In that Act we find that a 15 per cent. increase was given to pensioners with under £120 per annum, a 12 per cent. increase to those with from £120 to £150 per annum and a nine per cent. increase to those with from £200 to £300 and over per annum.  The Government should have followed the good example set by the inter party Government and given greater increases to those who are at the bottom of the ladder and who need the money badly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said, the cost of living now <Col N="1353" /> stands at an all-time record of 147 points.  In March, 1957, it stood at 135 points.  The Budget of that year increased it by 12 points.  In 1956, when the last increase was given to those pensioners, the cost of living stood at 132 points.  It is now at 147 points, that is, an increase of 15 points since those people got the last increase.  In other words, there is an increase in the cost of living of almost 12½ per cent. Crocodile tears were shed by many people here the last day because we were not able to give the judges the full increase of 15 per cent. and it was pointed out that the cost of living had increased by 15 per cent. since 1952. Surely the people who shed those crocodile tears about the judges should have seen to it that the unfortunate pensioners at least got a reasonable increase?</P>
    <P>When the Taoiseach spoke in the Dáil about judges' salaries, he said they should get a salary to put them in a position in which they would be as far as possible immune from improper influence of any kind.  The Taoiseach and the Government should have given these pensioners an increase to keep them as far as possible immune from hunger and want.  They are not getting such increase in this Bill.</P>
    <P>A nation is very often judged by the way in which it treats the old, the destitute and pensioners.  If we are judged by that yardstick abroad, some nations will think very little of us. Indeed, we are not living up to the promises made by the Taoiseach at the recent debate at Oxford that our social services would be increased and put on the same level as the social services in England and Northern Ireland.</P>

      <P>In 1950, the increase given cost £200,000.  In 1956, the increase cost the Exchequer £120,000.  This year, they are getting about £70,000, which is only roughly one-half of what they got in 1956, and one-third of what they got in 1950. Yet, the people who were then in Opposition and who are now in Government lamented the fact that these people were not getting enough.  It might be no harm to quote the Tánaiste in November, 1956, as reported at column 960 of the Official Report, Volume 160:</P>
      <P>It is a Bill, in fact, to mitigate the hardship to which the continuing upward trend in prices has subjected many hapless people, most of them incapable of serious work, who were retired on pension in days when circumstances were easier and who had been looking forward to comfortable security in their old age.  It cannot be denied that the hardship exists and that in the majority of cases it is severe. Accordingly... we are not opposing the Bill....</P>
      <P>Indeed, the one criticism I have heard of the reliefs to be granted under the Bill is that, so far as the smaller pensions are concerned, they are meagre indeed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Yet, at that time they were getting a 50 per cent. increase and that was <Col N="1355" /> described as &ldquo;meagre indeed&rdquo;.  Now they are getting a four to six per cent. increase and, of course, it is regarded as sufficient.  The hardships still exist; there has been an increase in the cost of living and I am surprised that the man who uttered those words only a few years ago could not ensure that justice was done to these people in this Bill.  Even though these pensioners may not have much political power, the nation owes them a great deal and more and better provision should have been made for them in this Bill.</P>

Secondly, he said the Budget in 1957 put the cost of living up by 12 per cent.  It put it up by less than five per cent.  Thirdly, he talked about the cost of living since this Government came into power.  We have been exactly as long in power now as were the Government before us and we put up the cost of living by exactly the same figure as they did when they were the Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It went up the very same. Let us talk about the principle of an increase in pensions.  It is a new principle. It was always recognised that salaries had to be adjusted to meet changing circumstances and for a long time, indeed, Governments and others made the stand that a pension, once awarded, should not be changed.  It is only since the war that that principle has been broken through and increases of varying amounts have been given in pensions since the war.  Naturally, of course, the first Bill brought in had to make big adjustments because there were very big changes in circumstances, in the cost of living, and so on.  There is no use in any Senator putting the words into my mouth, or into the mouth of any Senator here, that this is a generous Bill.  We never said it was.  It is as generous as we can afford in the circumstances but we never said it was a generous Bill.</P>
      <P>There is not very much use in quoting statistics of the number of State pensioners who are in receipt of a pension of less than £75 or between £75 and £100, without having the full circumstances, which I have not got. There are, of course, as Senators are fully aware, pensioners who retired on a very small pension, perhaps, from some job where the salary was small and the duties were not too onerous. All these things must be taken into account before we can deal with figures of that kind.</P>
      <P>I cannot say how many were excluded, but as far as I can make out from any brief I have here, the number excluded from any increase was somewhere between 200 and 300.  I am not sure of that: I am saying it only as far as I can adduce the figures.  The number affected by this Bill is something over 5,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1357" /> I do not know exactly what Senator Sheehy Skeffington meant by &ldquo;deductions.&rdquo;  I do not think there will be any deductions from anybody.</P>
    <P>In regard to the sixpence per month which has been referred to, it is easy to be sarcastic about a thing like that, but, if you take a case where one man retired, let us say, in October, 1952, and another man retired in November, 1952, I do not think any Senator would suggest that you could give the man who retired in October a higher pension than the man who retired in November.  There are two men sitting side by side in an office, having practically the same service, only one month between them, and when you come to adjust pensions, you cannot give the man who retired in October more than the man who retired in November.</P>

      <P>I have very little else to say.  I want to speak about the question of the super-cut.  There is no attempt in this Bill to deal with the lump sum and the super-cut, and that was the comparison which was made.  What this Bill does is to deal with pensions.  Under the super-cut, which was operated in certain circumstances, straitened circumstances, if you like, it was necessary to take a slice off the higher civil servants.  Many thought it was unjustifiable and that it should be restored, and it was restored very soon after the war.  Unfortunately, for the few years it operated, certain people retired and were suffering what appeared to be an injustice. Those who went out before them and after them were better off.  In the Bill in 1956, brought in by Senator L'Estrange's Government, the position was partially made right.  They got a choice under that Bill of taking the pension as if there was no super-cut, or alternatively of taking the lump sum and suffering the super-cut.  I read the debates and it was strongly advocated by certain speakers here that they should have got both and not a choice.  That is what is being done now&mdash;both are being restored.</P>
      <P>There is no comparison with regard to the teachers because the lump sum is not affected by this Bill.  There might be a case to be made for it&mdash;I do not know.  I just want to say that it is not being dealt with.</P>

      <P>In no worse position then, I take it, than the man who retired in September.  What happened in relation to the national teachers, as I understand the position, was that there was an increase in the general scales of salary in or around 1946, after the removal of the Wages Standstill Order.  One person, say, retired in 1945 with a maximum salary of £300, and a colleague, who retired in 1946, got an increase bringing him up to £600 and, in addition, got the lump sum.  The man who retired in 1946 had his pension based on the £600 and the man who retired in 1945 got a pension based on £300.  I think that is most inequitable and there does not seem to be anything in this section to rectify that gross injustice, as I think the Minister will realise if he goes into it.  The increase under the Act, to which Senator L'Estrange referred, was granted to some extent to compensate people for the fact that they had been on a rate of wages which had been stabilised under the Wages Standstill Order.  Nothing in this section remedies that anomaly and that grievance which, to my mind, is a much greater grievance than that which existed before the restoration of the super-cut, which, I might say, I wholeheartedly agreed with.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to increase the standard lorry weights of licensed hauliers so as to ameliorate hardship which may be caused by the proposed new motor taxation legislation.  This motor tax legislation removes the doubts which have arisen as to what constitutes the weight of a motor vehicle for taxation purposes and provides that additions to lorries, such as creels, side boards, special bodies, etc., must be included in the unladen weight of vehicles for taxation purposes.</P>
      <P>Under road transport legislation, a licensed haulier may not operate, in the course of his licensed business, a lorry or lorries the total unladen weight of which for taxation purposes exceeds the standard lorry weight specified in his licence; the original standard lorry weight granted to a licensed haulier was the total unladen weight of any lorry or lorries used by him in his carrier business on a particular date prior to the enactment of the Road Transport Act, 1933.  The Road Transport Acts, 1934 and 1935, provided for increases in the standard lorry weight to a minimum of two tons and for certain other minor additions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under these provisions, allowances were granted, <i>inter alia</i>, to meet the weight of detachable crates or creels <Col N="1363" /> which were used with the original vehicles prior to licensing but were not included in the standard lorry weight.  Under the Transport Act, 1944, standard lorry weights were further increased subject to certain minima by 20 per cent. in the case of licences with an existing standard lorry weight of four tons or under and by 10 per cent. where the standard lorry weight was over that figure. A further general increase on the same basis of 25 per cent. and 12½ per cent. respectively was authorised in 1953.</P>
    <P>Subsequently, further increases have been authorised to permit the use of permanent tipping gear (10 cwt.), diesel engines (5 cwt.) and creels for use with livestock (7 cwt.) As a result, a licensee who, in 1933, had a lorry of unladen weight of 1 ton, 10 cwts. or even less, can now use a lorry weighing 2 tons 15 cwts. unladen, and can have added to that figure a further 5 cwt. for a diesel engine, 10 cwt. for a permanent tipping gear and/or 7 cwt. to cover the use of a livestock creel but only in connection with the carriage of cattle.</P>
    <P>The policy enshrined in road transport legislation has been to preserve to the railway companies and subsequently to C.I.E. the benefits of any expansion in the use of public road transport generally while protecting existing road transport businesses. The increases in standard lorry weight I have referred to were justified principally by the continued trend towards heavier lorries and the difficulty of obtaining replacement lorries of a size which would be permitted by standard lorry weights.  Nevertheless, it is quite clear that despite the policy considerations the licensed hauliers have, as a result of these increases, increased very substantially their carrying capacities since 1933.</P>
    <P>It has frequently been argued by the licensed hauliers that the weight of detachable crates, creels and other fittings had to be included with the weights of their lorries for taxation purposes and, therefore, in their standard lorry weights and ever since the '30's, they have been agitating for increases <Col N="1364" /> in standard lorry weights to cover the use of these articles.  Certain concessions, as indicated, have already been granted for the use of cattle creels and the present level of standard lorry weights has been settled on the assumption that the weight of such additions must be included in the weight of vehicles for road tax purposes. Indeed, if this were not so, there would be no point in the representations which have been made over the years by the licensed hauliers.</P>
    <P>In recent years, a number of licensed hauliers have challenged the official interpretation of the law relating to the weighing of vehicles for road tax purposes and have removed all additions when the lorries were being weighed for taxation purposes.  They have been thus enabled to use larger lorries without exceeding, on the face of it, their standard lorry weight under the Transport Acts.  The effect of the new motor taxation legislation on these cases would be to bring the unladen weight of their lorries over the standard lorry weight specified in their licences.  In such cases hauliers would be unable to continue to use their present lorries and, in the absence of an increase in standard lorry weight, would either have to replace their lorries with lighter vehicles or operate them without the attachments or additions which might be essential to their business.</P>
    <P>This was, of course, a risk they must have foreseen when they chose to anticipate an interpretation of the law favourable to themselves; it is nevertheless the case that some of them may have done so in good faith and that the new legislation may indeed cause them considerable inconvenience or even hardship.  In these circumstances, the Government have decided that some further increase in standard lorry weight might be granted to help offset the impact of the new motor tax legislation.</P>
    <P>It would be entirely inequitable to grant an increase in standard lorry weight to licensed hauliers who had, with their eyes open, excluded equipment, such as creels and sideboards, when their lorries were being weighed for taxation purposes and to deny <Col N="1365" /> such an increase at the same time to more prudent hauliers who, to their own detriment, abided by the long standing and more generally accepted interpretation of the law.  It would mean that of two licensees who had been entitled to identical standard lorry weights ever since 1933, when licensing commenced, one would in future enjoy a greater standard lorry weight and be entitled thereby to use a larger vehicle.  It is essential, therefore, that any increase provided for in this Bill should be an all-round one.</P>
    <P>There is a wide disparity in the lorry attachments which may be used by a licensed haulier.  Some hauliers may have acquired comparatively light attachments only, such as sideboards, other may have acquired creels or even special bodies or tanks affixed to their lorries.  The extent to which such acquisitions may have brought about an excess on their standard lorry weight will vary considerably according to the type of the licensee's business, which may not have called for any excess in standard lorry weight.</P>
    <P>It would be entirely impracticable to determine the extent to which standard lorry weight may be exceeded, as a result of new motor taxation legislation, in each of some 1,000 individual cases.  In any case there would be nothing to prevent hauliers acquiring new and heavy additions now for weighing with their lorries on the 1st January next.  For these reasons, therefore, it is essential that any increase in standard lorry weight should be on a uniform basis as well as being applicable to all licensed hauliers.</P>
    <P>The uniform all-round increase provided for in this Bill is a figure of 7 cwts. per lorry.  This is a somewhat arbitrary choice but it has been selected because it is the figure which has been deemed to be sufficient to cover the use of a livestock creel with the type of lorry which comes within the standard lorry weight of 2 tons, 15 cwts., which is the standard lorry weight to which the great majority of licensed hauliers are entitled.  It has <Col N="1366" /> been represented that this increase is not sufficient to meet the hardships imposed on carriers who may be using certain heavier equipment, particularly lift-vans and special cattle bodies which may weigh as much as 25-30 cwt. each.</P>
    <P>It is not the object of this Bill to provide increases in standard lorry weights which would enable all hauliers irrespective of their <i>bona fides</i> to carry on with the lorries and equipment which they are at present using.  Hauliers who have been evading the payment of the proper road tax on their vehicles, or who have been deliberately using equipment which brings the weight of their vehicles substantially above their standard lorry weights, can scarcely expect the legislature to give them a general amnesty and confirms them in the gains which they have so doubtfully made.</P>
    <P>In all the circumstances, and having regard to the fact that the present level of standard lorry weights is intended to include the weight of additions, I am satisfied that the increase of 7 cwts. per lorry provided for in this Bill is a reasonable and indeed a generous contribution towards relieving any hardship which may be caused by the new road tax legislation. Nevertheless, I will be prepared to consider, under the provisions of Section 116 of the Transport Act, 1944, any individual cases of genuine and deserving hardship which may be brought to my attention.</P>
    <P>I may say that I have already received representations from the hauliers engaged in furniture removal. It appears, in their case, that furniture lift-vans have never been included in the weight of their lorries for taxation purposes and were not included in the standard lorry weight of their lorries in 1933.  Whether or not there has ever been any real doubt as to the law in this matter it is clear that these hauliers have been acting in good faith and could have got an increase in their standard lorry weight prior to 1944 to include the weight of lift-vans.  I am, therefore, prepared in principle to authorise increases in these cases to meet the hardship which arises.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>In its appearance this is a very small and insignificant measure brought before us at Christmas, as we are told for the purpose of removing doubts and doubtful gains by certain people who, it is suggested, are evading taxation. This small measure is calculated to do very much more harm to the economy than the Minister tells us.  I doubt if he is so naïve, or so ill informed as to think this Bill has as its sole purpose the bringing into the ambit of taxation a small number of licensed carriers who have increased the weight of their lorries.  It is my belief that every person who employs his own transport will be affected very seriously by the Bill.  It is a new direct and indirect tax on the whole industry of the country, particularly the farming industry.</P>
      <P>It is suggested that the Bill is for the purpose of stopping evasion but I believe it is a witch hunt to gain another £100,000 of taxation in a very simple way, and is brought forward just before Christmas in the hope that it will slip through unnoticed.  I hope that many people on both sides of this House have their feet in Irish agriculture and, before I conclude, I am going to ask that the Minister withdraw this measure and reconsider it.  I believe he has been ill-advised in introducing it and he has not in any statement, or in any information which has emanated from Government sources, made known its effects to the public.</P>
      <P>I believe it will increase the cost of hauling beet, fodder, hay and straw.  I believe it will increase the cost of transporting sheep, lambs, pigs, small cattle, water and everything that is important in rural Ireland.  Any farmer who puts a water tank on his lorry during a dry summer to carry water from a pump or fountain will have the weight of that tank added to his lorry, and it is obvious that the carrying capacity of the lorry will be reduced by the weight of the tank.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Any co-operative creamery which uses tanks for the purpose of transporting milk or skimmed milk to the several milk processing factories throughout the country will bear enormously increased taxation.  The <Col N="1368" /> meat industry which is required by regulation, in fact, by the Department of Agriculture, to transport any form of fresh meat to another factory, will bear increased taxation.  That industry is diverse in its forms of production and may have to transport meat from one factory to another in insulated containers.  A factory which has a lorry able to carry six tons, if a two ton container is placed on it, can only transport four tons.  The weight of the container will be taxed and they carrying capacity of the lorry will be reduced.</P>

I do not understand why this measure is brought before us in this form since we seem to have no power to object; but I do know the effect it will have. It will cause grave hardship on our economy.  I should like to have a direction from the Chair as to how far I may go.</P>

      <P>The Minister spoke about the weight of creels and additions. If a licensed carrier is allowed to carry only 7 cwts. increase, he will henceforth be able to avail of only half the capacity of his vehicle if he is carrying light animals, like sheep and pigs.  He will therefore become compelled to charge considerably more to the farmer or merchant for whom he carries livestock.  That will have an adverse effect all over the country and considerable hardship <Col N="1370" /> will be imposed on the livestock industry. On the floor of an ordinary lorry, one can carry 50 sheep.  These 50 sheep would not be one-third the weight that vehicle could carry.  If the owner wishes to carry 100 sheep, the weight will exceed 7 cwts.  Therefore, it will be illegal for the owner to carry 100 sheep.  Everyone knows that that will affect costs, which will be increased enormously.</P>

      <P>The Minister referred to that.  We have no opportunity of dealing with the Financial Resolution. This is the only measure brought before us.  Its effects will be disastrous. I have spoken to hundreds up and down the country.  This measure will affect many of our major industries. It will increase costs enormously, particularly in the livestock industry and in the meat processing industry. I want to add this note of warning. Every Senator should get a copy of the rates published.  Lorries that were 1 ton before will be 2 tons now. That will be the effect of this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say at the outset that the transport situation in the country, a situation upon which this Bill will make some impact, is really in a chaotic state.  I should like to preface my remarks consequently by saying that the new Ministry and the new Minister are in my opinion admirably qualified to deal with that situation. It was an act of imagination on the part of the Government to create this new Ministry of Transport and Power. The choice of the present Minister could not have been better.  I am certain that he is aware of the problems and that he realises that this Bill merely tinkers with them.  But it is a Bill he has to bring in in the first few months of taking office.  I am confident that he cannot be happy about the whole series of transport Bills which the Government have been obliged to bring in year after year, to try to evolve a policy which will reconcile haulage by private enterprise and haulage by C.I.E.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest that the 7 cwts. in this Bill <Col N="1371" /> are an endeavour to reconcile two irreconcilable and incompatible policies&mdash;private enterprise and public enterprise.  The Minister in the Dáil went so far as to make it clear that if, for instance, we were to amend this and make it 1½ tons instead of 7 cwts. that would have the effect of allowing the small hauliers to impinge, as it were, competitively upon the field of C.I.E.  Consequently the 7 cwts, is a kind of sop thrown to the smaller hauliers to keep them quiet&mdash;I do not think it has been eminently successful in that&mdash;and, at the same time, not to take too big a portion of the market away from C.I.E., under the other legislation to which the Minister referred in his opening remarks.</P>
    <P>I do not want to go outside the terms of this Bill, but it seems to me that this Bill makes no attempt to deal with the realities of the situation&mdash;the effort, on the one hand, to save enough lucrative work for C.I.E. and, on the other hand, not to put private enterprise out of business.  I suggest to the Minister that he ought to face the fact that because this Bill is so limited in its scope it will have the effect not of palliating the other legislation to which he referred, but rather of failing to palliate its effect sufficiently because it will put a large number of small hauliers right out of business.</P>
    <P>The Minister may ask how can we put them out of business by making a concession?  I do not think we ought to forget that, while he is making a concession with one hand, he is making a very considerable withdrawal with the other.  He himself referred to that quite frankly in his opening remarks. My own belief is that the Minister should either put these people out of business altogether, or else let them get all the business they can.  To say to them that they may only have a certain small increase in the unladen weight of their lorries is in fact to put many of them out of business.  It is not giving them the kind of concession that would be necessary to allow them to continue in operation on the present basis.</P>
    <P>These small hauliers&mdash;and the amendment here, I suggest, does not <Col N="1372" /> take it sufficiently into account&mdash;are labouring under a whole host of disabilities in relation to limitation of area, limitation of class of maintenance, limitation of standard unladen weight which is only slightly modified here, limitation of the transfer of a licence when it is being sold out of an area, and so on.  Despite the fact that the spread of these licences throughout the country is extremely haphazard, there are some activities which have large liberties and some which have none because of past tinkering with the system.  If you treat these hauliers like spancelled cattle and prevent them from moving freely in terms of free enterprise, merely to throw another seven cwts. on to what they are permitted in the weight of unladen lorries is, in fact, I suggest, to add insult to injury.</P>
    <P>The Minister is not quite fair when he suggests that there may have been deliberate evasion&mdash;and these are the words he used here and in the Dáil&mdash; and that the provisions of the other Bill, to which I must not refer, will only hit those who have so far been guilty of evasion.  That is not fair for the reason that if there was what he would be entitled to call evasion, there would be no need to change the law.  It is because the law was not what the Government thought it was that certain people may have gone beyond what the Government thought they were entitled to do.</P>
    <P>The Minister should not forget that this has been tested in the courts and they even found for the hauliers against the Attorney General.  My information is that each time it has been tested&mdash;even when a C.I.E. case was tested&mdash;the court found for the hauliers.  The C.I.E. case was slightly different because it had to do with a container clamped on a lorry.  It seems that the clamping to the lorry had been done under a misapprehension. Therefore, I do not think it is just to say some people have been evading the law and that it serves them right if they are hit now.</P>
    <P>I suggest that when the Minister decided&mdash;and I think he might perhaps let us into some secrets there&mdash; that seven cwts. should be the maximum <Col N="1373" /> referred to in the Bill, he should tell us what he had in mind.  Why hit upon seven cwts.?  Why not eight cwts. or 15 cwts.?  What had he in mind?  He himself referred to provisions that have become necessary since 1932, though it would appear on some legislation on transport that some officials in the Minister's Department have been thinking consistently in terms of 1932.  The Minister has admitted that there have been some improvements in trucks and lorries since then and he himself mentioned sack-loaders, power brakes, ramps, diesel engines, and two-speed back axles which add to the weight which has been recognised, as the Minister said, in previous legislation.</P>
    <P>It is remarkable that in every case, if my information is correct, where the additional weight has been recognised, the Government seem to be able to get hold of far lighter sandloaders, power brakes, ramps, diesel engines and two-speed back axles than, in fact, could be bought on the ordinary market.  Where a cattle ramp is added, the trucks weigh something from 10 cwts. to 15 cwts. and the Government think it weighs at an absolute maximum some five cwts. or seven cwts.</P>
    <P>I feel that the decision of the office as to what the actual increase in weight implied by such fitting to the lorry, has not been made by people who are closely in touch with the realities of the situation and was based upon a misapprehension when the decision was made that an extra seven cwts. ought to be enough at this juncture.  Even the Minister and his officials do not feel too happy about that.  They felt it was necessary to make provision also&mdash;or to remind us of the provisions of the 1944 Act&mdash;to enable the Minister to take special individual cases into consideration and make concessions for them.</P>
    <P>In 1932, the two-ton lorry was fairly big but it is now extremely small and yet some 75 per cent., I am told, of the hauliers who will be affected by this Bill have, in fact, a two ton 15 cwts. limit unladen weight and to that now is to be added this very small <Col N="1374" /> figure of seven cwts. to take into account the fact that, as the Minister mentioned, the container will, by law, indubitably be in future weighed in. Anything else put on the lorry or added to the lorry will, in future, be deemed to be fitted to and be part of the vehicle itself.</P>
    <P>I suggest, therefore, that the decision of the Government on this matter as expressed in this Bill is outmoded, is not sufficiently in touch with modern conditions, and is not the modern view. Yet, the tax people have to pay is quite modern enough and in fact, in the case of the five-ton or seven-ton lorry, it is nearly double the British equivalent.  When the Minister considers, and asks us to consider, adding on a mere seven cwt. to this, he should bear in mind that most of these licensed hauliers are unable under existing legislation to run even the lightest of the modern Leyland trucks and even the new Dundalk truck which will be on the market will be out of their reach on that account.  In other words, I do not think the addition of seven cwts. is sufficient on account of the changes in conditions.</P>
    <P>All these people are badly in need of the adjustments offered by the Bill but the seven cwts. is far too small.  A haulier in Limerick was mentioned to me whose lorry has a container which weighs three tons. In County Cork, it is common to find a container actually weighing one and three-quarter tons.  In relation to those circumstances, I do not think it fair of the Minister to say that this Bill and the other Bill were brought in to remove a doubt.  So far as the courts go, there was not any doubt. It is quite clear that, as the Minister said, this Bill is linked with the other Bill which will compel the lorry owner to weigh in all additional parts, containers and so on, and up to the present the courts have found that containers are not regarded as part of the weight so it is no use for the Minister to say that the hauliers know perfectly well that they are.  The courts say they are not.</P>
    <P>The Minister shook his head when I referred to the case in June, 1959, of the Attorney-General <i>versus</i> Glynn <Col N="1375" /> which was dismissed and the Attorney-General did not ask for any case to be stated.  Similarly, in the Green case in 1954, the courts found for the hauliers.  In view of those facts, I do not think it is sufficient for the Minister to say, as he said in the Dáil and again here today, that he has the power to deal with special hardship cases.  Apart entirely from this Bill, that is a bad principle and I do not think any Minister should come to Parliament and say: &ldquo;The Bill I am asking you to pass lays down a certain law but since I have absolutely discretionary powers to let people off this law, the stringency of the law is not a thing to be objected to.&rdquo;  I do not think that is the way to legislate.  It should not be at the Minister's discretion but should be set out in the legislation and it should be the same for all.</P>
    <P>At column 1099, volume 178 of the Dáil debates of 9th December, the Minister says:</P>
    <P>All I can say is that I shall have to ask the House to trust my judgment in this matter.</P>
    <P>I do not think that is good enough.  I would say to the Minister: &ldquo;Do not ask us to trust your judgment&mdash;legislate and let us trust the legislation,&rdquo; not because I distrust the Minister but because I prefer to see the principle in the Act rather than know that the principle is in the mind of the Minister.</P>
    <P>Again, at column 1095, the Minister says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Similarly, the Minister has absolute discretion, in some instances, to increase the types of merchandise that can be carried in the lorries owned by licensees.  In certain circumstances, if, for example, a licensed haulier has a number of commodities on his licence but some are excluded, the Minister has to decide in relation to the transport available in the area whether it is reasonable to exclude those commodities.</P>
    <P>A little further down in the same column, he adds:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1376" /> In areas where there is inadequate transport and where statutory bodies such as C.I.E. do not operate, the Minister has absolute power to decide how many licences he will give in order to provide transport in an area.  He has the power to increase the weight in those circumstances, on his own discretion.  There is no section in the transport legislation which determines how he can increase the weight for persons who receive licences in an area where no public transport is available.  He has the discretion there.  He has the choice of deciding how many licences he can reasonably give.</P>
    <P>That occurs in the debate on this same Bill.  In defence of this Bill, the Minister puts the case that he has absolute discretion in relation to some people.  I cannot really believe the Minister thinks that is a good principle.  I would ask how would a case of special hardship be proved?  What will be the Principle upon which it will be judged?  How will it be judged?  By whom will it be judged?  What redress will the haulier have, if his request is refused?</P>
    <P>The Minister told the Dáil&mdash;I am sure he will repeat it here&mdash;he is confident that his officials will do this and that in every case and so on.  I do not think that is good enough.  I prefer to see it in the Bill.</P>
    <P>If some hauliers are to be kept to an increase of seven cwt., all of them should be.  If someone gets a special concession by pleading a case skilfully with the Minister or his officials, then I think all of them should have a right to that concession.  I suggest that his defence that he can use his absolute discretion in individual cases is a defence of justice that is not evenhanded. He says at columns 1096-97 that the cases, as far as he can judge, have always been fairly dealt with and I quote:</P>
    <P>One can read in the Department literally dozens of files relating to the discretionary powers exercised by the Minister, and see running through them a thread of reasonableness, fairness, equity, commonsense and a human approach.  I do <Col N="1377" /> not believe any Deputy would contradict my statement.</P>
    <P>That is a touching appeal to our faith but I do not think it is a defence of legislation.  I do not think it is a defence of restrictive legislation in relation to some who might not be able to make the human approach or appeal to the commonsense of the official concerned.</P>
    <P>I should like to quote a case of hardship dealt with recently by the Minister. It was the case of Patrick Byrne, a haulier in Carlow, licence number 386, who is a married man with 10 children.  He owned one lorry which he bought in 1946.  He owns four acres of land and has a small shop.  I repeat that he has 10 children.  He pays £25 in tax and the unladen weight of the lorry is 3½ tons, including a diesel and a lift; but for cattle he requires a livestock creel and with a livestock creel and ramp, the unladen weight is brought up to over five tons.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt he made a very human and commonsense approach but he has been refused.  I mention his name because I have permission to do so.  I cannot help noticing what will happen to a person like that.  I suggest that he will sell out and leave the country with his 10 children as the person did the other day whose photograph with 10 beautiful children was in one of our Sunday papers.  He was going off because this country was of no use to him.</P>
    <P>It is all very well for the Minister to say that his discretionary power will be used.  I am informed by an independent source, the National Farmers Association, who gave the details of his case that the local mart requires this man and that C.I.E. cannot in practice&mdash;this is independent testimony&mdash;give the service locally that is required.  Yet he has been turned down.  I suggest that by reason of this, he and other people will be put out of business.</P>
    <P>I suggested at the beginning that the Minister and his predecessor should have been prompt and either put these people right out of business, should have compensated them and <Col N="1378" /> replaced their service with an adequate public service or should have removed all restrictions and let them do what business they can get, but not to do what the result, or even the purpose of this Bill must be, that is, to throttle them slowly.  The Department is, of course, a new one.  I have no doubt it will make its own new traditions, as it were, but it has not been the practice automatically in the past to consult with the licensed hauliers.  I would put it to the Minister&mdash;I think the Minister will agree with me&mdash;that in his agreeing to see deputations and accept representations and so on, he is acting in the spirit of what I am suggesting.  I would put it to him that consultation with the interests involved is an excellent practice for every Minister.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister whether, when they decided upon the seven cwts., the Minister or his Department consulted the people who would be directly affected by it as to whether the seven cwts. was enough or not? Was&mdash;as is the practice in Britain, for instance&mdash;a rough draft of this Bill sent to the Road Hauliers Association? Was a final draft sent?  Was their opinion asked before the Minister and his Department settled upon this quite inadequate seven cwt.?  In other words, it is good practice, whether or not you take the advice given, to consult those involved, those who will be directly affected and those, in fact, who are on the job and find out their opinion at least before making a decision.</P>
    <P>My immediate hope is that this Bill will be amended and that seven cwts. will be changed into a more reasonable figure&mdash;perhaps, one ton or one and a half tons.  My long-term hope is that the Minister will be coming before us soon with a comprehensive State scheme based not on balance sheet profit entries but on a determination to have a comprehensive scheme, not just piecemeal legislation, to satisfy the real transport needs of the people, big and small, in every area, even at an occasional loss to the scheme.  I appeal to the Minister to grasp the nettle, as it were, and to bring <Col N="1379" /> before us a real national transport scheme in which he will be prepared to take over transport entirely, after fair compensation to those people who are now being throttled to death.  I believe this Minister could do that and make a big success of it.</P>

      <P>The scope of the debate is very confined.  Surely I can refer to the Minister's opening statement?  He said that on certain occasions the proposed seven cwts. might be increased.  As we all know, seven cwts. is a very small amount in <Col N="1380" /> relation to creels or crates on a lorry. The first day the creels or crates are put on the lorry, they may weigh only seven cwts. but, after drawing a lorry-load of beet on a few wet days, they would weight nearer to a ton.  The containers or crates or creels become very heavy when they are in use for some time.  This Bill, when enacted, will wipe out the small lorry-owners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>I claim that the proposed figure of seven cwts. per lorry is not sufficient to meet the hardship imposed on licensed carriers.  The amount should be increased to at least 20 to 30 cwts.  This Bill is a retrograde step and will increase the existing financial burdens on licensed hauliers. Furthermore, it does not go far enough towards meeting them.</P>
      <P>The licensed hauliers have had to meet the increase in the cost of living, the increases in the prices of petrol, oil, spare parts and garage services.  Now they must grapple with a new imposition. As reported at column 1060, Volume 178, of the Official Report of Dáil Éireann, the Minister said:</P>
      <P>Hauliers so affected would be unable to continue to use their present lorries and in the absence of an increase in standard lorry weight would either have to replace their lorries with lighter vehicles or operate them without the attachments or additions which might be essential to their business.</P>
      <P>I would remind the House that many of these licensed hauliers are enterprising young farmers' sons and perhaps young garage men who had faith in their country and stayed at home instead of emigrating.  They were prepared to work at home and they showed initiative.  They got a few pounds together and put a deposit on a lorry.  Many of them may not have paid for the lorries yet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>How does the Minister expect, in the light of what he has said in the Dáil, those people to replace their lorries with lighter vehicles?  That might be all right for C.I.E. or for some concern with State backing.  It is impossible for the young man who stayed at home instead of emigrating and who embarked on this business with perhaps <Col N="1381" /> the minimum of capital.  It may sound the death knell of the promising little business of many a licensed road haulier.  If you substitute 20 or 30 cwts., the Bill will go some way towards meeting them.</P>
    <P>The day we pass this Bill may be a red letter day for private enterprise in this country.  We should do all we can to encourage private enterprise.  Instead, we are dealing it a blow from which it may find it hard to recover. We all know that furniture removers and livestock hauliers will be severely hit.  If you raise the amount from seven cwts. to 20 or 30 cwts. you will go some way towards meeting them.  We are about to put a further tax on agricultural production and industrial production.</P>
    <P>In his concluding remarks in the Dáil on this Bill, the Minister said, as reported at Column 1063 of the Official Report, Volume 178:</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, I will be prepared to consider under the provisions of Section 116 of the Transport Act, 1944, any individual case of genuine and deserving hardship which may be brought to my attention.</P>
    <P>It should not be left to this Minister or to any other Minister to do that. The Bill should lay down certain rules and regulations and no individual should have the authority envisaged in this section.  It is altogether wrong.  We know what happened on Achill Island.  Eighteen new licences were issued after a certain political meeting.  It is only natural.  If one man can do it, these things can happen.</P>

      <P>The Minister by now should have come to realise that there are very many experts on transport excepting the people who, from time to time, have been given the job of running public transport because strangely enough these other people do not seem to be able to make it pay. Everybody else, Deputies in the other House and Senators here, apparently know all about it.  What we are dealing with here, however, in this Bill is another concession to licensed hauliers who are a very small group in the community performing generally a good service to the community but who are, I submit, a very privileged group.  Those are the people, or the successors of the people, who in 1933 had their competitors bought out with the taxpayers' money and who since then have been allowed, as the privileged few in the country together with public transport, to carry goods for reward outside the exempted areas.</P>
      <P>This Bill does not deal with lorries generally, lorries owned by farmers, traders, merchants or creameries who do their own carting.  It deals with the lorries owned by these privileged few, the licensed hauliers.  As the Minister and the House may know, this group of licensed hauliers are very well represented; they are a powerful and vocal group who have been successful even in converting Senator Sheehy Skeffington to advocate private enterprise to us here.  That, of course, is quite a miracle and I must compliment the licensed hauliers on what they have achieved.</P>

      <P>The Senator is doing very well with his private enterprise merchants.  I was surprised to hear the Minister telling us about the concessions given since the position was supposedly frozen by legislation in 1933. The majority of those who were then operating lorries for reward had their licence or their right to operate for reward bought out with the taxpayers' money and the remainder, a small few, the licensed hauliers, were frozen to the weight of their lorries at that time.</P>
      <P>The Minister in his speech has given figures which, as far as I could gather, show that the licensed haulier, who had a two-ton weight which was frozen by the legislation in 1933 and whose competitors were bought out, has over the years been so successful in advocating and getting concessions that now his unladen weight can be up to 3 ton 17 cwts.  In this Bill, there is provision for a further concession of seven cwts. to bring the two-ton unladen weight up to 4 tons 4 cwts.  These are not the poor people who are being throttled out of existence, as Senator Sheehy Skeffington fondly imagines.  These are people with a licence which can be sold, and which is very good value, if they do not want to continue operating as licensed hauliers in their area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From what has been said by the Minister I cannot see the need for this extra concession at all because what has been happening is that up to now licensed hauliers and other owners of lorries were obliged, as we understood the legislation passed by the Oireachtas, to tax their vehicles with the equipment on the vehicles; in other words, a livestock lorry, for instance, was expected to be weighed with the creel on it.  But apparently people were able to read flaws in the legislation, strip the lorries down to the boards and have them weighed without any of the equipment.  That was in effect, getting around the legislation and the purpose <Col N="1384" /> of the Resolution adopted in the other House was to safeguard the position. The Minister in his goodness, and no doubt because of the pressure of this fairly strong and competent pressure group, has provided in this Bill a further concession of seven cwts. on the weight which, as I said, was frozen in 1933 and increased by various stages since then.</P>
    <P>I do not know why the House should be asked to give this further concession at all.  Maybe the Minister has come to regret it because he has heard so much nonsense in both Houses about it.  He must think he made a mistake to give any concession at all and should have left the position alone. The Minister's whole argument was in favour of the Oireachtas agreeing to give him discretion to deal with exceptionally hard cases.  That was the sense of his words but then towards the end of his speech he implied that this would be a common increase to all lorries owned by licensed hauliers, that it would be simply a matter of applying and there would be the agreed seven cwts. increase in their licence-operating weight and furthermore that the Minister would be prepared to exercise his power under the 1944 Act to give further increases to people who put a meritorious case to him.</P>
    <P>I do not know where we are going at all in this matter.  It all started in 1933 when there was a freeze and when the competitors of these people were bought out with the taxpayers' money.  These people have in a sense been in a privileged position since then with licences to operate in particular areas or around the whole country in some cases.  These licences can, in fact, be sold and are a very valuable asset. I think the Minister should assure us that the discretion which will be given to him under this legislation will be exercised with discretion, that it will not be an automatic increase to every licensed haulier simply because some of them, or some other people owning lorries, get around the law by stripping their lorries down to the floorboards and get away with taxation.  I hope the Minister will not be persuaded by Senator Sheehy Skeffington to embark on a whole series of transport <Col N="1385" /> legislation as I think what is more needed now than anything else is a period of rest from all the experts so that the public transport organisation can get on with the charter given to it last year to try to put the undertaking on its feet.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>When insisting that we preserve order, the Leas-Chathaoirleach told us that this was a liberalising Bill.  I agree that under the rules of this House it is a liberalising Bill. At the same time, one must consider the kind of liberalising Bill it is.  We can imagine the licensed haulier as a rather hungry horse in a sparse pasture. Outside, on the other side of the road, there is a more luscious pasture. Tonight we are opening a wicket gate and later, through future motor taxation legislation, we shall take the horse out of the sparse pasture and show him the wicket gate to the lush pasture. The trouble is that the gate we are opening tonight is not big enough to let him through&mdash;because the seven cwts. is of no use&mdash;unless the unfortunate horse becomes so thin through hunger that he can get through.  Unfortunately, the horse must die.  Of course, we are not really talking about a horse at all.</P>
      <P>The most desirable situation we could get in regard to haulage would be to have a good fleet of lorries owned by licensed hauliers competing with C.I.E.  If this Bill brought that about, it would be commendable.  The Minister would approve of it and I would approve of it.  But I do not think this Bill will do that.  While I may not discuss forthcoming legislation&mdash;the Financial Resolution in regard to motor taxation&mdash;it is true to say that the Minister, speaking on the Second Stage of the Bill, at column 1059 of the Dáil Debates, said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this Bill is to give effect to the announcement already made in the House that it was proposed to promote legislation to increase the standard lorry weight of licensed hauliers to <Col N="1386" /> ameliorate any hardship which might be caused by the proposed new motor taxation legislation.</P>
    <P>That is the important point.</P>
    <P>Further on, the Minister says he wants to make it quite clear that containers, creels and all those additions for the movement of goods will now be weighed with the lorry when it is being taxed or when it is being weighed for a licensed haulier's plate. Whereas prior to this the licensed haulier was allowed to bring his lorry, in the piquant words of Senator Murphy, &ldquo;stripped to the floorboards&rdquo;, he must now bring it along with all the additions he uses in the course of trade, creels, sides and tanks.  He has been deprived of the right to use these things and not have them counted in the weight of his lorry.  In return, he is getting a general allowance of seven cwts. and, in addition, the frozen section of the Transport Act, 1944, which allows the Minister to deal with a hardship case, may be invoked.</P>
    <P>I want you to envisage the pattern of public transport and the way it is moving.  The first thing I notice is that C.I.E., quite properly, are using cattle containers.  Am I in order in dealing with the trend of public transport?</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamOBuachalla" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>Not the whole problem of public transport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>No, certainly not. Containers are lifted on to the lorry by a crane.  The lorry goes to Dublin and the cattle are driven out on a bank. The container is then removed, dropped in the C.I.E. yard and the lorry takes back ten tons of fertilisers. That is an everyday process&mdash;cattle one way and fertilisers and bag-stuff the other way.  Private hauliers are beginning to do the same.  Prior to this Bill they were allowed to do it.  They could have a set of three or four containers, a crane and a loading bank. They could move cattle to Dublin and take bag-stuff back or <i>vice versa.</i> When this Bill is passed such a container will be completely outside their <Col N="1387" /> ambit because it will weigh from 25 cwt. to 30 cwt.</P>
      <P>At the moment private hauliers are operating largely on the basis of a lorry, the maximum weight of which shall not be more than 2 tons 12 cwt. At present an ordinary commercial ten-ton lorry, with the lightest type of long wheelbase body without sides, will weigh at the very maximum 3 tons 5 cwt.  Therefore, these people are precluded from using the normal sort of lorry used today for the normal sort of remuneration.  They have to complete with people who can use any weight or size of lorry.</P>
      <P>The Minister says that the concessions granted were for the purpose of taking into account such things as creels, bodies and so on.  I would join issue with him on that.  In his opening statement he sought to clarify the position and stated that in future creels would be taken into account whereas they had not been taken into account previously.  But it can be shown that, in many cases, they were taken into account.  For instance, if you had a diesel engine you got 5 cwt.  Was that not given to people who had creels? Other increases were given because the normal weight of the lorries they had to complete with had increased and is increasing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While within the terms of the Rules of Order this is a liberalising measure, as far as the licensed haulier is concerned it is the exact opposite.  It will curtail him in business.  The trend is for ordinary lorry weights to increase. The argument might be used by the Minister that in 1933 these people were entitled to use only a lorry of 2 tons 5 cwt. and there are now in a position to use one of 2 tons 12 cwt. He might say that if they were allowed to use a lorry of 3 tons 10 cwt. or 4 tons, they would have something more valuable than they had in 1933. I contest that.  My point is that, even though the cost of fuel, labour, rubber and vehicles has gone up over the past ten or 20 years, at the same time costs of moving goods have not gone up to anything like the same extent.  The reason is that you now have a much more efficient vehicle.  For instance, you now have people who will move <Col N="1388" /> grain in bulk 30 miles at 15/- per ton. You could not get it done in 1933 for 35/- per ton.</P>

      <P>I hope the Minister will realise I do not wish to cast any aspersions by going back to the Transport Act, 1944.  It is necessary to do so if the Minister tells us that the hardship clause in that Act can be invoked.  The Minister will appreciate I do not intend to cause any acrimony. In discussing it he mentioned furniture vans.  I can see the difficulty with regard to furniture vans and understand the Minister's anxiety to do his best for furniture removers.  I know it will not in any way prejudice their case if I make a comparision.  I use the Minister's words, that furniture removers, in using containers, were acting in good faith and could have got the increases in weight if they had asked for them in 1933.  The Minister is absolutely correct.  It is also correct to say that all over the country there are ordinary hauliers who could have got the whole 26 counties&mdash; indeed, the whole 32 counties are mentioned in legislation&mdash;in 1933, if they had asked for it, for the purpose of ordinary merchandise.  Therefore it is not right to make a hard luck case for one section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Similarly, there is the question of the type of merchandise carried.  In 1933, if a man filled up an application form showing his business and the type of merchandise carried, no examination was made of his business and he was granted permission to carry the same type of merchandise in succeeding years.  I have had experience in regard to some plates.  People came to me about them.  There was a man in the village of Clogherhead, a fishing village, who purchased a plate for the very good reason that he was prepared, at ordinary wages, to be at Clogherhead Pier and to convey fish from <Col N="1389" /> there to the market in Dublin at all hours of the day or night.  There was no public transport concern interested in the business or, if interested, their charges would be prohibitive.</P>
    <P>The person concerned purchased the plate.  The mileage limitation was in order and he would have proceeded with the business but the snag was that the gentleman who owned the plate in 1933 had not included fish in the list of merchandise which he normally carried and the purchaser was precluded from carrying fish.  Therefore, while the Minister's representations that there is a hard luck case in regard to furniture removers are merited, there is a hard luck case to be made for every haulier in the country.</P>
    <P>I dislike legislation which gives the Minister discretion to give somebody a valuable concession which he does not give to anybody else.  It is an onerous duty on any Minister to have to exercise such discretion but there are cases where a Minister has to do it, when there is no other way out.  In this case, it is a clumsy solution and a better solution could have been found. I do not intend to suggest a better solution, except to say that, perhaps, a general increase of the order of 25 cwts, might have solved the problem.  I think 25 cwts. was the figure the Party to which I belong considered equitable. A larger all-round increase, without invoking the hard case section of the Act of 1944, would have been better.</P>
    <P>I do not in any way wish to cast aspersions when I say there is difficulty in deciding what is a hard luck case. There is the consideration of how the case is put, if it is put better by one person than by another.  If it is put by a friend, is the Minister more inclined to believe it than if it is put by a mere acquaintance or by a person whom he does not know?  I agree with certain members of the Opposition who have said that this is a bad section in legislation.</P>
    <P>I do not want to take Senator Murphy up on details but he did mention several times that, in his opinion, licensed hauliers were in a privileged position.  I do not think that any man who carried on a business legitimately <Col N="1390" /> and who was precluded, by legislation, from continuing to do so, except under licence, is a privileged person. I do not think that the State has the right to take away my small business and not compensate me or license me to proceed with it.  In relation to an unemployed man, such a person may be privileged but whatever privilege he may have arises from the fact that he had a business in 1933.  Why should he not be allowed to sell the business? It is illegal to sell a plate.  One can sell a business.  When plates have gone into disuse, the Department have frequently refused to allow the owner of the plate to sell the plate because he had not a business.  In many cases businesses were resurrected so that the Department would allow the person to sell the plate.  The argument with regard to privilege does not hold water.</P>
    <P>Normal practice is being interfered with in this legislation.  The normal practice was that a man could put a tank, creel or sides on the lorry and it was not included in weighing the lorry for licensed haulier plate purposes.  In future it will count.  The seven cwts. is nothing more than a sop.  The industry is daily becoming more efficient. People bring loads of grain to Dublin in containers so constructed that when the grain has been delivered and allowed to run into the hopper, the back of the lorry can come down and allow ten tons of fertilisers, grain or anything else to be loaded and carried on the return journey.  In view of the trend towards the use of tanks, containers and so on, seven cwt. is little more than the figure one would expect in a circus ring.  It is of no practical use.  It curtails the licensed haulier in his business.  This may appear to be liberalism whereas it is the reverse.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOQuigley" hpid="Mr. O'Quigley Mr. O'Quigley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>Frankly, I did not understand very much about the Bill, even after reading the debates in the Dáil, but I do understand a good deal more about the implications of the Bill having listened to the debate in this House.  There is one thing that did strike me about the Bill, reading it in conjunction with the Dáil debates, namely, that certain power is being vested in the Minister for Transport and Power to decide certain <Col N="1391" /> things.  I am assuming that all these things will be perfectly correctly decided by the Minister for Transport and Power.  Equally, I assume that, before the Minister makes any of these decisions, a considerable amount of investigation will be involved for the officials of his Department. That is a necessary preliminary to a proper decision on the part of the Minister under this Bill.</P>
      <P>I have no complaint about that, either, but I want to make an observation on these two aspects of the Bill, that when we are talking about reducing taxation and reducing the cost of administration, we ought to bear in mind that when we introduce legislation which contains provisions of this kind, it is the kind of legislation which increases the cost of administration and, consequently, taxation. When the Legislature passes a Bill of this kind, there should not be the complaint of the high cost of administration.  It will be found in every case that it is the Legislature, by this kind of enactment, that is bringing about the high cost of administration and of Government. When I say the Legislature, of course, that really boils down to the Government, who bring in this kind of measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only other matter to which I want to refer is the statement made by the Minister both in the Dáil and in this House.  I do not know if I understood the Minister correctly, but I took him to say that the maximum increase permitted in respect of creels under this Bill will apply only in respect of creels used for the purpose of hauling livestock.  I have had a considerable amount of experience in the west of Ireland and I know that there is a great deal of use made of creels for hauling turf.  I do not know whether this concession, this liberalisation if I might refer to it as such, will apply in respect of creels used for the hauling of turf.  If not, it would seem to me that it is very proper that it should apply because a great number of people in the west of Ireland&mdash;and I am sure in the other counties where they have turf&mdash;have to employ these licensed hauliers to carry turf for them <Col N="1392" /> and if the effect of this kind of thing is to increase the cost of haulage, then people may very well turn over to buying coal.  That is the kind of thing which is not desirable either from the point of view of the balance of payments or the volume of employment in the Irish countryside.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I had better go through the various observations made in the course of the debate and deal with as many points as I can.  I think most Senators showed that they understood the nature of this measure. Several Senators asked how we estimated 7 cwt. as being a reasonable concession.  That weight is reckoned to be the weight of a creel, which is a fairly large attachment, used in a lorry of 2 tons 15 cwt. unladen weight and this information we got from motor traders.  In the definition of what we were seeking, seven cwt. would be a reasonable increase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Next, I want to deal with the position of the licensed hauliers and to state beyond yea or nay that, of all sections of the community who were perfectly aware that vehicles should be weighed with their attachments, the licenced hauliers were most conspicuous in that respect.  They have been coming to the Department to seek concessions year after year since 1933 and they have consistently and continually sought concessions on these grounds: that lorries were becoming larger, which was a reasonable ground, that there were special attachments which were normally fitted to a great many lorries, such as tipping gear, and the replacement of petrol engines by diesel engines, and that these should be included in the unladen weight. They went so far as to say that they must have substantial increases in certain allowances because they had to weigh their lorries unladen with these additions.  It was made clear beyond all doubt that they were aware of this position and I cannot accept the idea that there is a large number of innocent licensed carriers who were not aware of these facts. In some cases it would have been very little use for the licensed hauliers to come to the Department seeking greater allowances wereit not for the fact that half their pleading was based <Col N="1393" /> on the understanding that they had to weigh their lorries unladen.  I think I should make that position clear so that everybody can understand it.</P>
    <P>Very few Senators seemed to advert to the fact that there have been increases of 40 per cent. in the basic weight allowances for lorries under 4 tons, since 1953, and 22½ per cent. for lorries with a basic weight of over 4 tons, in 1933.  In addition, as I have already indicated there have been special allowances for diesel engines and tipping gear.  If, in fact, you take a lorry which was 2 tons 10 cwt. in 1933 and add to it the basic weight increase, plus the diesel engine allowance, plus the seven cwt. provided for in this Bill, the increase in weight is 70 per cent., which I think is considerable. If you take the lorry which in 1933 was 1 ton 15 cwt. and make the same additions&mdash;the basic weight allowance, the diesel engine allowance and the seven cwt. provided for in this Bill&mdash;the increase is in the neighbourhood of 100 per cent., so that the licensed hauliers have really had very substantial increases.</P>
    <P>Some of the suggestions for increased weight allowances made in the debate would increase their carrying capacity enormously.  Some Senators would add 30 cwt. as the allowance to be provided for in the Bill.  It would increase the carrying capacity of the 900 odd licensed hauliers covered by the Bill by some 40 per cent.  I want to make it clear that I have absolutely no intention whatever of taking away from C.I.E. one pennyworth of the traffic in which they are now engaged, through any measure such as this.</P>
    <P>I was glad to hear one Senator speak on behalf of C.I.E.  Senator Murphy quite obviously was taking the part of C.I.E. in the debate.  I should like to hear a few more people say something in relation to it. C.I.E. is costing the country at the moment some £3,500,000 a year and, as I said in the Dáil, that represents a distribution of taxes to the average consumer, the average individual, of 3d. in the £ on income tax, 4d. on every gallon of diesel oil and 4d. per gallon <Col N="1394" /> on petrol, plus 3d. on every packet of 20 cigarettes.  The Transport Act of 1958 quite clearly laid it down that C.I.E. shall pay its way within five years.  C.I.E. employs a very large number of people and they have a redundancy problem to be faced already.</P>
    <P>I want to make it clear that I do not intend to worsen the position, if it can be avoided, of the licensed hauliers.  While fully realising what the law is, I certainly do not intend to give an increase in carrying capacity of 40 per cent. to the licensed hauliers.  That would be going against the implications of the Transport Act.</P>
    <P>I should say that this Bill is one of a number of Bills related to transport licensing and indeed, here I may quote from the speech which I made in the Dáil Volume 178, column 1231 on the Committee Stage of this Bill.  I quoted there a letter to the Irish Haulage Contractors' Association which was sent from the Minister for Industry and Commerce in October, 1938, and in the course of which he said:</P>
    <P>While protecting the existing road transport businesses, the policy of the Legislature was to preserve to the railway companies the benefit of any expansion in the use of road transport.  The Minister sees no prospect of a departure from this policy.</P>
    <P>Some Senators have suggested that these small hauliers have already been labouring under difficulties.  C.I.E. have to observe trade union regulations and their conditions of employment on a far more precise scale than in the case of licensed hauliers.  Everybody in this House is fully aware of that.  In so far as the licensed hauliers' financial position is concerned, the Central Statistics Office have furnished information as to how they fared since 1953. In 1953, their admitted net receipts were £255,000 and by 1958, they had risen to £387,000, an increase of 51 per cent., a far bigger increase than any decrease in the value of money would account for.  No one can say, therefore, that they have not been able to maintain <Col N="1395" /> and improve their position in the past few years.  Again, there has been no indication that the licensed hauliers were in the majority of cases not guilty of deliberate evasion when they weighed their lorries with all the attachments removed.  I should like again to stress the fact that in consultation with the Department of Industry and Commerce, the position was made more than clear to them.</P>
    <P>Some Senators seemed to suggest that recent legal decisions had definitely declared that lorries could be weighed with the attachments upon them but I think, as the House already knows, two judges disagreed with each other on that matter and there has been no specific legal decision of a positive kind with regard to the interpretation of the law, so far as the payment of taxation is concerned.</P>
    <P>A number of Senators referred to the use of containers.  Use of containers will provide me with some of the perplexing problems that I shall have to face when cases of genuine hardship, deserving cases of hardship due to a misapplication of the law, come before me.  There are some containers which are taken off the lorry empty and put back on the lorry already filled, where there would be a case for action under Section 116 of the 1944 Act.  There may be all sorts of difficult, in-between cases that I may have to consider and, as I said in the Dáil, I cannot be aware of them yet.  Until I see the applications for increases over and about seven cwt., I shall not know what the problem is.  I must wait until I receive the applications.</P>
    <P>It is quite impossible to put the hardship cases into legislative form. Naturally, any Minister desires to escape from having to exercise personal discretion in matters of this kind.  We would all like to put into legislation as much as possible of all the matters relating to the licensing of vehicles or anything else.  As Senators know, it is possible to legislate so that the Minister will have as little discretion as possible but in this case it is quite impossible by legislation to cover all hardship cases particularly when we do not know their nature.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1396" /> I was asked why I did not consult the Licensed Hauliers' Association and other persons in regard to the provisions of this Bill.  The answer is that I wanted to make quite sure that the legislation would be passed before Christmas in order to provide this liberalisation, as Senator Donegan described it.  There was no time for consultation of that kind.</P>
    <P>Senator J.L. O'Sullivan spoke of the increase in the weight of creels as a result of moisture and referred to the beet hauliers in that connection. The increases of weight allowed in 1953, of 25 per cent. in the case of lorries under four tons and of 12½ per cent., in the case of lorries over four tons, were given partly because of observations made to the then Minister that creels became saturated with sand, mud and water and increased in weight.  Increases given then were partly to allow for the factor referred to by Senator O'Sullivan.</P>
    <P>Senator Donegan made a number of observations in regard to the position of lorry-owners who used such containers. The Senator's conception seems to be that of a very heavy lorry. The fact that larger lorries are more economic or that C.I.E. uses them does not entitle licensed hauliers to use them.  Their weights were clearly restricted by law; it was intended that the situation should remain the same as in 1933 and each concession made was made with the Minister at all times wishing to preserve the position of C.I.E. as a transport carrier.  It was never intended that licensed hauliers should automatically get all the increases in weight and all the privileges they might have as a result of modern methods of carriage simply because they existed.  It was quite clearly intended that there should be a restraining attitude in regard to the provision for additional weight&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister would not suggest that hauliers should be entirely related to 1933 and that, in fact, a business which they were licensed to carry on in 1933 would never have expanded or that they would be so completely behind the times as to use the same type and <Col N="1397" /> weight of lorry and operate the same work to-day as they did in 1933? Surely they are entitled to the ordinary expansion that occurred in every business having anything to do with machinery?</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;in regard to the total weight they are entitled to.  I think I have dealt with all the points that have been raised and, as I said, I shall examine every case of hardship that arises and assess whether it is a deserving case.  As I have indicated in the Dáil, the Department has a splendid record of creating in every case a pattern of consistent decisions.  Hardly ever has there been a controversy in the Dáil, hardly any Parliamentary Questions have been asked in this connection down through the years and I can assure the House that whatever we do will be done with a view to equity and consistency.  We shall avoid all distortions in our attitude to the problems that will arise, but they will not be problems easy to solve and we must wait until we get the applications for increases over and above seven cwt. before we know the nature of the problems.  If there should emerge some very difficult problem, if the pattern of transport as we see it then is different from what we imagine at the moment, I may have to come back to the Oireachtas for further legislation, but so far as we can see it at present, this Bill, with the additional seven cwt., should provide relief sufficient to enable hauliers to carry on their business.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>In Subsection (3) of Section 1, line 25, to delete &ldquo;seven hundredweight&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;one ton&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I do not propose to say anything beyond what I have already said in favour of it, but I do stress the point that unless the Minister is prepared to deal comprehensively with this matter, he must deal more generously with these small people.  That is the purpose of my amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I approve of the amendment and think it is a reasonable compromise.  If these people are to carry on their normal business, in normal competition with a public transport concern like C.I.E. which will use the heavier vehicles, the amendment is necessary.  I agree with the Minister they are not entitled to any more but I argue that seven cwt. is too little.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DominickMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I oppose the amendment and, considering what the Minister said in reply to the debate on Second Reading, it is clear anybody proposing an amendment like this is moving against the principle of <Col N="1399" /> organised public transport and the maintenance of C.I.E. as a nationalised organisation, and is advocating that a limited group of licensed hauliers should be put in a position to compete against nationalised transport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not voting against organised public transport.  In the first few sentences of my contribution this evening, I pointed out the healthy position we regarded as desirable was one in which we had a virile licenced hauliers business competing with a virile public transport business, and I felt there was plenty of room for both.  I do not see anything funny in that.  We should not want to see these people wither away for want of sunshine, and without competition, we shall not get desirable results in the public transport business.  I want to see the public transport authority prosper and one of the ways to make it prosper is to give it virile competition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DominickMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Why then limit the competition to 900 licensed hauliers? Would the Senator explain that?  Does he favour a free-for-all in the carriage of merchandise?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I certainly do.  In 1933, it was decided in order that there should be a volume of traffic to justify a public transport authority, only those engaged in hauling would be licensed to proceed with their business.  As long as new businesses are not allowed to come in, you have this small licensed section competing with public transport and I think this amendment is necessary to prevent that small section withering away.</P>

      <P>I should like to make it clear that my purpose in proposing this amendment is to maintain equity, and to ensure justice. I believe the time will come when these people will have to be put out of business and compensated for loss of business on the basis of the present system.  The present basis will be lost if we merely concede seven cwt. and it is to maintain that basis until such time as the Government and C.I.E. <Col N="1400" /> build up enough courage to take over the whole lot that I propose this interim measure so that these people will not be slowly put out of business but will be honourably treated.</P>

      <P>This discussion has confused me.  In view of what Senator O'Donovan said, may I ask if this change from seven cwt. to one ton refers only to creels?  He mentioned a cattle creel being superimposed upon the floor of a lorry and a container subsequently being put on for the transport of carcasses and quarters of beef.  It would mean that for one purpose there is a lorry with a creel to transport live cattle and the reverse, a container containing cattle which can be superimposed upon a platform.  That is news to me.  I thought you could not have a superimposed container for live cattle. What is the purpose of this?  I want to be clear about it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>This was one measure on which I had a very open mind.  I had no direct interest in the Bill and, in fact, took very little interest in it until I read the reports of the Dáil Debates, but, having read them and listened to the discussion in this House, and having heard the Minister's reply, I think there is no case for the amendment.  By adopting this amendment, the House will defeat the whole purpose of the Bill.  Apart from that, I see a much wider and more serious implication.  We are condemning the taxpayers to an unestimated and unpredictable bill of tremendous magnitude so far as the public transport organisation in this country is concerned, and I could not possibly support the amendment.</P>

      <P>The Senator wants to build a house knowing the foundation is not too good.  Knowing it will ultimately fall, he wants it as high as possible before it does fall.  Any merit the amendment may have had has been destroyed by that argument.  If I had been prepared to suggest that the Minister might settle for eight or nine cwt.  I am afraid I could not do that now in view of Senator Sheehy Skeffington's own argument.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>May I just clear up that point in the mind of Senator O'Reilly?  If we anticipate at some future juncture we shall have to pay compensation to the owner of the house, it would be more honourable for us to put the owner in such a position that dry rot will not develop in his house and reduce its value.  These people should be honourably treated and honourably compensated on the basis of what they now possess.  I think it is dishonourable to reduce in value what they now possess, and that is what we are doing by allowing an increase of only seven cwt. instead of a legitimate increase of one ton.</P>

      <P>In regard to this amendment, if we increase the carrying capacity of licensed hauliers by 25 per cent., I do not see how that could enable them to carry on a healthy competition with C.I.E.  It would be giving them a very considerable privilege.  The seven cwt. was meant to assist them.  It it as far as I can go.  The seven cwt. is added to the weight specified in each <Col N="1402" /> haulier's licence and he can make use of the additional weight for any purpose he likes, having regard to the commodities he is licensed to carry and having regard to the area over which his licence extends.  This does not relate to cattle creels specifically. I merely mentioned a cattle creel because I thought it was a rather typical example of an attachment having a weight relevant to this element of liberalisation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator O'Donovan mentioned the type of cattle crate which I was discussing.  Actually the type I mentioned is the creel which is not part of the lorry and which has to be moved by a crane because it is so heavy; it has to be lifted by a crane and placed on the lorry.  The cattle are driven in from a loading bank and, when the cattle reach their destination, they are unloaded and the creel is taken off by another crane.  Presumably the lorry then goes its way with a load of sacks, maybe, or something else.</P>
