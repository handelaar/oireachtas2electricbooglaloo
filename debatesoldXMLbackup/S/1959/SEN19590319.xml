      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>In resuming, I should like briefly to sum up a few points.  First of all, we have the very compelling fact that all the comparable democracies in Western Europe&mdash;comparable with ours in size and, roughly, in population range&mdash;have got some form of P.R. as their method of election. I take Denmark, Holland, Switzerland, Norway and Sweden, to mention but a few.  All of these are highly successful countries with highly successful Governments, with increasing populations and a rising standard of living.  In fact, for years we looked on the achievements of these countries as an example of what we might do.</P>
      <P>We find now that the system of election in those countries is being rejected out of hand here with out any impartial inquiry into how it works, and being substituted by the system we can see working so disastrously in our unfortunate Six Counties across the Border.  That is a most irresponsible approach by the Government to changing our fundamental electoral system.  In those countries I have mentioned, the key-note of government is co-operation; the key-note of the life of those countries is co-operation.  We have heard about the wonderful co-operative movement in Denmark, the wonderful co-operative movements in Holland and in the other countries, and we have seen their spectacular success in providing for the British market.</P>
      <P>In fact, to our regret, we find we are not competing very successfully with them, and I might go further and say that the form of government in those countries&mdash;coalition government&mdash;should more properly be called co-operative government.  That is the type of government we want here-government by co-operation of all the Parties pulling together for the welfare of the country.  Even under the stress of great events, we find that England has been forced to adopt that policy in her major wars, as the only way of getting a co-operative spirit of her people to the task in hand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1618" /> Also, we find this catch-cry of multiplicity of the Parties&mdash;that P.R. brings a multiplicity of Parties.  There could be nothing further from the truth, as seen in these countries which provide the examples, the small countries in Western Europe.  Where is the multiplicity of Parties in those countries?  They have in Denmark, Sweden and Norway the same number as they had at any time.</P>
    <P>As for multiplicity of Parties, could anything be more compelling than the 13 Parties which contested the last election across the border?  Surely, that is multiplicity of Parties, fed by the so-called straight vote system?  Here we reject the system which has worked so well in Western Europe.  It is proposed, in a very irresponsible manner, to substitute here a system which will breed Party and class warfare, which will divide our nation into two groups, the &ldquo;haves&rdquo; and the &ldquo;have-nots&rdquo;.  If that is the foundation on which we approach and tackle our grave economic problems in the future, then I say &ldquo;God help Ireland.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>To sum up, we see the evils which are likely to flow from the introduction of the &ldquo;Belfast system&rdquo; of voting. These are, first, excessive Government majorities, with an Opposition which would be almost as helpless as the Opposition which is at present in the Six Counties.  It has been calculated, and it has not been refuted, that had the last election been conducted under this system, there would be at least 120 to 130 Government Deputies in the House and fewer than 20 Opposition Deputies.  Does anyone suggest for a moment that that would be a desirable system of government?  Not even the Government themselves at present would desire that, as they say this new system will give the best of everything &mdash;a great Government, a great Opposition, a great Labour Party, a great Fine Gael Party, a great Farmers' Party, and so on.  They cannot have it every way.</P>
    <P>Again, this system, with its excessive Government majorities and weak Opposition, is bound to lead to intolerant and arrogant government.  Surely, we have grave reason to fear that, when we see the way in which much of <Col N="1619" /> this debate has been received by members of the Government Benches, where it is taken that the debate and the criticism are wrong.  In fact, we had a statement from Senator Mullins yesterday referring to &ldquo;obstructionist tactics&rdquo;, where in effect we were doing our duty in investigating and debating the matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasMullins" hpid="Tomás Ó Maoláin Tomás Ó Maoláin">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Ó Maoláin</NameTxt>
      <P>It is clear that the Senator did not listen or could not understand my reference to obstructionist tactics.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>Again, we find that such intolerance on the part of the Government would lead further to the division of our country.  It would lead, as I put it, into the division of the &ldquo;haves&rdquo; and the &ldquo;have-nots&rdquo;.  We see that system working badly enough at present in the making of appointments of judges and others; we do not want that intensified and taken further.</P>
      <P>Thirdly, it is agreed by all that the period facing us is a critical period in the life of our nation, where a great effort towards economic expansion is called for, where the very economic independence of our nation is at stake. Will we get that effort by dictatorial Government or by co-operative Government? Will we get it by a Government which is arrogant and which dictates, or will we get it by a Government which gives leadership, consultation and reason?  I suggest that the latter is what the Irish people wish and that it is the only type of Government for us, where we all pull our weight, where we all put our shoulders to the wheel.  That is the only type of government or by co-operative govvival as an independent economic unit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fourthly, the proposed change would mean that the electorate would be deprived of all choice of Party candidates. One of the greatest fallacies introduced during this debate has been the fallacy that the change will give improved candidates.  Nothing could be further from the truth, as shown by what is happening in England and elsewhere.  Here the Party voter would be faced by one candidate only, put up by the Party in the constituency. What is the voter to do?  Is he to vote for that candidate or desert the <Col N="1620" /> Party?  That will be the choice; there will be no other.  As it is at present, in Cork City alone, anyone wishing to vote for Fianna Fáil there had a choice at the last election of four candidates; anyone wishing to vote for Fine Gael had a choice of three candidates; anyone wishing to vote Labour had a choice of two.  Does anyone suggest that that is not a better system, a system giving more responsibility to the voter, than the system of simply putting X before the candidate given to him by his Party?  It is no wonder that under such a system over half the seats in the Six Counties were uncontested in the last election.  Is it there we are facing?  If it is, let us be fair about it and let the spokesmen for the Bill not claim that this change will give better candidates.</P>
    <P>Under the proposed system, it will be far more important that the candidate should acquiesce and keep to the Party line, rather than that he should show ability or be capable of making valuable contributions in Parliament. We have seen that only too recently in the case of Mr. Montgomery Hyde across the Border.  Would that happen here under our present system?  Clearly, it would not.  If the man were rejected by his Party, he could go forward as an Independent or as an independent member of the Party.  In fact, on a few occasions we have had independent Party members going forward.  We had, for instance, Mr. Maguire in Sligo-Leitrim. The system, therefore, gives to Party members an independence which is denied under the so-called single-vote system.  Again, you have the case of Mr. Warnock in the North and of Mr. Nicholson in Britain, to mention but two.</P>
    <P>If, as a result of the next election, we get a Government with a very large majority and a weak Opposition we shall ultimately find ourselves with an arrogant and dictatorial Government imposing harsh laws, without having either the co-operation or the understanding of the people.  If we reach that position, surely then we are preparing the ground for the ensuing election in which there is bound to emerge a <Col N="1621" /> reaction on the part of the people.  A Left Wing Party will rise.  That Party will have the opportunity of sizing up the situation and laying the plan of campaign to gain power.  There is no secret about the methods used to gain power in such circumstances.  All a Party has to do is appeal to a section of the voters, a section greater than 50 per cent. of the voters.</P>
    <P>In this country there is only one line of cleavage at the moment.  That is the cleavage between town and country, between the rural voter and the urban voter.  That is the line that any Radical Party will strive to exploit because a rising Radical Party will preach class warfare and will appeal in such a way to the electorate as to arouse class instincts.  If rural Ireland remains sound, then that Party will appeal to the urban voter.  It will brand the farmers as the culprits, as the people who have let the country down, the people who have not played their part.  It will preach the hair-shirt policy for the farmers and it will preach the doctrine of compelling farmers to sell their produce at a price in the cities and towns.</P>
    <P>That is the kind of propaganda that will appeal to the misled and underprivileged sections in the cities and towns.  Such a Party need gain only 40 per cent. of the votes in city constituencies in the second or third election after this in order to gain control. When that day comes Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael will still be fighting each other and the Radicals can rely on them to split the other 60 per cent. of the vote leaving the Radical Party to romp home with 40 per cent.  That will give a Government with a majority in Dáil Éireann, a Government which will hold it has a mandate from the people, whereas, in fact, at best, it will have only 40 per cent. of the votes or 60 per cent. of the constituencies.  It will have, in fact, about a quarter of the total vote.</P>
    <P>That is the stage the Government are setting by their proposal.  If a Party is prepared to exploit class welfare, knowing how that has been used in other countries, then by commanding 40 per cent. of the urban vote, or a quarter of the total vote in the country, <Col N="1622" /> it can impose its will on the people and claim that it has a mandate from the people to do so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasMullins" hpid="Tomás Ó Maoláin Tomás Ó Maoláin">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Ó Maoláin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator is talking about P.R.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>Under P.R. such usurpation of power could not possibly take place because, even though one may reduce the proportionality of the system, as we have done here with our three seat constituencies, the basic fact remains that a Government must get at least 46 per cent., 47 per cent. or 48 per cent. of the vote.  Consequently, no Government can afford to antagonise either the rural or the urban section of our community. Neither Fianna Fáil nor Fine Gael have ever sought to antagonise sections. That is a good thing.  A balanced policy between the two has had to be preserved.  If this proposal is adopted, the floodgates will be opened.  The stage will be set for any Party ruthless enough to exploit class warfare and impose its will on the people, having got something in the region of 25 per cent. of the votes. That is the greatest condemnation we can offer of the proposed change.</P>
      <P>Surely, this should not be described as the &ldquo;straight&rdquo; vote.  Surely this is not democracy.  It is not democracy as it operates in the Six Counties. Neither will it be democracy as it is proposed to operate it here.  Calling it the &ldquo;straight&rdquo; vote is a misuse of words.  I have gone through the <i>Encyclopaedia Britannica</i> and through a number of books dealing with electoral systems.  In none have I found a system called the &ldquo;straight&rdquo; vote. The usual term used for such a system is the plurality system, the majority system or, as it is called in England very often, the &ldquo;first-past-the-post&rdquo; system.  These are correct terms.  It is somewhat sinister to discover here that no commission has been appointed to investigate and hold an impartial inquiry into the system of voting and, at the same time, a deliberately misleading epithet has been used to describe the system&mdash;a term which implies that what is being done is fair and impartial and not something intended to mislead the electorate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1623" /> I would appeal for the withdrawal of this incorrect classification.  Let the Government face up to the implications of the term they are using.  Let them call it the plurality system, or any other system; it is not the &ldquo;straight&rdquo; vote.  Let the Government be specific and designate it correctly as the &ldquo;Belfast&rdquo; system.  That describes it exactly. I commend that description to all Parties.  I commend it to the people and I appeal to the people not to permit their liberties to be filched away from them by this ill-considered effort to impose on them a system which has operated with such disastrous results in the North.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DominickMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>We are dealing now with the Report and Final Stages of this Bill.  Many Senators are anxious to speak and I shall, therefore, be as brief as I possibly can.  I join with Senator Hayes in complimenting the Minister on his approach to this matter.  He had both the courtesy and the good sense to put forward arguments as to why the sections should be put back into the Bill.  The fact that this debate has been more orderly than it was last week is, I think, due in large measure to the good example given by the Minister in his remarks on the Report Stage of the Bill.  I think I should attempt to deal with the arguments put forward by the Minister in proposing these amendments.  He said the problems facing us necessitate forthright and bold decisions by the Government of the day and that the system most likely to give such a Government would be the system of election proposed as an alternative to our present P.R. system.  I think we should, first of all, look at our present system and see if in fact it has failed to give us adequate Governments with sufficient strength to take necessary decisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The P.R. system of election has been in existence since the foundation of the State.  It is as old and as Irish as it could possibly be.  It has been in existence here 37 years&mdash;a comparatively short space of time&mdash;but, from the foundation of the State, it has been the system of election.  Do we find it has produced results where the <Col N="1624" /> Dáil has been made unable to elect a Taoiseach, where the Taoiseach has been unable to get a Government accepted by the Dáil; in other words, where there has been deadlock and stalemate?  That has not been the case.</P>
    <P>We cannot point to any instance where the Dáil has not been able to elect a Taoiseach and where the Taoiseach has been unable to get a Government acceptable to a majority in the Dáil.  Do we find that the P.R. system leads to coalition, as is now suggested by Fianna Fáil?  Over the past 37 years, as far as I know, we have had an inter-Party Government which Fianna Fáil labelled &ldquo;Coalition&rdquo; for six years.  For the other 31 years of the 37, there has been a one-Party Government with sufficient majority.  Granted they have run into difficulties on occasions.  They have had to appeal to the electorate.  What is wrong with that?  They have had their troubles and have had to go back to the electorate at various times. The result has been that P.R. can be shown to have worked here since the foundation of this State.  It has enabled Governments to operate and for only six of the 37 years has there been a Government composed of a group of Parties rather than one single Party.</P>
    <P>The second argument the Minister used was that P.R. tended to lead to a multiplicity of Parties.  Where is the multiplicity of Parties in the Dáil at the present time?  I think there probably has been a tendency to reduce the number of Parties under the P.R. system than the opposite. The Dáil at the moment is composed of Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael, Labour and I suppose you could say Clann na Talmhan&mdash;four Parties.  There are other Independents but it is admitted that under any system of election you will tend to have Independents.  Those four Parties, what one would call main Parties, are supposed to be a multiplicity of Parties&mdash;two main Parties and two similar Parties&mdash;in the Dáil at the present time.  Whether they are big or small, whether they are numerous or few, they are there because they have got sufficient support from the people.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1625" /> The Minister went on to refer to minorities.  He said the only minorities mentioned were religious minorities.  I do not think he was quite fair to himself in that respect.  The Seanad Reports show quite clearly that more than religious minorities were mentioned in the debates here.  I must come back to the point I made on the Second Stage of this Bill that there is a minority Party in the Dáil at the moment.  There are a few but the one I am particularly interested in is the Labour Party.  It is a minority Party in the sense that it has not anything like the support of Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael.</P>
    <P>I believe the minority of the electorate who support the Labour Party have the right to representation.  They have had that right since the State was instituted. I must again advance the argument that no majority has a right to take away the rights of the minority. If 51 per cent. of the electorate in this referendum, or 52 per cent., or 60 per cent., decide to take away the rights of representation from a minority, that is no more just than if it were 80 per cent., 90 per cent. or any other percentage. It still is wrong to take away the rights of minorities.  They have been written into the Constitution. Indeed, it can be said that the whole Constitution is built on the framework of P.R. and the rights of minorities.  It is quite wrong and an injustice to attempt to deprive those minorities of their rights of representation in Dáil Éireann.</P>
    <P>Let me bring the argument nearer home to the Minister.  He was elected in Cork City.  There, in Cork City, as I pointed out before, you have three Fianna Fáil Deputies, one Fine Gael Deputy and one Labour Deputy.  Of the first preference votes cast in the last general election in Cork City Fianna Fáil got 21,000-odd, Fine Gael got 11,000 and Labour got 6,000-odd.  The result is a fair and proportional result. It has meant that you have three Fianna Fáil Deputies representing Cork City, one Fine Gael Deputy and one Labour Deputy.  Does anybody think it right that the system should be changed with the result that the 6,000 <Col N="1626" /> voters in Cork, the 6,000 Labour supporters, should be deprived of representation in Dáil Éireann and that instead of three Fianna Fáil Deputies one Fine Gael Deputy and one Labour Deputy in Dáil Éireann representing Cork City you should have five Fianna Fáil Deputies?  That is what the Government propose and that is what they are aiming for.  I still say that is not right or just.</P>
    <P>There are other minority Parties, minority groups&mdash;Clann na Talmhan and Sinn Féin, even though that latter Party is not represented in Dáil Éireann.  These are minorities.  Under our present system of election, these are entitled, if they get sufficient support from the electorate, to have their people representing them in Dáil Éireann.  I agree and accept that if the working of that system meant that government was impossible or resulted in the rights of the majority being interfered with, it would be just to rearrange the system so as to prevent that from happening.  In fact, as I have shown, P.R. has enabled government to take place and to continue in the State since its foundation.  It has worked in the Republic of Ireland.</P>
    <P>The Minister went on to say&mdash;here he joins me in my abysmal innocence, as the Leader of the House put it&mdash; that the main streams of political division in this country were largely based on the Treaty.  When I used that argument, Senator Mullins corrected me and produced a mass of figures to show the support which he alleged the Republican Party obtained in 1922 and how that support has varied since. I accept his figures as being correct, but there is a very unfortunate inference from those figures.  I shall not attempt to develop that point, but I do say that it is a shocking thing that we have had these troubles if, as Senator Mullins says, the support was so small at that time.</P>
    <P>No matter that what Senator Mullins may say, the tendency in families which took one side or the other in the Civil War is to continue to take the side of Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael as year follows year.  The Minister said that that tendency is dying out, that people are forgetting that clear-cut <Col N="1627" /> division&mdash;those may not be his exact words&mdash;and that new groups can emerge under P.R. which can secure representation in government.  What is so terrible about that?  It should be the wish of all, if we are really sincere in desiring that the divisions of the Civil War should be forgotten, that the main Parties should not continue to be divided on the historic basis of the Civil War, that new groups should emerge and that Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael should forget their old division and unite for the good of the country.</P>
    <P>I should like to see that happening, not alone for the good of the country, but because it would be for the good of the Labour Party.  Ever since the Civil War, the Labour Party has been between the two main forces.  It is to the credit of the Labour Party that it has been able to preserve its independence, that it was able to form an Opposition in Dáil Éireann immediately after the Civil War, that it was able to maintain parliamentary government so that Fianna Fáil, in their own good time, could enter the Dáil and eventually become the Government.</P>
    <P>Let us at some stage in our development get away from that historic division. If, as the Minister says, P.R. can result in those divisions being forgotten, in new groups emerging, that is a very good argument for the retention of P.R. in our Constitution as the system of election to Dáil Éireann.</P>

      <P>All that could be said on this stage has been said on Second Reading and repeated on Committee Stage.  In re-inserting this section, we are restoring the <i>status quo.</i>  This Section 2 is of the very essence of the Bill.  It enshrines the principle of the Bill which was accepted by the Seanad on Second Reading.  The Opposition can be charged with inconsistency, if having passed the Second Reading, they then try to tear to pieces the Bill as passed on Second Reading.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Quinlan suggests that under the straight vote system, a candidate must be accepted and that no other candidate can present himself for election. I think that is a correct interpretation of what the Senator said.  What <Col N="1628" /> is to prevent a person who thinks he has sufficient support in a constituency from presenting himself for election? The Senator referred to the case of Mr. Montgomery Hyde in Northern Ireland and suggested that what has happened in that case would not happen under the system of P.R.  Does Senator Quinlan not know very well that Mr. Hyde has offered himself as a candidate, in spite of the fact that he has been rejected by his Party?  What is there to prevent any person who has been rejected by his Party from going forward as an Independent supporting that Party or as an absolute Independent? There is nothing in the straight vote system to prevent him from going forward for election or to prevent him from being elected, except the voice of the people.  Senator Quinlan knows that very well.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinlan has referred to the Belfast system.  Last week, it was referred to as the British system.  It is not referred to as the American system.  That would not do.  It is more useful to call it the Belfast system.  The fact has not been mentioned that, in spite of the gerrymandering that has taken place in the Six Counties, a large number of people who are entirely opposed to the Government there have been elected from time to time and continue to be elected.  They are not being wiped out, in spite of all the gerrymandering that has taken place there.  The catchcry is used that all others will be wiped out here, except Fianna Fáil.  Surely Senator Quinlan or anyone else who makes that allegation does not anticipate that there will be the same system of gerrymandering here as there has been in the North?</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that a better type of representative will not be obtained under the straight vote system.  I maintain that there certainly will.  When, under the proposed new system, a candidate is elected by a small constituency as the sole representative for that constituency, the people will very soon evaluate his worth and in a following election, it is they who will select and elect the candidate.  It is the people <Col N="1629" /> who will decide whether that candidate is good enough or whether he should be rejected for a better man. There is nothing wrong in asking the people for their verdict, in asking them to select and elect the man who, they think, is the best representative for their area.</P>

      <P>I agree with Senator Murphy that the tone of the debate on the Report Stage of this Bill has greatly improved.  I was horrified by the behaviour of the Minister for External Affairs here on the Committee Stage of the Bill. Beyond that I shall not go, but I do think the Minister for External Affairs did not help towards a dispassionate and constructive debate on the Bill.  Indeed, it struck me that if the current rumours are correct that the Taoiseach's cloak is to fall upon the Minister for External Affairs, it would indeed be a very bad day for the Government and the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Education was obviously in a chastened mood yesterday afternoon when he was addressing the House on these amendments. He felt that there was not much point in saying anything; that the people were not open to persuasion.  It was a pitiable condition in which to find a Minister of the Fianna Fáil Government, that he really did not feel like saying anything, but that he had to say it.  It is something of a change. Indeed, it may merely be a prelude to a change in the country when they come to bring this referendum to the people.  They may find that when they have talked to the people, they will be just as dispirited and dejected as the Minister for Education was yesterday evening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A curious line of argument that has been introduced in the debate on this stage of the Bill by the speakers on the Government Bench is that people who are in opposition to them are all conspiring, are all in a huddle, to bring about the defeat of this measure.  I am glad to know that that is not so, but the idea that the unity of thought among Parties and the Independents here suggests there has been some such conspiracy is the <Col N="1630" /> type of thing with which, perhaps, Fianna Fáil members would be more familiar than people on this side of the House.</P>
    <P>The same theme was taken up by Senator Mullins when he referred to certain statements published in the <i>Irish Independent</i> which had been made by me at some meetings prior to the Second Stage.  At column 288 of the Official Report, Senator Mullins was moved to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I was interested, again, in Senator O'Quigley and, remarkably so, in the leading article of the Fine Gael daily newspaper which, in almost the same words, had the same idea.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Then he went on to quote it.  Then he continued:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;And this Fine Gael daily organ, a few days later, came out in almost the same words&mdash;Senator O'Quigley must have inspired them or they him; I do not know which&mdash;with the same proposition.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The idea apparently is that because this leader writer, whoever he is, and I seem to have the same idea, there must be some kind of conspiracy.  It does not occur to him or the members of Fianna Fáil that people thinking independently on a problem can have the same views.  They apparently have experience only of people having the same view when it has been laid down for them from the top.</P>
    <P>I was extremely interest and amused to read in no less a paper than the <i>Irish Press</i> some extracts from the Pastoral of His Eminence Cardinal D'Alton which deals with the Ecumenical Council.  The Cardinal was talking about the purposes of the Ecumenical Council, and dealing with the history of the schism out of which the Ecumenical Council arises.  Among other things he referred to the principle of <i>cujus regio eius religio</i> in the Peace Treaty of Westphalia.  On the Second Reading, I had pointed to the impossibility of people being moulded into the strait-jacket of two Parties; that there were already Parties in this country and that these Parties represented the amalgamation of the views <Col N="1631" /> of different sections of the community and that history should teach Fianna Fáil that you cannot compel the people to form themselves into two <i>blocs.</i>  History was all against it.  I cited, as one of the things in history, the failure of the Peace Treaty of Westphalia and the principle of <i>cujus regio eius religio.</i>  I wonder whether Senator Mullins thinks that Cardinal D'Alton and I were in a huddle on this aspect of history?</P>
    <P>Yesterday the Minister for Education came along with what has now apparently become a scientific principle among Fianna Fáil speakers&mdash; that P.R. leads to a multiplicity of Parties; that a multiplicity of Parties leads to coalitions; and that coalitions leads to instability of government. The Taoiseach was on the same subject many times both in the Dáil and in the Seanad and spoke about the political issues which divided this country when P.R. was first introduced.  He is reported at column 254, Volume 50, of the Seanad Debates as saying:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We all know there were issues here which divided the country into two major Parties.  As long as that was so and there was no public support of any kind for the smaller Parties, they found it very difficult to operate and had not operated to any extent.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I shall not deal with that.  At the moment, we have about the same number of Parties as we had since 1923.  In spite of the big political issues which divided the people in 1922 and from then onwards, some people in this country thought that political Parties based solely upon political division were not good enough.  From a very early stage, we had smaller Parties and we have not really got any more effective smaller Parties at the present time than we had in 1922 and 1923.</P>
    <P>In the 1923 election&mdash;and I am relying for my figures on the figures given in the book by Dr. Ross, <i>The Irish Election System</i>&mdash;there were four major Parties&mdash;Republican, Cumann na nGaedheal, Labour, Farmers and minor Parties.  In 1927, there were five Parties and this, mind you, at a time when there were supposed <Col N="1632" /> to be big political divisions which resulted in fair stability of government and the P.R. system worked.  We had as many Parties in 1927 contesting the election as we have at the present time.  We had Fianna Fáil, Cumann na nGaedheal, Farmers, National League and minor Parties, who got seven out of the 152 seats. In the second election in 1927, there were again five major Parties and a number of minor Parties who, between them, got only one seat.  In 1932, we had Fianna Fáil, Cumann na nGaedheal, Labour, Farmers and minor Parties who got no seat.  In 1933, we had still four Parties, Fianna Fáil, Cumann na nGaedheal, Labour and the Centre Party who had 11 seats, Labour having nine.  In 1937, we had four Parties&mdash;Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael, Labour and Farmers.  In 1938, we had the same situation.  In 1943, we had five Parties&mdash;Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael, Labour, Farmers and Clann na Talmhan.  To come up to the present time, in 1957, we had Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael, Labour, two Independent Farmers, Clann na Talmhan, and Clann na Poblachta&mdash; with one seat&mdash;which may not be regarded as a Party, so that in reality you have about the same numbers of Parties now as you had in 1923. Therefore, it is not true to say that as long as there were big issues dividing the country, there were no small Parties.  In fact, there were many small Parties, and small Parties apparently will persist in this country because the people want them.</P>
    <P>The extraordinary thing about it is that with all that experience, and with the knowledge that these different Parties were presenting themselves for election at all elections from 1923 to 1937, the Taoiseach, at that stage, did not seem to think that P.R. was such a bad thing and did not leave the Constitution in such a way as would enable P.R. to be dealt with to meet changing circumstances.  More extraordinary still&mdash;and we have pointed this out before, but it is necessary to repeat it&mdash; is that from 1937 to the present time, with the exception of Deputy MacEntee as Minister for Local Government in 1947, and the Taoiseach at election times and for a particular <Col N="1633" /> purpose, not a single member of the Fianna Fáil Party, or any political theorist in this country, saw that there was anything wrong with the P.R. system.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Health has as great facility for unearthing all kinds of quotations about all classes of people. He would have made a great researcher into history or a great biographer but he has not been able, with the one exception of the quotation from his speech on the Constituencies Bill in 1947, to produce another quotation from himself, or from any other Fianna Fáil speaker, in the same vein.  It is very little wonder, at this stage, that people should ask themselves why it is sought to introduce the single member constituency and to abolish P.R.  One thing we can be certain of at the present time, and one thing that is a legal fact, is that the Constitution, the law, at the moment provides for P.R. and for the multi-member constituency, and that represents the will of the people until it is changed.</P>
    <P>That cannot be controverted and, what is more, the people have given, as recently as 1954, expression to their will in the election results of that year. They had the experience of 1948 and from 1948 until 1954, a period of six years, they had continuous condemnation of Coalition Governments by every member of Fianna Fáil in the Dáil and in the Seanad, at Party meetings all over the country, and in daily issues of the <i>Irish Press.</i>  There was a continuous condemnation of the so-called, supposed evils of Coalition Governments and, in 1954, the people were sternly warned by the Taoiseach of the gloom and disaster that would follow if Fianna Fáil were not returned with an over-all majority.  In spite of that intensive and well-organised propaganda over a period of six years, and in spite of the warnings issued to them by Fianna Fáil speakers at all elections, the people decided in 1954 that Coalition Government was the form of Government which they wanted.  They voted for it and they got it.  I do not know what could be a clearer indication of the will of the people than what is contained in the Constitution, <Col N="1634" /> and in what I might call the latest ratification of the Constitution in the 1954 election.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach speaking at Mullingar, as reported in the <i>Irish Press</i> of Monday last, 16th March, stated that &ldquo;the straight vote system made for unity and a coming together. The P.R. system made for disunity and dispersion&rdquo;.  I want to weigh these words against what he had to say on Second Reading of the Bill.  Having referred to the divisions which kept people apart, in column 254, of Volume 50, he went on to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is different when the aims and objects which divided the major Parties are no longer there.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In other words, P.R. has produced what he says the straight vote system produces, unity and a coming together.  It is there already.  What the Taoiseach wishes to do is to create disunity and dispersion by introducing the straight vote system.  He then continued:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;One of the reasons we did not have the evils stemming from P.R. which were to be seen in other countries was that the divisions were so sharp that they prevented the development of small Parties, which leads to Coalition Governments.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Again, the war kept us fairly well together, but immediately after the war we were obviously entering into a new phase in which the antagonisms&mdash;I do not like to call them that, but I may as well use the word here&mdash;which divided us into two main Parties were disappearing.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach is right that the old antagonisms of 1922 are not still there to keep the people apart so that he and his Party can be identified as the great republicans and the rest as substandard republicans.  He added:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;When these disappeared, you were going to have, as a normal feature, the growth of a lot of artificially-created Parties, splinter Parties, and so on.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We have Senator Lahiffe saying that the people will judge.  The people know what they want and, if the people know what they want, the <Col N="1635" /> people are intelligent and, of course, they will not support the artificial or splinter Parties which the Taoiseach says P.R. leads to.  If the Taoiseach is really sincere in saying that the people are intelligent, then intelligent people will not be voting for Parties which will make organised government quite impossible, but it seems to me that the Taoiseach, in spite of all his professions of regard for the intelligence of the people, has not got the regard which he says he has.</P>
    <P>The debate on this Bill has been characterised by one thing more than another, by the sweeping assertions made by members of Fianna Fáil of what they say are facts but which upon investigation and upon being challenged, do not stand up to investigation. We had the Minister for External Affairs stating that there are three countries in Europe where the whole country is turned into one constituency for the purpose of P.R.  I have asked the Minister for External Affairs, and have asked the Minister for Education to-day through you, a Chathaoirligh, which are the three countries in Western Europe that conduct their elections under P.R. on the basis that each country is a whole constituency.  I do not know which countries they are and I should like to be informed.  If that is the kind of &ldquo;factual&rdquo; information that Fianna Fáil speakers will give the people when they begin to talk upon this referendum, I can well see the need for Senator Quinlan's plea for a commission that would, at least, establish and set beyond dispute the facts relevant to P.R. in this country, and in the other countries where it is operated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid I may not have the words here but I have no doubt at all in my mind, as I have read it several times, that the Minister made the statement, and I shall find it later.  Perhaps some other speaker <Col N="1636" /> will mention it, if that will meet the wishes of the Seanad, but the Senator may rest assured the Minister made the statement.</P>
      <P>We have had criticism of the Danish, the Dutch and Finnish Governments but there are many people who, as Senator Quinlan has said, would wish that our economy was as buoyant and our people as well off materially as the people who live in those countries.  We know the single member constituency system has operated in Britain.  Yesterday the Minister for Education quoted that authoritative journal, <i>Time,</i> on Coalition Governments in a number of countries but I want to commend to the Minister the issue of <i>The Economist</i> of 29th January this year where he will find that journal is entirely dissatisfied with the position under the single member constituency system, and where it is stated that five-sixths of the seats are safe seats and that generally a large proportion of them are uncontested.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We also know from quotations read by Senator Quinlan from a review in last Sunday's <i>Sunday Times</i> that there is a large body of opinion in Britain which is becoming concerned about the abuses which the single member constituency is leading to in Britain.  It is quite useless for Senator Lahiffe to say that if a person is a member of a political Party and is not put forward for election under the new system he can always go up as an Independent.  They have had that option in Britain and a case occurred recently in Southend where one candidate put up was a son of a former holder of the seat. Another person was minded to stand for the constituency and the local Party wanted him to stand but headquarters, the Party bosses about whom we have been talking, would not sanction the man the local people wanted.  The local people then had the option of supporting the person nominated by the Party bosses or putting up their own local man.  If they did that, what would happen was perfectly clear.  The seat would have gone to neither of them but to the Labour Party.  That situation <Col N="1637" /> would arise here in a constituency where, say, Fianna Fáil had a candidate, a sitting member, who wished to offer himself for election.  If the local people wanted him and headquarters wanted to nominate somebody else, all the supporters of Fianna Fáil would want to support the Party and because of their allegiance to it they would not feel like overriding the wishes of the Party bosses.  If they did, it would mean that the Party would be injured and that neither the Party bosses' nominee nor the local nominee would be elected.</P>
    <P>That is the practical difficulty that arises in the single member constituency. Senator Lahiffe must be extremely untutored in Party political matters if he does not realise that this situation will be created and that in effect it means under the system proposed in this Bill a candidate can be foisted on a constituency whom the constituency does not want.  That is one the abuses which can arise from the single member constituency, one which has occurred in Britain and which has given rise to increasing anxiety among thinking people there. We are now being asked to adopt a system that is not working out so well in Britain and we may find ourselves in the ironic situation, as has happened in other instances, that in 20 years or less Britain will have gone over to the single member constituency with the transferable vote or some form of P.R. and we will have the British system enshrined in our Constitution and we will be quite unable to get rid of it.</P>
    <P>There seems to be a fundamental difference between the Fianna Fáil Party and the rest of the country on the purpose of the Dáil.  I have always understood that elections were for the purpose of electing members to the Dáil, and that the purpose of the Dáil was that it should represent the people and be the master of the Government. Apparently that is not the view of the Taoiseach or of the Fianna Fáil Party. The Taoiseach as reported at column 871 of the Seanad Debates, Volume 50, said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Now, let us go from Parliament to Government.  It is true that the Dáil is the father, so to speak, of the <Col N="1638" /> Government.  It creates the Government; it brings it into being by nominating the Taoiseach and by supporting by its consent the Government which is chosen by him. Which is first?  In order of time, undoubtedly, the Parliament comes first, but the fact is that once the Government is selected, the Government is the main-spring of action; every member of the Government is engaged whole-time on the job of endeavouring to get action taken in the public interest.  It is the main-spring of political action in the Parliament. It prepares the programmes within the general programme of the Party to which it belongs and which has been accepted by the country and by virtue of which they get into office.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Therefore, when we talk of Parliament and try to put it in contrast with Government, we must admit that, in the end, it is the Government that counts most.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I do not at all agree with that nor do the people of the country agree with it because that is not what is in the Constitution.  The Constitution provides, in Article 28, that the Government shall be answerable to the Dáil and if somebody is answerable to me that means I am the master.  They are responsible to me and I am the boss.  Our system of parliamentary institutions and the whole system of government is so constructed that no organ of government can ever become too strong.  The Government are kept in check by the Dáil and are answerable to the Dáil from day to day, in their annual Estimates and in regard to all their legislation.  The Dáil is kept in check by the Constitution and the courts which are under obligation to see that the Constitution is upheld and that none of its provisions is transgressed.</P>
    <P>Under the straight vote system I do not understand how, if you have a Government with an overwhelming majority in the Dáil, much bigger than it is at present, it can be said that the Government are answerable to the Dáil.  That, apparently, is not what the Fianna Fáil Party think should be the position.  The Fianna Fáil Party want <Col N="1639" /> the Government to discuss its programmers, not in the Dáil or subject to the approval of the Dáil, but in the Party rooms.  We have heard that stated here, that the Government should get agreement from its supporters in the Dáil to the proposals which it intends to enact as legislation or execute as Government schemes, that then it should come into the Dáil and that the Dáil should be merely a rubber stamp which would cloth its actions with the appropriate legal authority.  If that is the conception of parliamentary democracy which Fianna Fáil have, it is not the conception which is embodied in the framework of our Constitution.  If we reach the stage where we have one Party with a preponderance of support in the Dáil, then the Government are answerable only to themselves.  The Party will do whatever the Government tell them, and being answerable to the Party is only putting a gloss on what, in effect, will be dictatorship by the Government. We have had reference to the experience of elections in countries where there is only a single Party.  If Fianna Fáil fare as well as they expect under this new system they want to impose on the country, in my opinion, there will be very little difference between the kind of control exercised in Dáil Éireann and the kind of control in countries like Hungary, Roumania, Czechoslovakia and Russia.</P>

      <P>We are being asked here to-day to reverse our decision of the other day and to re-insert the two clauses, one prescribing single seat constituencies and the other prescribing the single non-transferable vote.  We, in our wisdom, decided to remove those two, and we are now being asked to change our minds and put them back in again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Listening to the Minister for Education yesterday, I was suddenly filled with a wild surmise because I heard him say&mdash;not with very great hope, but still he did express the hope&mdash;that some of us at least in the Seanad might be open to persuasion in this matter.  As I say, he did not appear very optimistic, but he expressed the wish, at any rate, that we should be open to persuasion.  It <Col N="1640" /> occurred to me that he would not say that, unless he himself were open to persuasion.  He would hardly come in here and tell us that we were worthy of reproach because we had already made up our minds, if he himself were in the same position.  My wild surmise therefore is that he must still be open to persuasion.</P>
    <P>I think that is very gratifying and I should like to picture our persuading him here&mdash;perhaps we have already done so and possibly he has changed his mind&mdash;because he has here to-day the power and authority to withdraw these two amendments to re-insert the clauses.  We know that political Parties are entirely democratic, and once they give power like that to a Minister, he would not in any way incur reproach.  I can imagine the scene at the Cabinet meeting.  The Minister goes back and says: &ldquo;I was persuaded by the Seanad.  Their reasons were so good and cogent, and I was as open to persuasion as any of them were.  So I changed my mind, and said I felt that we should withdraw these amendments, and so I withdrew them.&rdquo;  I can imagine the Taoiseach putting his hand on the Minister's shoulder and saying: &ldquo;My boy, you did well, and acted in the best traditions of a democratic Party, where everybody is free to have an opinion differing from the Party line, if they feel, in their own conscience, that they must act in that way.  Therefore, I feel you were quite right to allow yourself to be persuaded.&rdquo;  It is in the hope, therefore, that we may be able to persuade the Minister to withdraw these amendments that I should like to advert to some points that, admittedly, have been covered many times, but I shall try not to be too long in doing so.</P>
    <P>The first point is one which received a certain amount of special discussion on Committee Stage: the size of the constituencies.  We are being asked to have single seat constituencies brought back.  It was revealed for the first time by the Minister for External Affairs on Committee Stage that the constituencies under this Bill will vary considerably in size and population.  I myself had hoped, owing to the terms of Section 4, sub-section 2, which says &ldquo;that the population of each constituency <Col N="1641" /> ... shall... be the same throughout the country&rdquo;, that perhaps they would be the same, and that the escape clause which is also in that section, &ldquo;so far as it is practicable&rdquo; would not be abused, and that the variation in size and population would be very small, since, in fact, the words are &ldquo;the population in each constituency... shall, so far as it is practicable, be the same throughout the country.&rdquo;  But the Minister for External Affairs not only refused to accept an amendment which would permit a variation of not more than 500 either way, but was unable to say, when challenged by me, whether that variation might be bigger even than 5,000, or 6,000.</P>
    <P>Now, the total minimum population in these constituencies we are proposing will be 20,000.  If the Minister is unable to say whether the variation may or may not be bigger than 5,000 or 6,000, then I am afraid we shall have constituencies which will vary very considerably in size, and far more than the phrase in sub-section 2, Section 4, would lead one to think, when it claims that the population of each constituency shall be the same throughout the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall pass to another point, and that is, a certain sense of dismay which was placed in my mind by one of the things Senator Mullins said.  He was challenged by members of Fine Gael, whom he had just told that they, too, could get into power under this new system, and he said they could do so &ldquo;by telling the people the truth.&rdquo;  The implication of that is that if the electorate knew the truth, they would elect Fine Gael to power!  I do not accept that implication, and I was a little dismayed that it should come from Senator Mullins.  I am sure he said it quite sincerely.  I do not accept the view that all you have to do is tell the people the truth and Fine Gael will be elected.  I do not think they would have any more chance than Fianna Fáil, if the people knew the full truth.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>I might tell the Minister that I spend a good deal of my time endeavouring to tell the people and the Seanad the truth as I see it, but at the moment I am concerned with the two amendments the Minister is asking us to pass.</P>
      <P>We are asked to abolish the multiple seat constituency and to substitute for it the single seat constituency.  On that point, I should like to state my conviction that by the multiple seat constituency, you get far more effective national representatives of the electors &mdash;representatives in the Dáil who are closer to the opinions and desires of the voters than by the single seat contituency. That applies even to three seat constituencies which, in my opinion, are not as good as five or seven seat constituencies.  I think you get at the national level far more effective representation by a team of people with a variety of views than by just one person.  Furthermore, I believe that you get far more effective local representation by a team of several T.D.s than by just one person of one Party.  I believe, therefore, that in matters of local concern and of national concern, it is of great value to the voter to be able to approach a variety of people representing his constituency in Parliament.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is very good for a Government T.D. to know that if he does not take action on a particular point, of either national or local interest, his fellow T.D.s for the same constituency will be approached, and are being approached, by those concerned about a particular issue, be it national or local. It is very easy for a T.D. to become lazy if he is the only representative for a constituency, and that applies just as much to an Opposition T.D. as to a Government T.D. If they know there are others representing the same body of voters, being briefed about the same matters, either national or local, they will be more likely to be kept up to the mark.  That seems to me to constitute a worthwhile rivalry between T.D.s representing the same constituency, and it is one of the most valuable aspects of our present system.  Therefore, I am strongly opposed to bringing back the single seat constituency, and I believe <Col N="1643" /> the effects of such a change would be perceptible reasonably soon in a slackening of activity on the part of T.D.s who felt themselves without local rivalry in Parliament.</P>
    <P>Another point which seems to me to be of major importance, and which I have not heard being really effectively countered, is one to which I might ask the Minister to devote his mind.  The point is this, if you have simply the right to mark an X against one candidate, as opposed to the right to have a transferable vote saying: &ldquo;I would like candidate B. best, but if I cannot have him, I would like candidate C., or if I cannot have him, I would like candidate P. or Q.&rdquo;, one major effect, in my opinion, of insisting upon the voter just voting once and expressing no further choice is that the power of the voter is reduced.  I do not think that that can be controverted.</P>
    <P>Under the non-transferable vote, the power of the voter to express his opinions, his desires and his choice, and to give a full expression to those, is reduced.  If you say: &ldquo;You cannot express any choice or any variation, you cannot have a second, third or fourth preference but you must just put X against one candidate; that is all you can do,&rdquo; it may be defended on the grounds that it is a good thing to clip the wings of the voter.  I do not think that that is a good thing.  I think the more power you give the voter, the better; and let the representatives realise that they are pretty closely answerable to the voters.  Any measure for clipping the wings of the voter, or cutting down his power to express a coherent choice is, in my opinion, a betrayal of the democracy which we now have.  That power is clearly reduced if you simply say to the voter: &ldquo;You can plump for one candidate and that is all.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Senator Mullins made a point yesterday in answer to something I had said in regard to the type of candidate who would be approved by the Parties.  I said that the favourite type of candidate would be the good, docile, meekly obedient candidate, the sane and safe candidate, the mediocre candidate.  The Senator said that perhaps I and others <Col N="1644" /> did not know how candidates were chosen, by the Partly convention, and so on.  He failed to answer the point that the Party convention at present chooses three, or four, or five candidates for one constituency, but leaves the final choice to the voter and that under the single seat constituency, the final choice will be in the hands of the Party convention, the Party bosses, or the Party administration, but it will certainly not be left to the voter. To-day the final choice as between members of the same Party in one constituency is left to the voter.  If we abolish the transferable vote, that final choice will be left to the Party. It will be left to the Party convention or the Party executive.  That will not be as good as the present system for it represents a transfer of a section of power from the voter to the Party, and that is certainly a bad thing.  I have not seen that point answered.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil are worried about coalitions, and the possibilities of coalitions, little Parties exerting pressure upon big Parties, and a whole lot of little Parties ganging up to throw Fianna Fáil out of power.  I have already admitted that there is a measure of justification for that concern, but I have asked Fianna Fáil to look into their own hearts with a little humility and to ask themselves whether there is anything in themselves, or in their policy, that after 16 years of power, might have led the people into wanting to see them thrown out.  I should like to suggest that what needs changing is not the multi seat constituency, or the transferable vote, but the range of policies put before the country.  People are befuddled by fake differences of policy. The policy put before the people by most of the big Parties is the same: a class society based on a system of privilege and poverty side by side.  It is only the personnel which is different, and the people can see little difference between the Parties.  It does not matter much whether you have an inter-Party Government or a Fianna Fáil Government.  You get the same thing, and you are going to get the same thing, whether you change the electoral system or not, so long as the people are kept in ignorance.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1645" /> I should now like to ask the Minister to put this question to himself and to the Seanad: supposing Cumann na nGaedheal in 1925 or 1926 had decided to abolish P.R. with the single transferable vote, does he in all conscience believe that the Republican Party would have welcomed that change?  If Cumann na nGaedheal had said: &ldquo;We are going to change the electoral system for the good of the country; we are going to have the single seat constituency and abolish the transferable vote&rdquo;, does he really think the Republican supporters at that time would have welcomed it?  Does he not know that there would have been a major outcry that this was a denial of democracy and designed to keep the Cumann na nGaedheal Party in office?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">

      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;of the electorate.  He forgets that there were other Parties and Independents who were supporting Cumann na nGaedheal and it might well have happened that the single seat constituency system would have favoured a Party, even though it could not command a clear majority in each constituency and could so split the Republican Opposition that it could get into power, just as Fianna Fáil now want to split the anti-Fianna Fáil opposition in order to maintain themselves in power, whether or not they have a majority. That is the main point of having single seat constituencies.  If such a change had been suggested in 1926-27, there would have been an outcry against it, as representing a major betrayal of democracy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The system we have had so far&mdash;<Col N="1646" /> and it was built up by all the Parties &mdash;is a system of which we have every right to be proud.  It has given us Parliaments, not all the actions of which I personally would approve, but surely we can claim that we have had democratic government in Ireland since 1922.  One could argue about whether or not Fianna Fáil should have come into the Parliament in 1922. Personally, I think they should have recognised a bit earlier than they did their duty to do that.  One could argue about that, but I do not think one can argue as to whether we have had democratic Government or not. We have had keen and wide parliamentary discussions and free elections. This system which we have developed and worked to build has set a headline to the world, and I am unimpressed by Senators like Senator Lenihan who tell us there are only one or two other countries that have it.  So what?  Surely we can lead the world in something.  Surely we do not have to go tagging after dozens of other countries in this respect.  This system which we have worked for a great number of years has produced free elections and democratic government in times of peace, and in times of war abroad and the maintenance of our neutrality here.</P>
    <P>If we have had Governments with which we have had reason to be dissatisfied, it is not the fault of the electoral system, and to think so is ridiculous.  A very limited choice is frequently put before the people, but at least the electors under P.R. have the right to express a graded choice.  The system is progressive and intelligent.  It is a finely adjusted electoral machine, which is both sensitive and sturdy, in the taking of a discriminating consultation with the people.  I hold, consequently, that this multiple seat system of P.R. with the single transferable vote is good, because for one constituency you get several representatives of various political shades.  It is good because the voter is not forced to vote only for his fourth, fifth or sixth choice, so as not to waste his vote.  He can express his first, second, third choice, and so on, which enables our Parliament to reflect the true pattern of our political <Col N="1647" /> thought, or thoughtlessness, if that is the case.</P>
    <P>That is the point about P.R. as we know it: the true position is reflected, not created.  If you have a multiplicity of Parties in Ireland, that situation is not created by the electoral system; it is revealed, and if it is the case, we ought to know it.  If there are existing differences or varying shades of political thought, we ought to be proud of the system that reveals and does not smother them.</P>
    <P>It is a good system, again, because the final discriminating power as between Party and Party, as between candidate and candidate in the same Party, is left in the hands of the voter.  I fail to see why that is considered highly dangerous.</P>
    <P>It is a good system, finally, because the Government under it are not so stable that they cannot be shifted, no matter what they do or what they fail to do, as was the case with the British Government between 1931 and 1940.  It took Dunkirk and Narvik to shift them.  That kind of stability is not good.  In Britain, it led the country to the brink of disaster because they could not shift the Government, they were so firmly entrenched and had such colossal stability, admittedly, but very little else to recommend them.  It is not a good thing to have a Government so stable that no matter what they do or fail to do, they cannot be shifted.  I am not convinced by this argument on the virtue of steering a ship with its anchor.</P>
    <P>If, then, we are now shamefully, or shall I say shamelessly, to abandon this system of ours, of which we have every reason to be proud, this abandonment will represent a major retrogressive step.  The results of this retrogressive step may not become immediately apparent, the reason being that there is a lack of real difference now between Party policies, but in the future, if we throw away this fine, progressive and well-balanced electoral machine, we shall all learn to regret it, and, I believe, to regret it bitterly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not have spoken at all were it not for a remark made by Senator Mullins, a gentleman for whom I have great regard.  However, he used the word &ldquo;satellite&rdquo; which I resent very much because I want to assure him and every other Senator that I am the most independent man who ever stood within a council chamber or this House, and that I would not support anybody if I did not think he was doing what was right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am very disappointed that these amendments should be forced back on this House.  As a member of the Oireachtas for almost a quarter of a century, I want to say that there is no Bill that has ever come before this <Col N="1649" /> House that has received the same consideration, in a friendly and good humoured way, with every point threshed out.  The Government Party should realise that we on this side of the House are expressing the views of the people and that this is the most representative, vocational Seanad that could be in existence.  You have the commercial view, the farming view, the labour view and, in fact, every view. You have also the university view.  The six elected representatives of the universities are not tied up with any political Party.  On the election of the Cathaoirleach, they voted three and three and nobody can say they belong to Fine Gael or any other &ldquo;Gael&rdquo;. That showed a very independent type of vote.  Those people are elected by about 22,000 voters who must belong to an educational or other panel.  They are united in their demand that the Government should not proceed with this measure.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, you have the commercial interests.  On this side of the House, you have labour interests, farming interests, commercial interests and all are united.  I want to say in all sincerity to the Taoiseach that if he is not prepared to take notice of such clear-cut and united statements of opinion from such diverse people, instead of setting up a commission to revise the constituencies, he should abolish the Seanad.  It is an insult to the Seanad if, when views are expressed so clearly, the Taoiseach will not accept them.  When the Minister is replying, if he does not agree that the Seanad should be abolished, will he at least tell me what the Seanad is here for, because, as I said, the Bill has been discussed at length and strong points of view have been put forward? I go further and say I believe there are Senators on my right who, if they were free to express their opinions, would express them in a similar manner.</P>
    <P>First and foremost, there was no demand for this change.  Senator Mullins spoke here yesterday evening. He was in very good humour and he was very interesting to listen to.  He put a bad case very well when he talked about the danger of dictatorship. I shall go so far as to say that <Col N="1650" /> we have got it&mdash;it is here.  It is the nearest thing in the world to dictatorship. The fact is that nobody wanted this change.  Not one Fianna Fáil cumann throughout the country sent in a resolution that they wanted it.  Not one county council, not one district council asked for this change.  Not one farmers' organisation or one branch of Muintir na Tíre asked for the change. No one but the Taoiseach himself wants it.  The Taoiseach said he wanted it and the Cabinet agreed and each member of the Fianna Fáil Party and each Fianna Fáil member of the Oireachtas has to vote for it or he will be expelled from the Party.  Is not that purely and simply the case?  If that is not dictatorship, I do not know what is.  That is my honest point of view.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach should have respect for the views of the members of the Oireachtas because, after all, he is not Taoiseach for any one section of the people; he represents all the people. When we hear this cry that it will go back to the people for their decision, we must remember that at another time the people gave a decision and it was not respected.  So far as bringing back these amendments to this House is concerned, a very clear and decisive decision has already been reached here and I am very disappointed that the Taoiseach has not taken notice of that decision.  As I said at the outset, there are no satellites in the Seanad.  There are some men on this side of the House to whom I have not even spoken and yet we are all united on this matter.  Nobody has approached me on the attitude I should take.  The whole thing has been clearcut and free.  When people of such varying views as, say, Senator Burke and myself or Senator Barry and myself are so united, surely there can be no bond in any shape or form except our desire for the future good of the country.</P>
    <P>On the Second Reading of this Bill, far more important questions were raised to which the Taoiseach should devote his attention.  I understand the statement of the Bishop of Cork, Most Rev. Dr. Lucey was read here last night, but I should just like to read a few lines again and I am sure Senators will agree that it deals with matters <Col N="1651" /> which are of much more importance to the future of the country than the system of election.  It reads:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Bishop, who said he had no good tidings to announce to the million and more of our exiles, went on&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This is a very serious statement of which the Government should take notice:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Worse still, those who could and should put things right accept this catastrophic and unnatural state of affairs with the fullest complacency and regard as a crank anyone who even calls attention to it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is a very serious statement in connection with emigration.</P>
    <P>I have just one further quotation which I take from the <i>Evening Press</i> of 27th February&mdash;a time when we were discussing the merits of P.R.  It was made at a meeting in the Taoiseach's constituency:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Emigration destroyed our fine senior team, and it is galling to see some of our best players leaving our shores year after year.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That statement was made by Rev. D. Kenny, C.C. at the annual convention of the Doonbeg, County Clare, G.A.A. Club.  Would it not be more fitting that the Government should concentrate their efforts in trying to keep these people in the country?  Those are the views of the Bishop of Cork and a curate in Clare and no one can say either of those statements was political. They are agreed on the tragedy that has happened to this country now under the Fianna Fáil régime.  More people are leaving this country now than left at any time since the Famine. I defy the Minister to deny that.  It is a serious position but here we are discussing the system of election we are to have in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not interrupt the Senator.  I am speaking on the national position as it is to-day.  My point of view is as I have already <Col N="1652" /> stated.  I understand the time is limited at the moment, but I should like to ask Senator Lenihan one question. He claims to be an expert on P.R.  Would he think it fair or honest in the Dublin County Council, where there are 25 members, if there were four candidates for election as chairman&mdash;an Independent, a Fine Gael man, a Labour man and a Fianna Fáil man&mdash;and if three of them got six votes each, that would be 18, and if the Fine Gael man got seven and was elected?  Does he think the Fine Gael man should be elected?  Is that his idea of a majority?  In the Dublin Corporation, there could be a vote for Lord Mayor of 16, 15 and 14.  Does he think the person with 16 should be elected?  Has he got a majority? There is no majority unless you get at least 51 per cent. of the votes cast.  No matter what way those who are trying to put this across may twist it, there is no majority unless you get 51 per cent.  As I said on the Second Reading, I have no objection to the single seat constituency.  As a matter of fact, I am in favour of it and would be a believer in it, but with the transferable vote, that no person be elected unless he gets 51 per cent.</P>
      <P>Finally, I would appeal to the Minister that in view of the united expressions which have been made here, the Government should reconsider this whole matter.  In the case of the university representation, the six university representatives represent 22,000 people.  Should every one of them have to agree before they cast their votes?  The fact that these six are united&mdash;leaving out the fact that there are men so wide apart as myself and Senator Barry who are united, or myself and other members of the Fine Gael Party who are united&mdash;&mdash;clearly means that the Government and the Taoiseach should take note of this united expression of such a cross-section of the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was no demand for this scheme from anyone but the Taoiseach.  I would be unfair if I did not add that, on one occasion, the Minister for Health gave expression to something similar, I believe Senator Mullins should not be one bit <Col N="1653" /> afraid as far as dictatorship is concerned. I feel we have it now.  He spoke about conventions.  I should like to ask him have the candidates selected at different conventions&mdash; such as County Dublin, County Kilkenny and County Clare&mdash;always been accepted and ratified?</P>

Six months of the time of the representatives of the people has been wasted, instead of being spent in doing something for the people.  It has been taken up with this matter, which no one but the Taoiseach wants.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened attentively to the debate and I do not think anyone can claim that he has put forward a new point of view.  However, some Senators have expressed their views in my hearing for the first time and I think it is due to them that I should deal with the specific points they have put to me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The most important point was the suggestion of dictatorship which, it has been said, lies behind the introduction of this Bill, its passage through the Dáil and its introduction here.  On a number of occasions when I have spoken on this issue, I have indicated that nothing could savour less of dictatorship than that a duly elected Dáil should debate such a measure&mdash;a Dáil elected on universal suffrage&mdash;pass it by a majority and that it should then be submitted to the Seanad.  When it will have been passed or deemed to have been passed in accordance with the Constitution, it must be submitted by way of referendum to all the people, who, again on the basis of universal suffrage, will have to give it a clear majority before it can be inserted in the Constitution. Is there anything which could savour less of dictatorship, or of the bulldozing tactics to which <Col N="1654" /> Senator Hayes referred?  Every step on this Bill has been taken in accordance with the principles of democracy enshrined in the Constitution and in accordance with the procedure laid down for the administration of both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Dealing with the more specific points made by Senator Hayes, he referred to the question of a minority getting a majority of seats.  Senator Mullins has already answered that, but I should like to add that in only one case in the past half century's history of Western Europe did a Party under P.R. succeed in getting a majority of the votes cast.  There were three cases in all&mdash;one in Germany and one in Britain.  By that time in Germany, in 1953, they had abandoned P.R. and in Britain, they never had P.R. or at any rate not at that time for the purpose of parliamentary elections.  Therefore, only once in the course of European history since P.R. was introduced has a Party succeeded in getting a majority under that system and returning a Government; and that happened here in our own country in 1938.  Therefore, it is untrue to suggest that only under the straight vote system or the single non-transferable vote system is it possible that a Party which got only a minority of the votes could succeed in getting a majority of the seats in Parliament.</P>
    <P>The suggestion that the introduction of this Bill has caused the Government to ignore the economic problems of the country is clearly unfounded.  Even after the intention to introduce the Bill was announced, in a matter of weeks, the Government White Paper on Economic Development appeared.  In a matter of weeks again, at least ten Bills were introduced to implement what was contained in the White Paper.  Some have been passed already &mdash;for example, the Bill to increase the capital of Bord na Móna from £14,000,000 to £19,000,000.  There was also a Bill to increase the capital of Irish Shipping Ltd.  Decisions have been taken in principle to increase the capital of Irish Steel Holdings by £2,000,000 in order to make its products more competitive.  A decision <Col N="1655" /> in principle has been taken to commence the production of nitrogenous fertilisers based on our own raw materials, the expenditure on which will amount to several million pounds. In the last few weeks before the Dáil adjourned for the Easter recess, a supplementary Estimate was introduced for the lime and fertiliser subsidy, amounting to £500,000.  In the current Estimates, there is provision of £1,500,000, under that heading, more than was provided in the previous year.</P>
    <P>I can instance several other practical steps taken by the Government, even while this proposed change in the system of election was being contemplated, while it was being passed through the Dáil and while it was being discussed here in the Seanad. With regard to the other suggestion of wastage of time in the Dáil, it is no harm to remind the Seanad and the country that the Dáil came together specially in January last to consider the further stages of the Bill, the stages which had not been completed before the Christmas recess.  The House reassembled at a time when it does not normally sit and all stages of the Bill were completed before the end of January.  The Dáil came together again in February in the ordinary way, and no later than it would normally have reassembled, to consider the nation's financial business appropriate at this particular time of the year.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinlan referred yesterday to emigration.  He said that while emigration persisted and continued at its present level it was wrong for the Government to introduce a measure such as this, a measure which would divide rather than unite the country. The Senator ignored the facts.  He ignored the statistics readily available to him, statistics which he, as a scientist, could very easily assess.  The fact is that in 1958 as compared with the previous year there was a drop in emigration.  In 1957, 60,000 more people left the country by sea and air than entered it.  The net balance for the 12-month period ending June, 1958, was 48,000 and the net balance <Col N="1656" /> for the 12-month period ending 31st December, 1958, was 40,255.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not fair, of course, to put forward these figures by themselves and without having regard to the unemployment register because emigration figures can decline while the numbers registering at the employment exchanges can increase.  But that was not the position in 1958.  The figures for every month are made available to Senators and Deputies.  Those figures show a continuous decline.  At the end of December, 1958, there were 5,300 fewer on the unemployed register as compared with the same period in 1957, reflecting an overall decline of 7 per cent.  In order to give force to these figures, one can refer to the British Ministry of Social Insurance figures as to social insurance cards issued to Irish immigrants.  In these there was a steady decline from an estimated 60,000 in 1957 to 48,000&mdash;in fact, probably less&mdash;in 1958.  These figures, the one supporting the other, give force to the contention, and prove conclusively, that there has been a steady decline in emigration.</P>
      <P>Two speakers quoted the remarks of Most Rev. Dr. Lucey, Bishop of Cork, a strong critic of Government policy. But Dr. Lucey does not refer to one Government more than another.  I should like to deny the suggestion, however, that this Administration, or any Administration for that matter, is, or has been, complacent about emigration. I am saying that deliberately and, in doing so, I am denying the contention of my own bishop.</P>

      <P>Senator Quinlan spoke of co-operation being the keynote of government.  I agree that co-operation is highly desirable in the administration of any organisation, whether it be a club, a company, or a country.  I think, however, that decision is the real keynote of government. Unless we have the capacity for decision and unless, as I mentioned in opening yesterday, we have a Government that can take decisions, we cannot have any economic progress.</P>
      <P>The Senator suggested, too, that this measure was introduced in an irresponsible manner.  If a measure is introduced in accordance with democratic principles, in accordance with the procedure laid down and in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution how can anyone suggest that it is brought before the Oireachtas in an irresponsible manner?</P>
      <P>He suggested that the Government are both arrogant and intolerant of criticism.  Surely, the fact that this measure has been debated for a longer period than any other measure ever introduced, has been criticised at length and every criticism made answered, or a reasonable attempt made to answer it, does not savour of either intolerance or arrogance.</P>
      <P>Senator Quinlan's remarks would seem to suggest that all-Party Government is the desirable solution. Surely democracy, and every Government, requires reasonable and responsible opposition.  The Senator said that we on this side of the House cannot have it both ways.  But neither can the Senator have it both ways.  There cannot be an all-Party Government if we are to fulfil the ideals of democracy and if the people are to be permitted to have a reasonable alternative to the Government in power, should they see fit to remove that Government from office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Murphy this morning naturally had regard for his own Party.  He referred to the Labour Party as a minority Party.  I wonder did Senator Murphy examine his remarks home?  The Labour Party draws its support from what they <Col N="1658" /> choose to describe as the working classes.  I like to describe anybody who does an honest day's work, whether it be with his pen, with his head, or with his hands, as a member of the working classes.  Manual workers alone are not entitled to be designated the working classes if the implication is that everybody else does not work.  But, accepting the Labour Party's own definition of the working classes, most of the working classes are members of one or other of the different trade unions.  Those who elect the Labour Party are usually represented in these unions.  I understand one union has a membership of something in the neighbourhood of 500,000.  Surely they cannot be described as a minority.  The fact that the Labour Party cannot command more than a minority of support from their own trade union members does not in itself make these people a minority.</P>
    <P>The Senator seems rather timorous about Labour's future as a prospective Government.  He seems to suggest that there is no hope of Labour ever becoming a Government on its own under the non-transferable vote and the single seat constituency.  I should like to remind the Senator that the counterpart of the Labour Party in England had five seats in 1905.  In 1923 they were the largest Party in the British House of Commons.</P>

      <P>I do not know if it did but I will take Senator Lenihan's <Col N="1660" /> word for it.  Senator O'Quigley described me as coming in here dispirited and dejected.

In coming in here, I tried to put my views as objectively as I could without bitterness or rancour.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>If that attitude can be mistaken for dispiritedness or dejection, perhaps I should adopt a more truculent attitude the next time I come here.  I can assure Senator O'Quigley that I have been in no way dispirited or dejected in asking the Seanad to reconsider these two provisions and to restore the Bill to the form in which it was originally introduced.</P>
      <P>Passing from that, the Senator challenged the statement that P.R. leads to a multiplicity of Parties.  We can only, in examining that situation, see how P.R. developed and what effect it had in other countries throughout the world.  The history of P.R. is fairly well-known now to the majority of us.  Before this Bill was introduced, many of us did not think much about it.  We did not know where it came from.</P>
      <P>One of the first suggestions in relation to P.R. came from the pen of a man named Thomas Hare.  We have here the Hare system of P.R.  It is rather appropriate that we are discussing it in the month of March. Two other books were written by two other Europeans about the system about the 1850's.  Within a short time after that many countries throughout Europe began to adopt the P.R. system in different forms, I will readily admit.  But almost in every case, with possibly only one or two notable exceptions, there was an increase in the number of Parties that got themselves elected to this Parliament. There was a notable exception in, I think, Belgium and there was an exception too in Holland but even in Holland at the present time&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall deal with Ireland in a minute.  Even in Holland <Col N="1661" /> at the present day, there is a tendency to increase the number of Parties according as they now find that different smaller Parties can exercise influence over the formation and life of Governments.</P>
      <P>In Ireland, since Senator Murphy referred to it, I have said already that the political thinking of the country was largely divided into two main streams.  Even if there was a tendency for small Parties to be formed, they ultimately found that the established lines of political thought were too strong to enable them to develop.  But the time is bound to come when that political thinking, based on the original division, will decrease.  I do not want to repeat what I have already said.</P>
      <P>There is another aspect which is worth considering in this respect, namely, that a number of these small Parties became absorbed into Fine Gael over the past 20 years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as I know, no Party was absorbed by Fianna Fáil. Perhaps single members of them infiltrated now and again but, generally speaking, Fianna Fáil established itself on its own policy and attracted the members to its ranks on the strength of that policy.</P>
      <P>Personally speaking, I was too young to have any views on the Treaty split. I joined Fianna Fáil, since I did intend to come into politics, purely of my own volition and as a result of objective examination.  I was in no way influenced by family ties one way or the other.</P>
      <P>Senator Sheehy Skeffington referred to the possibility of my going back to the Taoiseach with the story that I had decided of my own volition to withdraw these two amendments.  I thought he referred to it with a degree of cynical levity.  If I am wrong, I apologise.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not.  I want to explain my position, as I have tried to do in a different way yesterday.  This <Col N="1662" /> decision was come to by the Fianna Fáil Party.  Senator Sheehy Skeffington as an Independent possibly does not appreciate or, if he does, he does not seem to agree with the manner in which political Parties make their decisions.  We arrive at our decisions like any other Party as a result of debate within the Party meeting whether as a result of a majority or a unanimous decision.  If I disagree so fundamentally with the decision taken that I cannot accept it, I am not obliged to stay in the Party.  I can leave it and give publication to my own opinions and the reasons for my withdrawal from the Party.  I agreed with the decision taken.  It is a decision of a Party, arrived at in a democratic fashion. Therefore, I do not feel I have authority to withdraw these two amendments, even if I felt inclined to do so.  The fact is that I do not. Therefore, the matter does not arise.</P>
      <P>The Senator also referred to P.R. giving within a constituency a degree of rivalry that will keep Deputies on their toes.  Again, he is referring to a matter of which he has, perhaps, little experience except from observation.  I happen to be a representative of a five seat constituency.  If I were representing a single seat constituency I would have to work far harder than I might do now.  With the position of Fianna Fáil, in a five seat constituency, there is always a good chance of a second man getting in irrespective of how hard he works or how little he does for his constituents.  There is a good chance that I may always be that second man. In many cases throughout the country there are people who are prepared to leave the work to others and who can get in on the strength of the vote of the first candidate in a constituency.  There may be quite a lot of soft pedalling or taking things easy on the part of some candidates or some Deputies when they have been elected.  The Senator referred to the fact that the power of the voter&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I was coming to that. The Senator suggested that the power of the voter was reduced.  I take it that we all agree that the purpose of the exercise of an electoral system is to elect a Parliament from which a Government may be elected.  The ultimate purpose is the election of a Government.  Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that the primary concern of the electorate is to have influence and power over the formation, the life and activities of government. I contend that the single non-transferable vote will give much more power in that respect to the electorate.</P>
      <P>The single transferable vote will require Parties to declare their policies and their intentions before an election. It is freely admitted that it will tend to single-Party Governments but, if the electorate becomes dissatisfied with such Government they can displace that Party and with it the entire Government and immediately cause a complete change of Government.  Therefore, I suggest that the power of the voter over the formation of Governments will increase rather than decrease, as Senator Sheehy Skeffington suggests.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, consider this situation that one might well find and that could have arisen here on the two occasions when a Coalition Government was defeated if there were not a strong, unified Party responsible in every way, like Fianna Fáil, to which the people could turn.  If there were not such a Party and if the Government were defeated, instead of having a new Government there would be a realignment of the different factions comprising the existing Government, some small groups dropping out, perhaps, and some other groups coming in to take their place.  That would not reflect the intention of the electorate in removing the Government from office.  Therefore I suggest that the single non-transferable vote will repose in the hands of the people more power over their Governments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Tunney asks what are the functions of the Seanad.  I am sure he will not disagree with me when I say <Col N="1664" /> that the functions of the Seanad are to do its duty and fulfil its tasks under the Constitution.  Under the Constitution, the powers of the Seanad are limited in a certain way.  That is the will of the people.  Nothing could be clearer than that the measure which the people passed in 1937 represented the will of the people.  The people gave the Seanad certain limited powers and they gave the Dáil the power to defeat a decision of the Seanad.  Therefore there is no suggestion whatever that because the Seanad might not see eye to eye with the Dáil or with the Government it should be abolished.  The Seanad is a deliberative assembly.  This Bill has been debated generally in a deliberative fashion.  If the Government refused to accept the decision of the Seanad there is no suggestion that the Seanad should be abolished; it is acting fully in accordance with the Constitution.</P>
    <P>Senator Tunney also referred to the possibility of people being elected individually with less than 51 per cent. of the votes.  I would ask him to reflect on what the position is at the present time.  According as constituencies are five, four or three seat constituencies, it requires only one-sixth, one-fifth or one-fourth of the valid votes cast to elect a Deputy and many Deputies are elected without receiving even the one-sixth, one-fifth or one-fourth.  In fact, at present there are in the Dáil approximately 30 Deputies who have succeeded in securing election without the quota.  Is it the Senator's contention that these Deputies should have received 51 per cent. of the votes cast before being entitled to election?  I believe that under the straight vote system the percentage of the votes that a Deputy will get in order to secure election will be far higher than the average percentage that one gets at the present time.</P>

      <P>It has been suggested that Fianna Fáil have got a sufficient majority under P.R. not to require to change the system if the intention only is to enable us to face our economic difficulties with more capacity to solve them.  It is true that at the present time Fianna Fáil, under P.R., have got a sufficient majority to enable them to carry out any measures for improvement in our economic situation.  Senator Mullins said yesterday that whenever Fianna Fáil had a majority P.R. of itself did not prevent the Government from doing anything to improve the country's situation.  It is true that during the period when Fianna Fáil had a majority under P.R. they were able to do most good work in the interests of the nation.  One would think that no progress whatever has been made in this country over the past 37 years since we secured a measure of native Government, but those who make those charges, who say that economic problems have been generally ignored because of squabbling between Parties deliberately ignore the facts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have, as was referred to yesterday, made many strides in our economic development.  We have what O.E.E.C. observers have described as an infra-structure second to none in any part of Europe.  By infra-structure they meant that we have made provision for hospitals, houses, roads, transport generally, water, sewerage and those other amenities that make for an increased standard of living.  We have <Col N="1666" /> the capacity to make this country a more prosperous one.</P>
    <P>We have, unfortunately, the history of emigration.  I have referred to that on a number of occasions.  People in Ireland emigrate too readily.  We have a common language with England and America which renders more easy the capacity for people to emigrate and take up employment in these countries. That is an economic fact which, perhaps, is fortunate or unfortunate according as one may look at it. Nevertheless, we have down through the years our history of emigration.</P>
    <P>I referred to the fact that people here are only too ready to decry conditions in our own country until they go abroad and then they often work harder abroad than they were prepared to do at home.  I remember Deputy Morrissey making that statement one time in public.  He was criticised for it but I admired him for his courage in making the statement.  He was the first I heard to make it.  He said if people were prepared to work half as hard here as they worked abroad there would be no necessity for them to emigrate. There is a lot of truth and force in that statement.</P>
    <P>I believe, too, that people have taken advantage of the conditions we have provided for them in the way of learning and equipping themselves generally for life.  Those who have any extra ability ought, if they can, to apply it here even though they will get less for their efforts at home than abroad.  I feel they have a duty towards their own country.  Whether the system of election is P.R. or the single non-transferable vote, they should have sufficient patriotism in them to apply their talents, to sell their services at home rather than abroad.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinlan made the suggestion that we were not equipping our people for emigration and since many of us have to emigrate we ought to equip them.  It has been stated on a number of occasions that so many of our young people fail to get education beyond the age of 14 or 15 years.  The fact is, however, that when people make comparisons with the number entering secondary and vocational <Col N="1667" /> schools they make comparisons, not with the year the people leave the primary schools, but with the entire bulk of the people attending these primary schools.  The result makes it appear that the number of people entering for further education is reduced considerably.  It is far more accurate to make the comparison with the particular year people leave the primary schools to undertake secondary and vocational education.  In the 14-15 year group there is 60 per cent. and in the 15-16 year group you have 48 per cent.&mdash;&mdash;</P>

These are just general remarks suggested as a result of the statements made by Senator Quinlan and others.</P>
      <P>I believe that this whole problem is bound up with our economic future.  I am quite prepared to concede that P.R., as it has evolved at the present period at any rate, has not hindered this Government in the slightest in implementing a broad programme of economic expansion.  Not only has it not hindered the Government but the Government have given proof that they are carrying on with that programme. It is possible, however, that against the background to which I have referred and in the changing political scene in this country, we might in the years to come see a situation arising whereby many small groups representing minority interests will have a say in government far in excess of that to which they are entitled.</P>

I do not believe they were disappointed so much with the performance of the inter-Party Government as with the manner in which they were able to break up and disintegrate from within.  They were particularly disappointed with the manner in which the last inter-Party Government broke up.  They dealt more severely with the Party to which the three Deputies belonged and who were responsible for the break-up of that Government than they did with the other component parts.  They were reduced from three members to one. We believe it is possible for situations such as that to arise in the future, that a Government composed of many groups can be influenced in its actions by the threat of small groups to withdraw their support, that decisions which must be taken by the Government in order to achieve progress could not be taken unless they get the goodwill, co-operation and acquiescence of those small groups.  Many of these small groups must have regard for the interests which elected them and many of these decisions might, for a time at least, adversely affect those interests. Therefore, such groups can and will threaten withdrawal from the Government unless a particular measure is shelved, or considerably watered down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We believe it is impossible for a Government to make progress under such conditions.  We believe that it is not only possible but very probable that such a situation could develop here and, it is for that reason we ask the Seanad to restore these two provisions in the Bill which we will ultimately ask the people of the country to adopt in their own interests, in the interests of the economic future of the <Col N="1669" /> country, and not in the interests of any Party.</P>
    <P>I have said before, and I should like to repeat, that I am in disagreement with the suggestion that the Bill is designed to perpetuate Fianna Fáil.  I have no more interest in the perpetuation of Fianna Fáil than I have in any other organisation.  As long as Fianna Fáil acts in a responsible manner, acts in the best interests of the country, acts as it is doing now, then it will have my allegiance.  As soon as it departs from certain fundamental principles which I and others hold dear, it will no longer have my allegiance.</P>
    <P>The Bill is not designed to perpetuate <Col N="1670" /> Fianna Fáil as such.  It is designed to perpetuate a spirit of responsibility in approaching the country's problems and we genuinely believe, in bringing this matter to the people to decide, without bitterness or rancour, that they can be left to make their decision so that their economic, social and other interests can be advanced under future Governments.</P>

    <Title>Central Fund Bill, 1959&mdash;Second Stage (Resumed) and Subsequent Stages.</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>When speaking on this Bill yesterday, I said I believed the paramount difficulty which Governments here will face is that the standard of living of our neighbours in Britain and of our cousins in America is nearly twice, in the case of Britain and four times in the case of the United States, as high as ours.  Many of the younger people do not understand why that should be; they tend to blame the Government and they have not given the mature consideration to our history, particularly our economic history, which would enable them to see that we have not been endowed by nature with the resources enjoyed by the U.S. and Britain.</P>
      <P>This problem confronting us as a nation is the same type of problem as confronts nearly every member as head of a household.  We cannot afford to live beyond our means.  We must be satisfied with the income we earn by our own exertions.  As a State we must be satisfied to keep our spending commensurate with our income.  As a business man, I believe that even though I do the same amount of work as a man in a similar position in a similar type of industry in England, I must be satisfied with a lower level of income.</P>
      <P>The same thing is true of Ministers of State.  It is only right to say, in passing, that they get far less remuneration than their opposite numbers in Britain and the U.S., but that is only in accordance with the different economies of the countries.  The same thing applies down along the line: civil servants, professional men and skilled and unskilled workers must accept somewhat less in our economy than their counterparts abroad.  If they do that, we should then have a cheaper level of production, and while their money incomes cannot be as high as in Britain or in the U.S., each £ they receive should have greater purchasing power.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is one reason why I thought the Government unwise in removing the subsidies.  The imposition of the levies and the result, a contribution to the Exchequer of £9,000,000 or £10,000,000, was an effort by the inter-Party Government to make our £ more valuable, to increase its purchasing power.  When the subsidies were removed, the Government discovered the consequence was what we now call the fifth round of wage increases. Through the arbitration machinery provided there was an immediate <Col N="1675" /> notch-up in the cost of all forms of service when the levies were withdrawn</P>
    <P>I know this problem is almost impossible to solve and I am merely touching on the question of the referendum, but I want to say that changing the system of election will not solve our problem.  It is of such a basic and perennial nature that it can be solved only by the Government appealing to the latent patriotism that exists in every vocational group in the country and saying to them that if they want to stay in Ireland, they must work for Ireland and accept somewhat less than they would have in Britain because in other respects they will get far more. This is probably one of the most pleasant countries in the world to live in and the tempo of life, from the point of view of enjoyment, is better than anywhere else.  Even as regards climatic conditions, it is said that we can be out of doors on more days in the year than in any other country.</P>
    <P>In terms of money values, we may not be as well off as our neighbours, but we have compensating advantages. Some of these can be brought to our people through education.  Unfortunately, all our efforts in the past have been concentrated on securing our freedom and, as Dr. Philbin, Bishop of Clonfert said&mdash;and I think it is quoted in the &ldquo;Economic Survey&rdquo;&mdash;we like to believe in freedom as our end, like marriage in a fairy story.</P>
    <P>I am afraid our younger people, many of whom have not got an opportunity of going to a secondary school, are inclined to grow up with that idea.  Really, it is higher education we need to convince the people of the value of what we can have here and to bring home to them the fact that if we wish to have more in money values, we can get it only by working harder and more intelligently.  The Minister for Finance was reared on the land and people who come from the land of Ireland generally have their feet on the ground and understand these economic facts.  Before they leave the farms, they see how life begins and how it ends and they need not text books to teach them these things.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1676" /> In conclusion, I suggest to the Government that if success is to be achieved here, it must be achieved through inviting and securing the complete co-operation of all the various vocational groups, many of which are out of touch with the needs of the present day.  I do not want to mention specifically any group, but the Minister for Agriculture recently had difficulty in securing persons for very essential services in connection with a growing branch of our agricultural trade.  That indicated to me that these people are out of step, or that someone is out of step with the present trend of economic realities.  It is not for us to judge the issue here, but a solution must be found, not a political but an economic solution, a solution of compromise in which all parties are prepared to sacrifice something for the common good.</P>
    <P>We shall have an opportunity of addressing ourselves more fully to these subjects on the Appropriation Bill and I do not propose to delay the House any longer, except to say that I believe our economy is a living and viable one, but it will only continue to be so, if we are prepared not to expect more from it than it can give us and if we want more, we must work harder and more intelligently and perhaps save a little to-day so that we may have more to spend tomorrow. There is no other way to do it.  It was thought once that by changing a Government, you could get more money.  That fallacy has been exploded.  We wish the Government well and offer them every co-operation in their economic programme and the various schemes they have put before us.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonKissane" hpid="Eamon Ó Ciosáin Eamon Ó Ciosáin">
      <NameTxt>Eamon Ó Ciosáin</NameTxt>
      <P>It is only right to congratulate the Minister for Finance on having brought the finances of the country into a very healthy state.  It is not easy for any Minister for Finance to meet all the demands made on the Exchequer from time to time by all sections of community, but the Minister has made a very good job of the administration of the Department of Finance since he took office two years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The manner in which this Central <Col N="1677" /> Fund Bill has been received by all sides of the House, even by the Opposition, is an indication in itself that our economy is on a sound basis, and there is not very much room for complaint.  There have been isolated criticisms of certain items in the Bill, which is only natural, but on the whole it can be gathered, from the mild tone of the speeches here and absence of any criticism, that there is an improvement in our position.</P>
    <P>When the Government took office two years ago, that was not the position. There was gloom and depression all over the land and a feeling of despondency had crept into all parts of the country.  It is no exaggeration to say that these clouds have been dispelled and that there is now a more confident feeling prevalent among the people.  We have what we have already referred to in other debates, stability in government which is an all-important consideration.  I was glad to hear Senator O'Brien last evening expressing the view, a view which many of us here hold, that there can be no progress in any country without stability.  I said that here myself on a previous occasion but some of the members opposite did not appear to attach the same importance to it as some others of us attach to it.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested by certain speakers on the opposite side, notably Senator Barry, that the bill before us is an enormous one.  It is nothing of the kind when we take an objective view of what it represents.  Furthermore, the size of the bill is not the best criterion to take.  We could have a much smaller bill but the expenditure of the finances involved might not be beneficial to the country as a whole. The size of the bill is not the all-important question.  The important question is the use to which that money is devoted and I submit that the policy enshrined in this Bill is a sound and constructive policy.  Again, I was glad to hear the view of Senator O'Brien last evening when he said this is a production Bill, that it is designed to increase production from field and factory, and that is exactly how it should be.</P>
    <P>We have here certain items for <Col N="1678" /> agriculture and these items in themselves are indicative of the imaginative way in which the Government propose to tackle our basic industry, agriculture.  I was surprised to hear last evening some Senator opposite finding fault with the proposal to provide subsidies for phosphatic fertilisers on the ground that such expenditure could not be described as capital expenditure. That is a very foolish attitude to take up.</P>
    <P>Senator Burke and Senator O'Donovan mentioned it.  Their objection to the proposal to provide cheap fertilisers for the farmers was based on two considerations.  One was that the increased fertility such a policy would produce would be of short duration on the land.  That is not a realistic approach to the matter.  As far as I can gather, this is part of a five-year plan. The idea is to continue this policy of providing cheap fertilisers for the farmers in order to preserve the fertility of the soil.  It does not matter whether it is to be regarded as capital expenditure or not.  Whatever it is, it is money being spent in the right direction.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>May I say that Senator Kissane misunderstands me?  I am in favour of what the Government are doing.  It is a most laudable plan, but it should not be treated as capital.  The subsidy should be given out of revenue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonKissane" hpid="Éamon Ó Ciosáin Éamon Ó Ciosáin">
      <NameTxt>Éamon Ó Ciosáin</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said, I do not mind how the money is provided when it is applied in the proper way and when it is for a good purpose.  It could not be for a much better purpose than to improve the land of this country with a view to increasing agricultural output, and that, I think, should be the aim of every Government here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second ground on which objection was raised to this subsidy for the provision of cheap fertilisers was that it would benefit only the large farmers.  I wonder are those who put forward that point of view serious? Does not everybody who has experience of life in rural Ireland know that the small farmer, more than anybody else, is always keenly aware of what is <Col N="1679" /> beneficial, likely to make his task easier and to make a success of his endeavours in producing as much from his holding as he possibly can?  This scheme will be of great benefit to the small farmers as well as to the large farmers.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, it will now be possible for these farmers to get credit facilities which they could not get before.  That, in itself, is a great thing.  A couple of years ago, there was no possibility of getting these credit facilities, or at least the possibility was very remote.  It is very gratifying to know that the commercial banks are playing their part in this credit scheme.  It is better, if farmers are in need of credit, that it should be available to them on their own doorstep, so to speak.  I cannot for the life of me see what objection to this scheme there could be on any side of the House.  I do not think that anybody here has any deep-seated objection to it.  They realise it is the proper thing to do.  The land of this country is very much in need of lime and fertilisers.  We have here also a subsidy for ground limestone, of which, I am sure, the farmers will take advantage.</P>
    <P>In the course of his speech last evening, Senator Burke mentioned a few matters to which I should like to refer to-day.  He said that during the term of the last Coalition, our exports increased substantially.  I wonder could he produce any evidence that that was the case?  I should like to see some proof forthcoming to substantiate that claim, because if that were the case, how was it that at the end of the period we found an adverse balance of payments to the amount of £61,000,000?</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>Because you imported more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonKissane" hpid="Éamon Ó Ciosáin Éamon Ó Ciosáin">
      <NameTxt>Éamon Ó Ciosáin</NameTxt>
      <P>That was the adverse balance this Government had to face two years ago.  It was a serious position.  I imagine if we had this substantial increase in exports the Senator mentioned, such an adverse balance of payments could not arise. But that was not the first time such <Col N="1680" /> a problem presented itself to the people of this country.  We had also the position that there was a deficit in the Exchequer accounts.  That was mentioned in the Dáil, but I do not know if it was mentioned here.</P>
      <P>It looks as if these imbalances are characteristic of Coalition Governments. We have never got a satisfactory explanation, or indeed any explanation, from those who support coalitions of why that huge adverse balance developed during those years. We can form our opinions as to how the deficit in the Exchequer accounts occurred: we know that in a Coalition Government where you have so many Parties watching one another, the Minister for Finance is at times placed in a very difficult and very invidious position.  No doubt there are demands for popular measures from one group or another and then, when the time comes to find the money, they are not prepared to face up to the issue, and they have recourse to the expedient of passing the bill on to their successors.  That was the problem with which the Minister had to grapple when he took office two years ago.</P>
      <P>I am sorry Senator Burke has left the House.  He and Senator O'Donovan raised an outcry against the provision of what they said was £10,000,000 for the expansion of our merchant fleet.  One would imagine from the way they spoke, that that sum was being given to Irish Shipping Ltd., free, gratis and for nothing. Everyone knows that is not the case. The position is, of course, that the capital of the company is being increased and their borrowing powers are being increased.  That is totally different from giving them a free grant which Senators tried to persuade us was the case.  What struck me was the inconsistency that was revealed.  Last week we dealt with a Bill entitled the Irish Shipping Limited (Amendment) Bill which provided for these financial arrangements.  That measure was accepted by all sides of the House, including the Opposition.  They did not demur; they did not oppose the Bill; they accepted it.  They are now voicing disapproval of a policy to expand our merchant shipping fleet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1681" /> I think it is a good thing, that it is right and proper, to give whatever assistance is necessary to Irish Shipping Ltd. to enable them to carry on their activities on behalf of the people of this country.  If we have to have a mercantile marine, we must keep it up to modern requirements, so, instead of complaining about whatever assistance, financial or otherwise, we give to Irish Shipping Ltd., we should be glad and proud to have the opportunity of showing our recognition of the wonderful work they have done. One of the items in the policy of Sinn Féin was to have a merchant fleet of our own.  Such a policy was advocated by Arthur Griffith and I submit that in dealing now with the question of this merchant fleet, we should not approach it in a half-hearted fashion, but that we should give them all the support necessary because they have been a boon and a credit to the country.</P>
    <P>Unemployment and emigration have been mentioned so often that I shall not go into them to any great extent this evening.  The Minister for Education this morning dealt with emigration. Some figures were given here last night to show that unemployment is decreasing.  There is no doubt about that; the trend in unemployment is downward.  On 7th March, 1957, the number of registered unemployed was 89,545; on 7th March, of this year, the number was 76,923, a decrease of about 13,000.</P>

      <P>I did not intend to deal with emigration, but since the Senator has mentioned it, I shall refer to an observation made here last evening by Senator O'Donovan.  He said that the floodgates of emigration were opened after the last election when Fianna Fáil came into office.  He said the tide of emigration flowed as it never flowed before, from this country, in 1957.  If there was such a terrible flood of emigration in 1957, could this Government be blamed for it?  Could it be expected that any of these trends could be corrected by a Government <Col N="1682" /> which was in office only for a couple of months?  In fact, when the Senator said there was such a tide of emigration in 1957, he was indicting his own Government, because if there was that emigration it was a direct result of the policy or lack of policy, of the Coalition Government.</P>
      <P>When the present Government came into office in 1957, the trend of emigration was arrested and it has been going down ever since.  There is not so much emigration to-day.  There has not been so much during the past year as there was during any year of the Coalition period.  Therefore, Senators opposite are on very unsure ground when they talk about emigration.  They have been making speeches up and down the country about unemployment and emigration and one would think from the tenor of their speeches that these social evils did not present themselves until the present Government took office.</P>
      <P>The number of unemployed in the country to-day is 13,000 fewer than it was this time two years ago.  That is all the more commendable when we realise that in Britain there has been an increase in unemployment.  Even in the great United States of America, there was an increase in unemployment and last year the figure there reached, if I do not make a mistake, 5,000,000. Therefore, it is very significant that while unemployment has increased in those countries it has decreased here by the figure I mentioned.  Perhaps another example nearer home would be of benefit.  In the Six Counties&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It rose to 56,000. That was a big increase.  One must remember that up there they are supposed to have the backing of the British Government.  In reality, as things are, they would be much better <Col N="1683" /> off if their economy were integrated with the economy of this part of the country.</P>
      <P>Senators have asked the Minister to increase the social services in certain ways&mdash;to increase old age pensions, blind pensions, widows' and orphans' pensions and so on.  We would all subscribe to that policy, but the difficulty, of course, is to find the money for it.  There has been a demand here, also, for a reduction in taxation, but as everyone knows, it is impossible to reduce taxation and increase the social services at the same time.  We cannot have it both ways.</P>
      <P>At the same time, I also would ask the Minister to reconsider the position of those people who form the most needy sections of the community.  If, in the not too distant future, he finds that our financial position enables him to grant increases to them, I am sure he himself would be glad to do so.  I know that he would be glad to reduce taxation, too, if he could, but that is more easily said than done.</P>

      <P>Many of us will have noticed a welcome increase in the Estimates for university education. Many of us will hope, too, that it is a sign of a more generous policy in the future.  A wise parent will never try to save on education, if he possibly can avoid it; and a wise Government will never try to save on education. On the whole, our Governments have been too restrained, too much inclined to save on education for the last 20 years.  Frankly, I would welcome a more generous policy and a more progressive policy in the Department of Education.</P>
      <P>However, the increases are clearly there for this year and anyone interested in university education will be grateful for them.  There was an increase of £282,000 over the £670,000 of last year.  The total amount now to be spent on university education is £953,000.  I should like to draw attention to three kinds of disproportion in this Estimate.  The first disproportion is&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>May I remind <Col N="1684" /> the Senator that we are not dealing with the Estimate?  We are concerned more with policy than with the Estimates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamStanford" hpid="Professor Stanford Professor Stanford">
      <NameTxt>Professor Stanford</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, a Chathaoirligh.  I think I can phrase it so as to meet your comment.  We are discussing policy on education and, in particular, the fraction of the total Estimate which is to be voted by this Bill.  What I am about to say is primarily a matter of policy rather than a financial detail.  The fact is that we must spend on education. Many of us may say that there is a considerable increase this year.  But we have only to look across the Border with Senator Kissane to see just how far we still lag behind in our policy on university education.  That has been said many times before, both by myself and by Senator O'Donovan.</P>
      <P>To take Queen's University as a simple example: over £1,000,000 is given to Queen's University, Belfast, from public funds every year.  That is an annual revenue of £1,000,000. That £1,000,000 is for one college with less than 3,000 students.  Contrast that with our policy.  We are offering less than £1,000,000 for five separate colleges and for more than 8,000 students.  These figures speak for themselves.  The contrast is very regrettable.  One could take any English provincial university&mdash;Manchester, Bristol, Sheffield, or Leeds&mdash; and the contrast would be even more regrettable.  There is no point in labouring the matter, but I urge the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Education never to forget that particular form of disproportion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second disproportion to which I should like to draw attention is that between the amount being spent on our universities and the rest of the national expenditure.  Let me cite one simple example; it has already been quoted in the Dáil.  This simple example will, I think, drive home the point I am trying to make.  It is proposed to spend £5,000,000 on aeroplanes to fly the Atlantic.  Less than £1,000,000 will be spent on our universities.  I cannot understand how in a struggling country like ours, and we are a struggling country, that kind of disproportion <Col N="1685" /> in public expenditure can be justified. These planes will be built entirely outside the country.  As far as I can see, not a single penny of that £5,000,000 will go into the pockets of Irishmen. The construction of them will not help our economy in any way.  Yet, we are spending five times as much on these planes as we are spending on our universities.</P>
    <P>Just contrast the effect of spending that £5,000,000 on our universities&mdash; and that is something we might very reasonably do when we consider the amount that is being spent on the universities in Northern Ireland and in Great Britain.  What would be the effect of such expenditure?  The main effect would be that our universities would at last be properly housed.  In Trinity College, for historical reasons on the whole, we are fortunate in our buildings.  Our needs are very much less than the needs of other colleges. The needs of University College are clear to all.  May I say here that we, in Trinity College, will give the fullest support to generous schemes of building for University College, Dublin?  We would urge the country to give every support to our plea that lavish money should be spent in the near future in getting proper buildings for our sister university.</P>
    <P>Consider what the effect on morale would be, as distinct from the effect on education, of a lavish building scheme of that kind.  There would be the employment given to builders, plasterers, painters, furnishers and all kinds of people.  But there is something more than that.  My mind goes back to Athens in the fifth century when by a piece of embezzlement, I am sorry to say&mdash;Pericles embezzled the funds of the Delian League; but leaving aside how the money was raised&mdash;these magnificent buildings which are still the glory of Athens and the glory of Europe were brought into being.  I am not, however, thinking primarily of the historical effect of such buildings.  I am thinking of the effect of the buildings on the morale of Athens in that day.  It was at once a tremendous inspiration and encouragement alone to the people of the city of Athens but to Greece as a whole.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1686" /> I suggest one of the best ways of building up national morale is through the medium of spectacular building&mdash; not just utility building, but genuinely spectacular building with the best architects, the best materials and the highest ideals.  We will be told that this extravagance could not be countenanced. How can it be called extravagance when £5,000,000 will go out of our pockets next year for aeroplanes that will probably not make one penny for us and will only increase emigration as far as I can see?  Yet the thought of spending £4,000,000 or £5,000,000 to rehouse our universities apparently makes most of our people shudder.  I cannot understand it.  I think it shows shortsightedness and lack of ideals.</P>
    <P>We do not want the equivalent of Mexico City University.  Some of the Senators may have seen pictures of that.  It is a most extravagant and fantastic expenditure of hundreds of millions of pounds.  The result is bizarre. We do not want anything of that kind here, but we do want something worthy of the city of Dublin, something worthy of the standards of Irish universities.  That could be provided with the money which will be sent to California within the next year.  I make the argument for two reasons: for the sake of university education, that is higher education, and, secondly, for the morale of the country.  It would lift up the hearts of the people if a really good scheme of building were put through within the next couple of years, so that not only the citizens of Dublin but the citizens of Europe could see Irish architecture and Irish materials at their best dedicated to what has always been near the heart of the Irish people&mdash;higher education.</P>
    <P>I make one proviso.  If this generous sum of some millions of pounds is to be spent on new buildings for our sister university in this city there should be some reasonable proportion of that large sum set aside for the needs of the other colleges and universities. University College, Cork, also has its needs.  Trinity College, though, as I said, we are historically fortunate in having on the whole good buildings, <Col N="1687" /> needs new laboratories and classrooms. Also the cost of maintenance is fairly costly for us, but the Government have been doing a great deal from that point of view, and we are grateful.</P>
    <P>It would be unfair to give £4,000,000 for the building of a university college and say there is nothing for anyone else.  That would be grossly unfair. Let us have reasonable proportion in a generous policy.  It will not merely be to the advantage of higher education but it will be an encouragement and inspiration to the whole country. In the light of what I have said does there not appear to be a marked disproportion between this less than £1,000,000 for our universities and £5,000,000 for what may be almost useless aeroplanes?</P>
    <P>The third disproportion is within the universities Estimate itself.  If one examines the figures at page 174 one finds that University College, Dublin, is receiving £143,000, which is more than one half of the total increase. The other three main colleges&mdash; Galway, Cork and Dublin&mdash;are receiving something in the neighbourhood of £40,000; £47,000 for University College, Galway, and £40,000 for Trinity College, Dublin.  Maynooth and the College of Surgeons are not receiving any increase.  It is clear from these figures that University College, Dublin, is receiving three times as much as any of the other colleges for current expenditure.  These are not capital grants; these are grants for annual expenditure.  If one examines the Trinity College grant a little more closely, one sees that of its £40,000, £20,000 is really what amounts to paying off an overdraft for capital purposes. The remaining £20,000 represents one-fourteenth of the total expenditure on the universities.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister a question to which I hope he will be able to give me an answer.  What is the basis for that disproportion?  Why has University College received half, when the others receive only one-seventh? I am sure there is a reasonable basis for it, but it escapes me. One reason does occur to me; it may well be in the minds of many Senators <Col N="1688" /> and I think we should meet it fairly and squarely.  It could be that the basis of allocation is to give grants only on the basis of students of Irish birth.  It may be in the minds of the Minister and the Department that if a college has a great number of students from outside the country, they should not be reckoned in assessing the grants.  If that is the basis, I suggest it is an unreasonable one and I shall offer three arguments for that.</P>
    <P>First, I should like to deal with the large number of overseas students in Trinity College, Dublin.  The first reason I would offer is that most or many of these non-nationals are of Irish extraction.  The father or mother is Irish, and the student comes back here because he regards himself as Irish still.  Secondly, if they are not of Irish extraction, it is very much to the advantage of this country that young people should come from England, France and further afield, to Ireland and learn to understand the Irish attitude to things and go back with a friendly and understanding outlook on this country.  They are in a sense honorary ambassadors when they go back to their own homes, and that consideration is not to be neglected.</P>
    <P>Further, there is one very good cash argument to show that if we did subsidise these overseas students, we would not be wasting money.  I mentioned this before, but it should be kept constantly in mind.  Every one of these students from overseas brings into the city of Dublin approximately £300 a year, possibly a little less but certainly over £250 a year.  On the present Estimate, they are being subsidised to the extent of approximately £70 a year.  I reckon there is a net gain to the city of Dublin and the people of Ireland of something like £200 a year from each of these students who come to one of our colleges from overseas.  Even as expenditure on the tourist trade, that would be fully justified.  Of course, that is not the main argument.  The main argument is that Ireland has always been hospitable to people from overseas who want to come and study here.  It would be against our <Col N="1689" /> historical tradition, and short-sighted, for the Government to make a discrimination in awarding grants to the universities between Irish nationals and non-nationals.</P>
    <P>There is one other matter.  It is not a popular thing to refer to, but, in all frankness, one must refer to it.  It is not our fault in Trinity College that we have not a larger proportion of Irish students.  At the moment, the proportion is approximately 50 per cent. of Irish to 50 per cent. of overseas. The reason is perfectly clear and I shall not elaborate on it.  It would be wrong for me to do so, but I think it is right for me to mention it.  We are under an ecclesiastical ban.  If we were not under that ecclesiastical ban, we would have far more Irish students.  I do not think it is presumptuous to say that.  If they are prepared to come from London, France, Germany, Switzerland, I imagine they would come from Kerry and Mayo, too.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamStanford" hpid="Professor Stanford Professor Stanford">
      <NameTxt>Professor Stanford</NameTxt>
      <P>No, but I am just taking care that the Government are aware that the disproportion of students in T.C.D. is due to circumstances which are largely not under the control of the college.  If instead of these thousand or so overseas students, we could have a thousand Irish people to fill up the places, nobody would be better pleased than we, and I assure the Minister and the House that there is always absolute preference given to Irish students coming to the college.</P>
      <P>Perhaps I have laboured that point. I am sorry if I have, but it is a fact we must reckon with.  I come back now to what I began with, that there is disproportion within these Estimates. University College has got a very big share of the cake.  We are glad there is a big-sized cake and wish it were bigger, but we should like to know why the cake was cut up in that way and whether the proportion is based on the ground of national and non-national students.  It would be a narrow and illiberal policy, if it were so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another matter I wish to <Col N="1690" /> mention.  There is a kind of trade or business in this country which is suffering at the moment and deserves relief. I have no financial interest in it, but I attend their meeting-places perhaps once a month.  That is my total interest.  I refer to the cinemas.  At the moment, they are being very hard hit by taxes.  I have figures here which I am sure the Minister has seen.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamOBuachalla" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I trust the Senator will not go further into that matter because it is one that relates to the Finance Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamStanford" hpid="Professor Stanford Professor Stanford">
      <NameTxt>Professor Stanford</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall pass from that but if there is a further opportunity to think favourably of them, I hope the Minister will take it.</P>
      <P>The next matter definitely does come within the Bill before us.  It is something that has never in my memory been raised in the House, within the past ten or eleven years, that is. We do know the importance of our fisheries and we are lucky in having an energetic and efficient Minister for Lands and Fisheries.  But I wanted to draw his attention and the Government's attention to a fault in the development of our harbours.  This is derived from personal experience in Dunmore East, County Waterford, last August.  It was necessary for the harbour to be dredged&mdash;and we cannot have efficient fisheries or any industry carried by ships unless our harbours are kept in proper condition. During the month of August, I had a very good opportunity to observe from close quarters the working of one of the dredgers of the Board of Works. The Board of Works has three dredgers as the House probably knows, and these chiefly attend to the three national ports, Dun Laoghaire, Dunmore East and Cobh.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My impression is&mdash;and it was shared by many notable people in that small but important harbour in the south of Ireland&mdash;that the ship itself was completely out of date.  The machinery was inadequate and inefficient. We must have proper equipment if we are to do this job quickly. Secondly, the way of working this out-of-date ship was deplorably inefficient. <Col N="1691" /> Much of that kind of work depends on the state of the tide.  It seemed to us&mdash;and we knew a bit about the sea&mdash;that the ship simply worked on something like office hours, so that if the tide was unfavourable, no work might be done, and when the tide was favourable it might be out of working hours and so no work was done, either.  The result was inefficiency and delay and very great inconvenience to the users of the port of Dunmore East.  Worst of all&mdash;and this is what we are fighting in this House&mdash;there was a sense of frustration and inefficiency.  To see out of date machinery being worked inefficiently is no encouragement to those who want the country to progress.</P>
    <P>I could say a good deal more about that, but I would urge the Minister and the Minister for Lands and those in charge of the Office of Public Works to give particular attention to their method of dredging at the moment.  I can only say that it is not adequate for what we hope to do with the harbours and fisheries in future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>There are one or two matters to which I should like to draw the Minister's attention, but it seems that I am rather restricted in the time at my disposal.  However, as you were kind enough to call on me, I feel that I should avail of the opportunity to express a view that is in total disagreement with something the Minister is doing and it is better that we should have it out here.  At least, I should be glad to hear his point of view on it because I daresay he has reasons for what he is doing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is not only a collector of taxes but also disburses the taxes. As I have said on numerous occasions in this House, when handling the affairs of the Department of Finance, he must be concerned not only with securing the taxes in any year, but must always try to look ahead&mdash;at least, I should hope that he would&mdash; and consider the possibilities for his successors.  There must be people to pay taxes and people must be engaged in profitable enterprises in order <Col N="1692" /> to be able to pay taxes.  The first question that arises for consideration by all of us is a question to which Senator Kissane gave some attention, that is, have we the people and will we have the people?  How optimistic are we about that?  How optimistic is the Minister?</P>
    <P>To-day there was a quotation given in the House from Dr. Lucey, Bishop of Cork.  The Minister for Education expressed the view that if a member of the Hierarchy or anybody else thought that the Government were complacent about the problem of emigration, that would not be representative of the facts.  I do not think that any of us who thinks of a future Irish nation can be complacent about the problem of emigration.  I am completely with the Bishop of Cork or any other bishop or layman, Senator or Deputy, who says that sufficient attention is not being given to this problem. It is the gravest problem confronting the country.  I know Senator Kissane for a long time and I have very great respect for him.  I should like to hear him discussing that problem in a more realistic fashion.  From figures which the Minister for Education quoted here to-day it would appear that he was ready to accept that 48,000 of our people went to England last year and got social security cards there and that that was the measure of our emigration. I am not good at figures but figures have been quoted which showed that 57,000 or 58,000 people emigrated in the previous year.  Senator Kissane was inclined to blame the predecessors of the Government for that.  I would suggest that only 48,000 people went last year because there were only 48,000 to go.  That is the grave situation as I see it.</P>
    <P>The problem of emigration is being constantly adverted to, but I do not see any intensive effort made to study the real causes of emigration.  We all know that people who are in employment in this country emigrate.  The desertion of the countryside and small towns and, indeed, some of the large towns, is such that if the problem is not grappled with soon, there will not be an Irish nation.  The reduction of the number of consumers in the small towns is a major problem for the business community <Col N="1693" /> there.  This problem is not being studied close to the source.  I do not know that any body of people have tried to discover from those who emigrate the reason for their emigration or have tried to study this serious problem on the spot, to learn why it was impossible for the people to stay at home, whether the reason was psychological, economic or did a boy leave because the girl with whom he was in love had already gone?  When the Bishop of Cork speaks as he does about emigration, he is not the only Bishop who could speak in that way. There are many Bishops in the remoter areas who see the day not far distant when there will be one priest in a parish where there are now two and perhaps the time when one priest will do for two parishes.  Who will be in the Minister's position then to solve the problem of finding over £100,000,000 to administer the country?</P>
    <P>I would urge that all of us should be much more realistic about this problem and, instead of being hurt, offended and bothered by those, whether Churchmen or laymen, who have the courage to speak out about this problem, should say what they know about it and make their contribution to a solution of the problem. It is because that is not being done that many people are being discouraged by the situation as they see it.</P>
    <P>There is a decision that has been taken by the Minister and, I presume, by the Government.  I do not know in how far they were guided by the monumental work that Senator Burke has before him and by the White Paper.  I want to protest against the decision of the Government in transferring funds from the Land Project to the fertiliser scheme.  I do not want to be misunderstood.  I was on a deputation 30 years ago from the Committee of Agriculture in Cavan to the then Minister to urge that a scheme to subsidise fertilisers would be put into operation.  It took a long time to get that distance.  If we had started to grow grass then, and had not abused the people who wanted to grow better grass then, we would have much more grass to-day and many more cattle and the total economy would be much <Col N="1694" /> stronger than it is.  Frankly, I find it difficult to conceive why the Minister took this decision, if all the facts were available to him.</P>
    <P>A great deal of the land of this country is marginal land.  There are people living on that marginal land&mdash; producers.  I would say that 50 per cent. of the land of the Republic might be termed marginal land.  There are areas, say, Louth, Meath, portions of Westmeath and other Leinster counties, North Cork, Waterford, Wexford, where there is good land but a great deal of the land is poor, really marginal land.  Its ability to produce will be measured by the amount of kindness we can give to it.</P>
    <P>The first point is this.  There are people still living there, although they are dying out.  On that point, I had a discussion recently with a young professional man in my own county. We talked about an area which I knew well.  It is an area seven miles in length &mdash;portion of three parishes.  There were hundreds of families there when I was growing up.  I could name one after another the people who lived over most of that area.  This young professional man said to me that there was not a marriage there in a generation. When the stock that is there goes, it will be the last and there will be a whole countryside of seven miles without a human being.  The people who are there are living on marginal land&mdash; the kind of land that benefited under Section B of the Land Project.  That is being scotched now.</P>
    <P>I want to put this to the Minister.  I am quite certain they are trying to do the best thing, although I may say that it is freely circulated&mdash;it is a very tragic thing if it should be so&mdash;in my county that this change was made in the scheme because of the man who introduced it.  If that is so, it would be dreadful.  That has been circulated. What I want to put to the Minister is this.  I have not got all the figures, but I understand that last year we had allocated to Section B of the land project £900,000.  That is dropped. Presumably a fair amount of that money is to be added now to Section A. I do not think that in my county <Col N="1695" /> Section A will take the place of Section B.</P>
    <P>Let me explain for the benefit of the members who may not understand Section A and Section B of the land project.  I live on a small farm of bad land.  I was brought up on a small farm of bad land and I know what bad land is. I am not the only member of the House in that position.  Senator O'Reilly could tell you what his area is like and what the effect of the land project work would be there.</P>
    <P>Under Section B, I was able to have my land drained and fertilised by the Government machinery.  They gave a grant and portion of the charge was met by me, but the portion which I had to meet was added to my land purchase annuity.  It was not necessary for me or any of my neighbours to put any cash down at all.  That has now been dropped.  Under Section A, the grant was given and the balance of the money which the scheme cost had to be paid out by the owner of the land. Since this decision was taken, I have had experience of a scheme made for a small farm of 30 acres which was to cost £1,200.  The sum of £900 would be available for a grant and the farmer would have to put down £300. In addition to that, he would have to find the contractor and pay him as the work was executed.  He would have to wait until the job was completed before getting any of the grant.  That closed down that scheme as far as our county was concerned, as well as the west of Ireland, the western seaboard and the poorer areas in the Midlands.</P>
    <P>I think it was a great error of judgment to do that.  It showed, in my opinion, a reckless disregard of the conditions under which the small farmer on bad land is living.  Senator Kissane addressed himself to the value of the fertiliser scheme.  I am all with him in that.  I have experience of it. I have been advocating it.  I have tried, by word and example, to advocate it. I believe that fertilisers can bring us considerable benefits and if the other resources are available to us, we can realise the benefit of better grass.</P>
    <P>Money is being transferred from the land project, from a poor county like <Col N="1696" /> Cavan, and is being made available for the purchase of fertilisers in Meath, Westmeath, Tipperary, Kildare and elsewhere to men who have 200 or 300 acres of land.  They will be subsidised to purchase manures.  That is a very good thing, but it is altogether wrong that the money which was necessary to improve the wet land in the poorer counties should be transferred to do that job.</P>
    <P>The truth is that the members of this House who know anything about farming know quite well that if you have undrained soil, it is practically worthless.  Certainly, you will not get the benefits from the application of fertilisers that you will get if you drain the water away.  If you put on lime, phosphate and nitrogen, with the wet land, you will not get the temperature up for a month later than you would if you had the water drained away.  That is my experience.  You apply nitrogen to soil from which you get no value at all.</P>
    <P>I feel there must not be a clear appreciation of the wrong this is to the thousands of small farmers all over Ireland.  Apart from that, in my county, we had between 200 and 300 men employed under Section B of this scheme.  Some of these men came to me and asked me what they would do.  Some of them were packing up to go to England because there was nothing else for them.  They were working on and improving the land. They were giving something to the farmer which the farmer was unable to provide for himself.  They made him a much more efficient person as a producer and a taxpayer in the State.</P>
    <P>Some said this was costing too much per acre.  I am quite certain that you can cite me instances of the high cost per acre over a limited number of acres.  That is true&mdash;at least, I believe it is true.  I have heard of these fantastic figures, but they are not average figures, nor are they representative of what the work cost over the country as a whole.  A really good job was done.  Even if the cost of the scheme was £30, £40 or £50 per acre, you had land at the end of it.  You had something from which you could produce and you had land upon which <Col N="1697" /> families could live.  The attitude of many of the people is to leave and clear away.</P>
    <P>The standards of life in the country to-day are such that people want more.  They desire more.  They are not able to get it from 20 or 30 acres of poor land.  The Dutch reclaim land from the sea at more than £100 per acre.  I have been there and I have seen it myself.  They have got land for centuries to come at £100 per acre.  If you take it for ten years, is not that a rent of £10 per acre?  If you take it for 20 years, is that not a rent of £5 per acre and if you take it for 50 years, is that not a rent of £2 per acre?  Yet we talk about spending £20, £30 or £40 per acre.  You have got something brand new; something that is a tremendous asset to the country.  It is a new conquest and we are doing the conquering ourselves. It is something we should continue and something of which we should be proud.</P>
    <P>Presumably the Minister has figures, or can find figures, of what the cost of reclamation in Bangor Erris would be, but I would suggest it would be a higher figure.  I do not know what the figure was for the 1,000 or 2,000 acres which the sugar company have so magnificently reclaimed in Galway, but, whatever it was, they have got land which they had not before.  Certainly, I think you will get this land drained and equipped for the future at a lower cost than that at which you would take a congest from the west and allocate good land in the east to him.  I wish the Minister would look into this matter again, because, in my opinion, he has taken a decision which will depress a great many people up and down the country. It is a decision that will reduce employment in the countryside, where valuable employment was previously being given.  That decision has shown a lack of sense in trying to maintain a balance in our economy, something for which I could hardly find an explanation.</P>
    <P>I want to say a few words in regard to the eradication of tuberculosis in our cattle herds and I only wish more time were available to me <Col N="1698" /> because that subject is of tremendous importance.  Indeed, it is fundamental to our whole economy.  It is comforting to know that the Minister and his colleagues now see the value of our cattle economy.  I do not want to go over past events, but it is unfortunate that we did not previously have a truer appraisal of what was of real interest to the country in earlier years.  If we had had that, I should say that public expenditure to-day would not be half the burden and half the worry it is.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture has very considerable difficulties in promoting the scheme for the eradication of bovine T.B.  It is a tremendous undertaking and maybe in some respects he is not getting as much co-operation as he ought to get.  It is the duty of everybody in the country to give the maximum co-operation in this matter.  We are implementing the scheme because we have to.  We ought to have done it earlier, but, at any rate, we are doing it now.  There are, however, certain aspects of the problem about which I am not happy and I should like to know if there is a completely thought out policy in regard to it.  If there is, I should like to hear more about it.</P>
    <P>We have areas in the west which are first to be stocked with healthy cattle.  Then the scheme will come into the east, and the southern counties are being left for later on.  In some of those southern counties at present, it operates only in so far as the farmers themselves are taking on the responsibility of trying to clear their herds. Everyone who can speak on this matter ought to urge the farmers to participate in the scheme, because our whole position is dependent on our ability to furnish a clean bill of health very soon in regard to our cattle stocks.</P>
    <P>The aspect of the problem which perturbs me most is that the figures indicate that we have 83,100 more cattle this year than last year.  It does not matter what side of the House talk comes from in boasting about what we have achieved in the strengthening of our economy.  Over the years, that is about all we have done in <Col N="1699" /> strengthening our economy&mdash;increasing our cattle stocks.  We may have some more industries, but I do not wish to deal with that aspect of our economy, or how the value and output of them has increased the taxable value of the people who own them and the people who work in them; but, as far as agriculture is concerned, we all know the kind of year last year was.  What I want to say is that these 83,000 odd cattle are young cattle and I doubt if any of them will be available for export this year.  In the main they are yearlings or, perhaps, between one and two years old.</P>
    <P>I have examined the figures in regard to one county, a county which, so far as I know, has not yet been attacked in regard to the eradication of T.B.  The last figures I saw showed that there are 113,000 cows in it.  There are 5,000 in-calf heifers and the figures which I have seen would indicate that nearly 50 per cent. of the cows there are reactors.  Therefore, when we go to clear that county &mdash;one of the vital counties in our whole dairy set-up and where the mothers of the cattle of the future are to be found&mdash;we will have to find 60,000 cows or heifers in calf in one year for that county, if the breeding stock is to be kept up.</P>
    <P>That is not the only county where things are pretty bad and I should like to know what plan the Minister for Agriculture has in his mind, or is in the minds of the Cabinet, as to where the replacements will be found. Have we a plan about all this?  We ought to have a plan.  I do not know quite how, but we ought to be encouraging each farmer not to sell any of his female stock at all, if he can keep them, mate them, and prepare them to be mothers of herds for a number of years to come.  If not, the net result of the scheme for the eradication of bovine T.B. may be that we may end up with 150,000 fewer cattle than we have at present.  If that happens, we shall be up against another problem in regard to our balance of payments.</P>
    <P>If that should happen, there would be great difficulty in building up our <Col N="1700" /> economy to the position of strength in which it was before this scheme was attempted.  If that goes on, side by side with a decreasing population and all the other difficulties under which we labour, I could not be optimistic that either the Minister, or any successor of his, would find it very easy to provide the finances which the machinery of government will demand in the future.  Perhaps there may be others in the House who would like to address themselves to this problem. I know that many schemes have been placed before the Ministry by spokesmen for agriculture, as to how we can do better in the eradication of T.B., but, a producer of milk gets no more for the milk from an accredited herd than he gets for the milk from a herd, 50 or 60 per cent. of which are reactors to the tuberculin test.</P>
    <P>If we are to make progress in this scheme, I believe that the people who are progressive will have to be paid something for what they have put into their efforts towards progress.  These were the matters I wanted to direct the Minister's attention to.  Perhaps they were not put as coherently, or with as much taste, as the Minister would like to hear them advanced, but I think they are fundamental to our whole economy.  The solution of these problems will be of great importance to the country's future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardMcGuire" hpid="Mr. McGuire Mr. McGuire">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGuire</NameTxt>
      <P>We have had a very interesting discourse from Senator Baxter on the agricultural side of the economy and I propose to deal with the other side, namely, industry, which is more in my line.  To begin with, the figure appearing on the Book of Estimates is an increase on the previous year's figure.  It is £115,500,000. It seems to be impossible to arrest this upward climb and perhaps the Minister has done his best this year, certainly on the expenditure side, to cut the bill, but it still mounts.  The &ldquo;Economic Survey&rdquo; stresses the necessity for lower taxation when it says: &ldquo;High taxation is one of the greatest impediments to economic progress.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There seems to be little hope of any reduction in taxation this year, even <Col N="1701" /> though such reduction is so badly needed.  Ministers and economists for years past have been stressing the importance of reducing taxation, but it seems to be impossible to do so.  I suppose the only thing we can do now is just to deplore that fact.</P>
    <P>I wish to drop the complaining note and not to be taken as complaining when I speak of what we have done or failed to do in the past in our industrial and commercial activities. On the contrary, I would say we can be pleased with the comparatively high degree of industrial development achieved here so far, but I think it is evident that we have now reached the point when new ideas, plans and incentives must be forthcoming, if we are to achieve the continued expansion in industry and production that we need for the future.  The need has become increasingly apparent for a plan for industrial expansion based on solid business and economic principles &mdash;I have repeatedly referred to this necessity myself year after year&mdash; rather than upon the very often purely, or heavily, political and social considerations we have applied to these problems in the past.</P>
    <P>I welcome the principles that have been stressed in the &ldquo;Economic Survey&rdquo;, the White Paper, and the Capital Investment Committee's Report.  Their emphasis on the proposition that obedience to the economic laws must come first, if we are to have the improved social conditions we aspire to, is a very timely&mdash;in fact, almost a tardy&mdash;reminder of the fact that it is necessary for us&mdash;absolutely vital&mdash;in future to have regard to the economic laws in business affairs, if we are to solve the industrial, social and political problems which will face us in the future.</P>
    <P>The common theme of the &ldquo;Economic Survey&rdquo;, the White Paper and the Capital Investment Committee's Report is the vital necessity for productive investment in industry and agriculture by both the Government and private enterprise in order to achieve our aims. It is obvious that a favourable industrial atmosphere must exist and also that a realistic industrial philosophy <Col N="1702" /> must prevail.  By this, I mean that economic rather than political considerations must come first.  Up to now in many cases, political and social considerations took priority over the economic facts of life.  I do not know that we should deplore that happening up to this because we had a lot of social leeway to make up and we had a lot of what is called infra-structure to build up, but I think we now realise&mdash;and I am glad we do&mdash;that it is time to go out on purely business lines for the future with this infra-structure built up underneath upon which the new industrial structure can be erected.</P>
    <P>There are still some suggestions from some quarters that the Government should push on further with State enterprise, while leaving private enterprise as a secondary preoccupation, but the emphasis in the &ldquo;Economic Survey&rdquo; is on the necessity for a drive to expand the private enterprise economy.  It says that the sphere of private investment is the one on which every individual in this country must mainly rely for its progress.  I quote from the <i>Banking Journal</i> of December last:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The encouragement of private enterprise involves the creation of an atmosphere of public confidence which depends on the existence of a suitable infra-structure of business investment&rdquo;</P>
    <P>&mdash;this we already have&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;but still more on the maintenance of low-cost production and low taxation.  Public investment will, in the long run, prove impossible unless private business is healthy and progressive because it is from the surplus created by private enterprise that the necessary savings are created.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This is the answer to those who want to go on with still more State enterprises, without realising that further State enterprise cannot be made possible, unless the private enterprise economy which produces the wealth to carry out State enterprise is itself prospering and developing.  Therefore, if we want further expansion of State enterprise, we must follow the advice <Col N="1703" /> of the &ldquo;Economic Survey&rdquo; and turn our attention with more enthusiasm and zeal to the development of private enterprise.  I welcome the White Paper in that it has announced its agreement with this policy and proposition. Furthermore, it has announced the intention in future to press on with the encouragement of private enterprise activity.</P>
    <P>There are two considerations in building up an industrial economy and these, I suggest are, first, that an industrial enterprise to be successful, must be located in the place best suited to its operation from the economic point of view, where the best power is available, the best transport and so on.  Location is, therefore, of great importance.  The second consideration is the atmosphere, the national and local atmosphere, in which it operates.  The Capital Investment Committee's report states:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Mere schemes of work for work's sake do not add to the total employment in the community, since they must be paid for by reductions in consumption in other directions.  For the same reason the committee does not favour uneconomic localisation of industry with the object of curing local pockets of unemployment.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Further, it states:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;New employment will be most effectively created by a rational localisation of production.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In other words, we should exploit our national advantages and locations to the best advantage.</P>
    <P>It is important that these activities should move with, and not against, nature.  The artificial placing of industries where they are unsuitable and uneconomic should be avoided in future.  I quite agree that up to now such action was very often well meant, the idea being to establish industries for the purpose of giving local employment. In a great number of cases, these misplaced industries have proved uneconomic and very disappointing in the long run, not only to the economy <Col N="1704" /> generally, but even to the places where they are located.  I grant that there have been some successful ventures, but if one does enough of anything, one is sure to get some degree of success, but I think the success in many cases was very dearly bought. In the long run, it is a short-sighted, wasteful and disappointing policy to do this.</P>
    <P>The reason is obvious.  Success in industry cannot be achieved in locations that unnecessarily increase the cost of production, especially now when we must produce goods capable of competition in the export market. Naturally, the efficient business man will study the natural advantages and disadvantages of every locality before committing himself to an industrial concern in any case.</P>
    <P>Decentralisation of industry, which is part of this problem, is desirable. But decentralisation of industry is a different thing from scattering industry. If you scatter industry all over the place you merely get uneconomic conditions and waste of all kinds.  What I should like to see is centralisation in situations around the country where the conditions necessary for successful industrial enterprise are present.  There was an excellent article in the <i>Irish Times</i> on this subject some weeks ago and I have taken my line from it.  I do not propose to quote it in full but I shall mention some of the points in it with which I agree.</P>
    <P>The kind of decentralisation that should be adopted in future plans should be one in which industries are grouped around towns and areas which are naturally suitable for economic industrial enterprise, places with good road and rail communications and ready access to the sea, in order to have ready availability of raw materials and also the speedy transport both to and from the concerns. We are happy in that we have such places with ready access to the sea for the purpose of getting in raw materials and exporting finished products&mdash;such places as Cork, Waterford, Limerick, Wexford, Dundalk, Drogheda, Galway and Sligo.  That is the right kind of decentralisation&mdash;<Col N="1705" /> the placing of our industries as far as possible around those areas.  Such action would result in the development of a number of strong pockets of industry, where a tradition of skill and a pool of skilled workers would be built up.  An era of stability and prosperity would be established in these localities.  This would do much to make these towns attractive places in which to work and live.  Ultimately we would have not only an economic form of industrial life in these areas but a minimising of the tendency to emigrate from these towns and to trek to either Dublin or England.</P>
    <P>There is widespread criticism of the centralisation of industry and centralisation generally in Dublin.  It is being condemned as being an unnatural concentration. But the fact of the matter is that it is really not an unnatural concentration.  It is happening in other countries, and it is not even unusual. In present-day Europe, in Italy, France, Austria, Denmark and many other countries, this same phenomenon is apparent&mdash;this trek to the cities away from the country.  By adopting this principle of centralisation around our other cities, we might avoid Dublin becoming too much of a giant and too top heavy.</P>
    <P>While on the subject of Dublin, I think it is bad policy, if people want to build industries in Dublin, that they should be prevented from doing so. Again, we ought to obey the economic law.  It is much better, even if Dublin became bigger, to have Irishmen employed in Dublin rather than having them go to Birmingham and other places in England.  It is a question of employing Irish people in Ireland.  If Dublin is the only place where industry can be set up to employ them, there should be no Government policy to prevent these industries from being set up here.  From now on, we ought to avoid setting up industries in unsuitable areas for purely political or even good social reasons.  Ultimately, they are not good social reasons because these industries will ultimately, fail.  They are bound to fail unless, of course, they are bolstered up indefinitely by unnatural protection and sops of all kinds, which I do not <Col N="1706" /> think we can continue to afford on any large scale in the future.</P>
    <P>Dublin has the advantage of accessibility and transport, but there is one matter to which I feel it is necessary to refer.  In fact, I have been asked to do so.  As I said, an all-important factor in a benevolent climate for industrial enterprise is access to raw materials and speedy transport to and from factories.  The climate existing throughout our transport system is an essential factor in our productivity, exports and competitive potential generally.  It is high time the spotlight was thrown on the appalling situation at the port of Dublin.  This is now the only port in Ireland&mdash;probably in these islands, if not in the whole of Europe&mdash;where container traffic is banned, in the face of its obvious necessity, its endorsement by official trade union circles and a recent recommendation by the Labour Court that at least a fair trial should be given for a limited period to this generally accepted mode of transporting goods.  In addition, whereas the national agreement regarding unofficial strikes has been generally honoured, to the credit of trade unions and employers alike, unfortunately the spirit of the agreement has not fully penetrated to the port.</P>
    <P>At this moment an unofficial strike in Dublin port has led to a hold-up in the discharge of 234 tons of seed wheat, which it is essential should be sown within the next ten days.  A consignment of car parts, vital to the continued employment of a substantial number of men, is similarly frozen in the hold of that ship and the export of a large quantity of stout is prohibited by the same action on the part of a handful of dockers who, in breach of their agreement and in defiance of their union, have taken the law into their own hands.</P>
    <P>It would be well, when we are considering the general economic future of the country, that the Minister should give serious attention to acts like these, which, given the existence of recognised trade unions and of collective bargaining machinery second to none, should be no part of the conduct of any section of the community.  The dispute <Col N="1707" /> arises over the withdrawal by the company of preference cards from men who refused stevedores' instructions to load six bundles of tubing weighing five tons in a hoist which by agreement is admitted to carry ten tons.  The difference in labour cost renders the handling completely uneconomic.  I feel it is my duty to refer to this.</P>
    <P>If we are to have any law and order in the future in our industrial economy, it is necessary that all concerned should pull together.  If our industrial life is to be upset by irresponsible actions by either employers or workers or by restrictive practices, all the best intentions of any Government or any business people will be frustrated.  I shall not say any more about that.</P>
    <P>I have referred to the location of industries and the necessity for having them in the proper location and now I should like to refer to the atmosphere which is necessary if our industrial enterprises are to be as successful as we would like to them to be in the future. We need efficient businessmen as well as having industries in the right place, but in order to attract such people and create good industries, the business atmosphere should be made as attractive as possible.  I have already said that a good businessman wants to operate in the best possible place, but he also wants to make an attractive profit, and that applies to our own people as well as foreigners.  We know that the main idea of going into business is to make a profit and having made a profit, one desires to be allowed to keep a reasonable measure of it.  Any conscientious businessman requires his profit, not so much to spend on himself, because a really good businessman will not spend much on himself, but to plough it back into his business and create more capital and more production; in other words, to have that self-generating capital which we badly need in this country.</P>
    <P>As regards foreign investors, it is not sufficient to tell a foreign investor that it would be profitable for him to come here.  He must be convinced that to come here promises a more profitable investment than elsewhere.  Last year, <Col N="1708" /> when I was making the same suggestion, the Minister said that taxation here was no worse than elsewhere.  I do not think that is the real answer to this proposition.  The great advantage that we could have in this country, to outweigh the disadvantages, would be a really attractive taxation code, as applicable to industries, for the building up of capital and giving reasonable profits.  I think the taxation incentive is the best weapon we could use.  It would be irresistible and would produce very fruitful results.</P>
    <P>It is not just enough to be no worse than other countries; we should be much better in this regard, especially as we are in the initial stages of industrial development.  However, I think we have seen the light in this taxation question.  On the question of exports and the remission of tax for ten years which the Government now offer, even from a long term view, that is only a very small sop and it will have to be very much improved, if we are to get the atmosphere that will produce the dynamic increases which are absolutely vital.</P>
    <P>Before I leave this point, I should like to quote again from the <i>Irish Banking Review</i> of December last.  It says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Government can do a great deal to create an atmosphere favourable to private investment which needs confidence, security and the hope of profit.  Domestic interests must be encouraged to save more and to repatriate some of their external holdings and foreign investments. The best contribution the Government can make is to keep taxation low and favourable to enterprise.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I should also like to refer to one other remark in the Government's White Paper.  On page 9, it says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;No programme of economic development will be successful unless the people have the will to work.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I need not say this as coming only from me, for it is a general opinion, that one of the greatest dis-incentives to the will to work at present in this country is high taxation.  That applies not only to employers and to owners <Col N="1709" /> of businesses, but to workers as well. To work harder and to earn more is merely to incur more and more heavy taxation, and therefore this question of taxation is of primary importance and will have to be considered if harder work is to be forthcoming.  It is extraordinary that the brochures which have been brought out tell prospective industrialists about the attractions of Ireland&mdash;about subsidies, grants and protection&mdash;but are never able to tell much about reliefs in taxes.  Tax reliefs are a primary inducement and if offered, a lot of these other things would not be necessary.</P>
    <P>I shall conclude by summarising in a few words what I have said.  I have stated that for the stimulation and expansion of existing productive enterprise, more and greater incentives for profitable trading are required and, as an addendum to that, I would say that something should be done about removing the new taxes and heavier rates on people who make additions to their businesses and carry out improvements to their premises.  It seems quite crazy that when a man spends more money on his premises, and on creating greater facilities for better trading, he should be penalised for doing so.  In other words, at a time when he is spending more money he is asked to hand out still more money to the State or to the local authority, in penalty, as it were, for being progressive.</P>
    <P>Secondly, for the creation of new industries it is highly important to have regard to the economic suitability of the location of the enterprise and also to provide a healthy economic climate in which a good profit incentive will be an irresistible driving force leading to the success of the enterprise.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel we should all congratulate ourselves on reaching the Central Fund Bill with only a few hours in which to discuss it after talking for the past few weeks, not about what the Government should do, but who was to do it.  I feel that the Government, having forced that upon us, have left us very little time to talk about this Bill.  The general increase <Col N="1710" /> of £4,000,000, in my view, gives very little hope to that part of the community on which we all depend, namely, the farming community.  The only ray of hope which is left is the fertiliser subsidy.</P>
      <P>I note that we are to borrow the fertiliser subsidy.  I was intrigued last night to hear Senator O'Donovan referring to the borrowing as probably not being quite the right course to follow for the very reason that fertiliser is not a permanent thing.  The application of fertiliser is something which a good farmer engages in, but which is not lasting.  Some fertilisers are more lasting than others, but from my own experience, they are not permanent. Nitrogenous fertiliser is not permanent, nor is phosphate, or burned phosphatic rock and after 24 months, the effects have gone.  Therefore, as the farming community, in the last analysis, must pay for everything, then it is right that they should know this fertiliser subsidy which is being given to them will eventually be paid for by them, as this is borrowed money which has to be paid back by the citizens.</P>
      <P>I agree that it was a grave mistake to have financed this fertiliser subsidy by the removal of Section B of the land project.  In my own case, I have applied for the Section A grant and I do not even know what I am to get. It is unfair that the man on the poorer land, who now will have to pay more, can no longer benefit from Section B of the land project.</P>
      <P>The fertiliser subsidy is an excellent thing.  I think it would have been done long ago but for certain inherent dangers.  While approving completely of it, it is no harm to mention these inherent dangers.  The main inherent danger is that the source of phosphatic fertiliser is controlled by one group and the entry of the rock phosphate into this country is exclusively through one international cartel.  It has been a fact over the years past that on the price charged for this rock&mdash;and it is from this rock that our fertiliser manufacturers manufacture their phosphate&mdash;we pay a subsidy of £4 a ton.</P>

    <P>The price of this rock was based not on the cost of production but on what the international cartel believed the <Col N="1711" /> Irish farmer could pay.  While that cannot be done blatantly now, there is a grave danger that, over the following years, this international cartel will again relate the price they charges for their phosphatic rock to the Irish manufacturers to what they believe the Irish farmer can pay, taking into account whatever the fertiliser subsidy per ton may be.  There is that grave danger there.  I hope it will not result in the subsidy being negatived.  I hope the Government will keep a very keen eye on that aspect of the matter in the years to come.</P>
    <P>The political opportunity in the fertiliser subsidy has not been neglected. Every seller of fertiliser cannot show the price of superphosphate straight; he must show the price and then the reduction in respect of the Government subsidy.  If we introduced a fertiliser subsidy I think we would do the same but it is no harm to mention it in passing.</P>
    <P>The past two years have been marked by a realisation brought upon people who, up to that time, were adamant that such was not the case, that we are dependent entirely on our agricultural industry for our future and our present.  I name among the people who did not seem to have faith in that industry bank directors and members of the Government.  With all the crises there have been, with our balance of payments crisis in which the export of cattle became such an important factor; with our credit squeeze crisis which was possibly brought about for a purpose; with all our other crises that we can remember, people now realise that the only thing we have is our farming industry.</P>
    <P>When it became a fact that all but 11 counties of the British Isles were closed to our store cattle, something had to be done.  Something was done. We have the large figure of £3,500,000 rising from £1,820,000 last year, voted for the eradication of boving T.B. However, that is entirely a general capital charge upon the country.  It is treated&mdash;because it is put into the capital side of the Estimates&mdash;as a capital charge.  I submit it is not a capital charge upon the farmers.  It is <Col N="1712" /> a capital charge upon the country.  If we do not spend that money, the man working in Capel Street is in as much danger of losing his remuneration as the man who works in Leitrim, Cavan or Louth.  That being so, the problem must naturally be faced and, if it is faced naturally, and we concede that point, we find that the figure given of a net increase in the Vote for Agriculture of £1,831,650 is reduced to a real net increase of nearly £200,000.</P>
    <P>After such a disastrous year and with the admission by all that we have nothing left for our agricultural sector, I think that is not sufficient and is entirely inadequate.  All the efforts the Government made&mdash;and I have no doubt they made them, as all Governments would&mdash;to reduce the amount of money in this Book of Estimates were brought to nought.  I believe they were largely brought to nought by the wholesale removal of the food subsidies in the 1957 Budget.  It is a fact that the effect of this is progressive and probably has not reached the end of its course by now.</P>
    <P>When sitting on the Louth County Council I had the opportunity of examining the estimates that came before us there last year.  I had the opportunity to learn that last year, when we met all the spectacular increases for our institutions, they were in the column referred to as &ldquo;Food, drink and tobacco.&rdquo;  This year, the spectacular increases were in the column &ldquo;Salaries and goods to be bought.&rdquo;  People will succeed in getting the remuneration they deserve. the 10/- wage increase may have settled with the worker on the roads, may have settled with the insured worker, or should I say, the trade union worker.  It did not settle with all the higher officials of the salaried classes.  I do not grudge them the money; they must get their just remuneration.  However, the reason for the inability of the Government to reduce this figure of £115,000,000 to its previous figure of £4,000,000 lower is directly attributable to the progressive effect of the 1957 Budget.</P>
    <P>A complete analogy can be seen if one scrutinises the Estimates of 1952 and the struggle that had to be made in the year 1954-55 with the result of <Col N="1713" /> that wholesale and I think entirely mistaken removal of all the food subsidies.  I am not so innocent as to believe that if the Government could have left things exactly as they were they probably would not have done so.  However, the complete and sweeping removal of the subsidies could not be right if the subsidies were at all right in the first instance.  Nothing so sweeping could be done by a Government and yet be all right.  A lot of it had to be wrong.  The progressive result is having its effect and the difficulties of the country and the Government now can be attributed to the 1957 Budget.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to the pricing of industrial goods produced in this country in relation to the pricing of similar goods abroad.  We have here a very complete system of protection for goods manufactured in this country.  It is right that we should have that in many instances.  In a lot of instances, I think these protections should be reexamined periodically.  They are not reexamined. Once protection for a product is given it remains.</P>
    <P>I do not want to mention any particular product or company.  I know, however, of a product sold in this country at, say, a unit of 3d. and the price for the same product&mdash;a product produced in great volume&mdash;across the Border in Newry is 2d.  I can only deduce that in order to compete in the export market we are selling a lot of goods to our own people at much greater prices than are really necessary if we were to sell them based on the cost of production.  I know that all over the world this has to be done but I think that with our rather wholesale system of protection it should not be done without constant revision and constant attention to see to it that our own cost of living is not going up because, if it does, the gentlemen sitting behind the Minister and everybody else will get their just remuneration and the size of the bill in this Book of Estimates will go up year by year, as it always has gone up, as stated by Senator McGuire.</P>
    <P>Last year was a very good year for the production of butter and milk products.  As a result, the Government <Col N="1714" /> found themselves in difficulties.  They used a formula whereby one-third of the extra losses would be borne by the farmer and two-thirds by the Government. This year, we have had the opposite and the losses are far less. Yet the real reduction of one penny per gallon which the Government imposed on the dairy farmers has not been restored.  That is downright dishonesty. I believe these men are entitled to some increase.</P>
    <P>Great play was made, notably by the Minister for Lands, with agricultural marketing.  Steps were to be taken in England and that would be an excellent thing.  Advertising was to be used to put across our products, the packaging of every product was to be seen to, and the product was to be placed in every shop in English cities which sold that sort of thing, so that we could sell our agricultural products there under our own trade names.  What has happened?  Why is the Minister for Lands so silent now on this project?  Why is there not something in the Book of Estimates that shows us our agricultural market is being seen to?  Is it that one election is over and the next one is not nigh?  Is that the answer?  If it is, it is a very poor one.  Really and truly, the manner in which the creamery and dairy farmers of this country have been treated for the past 12 months is scandalous.  They have been made to suffer a reduction in price of one penny per gallon, and that reduction, as I say, has not been restored.  The carrot which was dangled in front of them has been removed because there is no election in the offing.</P>
    <P>I note, too, in this Book of Estimates, a reduction in the amount allocated for wheat losses&mdash;losses on disposal of wheat and payments to wheat growers&mdash;of £330,000.  The amount last year was £800,000 and the estimated amount this year is £470,000.  Does not that give a complete picture of the way in which the unfortunate wheat farmers were treated last harvest, during the most catastrophic period they ever experienced, and that by the Government which plastered wheat on every deadwall in the country, by the <Col N="1715" /> Government which railed at us when we had to reduce the price to a certain figure per barrel, but who, when they had to reduce the price by a further figure, proceeded to do so in so complicated a manner that many farmers do not know what they got for their wheat last year.  There were so many pluses, minuses, multiplications and deductions that the farmers do not know what they got.</P>
    <P>There is a motion on the Order Paper dealing with this matter which will, I presume, be discussed after Easter and, therefore, I do not want to go any further into it at the moment, except to say that the antipathy&mdash;and that is a mild word&mdash; which the Fianna Fáil Government have always shown to the agricultural community, except when they wanted their votes, is too well known now to be discussed&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Lest we find ourselves out of order, I shall continue. We have had great discussion about planes.  There are two things about the purchase of these jet planes.  One is the weakness of the Tánaiste for reverting to any of his brain-children. If they are taken from him, he is like a child who insists on having the toy which is on the top shelf.  An instance of that is the scheme to spend £5,000,000 on jet planes.  There is not a hope of getting a returns from that expenditure of £5,000,000 comparable with the return which would be got from an expenditure of £5,000,000 on the agricultural industry, on industrial development, on agricultural marketing and many other such things.  The people will not accept it and it is a political error for the Government. <Col N="1716" /> The other night I was in a certain place and I was in a room where, actually, a union group were meeting. They wanted to know if I would vote for an increase for painters employed by the Drogheda Corporation.  I found myself, God forgive me, defending the Government because they attacked me about old age pensions and I said: &ldquo;Gentlemen, I am all for you; I want to see the old age pensioner getting more, but may I make some little explanation of the Government's dilemma?&rdquo;  They said: &ldquo;Certainly.&rdquo; I said: &ldquo;Well, an increase of 2/6 represents a cost of £1,250,000.  Therefore, unfortunately, you will realise that from year to year the old age pensioners are the hardest people to satisfy.&rdquo;  A man at the back said: &ldquo;What about the £5,000,000 for the planes?&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Is it not true as was said here to-day &mdash;it was said by Senator Stanford&mdash; that we must look at this Book of Estimates on the basis of comparison.  If we are not in a position to help the old age pensioners, and, mind you, it is a social thing and a very important matter, we certainly must not spend £5,000,000 on these transatlantic planes that will not employ 1,000 or even 100 men.  They may, in fact, be of some little help to the tourist industry, but they certainly will not repay an expenditure of £5,000,000.</P>
      <P>I note there is merely a token sum for the payment of compensation to workers in the Dundalk Engineering Works.  Quite honestly, I am very pleased with what the Government have done in the Dundalk Engineering Works.  They were faced with a grave dilemma in which up to 1,000 people were about to become unemployed.  I do not wish to blame one Government or another&mdash;I do not think any blame can be apportioned&mdash;because the dilemma arose and having arisen, something had to be done about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Looking at it in a broad way, the only thing to be done was to try to start some sort of productive industry which would eventually stand on its own two feet.  The Government have undertaken to invest £1,500,000 and they are pressing forward with various companies they have instituted.  I wish <Col N="1717" /> them well and I am glad that merely a token sum is included in the Estimates for additional payments to persons who lose their employment in the Dundalk Engineering Works.  The Government have not won the race yet, and before they win it and re-employ the men who have been disemployed there, I may criticise them and criticise them severely.  I just want to say that to-day I am prepared to thank them for what they have done and that, as a Louth man, I appreciate it and I do not wish to criticise one Party or another.</P>
    <P>Senator McGuire very properly referred to the question of the availability of transport and of know-how in industry, and to the fact that industries must be situated in the right place wherever that may be.  I agree and I think it is far better that a man should move from the west of the Shannon to Dublin or Waterford or wherever the industry would be best placed.</P>
    <P>Take the case of America.  Some 30 years ago, 80 per cent. of the population of America lived on the land and 20 per cent. lived in the cities; now 80 cent. live on the land.  Birmingham will expert its pull on Galway just as Dublin will.  Many people have talked a lot of nonsense about emigration.  I am not in favour of it, but as long as it is there I can see that it is a factual thing about which no one can do very much, except by the manipulation of the productive influence to try to keep as many people at home as possible.</P>
    <P>I notice in the Department of Defence Estimate that the expenses of the equitation team have been reduced from £8,500 to £2,500.  The Army equitation team were our best diplomats abroad.  They did a great deal for the country.  They may not have made the connections which got factories, but in their halcyon days they undoubtedly were the ambassadors of Ireland abroad.  I know that we were very parsimonious towards them and that the men we sent to ride our horses in horse shows in America, Italy and elsewhere, even in Australia, were given very small allowances and that they had to attend at functions and spend money largely out of their own pockets.  I should like to hear an explanation <Col N="1718" /> of this Estimate from the Minister when he is concluding, and I hope that this reduction of £6,000 is not foreshadowing the end of the Army equitation team.  It would be a great mistakes if it were so.  We have not done them too well in the past.  I hope we shall do them better, or certainly not worse, in the future.</P>
    <P>As usual when Fianna Fáil is in office, there is a general increase in the Department of Defence Estimate.  The net increase of £355,840 brings the Estimate to £6,723,900.  The largest increase is in the pay of officers, cadets, N.C.O.s and privates, £215,731.  It is a lot of money.  I wonder if it is justified. I wonder if we need a larger Army.  The increase obviously foreshadows more men.  It is not an increase in the amount of pay; it is an increase in the numbers of men.  I think we are incorrect in having a greater Army and that we probably could do with a lesser one.  The Army men say to me that when the inter-Party Government were in power they had not got polish for their boots, but when Fianna Fáil are in power they can send out jet planes.  That may be a bit of honest speaking, but that is what they tell me.  While we may have erred a little the other way, it is better to cut down as much as possible on the Army Estimates, as long as they fulfil their obvious duty, rather than be too flaithiúlach with them.  While I wanted to see the Army equitation team kept at normal level, I think an increase of £350,000 in expenditure on the Army, in this year of grace, when things are not so good, is incorrect and should not have been allowed.</P>
    <P>Going back to what Senator Stanford said about comparisons, I should like to refer to the increase of £5,539 in the expenditure on the Peatland Experimental Station at Glenamoy to £47,785.  I well remember, before the days of the commission on this matter &mdash;when I was a member of Dáil Éireann, actually&mdash;the protestations there were that this would pay.  When we cut it down, it was said that if we had kept it on for another year or two it would have paid, that there would not be any debit balance and there would not be any £47,000 to be voted. Here we are again with an increase of <Col N="1719" /> £5,539, notwithstanding what the commission said.</P>
    <P>There is just one point to be made on that.  So eminent a man as Professor Senior, when the commission produced its findings, stated publicly &mdash;and this was published in the <i>Irish Farmers' Journal</i> of the following week &mdash;that the source of carrotene, which is the main reason for the production of grass meal, was now far cheaper in its synthetic form than in its natural form in grass meal.  I endeavoured, through any connection I had, to speak to other men in the same profession as Professor Senior, who should know about this.  They all say that the synthetic carrotene is much cheaper and just as good.  If grass meal is used in compound meals, it is used in compound meals for some reason which is a dyeing reason.  The reason is that the women in Cavan, Monaghan and Leitrim will not buy chickmash unless it is green.  That is the reason.  I would like that little bit of carrotene to be digested by the Minister and his advisers.</P>
    <P>If it were a fact that the sale of these compound meals could be effected without getting that greenish hue into it, if the people would buy them without it, there would not be any such thing as grass meal.  Yet to-day we have the Peatland Grass Meal Experimental Station at Glenamoy and we are paying into it £47,700&mdash;while at the same time we cannot give a penny to the old age pensioners.</P>
    <P>To come back to the weakness of Fianna Fáil, I would say that it seems from this question of power.  We must have planes because the inter-Party Government sold them: we must have Glenamoy because the inter-Party Government cut it out; we must have Store Street Bus Station because the inter-Party Government cut it out. What is the next?  Is it the Bray road?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">

      <P>I should like to devote my remarks this evening to three ministries.  The three Departments about which I want to say something are the Department of Justice, the Department of Social Welfare and the Department of Education.</P>
      <P>On the Estimate for the Department of Justice, I should like to say that it has been a source of continuing disappointment to me down the years, since the formation of our own Government, that there has been no governmental move for radical penal reform.  I should like to see a Minister for Justice who would concern himself actively to put before the Government a series of schemes in order to bring our prisons, reformatories and industrial schools up to date, and perhaps a little bit ahead of other countries, instead of lagging 20 to 25 years behind.</P>
      <P>One of my earliest memories as a little boy of three and a bit was being taken in 1912 to see my mother in Mountjoy.  I still remember the inside of Mountjoy, though I am glad to say that so far I have avoided a repetition of that experience.  My mother served several terms of imprisonment. That particular sentence was for the crime of breaking windows in Dublin Castle in the cause of votes for women.  Her experience was that she could not find it in her to think of herself purely as a political prisoner, as some do, and keep apart from the other prisoners.  She always felt that the prison population were one.  She felt as strong a fellow-feeling for the ordinary criminals as she did for her own political colleagues, whether they were in the Suffragette movement, or later, in the Nationalist movement.  It promoted a regret in her, a regret I now express, that in a country where almost all the leading politicians have seen the inside of a cell and know what it is like to be in jail there has been no movement for penal reform, a reform which would set a headline for the rest of the world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Why is that?  Is it because, having <Col N="1722" /> seen the inside of a jail, one soon forgets what it is like?  Is it that we have some inherently backward and narrowminded view of imprisonment, retribution, and punishment?  I do not know what the explanation is.  I have talked about this with politicians, and they say: &ldquo;Yes, it is true, we are all jailbirds in a sense.&rdquo;  Why do the jailbirds then not remember what it is like to be in jail?  Why do they not promote the reforms that are being slowly brought about in Britain, but in which we have made singularly little progress down the years?  I should like to see our jails, in so far as we have to have them existing, being models of what modern penal institutions should be, instead of being models of what penal institutions used to be in the days of Queen Victoria.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to another point which is related particularly, to industrial schools.  I notice time and again when a child is committed to a school, industrial or reformatory, that the length of sentence seems to be terribly long.  You get a little boy of nine breaking into a lock-up shop and stealing jam or sweets, and being sentenced to seven years in an industrial school.  That is the kind of thing that happens.  Why?  You see that nine out of ten times, they are committed to the age of 16.</P>
    <P>The other day in the country a boy of 12 was brought to court and summoned under the School Attendance Act, and was sent to an industrial school until the age of 16.  If he had attended school properly, he would only have attended school until 14, but he was sent to the industrial school until he is 16.</P>
    <P>In this case, furthermore, the judge asked the further whether he could afford to pay anything towards the upkeep of the boy.  The father said he was unemployed and was getting £2 7s. 6d. a week to keep himself, his wife, and his children, and that quite clearly he could not afford to pay anything.  The justice saw that.  The boy was committed.  The State then pays for that boy in the industrial school 45/- a week which is probably only just adequate, in fact, but if the boy had stayed at home the family <Col N="1723" /> would have been give only 6/- to keep him.</P>
    <P>In that case, the father went out into the street, crying after the boy and saying: &ldquo;You shall not take my boy from me.  I will appeal.&rdquo;  The boy was taken away for four years, because he has not been attending school.  The point I should like to link up with this whole question of reform is this: I should like to see reform in those who fill and those who run our reformatories and industrial schools and prisons, as well as attempted reform of the prisoners.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, and it is linked with that, on the question of children, I should like to see more co-ordination between the various departments that deal with children.  A question was asked about this case in the Dáil the other day by Deputy Dr. Browne.  He asked the Minister for Education about the case.  The Minister for Education said that, since the committing to the school was done under the authority of the Department of justice, he could not make any answer&mdash;although the boy once committed, is under the jurisdiction of the Department of Education!  That is very bad.  It is a neat parliamentary way of passing the buck and not answering a parliamentary question, but it is intolerable for children to be thrown around in this way under the responsibility now of one Minister and again of another Minister, and, in the final analysis, supremely neglected as far as the State goes.</P>
    <P>It is apparently possible for the State to pay 45/- a week for the upkeep of a child in such an institution where, presumably the catering is done on a big scale, but the State can give only 6/- a week to the family towards the upkeep of the child at home.  Should we not examine our consciences about that?  We pay lip-service to the sacredness of the home. We talk about the evils of Communism and say it breaks up homes and tears the children away.  Yet we find that kind of thing going on before our eyes.</P>
    <P>If the father, for instance, of such a child as I have been speaking of were paid anything like 45/- a week for the upkeep of that child at home, I suggest <Col N="1724" /> the home would probably be much better, and possibly so would the child's attendance at school.  I admit there may have to be some disparity, but I suggest that the disparity between 6/- per week for the upkeep of the child at home, and 45/- per week for the upkeep of the child when torn away from home is too great.</P>
    <P>That brings me to the Department of Social Welfare.  It is easy to shed tears about the widows, the blind and the old age pensioners.  I think it has been done on political platforms throughout the country.  I am old enough to remember the outcry and the scandal in the country when the Cumann na nGaedheal Government reduced the old age pension from 10/- to 9/- per week.  That was a very big vote swinger for the Republican candidates at the time&mdash;and, of course, the full 10/- a week was brought back fairly soon.</P>
    <P>I think we ought to recognise that in those days 10/- a week was regarded by everybody who spoke in public as a scandalously low amount to pay to old age pensioners and which they did not even get until they were 70 years of age, but in terms of purchasing power to-day, what we now give with great unction to our old age pensioners is 25/- per week.  I do not think anybody here thinks old persons can live in dignity and comfort, as human beings ought, on 25/- per week, but we shuffle off the responsibility by saying we have not the money, or that the money must be spent upon &ldquo;productive&rdquo; things, or that we just cannot manage it.</P>
    <P>I remember a question, which was asked, I think, by Senator Cogan, at the time as to how much it would cost&mdash;it was when the previous Government were in office&mdash;to abolish the means test for old age pensioners and blind pensioners.  I think the answer was something like £2,500,000.  That £2,500,000 would, I suggest, be admirably spent not on increasing the old age pension, but on abolishing the means test for those pensioners of 70 years of age, because for them it would be an enormous thing.</P>
    <P>A sum of £2,500,000 in relation to our Budget would be relatively small. If the Government do not feel they can <Col N="1725" /> do that, could they not go some of the way and make the means test less stringent, because on its present scale it means that if the old age pensioner has so much as £104 a year from some other source, he or she cannot get a penny in old age pension.</P>
    <P>I come now to the Department of Education in which I am particularly interested.  I want to say some things about it, and I hope at not too great length.  The point I made before, and which I intend to make again, is that when a child is late for school, it gets punished, but when the Minister for Education produces his report for his Department three years late nobody is slapped for lateness.  There is no censure in that case.  Yet, year after year and Government after Government this Minister is late&mdash;and has he got an excuse, a signed letter from the Taoiseach to say: &ldquo;Please excuse the Minister for Education; he is late again; he was slow doing his homework, as he found it very hard&rdquo;?</P>
    <P>It is time the Government woke up to the fact that the Department of Education is, year after year, telling us what happened in our schools and in our educational system three years ago.  The news is about to break in a few weeks' time, I think, when the Department is bringing out its current report as to what was happening in our schools in the year 1956-57.  We are again to be given the figures and the facts for three years back.  I would ask the Seanad whether they think that that is good enough, Personally, I do not think it is.  I should like to hear what the Minister thinks about it, or is there some excuse about conditions and situations, and so on?</P>
    <P>Some years ago, I suggested to the Minister's predecessor that it was fantastic for the two big State examinations to treat the Irish language like a dead language, and to hold no oral test at State examinations.  I was told emphatically, presumably on advice from the Department, by the then Minister, the Minister of the Coalition Government&mdash;that it would be virtually impossible to organise such a test.</P>
    <P>I salute the present Minister.  He <Col N="1726" /> has decided that for the leaving certificate&mdash;not for the intermediate certificate&mdash;but for the leaving certificate, at last, after 37 years of Irish Government, they will treat Irish as a living tongue.  That is a victory which we ought to salute, because if Irish has any value at all as a school subject it is as a living tongue, not as a dead language, not as a language just to be written down.  The major educational value is in learning how to launch oneself into another spoken tongue, and surely it has been a betrayal down the years to treat Irish as if it were, like Latin and Greek, dead, and could not be spoken. Things do move, apparently.  The Department has moved, and next year, I believe, they will actually have an oral test for the leaving certificate. They are very frightened about it, very scared; it is very tentative.  They have made no promise at all about the intermediate certificate, but at least they will have an oral test for the leaving certificate.</P>
    <P>I am afraid I am not satisfied.  I do not want to bite the hand that feeds me, as it were, or to look a gift horse in the mouth, but I do feel that children doing the intermediate examination might have the privilege of having their spoken Irish tested and any other modern language they may take.  I do not care how difficult it is.  I do not believe it is any more difficult than it is in France or Britain, and I have mentioned before, indeed, that any child going for the general certificate of education in Britain and taking the subject Irish, as he can, must do an oral examination in Irish, because the British education authorities, both in Britain and in Northern Ireland, regard Irish as a living tongue even at the intermediate stage, which our Government, in practice, do not. I know, of course, that in words they pay great tribute to the language as a living tongue, but not in practice.</P>
    <P>We have the situation, in fact, that as far as university matriculation goes &mdash;I speak open to correction&mdash;the only university matriculation examination which insists in the examination for Irish upon an oral test is the entrance examination into Trinity College.  We have always had an <Col N="1727" /> oral test, because with any living tongue, we believe in the necessity for testing it as a spoken language.  I believe U.C.D. is about to introduce that.  It may be that both Cork and Galway have done it, but my information is that for the matriculation, so far, the only university matriculation having Irish as a spoken tongue is that of Trinity College.  It is true that it is not a compulsory subject there, but it is also true that when it is chosen Irish is treated as a living tongue.  The question may be asked of the Government, why, except in relation to the leaving certificate, and that in the future, must Irish continue to be treated officially thus, as a dead language?</P>
    <P>If I started talking at length about the general policy with regard to the Irish language, I should be repeating a lot of what has already been said, but I should like to say that I think it is more than high time in this country that, with whatever tears it may be necessary to shed&mdash;and, after all, what are tears for but to shed them?&mdash;it should be recognised that the Irish language is not the vernacular tongue of the country and never will be again.  I say that that should be recognised as a basic fact.  I believe, furthermore, that the Irish tongue, where it is still being spoken and surviving, ought to be fostered and encouraged and protected in the best possible way, which is by giving economic support to those who speak Irish in the Irish-speaking districts.  I believe, furthermore, that Government expenditure should be generous to foster the interest in Irish of enthusiasts, of those who are really genuinely interested, and not interested in it simply because it will help them to get a job, but I believe that no further money should be spent upon fake compulsion and tests that people are reluctant to take, which, in my opinion, are not merely promoting an antipathy to the language but are, in fact, acting against the best interests of the language itself.</P>
    <P>No less a person that the Professor of Psychology in University College, Dublin, Reverend Professor O'Doherty, made an excellent statement about the <Col N="1728" /> whole question of teaching other subjects through the medium of a language which is not one's mother tongue.  We in this country tend to get very emotional about what is and what is not our mother tongue. Father O'Doherty made it quite clear that one's mother tongue is not necessarily one's ancestral tongue, that our mother tongue is, in fact, the first language through which we achieve communication with the outside world. Now, for nine-tenths of our people, that is English, and when the child of four or five first goes to a national schools, if the teacher attempts to instruct that English-speaking child in arithmetic, or other subjects, through the medium of a language that it does not know, the teacher may be doing very big damage to the child, to the child's thought processes, and also, incidentally, to this strange new medium which the child could far better in other ways be taught to love and have an interest in.</P>
    <P>I believe, in other words, that if there were a more intelligent, better-informed Government policy towards the language, it would pay a better dividend from the point of view of fostering the language; and the language would have a longer life, because I believe the language is now being watered down and diluted and diminished, and finally will be killed off by Government policy, killed by kindness.</P>
    <P>Now I should like to come to the question of secondary education in this country and to deal with the Department's attitude towards it.  Again, I should like to start by congratulating the Minister and the Department on the recent increasing of the scale of increments to registered secondary school teachers.  That was excellent, and I think the increases were reasonably generous.  They were not by any means over-generous.  They certainly were overdue.  They were given, however, and we should note that and give credit to the Minister for that.</P>
    <P>It is true, as I suppose everybody here knows, that the ordinary lay secondary school teachers in this country depend to a major extent upon these increments for their livelihood, and in many cases they represent considerably more than half their salary. <Col N="1729" /> Therefore, it is a good thing that they should at last have been increased. But, in relation to increments there are still quite serious defects in the departmental system, defects that a Minister of imagination ought to set about changing.  In the first place, a man who has got all the qualifications to become a registered teacher cannot become registered, despite the fact that he may have an honours degree, a higher diploma in education and have passed a language test, until he has taught a qualifying year in a school.  That kind of regulation is just stultifying, and cheeseparing, for the sake of saving a few hundred pounds, and it ought to be abolished.  It ought to be made easy for teachers&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, Sir; I accept your ruling.  I would put it in general terms simply thus: I think the Department's policy on education in relation to such things as registered teachers and their increments is due for an overhaul, and should be changed.  I shall not go further into details because I accept and respect your ruling.  In relation to increments, there should be a change.  A similar change of attitude ought to come about in relation to the whole way in which the Department of Education help secondary schools by grants.  They help by increments.  They help also by capitation grants and I believe the Government's policy on education ought to be modified in relation to that also.</P>
      <P>With regard to scholarships, I do not want to go into detail, out of respect for your rulling, but the whole question of the way in which money is dispensed in the secondary schools and to children in them should be seriously examined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now I have mentioned some ways in which I consider secondary school education is not very well served.  We know, of course, that there are no grants at all for buildings.  Nevertheless, I would say that in relation to the policy of the Government, secondary schooling is, perhaps, rather more <Col N="1730" /> favoured than most other branches.  I should just like to quote the general figures from the statement of net audited expenditure on Public Services, in relation to Votes 37,38 and 39, Primary Education, Secondary Education and Technical Education, and also Vote 43, Universities and Colleges.  The amount of the increase of the present Estimate over the first year quoted, 1950-51, in relation to secondary education, is two and a half times as great in the present Estimate, 1959-60.  For technical and university education, it is just about twice as big; and for primary education, it is only one and a half times as big.</P>
    <P>I feel that there is a big disparity there, and that primary education is the least privileged of our branches of education.  I should like to see in relation to that&mdash;and I do not want to go into details&mdash;a change in the Government's general attitude towards school building.  I should like to see them, when they find there is a shortage of schools, and especially of classrooms, instead of building colossal schools which may cost anything from £3,000 to £6,000 per classroom, putting up short-term, &ldquo;utility&rdquo; schools to bridge the gap for the sake of children in overcrowded conditions now, and for the teachers who have to deal with such overcrowding; in other words, put up schools which we know will not last, which may be provisional, but which will meet the problem as it appears now in the moment of crisis, rather than try to build, long-term, colossal, palatial schools, which will meet the problem only in 30, 40, or 50 years' time.</P>
    <P>My colleague, Senator Stanford, has dealt in a manner which I would entirely approve with the question of the university grants.  There are just two supplementary points I should like to make on that.  Senator Stanford started by saying&mdash;and I should like to echo what he said there&mdash;that although in the present Estimates we find a very big increase, comparatively speaking, in the Estimate for University College, Dublin, an increase of £143,000, it is in no sense of envy that some of us feel that one or two of the other colleges might have been as <Col N="1731" /> generously treated.  It would be absurd to say that the grant to University College, Dublin is too big.  I think it would be very easy to demonstrate that it is too small.  Therefore, it is in no sense of suggesting that it is too big that I turn to have a look at the other grant totals.  We know there are special problems of overcrowding, understaffing, underpay and so on at University College, Dublin, but those problems exist in all our university colleges.</P>
    <P>I notice that if you examine the increases which are given at page 174 of the Estimate for the Public Services, if you notice what percentages increase if given in each case, you will find that for the National University, the central office and organisation, there is an increase of £10,000 which represents a 50 per cent. increase, that is, £10,000 in relation to the £20,000 grant last year.  In relation to University College, Dublin, the increase is £143,000 which again represents roughly a 50 per cent. increase on last year's figure.  For University College, Cork, the increase of £43,000 represents an increase of only 35 per cent. on last year.  For University College, Galway, the £46,930 again represents roughly a 50 per cent. increase.  Maynooth College get no increase, and the College of Surgeons gets no increase. Trinity College gets an increase of £40,000 which is just 34 per cent.</P>
    <P>On those figures, I should just like to make two further comments.  One is that this amount of £40,000 increase which is being granted includes a Grant-in-Aid for repair of college buildings, which are historic college buildings, of £10,000 and a grant towards redemption of capital expenditure of £20,000&mdash;a repayment of existing debt or deficit&mdash;so that the real increase this year represents a mere £10,000.  That is the first point.</P>
    <P>The next point I want to make is that Trinity College, Dublin, has one point of difference with the other university colleges in that it is far more a residential college than any of the others.  The amenities it has to provide are more extensive, and are of a different kind from those in <Col N="1732" /> colleges which place less emphasis on residence.  Therefore, I may legitimately say that the 34 per cent. increase is perhaps not calculated with sufficient regard to the realities of the situation.  I do not want to say any more on that.  Indeed, I have already spoken at greater length than I intended to.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I will say in relation to the Department of Education that the major problem facing them now, and which I do not see them tackling in a realistic spirit at all, is the problem of overcrowding in the classrooms. I am shocked&mdash;I am not easily shocked&mdash;when I find that the Minister, when he is asked in the Dáil questions as to the actual extent of overcrowding in classrooms in Dublin and Cork, makes the answer that it would not be in the public interest to spend the money it would take to find out.</P>
    <P>In other words, he is not prepared to find out.  He does not know and he does not care.  The only kind of answer he gives is in relation to the average. If you divide the teachers into the number of pupils you will find there are some 43 to 46 pupils per teachers, but he does not know, he does not care, and is not prepared to find out what the true overcrowding situation per classroom is in Dublin and Cork. How can a responsible Minister face his critics in relation to these children without even knowing what are the conditions of overcrowding in city schools, in Dublin and Cork particularly?</P>
    <P>In my contention, the whole future of the country depends upon the educational chance that we can give to our half a million or so of primary school children.  In my submission the Department of Education is falling down lamentably upon that task.  I should like, therefore, to enjoin the Minister and the Government to give serious reconsideration to the basic facts of education in relation to the primary schools of Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Carter</NameTxt>
      <P>The Central Fund Bill gives the Seanad an opportunity of discussing the trends briefly past and present and if one is to go by most of the indicators that give us an idea <Col N="1733" /> of the way in which our economy is progressing, one may take it that we have made reasonably good progress in the past couple of years or so. The Estimates, which usually compare the position with that of previous years, show that a greater drive is under way and that, despite charges to the contrary, the Government have made every effort to point the way to success.  On this Bill, and on previous Bills, the Government have been charged that they have done nothing but direct their attention to changing the system of election.  Of course, that is not so.  While the system of election is of primary importance in any democratic country, the economic and fiscal programme of the Government is also of great importance.</P>
      <P>We assert that whilst the Government have been engaged in introducing measures to change our electoral system they have also been engaged in performing good works, if you like to put it that way, in regard to our economic activities.  It is not fair to say that the Government have been lax, for one moment or that they neglected any matter regarding our drive towards prosperity.  It is quite clear that the critics of the measure to change the electoral system are not taking notice of all the factors involved.  It is quite clear that a number of people have set out to condemn and destroy the Bill which has just been defeated in this House, and to prevent the people of the country from exercising their due authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some of the critics of the measure asserted first of all that we wanted to change our system of election to an illiterate system.  Then they mended their hands and said we were changing to the British system and the Belfast system.  Regardless of that we again assert that any country which wants to make reasonable progress&mdash; whether it be political or economic progress&mdash;must have a sound system of government, and we further assert that now is the time to plan for that system.  Now is the time, when we have a Government with a strong majority, to plan ahead.  We are not planning for the present.  We are planning for the future and we are recognising <Col N="1734" /> the fact that we may not always be able to secure as strong a Government as we have, under the system at present in operation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCarter" hpid="Mr. Carter Mr. Carter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carter</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to move away from that presently, but I think it is necessary to assert it.  I can relate it to this Bill.  Senator Dr. O'Donovan may laugh if he likes but Senator Professor O'Brien asserted on this Bill that if he were a shareholder&mdash;which, incidentally he is&mdash;in the company, he would not like to place too much reliance on investing in the securities of the company at the moment having regard, if I am quoting him correctly, to the state of the accounts.  I want to put it to Senator Dr. O'Donovan that for the last ten or 15 years we were engaged in high politics, in election after election, with the minds of the political Parties completely devoted towards getting votes, or trying to get votes, under a system of government which caused elections every two and a half years or every two years, seven months, on an average.  I believe that in order to make progress a Government would need a more reasonable time for its calculations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Numerous speakers referred to-day to the position regarding unemployment. Senator Baxter was at pains to outline the position and he made a statement pointing out that certain areas were being depopulated.  He quoted certain people and, in quoting them, he said in effect that we had not a remedy for the problem.  The only answer I could give Senator Baxter in that connection, would be that the remedy lies in our own hands. We are all shareholders in this democracy and, whether we get up in this House to plead for an increase for old age pensioners or for teachers, to plead for increased grants for primary and secondary education, or to look for more supports for agriculture, or for any other branch of our activities, we must always recognise that we can never spend more than we earn in any given year.  It does not <Col N="1735" /> require a university professor to know that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Carter</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sneering.  I am not trying to denigrate them at all. I admire our teachers, primary and secondary, and I admire our professors. I want to knock the idea on the head that I am sneering at university professors. I am not, but I would like it to be recognised that we cannot spend more than we earn in any given year, and we cannot invest more unless we get it by borrowing either internally or externally.  That is a simple economic fact.</P>
      <P>When we speak of emigration we must take notice of the fact that emigration did not start to-day or yesterday. We have had emigration for a long time, and some of the people who are now loudest in their condemnation of it are people who sat on commissions regarding it.  These people wrote minority reports and, to my mind, they had not very much more in the way of ideas to offer to solve the emigration problem than any of us might have had, had we served on the commissions. There is no good in saying at this stage, in face of all the factors involved, in face of all the economic indicators, that we can turn back the hands of the clock and say that we are going to do something in spite of all the trends and, in effect, we are going to go back on the road instead of forward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government have published the White Paper and it has been welcomed in all quarters.  I have not heard very much criticism of it except some remarks made last night by Senator O'Donovan regarding the banking system and I do not propose to enter into an argument with him on that subject.  Having regard to conditions outside and to the fact that most of the great schemes started by Fianna Fáil are coming to an end &mdash;the rural electrification programme, the housing drive, now tapering off, activities of some other State or semi-State bodies&mdash;I think the Government <Col N="1736" /> were wise in putting forward at this stage a programme for economic development. Take one sector, for example, the greatest field of activity we have, the agricultural sector.  If we are not able to take advantage of the plans outlined in the White Paper and so organise ourselves as to be able to work towards the objectives outlined in it, we shall lose out again.</P>
    <P>One could talk for an hour on this subject and fill reams of paper but we must speak with some purpose in view and that purpose, as Senator O'Donovan said, should be to generate activity here in order to generate income.  That is easier said than done.</P>
    <P>In the past two years, since the Government took office Senator O'Donovan criticised the Minister for Finance because he would not take responsibility for the Estimates which were published a day or two before he took office.</P>

      <P>They were conveniently defeated.  It resulted in taking them <Col N="1737" /> out of a hole.  When Senator O'Donovan refers to such matters, he should mention the first report of the Capital Investment Advisory Committee which recommended the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Sweetman, to eliminate the subsidies.  That Government was defeated and of course the Minister would not assume any responsibility for the Estimates simply because they carried a certain amount of unpleasantness&mdash;the subsidies would have to be withdrawn.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCarter" hpid="Mr. Carter Mr. Carter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carter</NameTxt>
      <P>Very well.  If you add together the deficit on the Budget and the amount that would pay the subsidies, where were you to get it?  I am quite sure the Coalition Government would not have undertaken the unpleasant task of putting perhaps twopence on the packet of cigarettes or three pence on the pint of porter in order to get it.  It was much more convenient for them to be defeated.  When people criticise I would like to have a little fairness in the criticisms.</P>
      <P>I was dealing with the effort to increase and expand our capital programme and I would like to refer to some matters contained in the White Paper.  The White Paper and the &ldquo;Grey Book,&rdquo; as it is known, have been a source of reference here for some time past and most thinking people have welcomed them.  No one has found any fault with either publication, but when we speak of emigration let us try to offer a solution.  At present we talk of co-operation and I heard people here during debates on other Bills extolling co-operation regarding both economic and governmental activities.  The fact is that we have no co-operation in the sense of co-operative societies.  The co-operative societies we have are such only in name and so long as the Government continue to do the &ldquo;moke&rdquo; they will remain co-operative only in name.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As advocates of privates enterprise, we all prefer to see individual investment rather than paternalism or collective investment.  While that is so we must have recourse to a certain <Col N="1738" /> amount of State investment because we have no tradition in building up our own industries due to our history. That being so, we have reached a stage when certain people here would like to rely on paternalism, people who call on the Government on every occasion to cure every ill that may exist whether on the social side or the financial side.</P>
    <P>In economies such as ours, the Government can only indicate the road they want the people to travel and if we want to take advantage of the markets abroad and beside us we can only do so by combining our efforts.  In one or two branches of agriculture, poultry and egg production and production of pigs and bacon, we have a favourable opportunity to do this.  It has been said that the ancient Irish elk became extinct because he refused to eat his grass in accordance with current conditions.  I believe that and I believe that unless the small farmers can be induced to co-operate in those two lines they will also become, like the elk, extinct and no amount of representation in this House or any other will prevent that because the cold hard economic facts are there and nobody can get around them.</P>
    <P>When I speak of co-operation I mean co-operation between individual producers.  I mean an effort based on a townland where you would have for producers of poultry and eggs one poultry house worked as the Boorenbund works it on the Continent thereby making it possible to produce a constant supply.  I think the same could be done with the pig industry. If we cannot get that effort in those branches of our agriculture then we will not be able to take advantage of the White Paper or the proposals outlined in it.  We can go on with our present system of co-operation which is not in reality co-operation at all. It relies on the Government for help when markets are bad and starts shouting about prices at certain times and then the situation arises when everyone starts blaming the Government for everything.</P>
    <P>The fall in the population in the counties to which I wish to refer, Leitrim, North Longford, parts of <Col N="1739" /> Cavan and such counties, set in from the day we ceased to be economic producers of poultry and eggs, pigs and bacon.  When people speak of emigration they should recognise the fact that no young boy or girl now leaving school is prepared to work at home for any length of time.  They want to take advantage of conditions abroad and emigrate in order to earn £9 or £10 a week.  They do not consider the other economic factors involved, what they are able to save or take home at any given time.  Their idea is to get employment, get the money and that it is their own affair what they do after that.  An effort should be made to inculcate into the younger generation the fact that any young person fleeing the country at present who is not forced out by economic factors is doing a disservice to the country, is not prepared to work for the country and should not be recognised here because of that.</P>
    <P>I could give many examples of young people leaving home at present who need not go but who, for some reason, prefer or pretend to see that the future lies with other lands rather than with their own country.  I think they have no reason for believing that at present.  When people bewail emigration they should remember these facts and recognise that the Government in the White Paper and in other publications have made every effort to induce outside capital to come in here in an effort to create industry to provide work for the people at home. That is not easy to do.  We are in competition with other highly-geared industrial countries and, first of all, with Britain.  Many other countries have entered the race.  Italy has become a first-class producer of many lines of consumer goods with an excellent finish and presentation and at reasonable prices.</P>
    <P>The French are also engaged in that work.  China has now spread her wings and is coming even into Europe and under-cutting Japan in markets which the Japanese traditionally held as producers of cheap goods.  I feel we must take note of all those factors and also that we have other influences <Col N="1740" /> operating against people coming in here to invest money.  The fact that we have strong ties with America, that many of our people emigrated there and subsequently brought up families there is not enough to guarantee that Americans will invest money here on any large scale but we hope they will recognise some of the advantages we have to offer.  We can only hope that for the future that development will grow and that they will come to regard money invested in this country as a sound investment.</P>
    <P>The three reports of the Capital Investment Advisory Committee, the &ldquo;Grey Book&rdquo; and the White Paper all go to show that we must be realistic about our efforts for economic expansion and accept that we cannot make prosperity by wishing it and that no amount of talk will induce our people to change their ideas overnight. You cannot have a revolution in any field of activity overnight.</P>
    <P>I only wish some area, some county committee of agriculture, would take it upon itself to try out one of the pilot schemes in order to take advantage of some of the suggestions embodied in the White Paper and thereby demonstrate, in one given area, that it could co-operate on the basis I mentioned; co-operate as producers and not under the name of a co-operative, which, in reality, is not a co-operative at all.</P>
    <P>The housing programme was mentioned and it was only last night that I read in the <i>Evening Press</i> that the Dublin Corporation have a big problem on hands in this regard.  They are trying to hand over, I think, roughly £42,000,000 worth of property, to the tenants.  It is by no means an easy task to get the tenants to recognise that they would be better off as owners of their own houses.  This country has gone a long way towards solving its housing programme.  Through subsidies and other ways, it has encouraged the building and reconstruction of houses and in that way various local authorities have undertaken heavy commitments. They are now at the stage when they want to transfer these houses to the tenants.  That is a laudable objective and the Government and the local authorities should get every encouragement <Col N="1741" /> in that direction.  At present we hear people bewailing costs, but when you come to that consideration, local authorities have to bear very high costs in this regard and I was glad to see during the year that the Department of Local Government was active in that direction.</P>
    <P>I have nothing more to say on this Bill, except to remark that whilst we hear criticisms, we are not as a rule offered solutions to coincide with the criticisms.  I should like to hear some alternatives, or some solutions, from the members who criticise the Central Fund Bill and the Minister for Finance who, as I said, following the worst harvest in history managed to keep the flow of imports reasonably in line with our exports and who, I presume, will manage to produce a balanced Budget.  He is to be congratulated on the way he handled the Budget last year and I assume that he has the support of most thinking people in his task.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, should like at the outset to join with my fellow Senators from the universities in expressing appreciation of the increased grants for university education.  I should also like to say that in no way do we begrudge our sister college, University College, Dublin, the large share it has got.  In fact, this is only timely and we hope it is only a first instalment all round because the amount spent on university education is still somewhat less than the amount available to Queen's University, Belfast. If we are to compete in the modern world, we shall have to keep our universities provided with the facilities to do that.</P>
      <P>Our Government have accepted the challenge of modern air travel and it has, within the past 12 months, spent £1,000,000 on the extension of the runways at Shannon Airport.  Likewise, we have the decision to acquire jet aircraft. In other words, the Government are very anxious to keep abreast of modern developments in certain fields and I hope that they will adopt the very same attitude to university education, and in fact to all education, as they are adopting in the field of air travel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to express just a few <Col N="1742" /> points of criticism and I join with Senator Stanford in being rather mystified by the manner in which the increases have been worked out.  For instance, I make it that the increase to University College, Dublin, has been 43 per cent.; the increase to University College, Galway, 50 per cent.; to Trinity College, 33 per cent.; and to University College, Cork, 29 per cent. I wonder was that based on the fact that Cork is the furthest of all from Dublin.  I hope this is only a first instalment and that we will progress from this.</P>
    <P>We had last year the &ldquo;space&rdquo; commission and we have all been impressed by the eagerness with which it got to work and the thoroughness with which it has accomplished its task.  We were led to believe that the report of the commission would be available long ago and I should like to ask the Minister when the report will be available.  Again, I join with Senator Stanford in conceding the great claims of University College, Dublin, for increased accommodation, but likewise we have our claims, too, and while in no way wishing to stand in the way of University College, Dublin, we think we should all be developed and enabled to meet the challenge of modern science and the modern age.</P>
    <P>I should like to point out one glaring omission, that is, that there is one university institution which has received no increase.  It is the one of which we are most proud&mdash;Maynooth College.  The Grant-in-Aid for secondary education stands at the same figure as last year, £20,000.  That is definitely a source of real criticism on this apportionment because we should realise the treasure we have got in Maynooth College.  It is the largest Catholic seminary in the world, and, above all, it is a seminary that is producing really first-class work.  It might be said right away that it is at the very height of its intellectual activity and there are six high-class journals emanating from it at present. That is a record of which a university six times its size could be proud.  I know the conditions under which those producing the journals work, their complete lack of clerical assistance, <Col N="1743" /> and I suggest to the Minister that before budget day, he should see fit to apply at least the same measure of generosity to Maynooth College as he has applied to the other colleges.  I think everybody here would join with me in voicing that appeal.</P>
    <P>I come now to another point, that is, that the apportionment of the grants seems to be on a <i>per capita</i> basis.  That is a very wrong principle in higher education, or in any type of education. If you are setting up an engineering school and you have 100 students in the faculty and if you increase that number to 200 students, it does not follow that your costs are doubled.  In fact the costs probably increase in the order of 50 per cent. to 60 per cent. but they are not doubled.  That is a fallacy we must guard against.  It can work in the opposite way also, because any type of education, whether university or other, depends on small classes. You must have that intimate contact between teacher and students to ensure that the students get the maximum benefit from their association with the teacher and are developed to the fullness of their capacity.  It is held by the highest authorities that classes of 20, 25 or 30 in most faculties are as much as you can possibly handle.</P>
    <P>Calculations have been made as to how much it costs to produce a doctor or an engineer, and the average is £70 per student.  That is fallacious. If I have a class of 20 and if next year there happen to be 22 or 23 in the class I get no more for teaching those.  The extra couple cost very little.  The average cost is a completely misleading figure and the calculations as to what it costs the nation for those graduates who have to go abroad and seek their living are all fallacious.  We cannot charge them at the average cost.  It is a differential cost and I would commend that to the Minister and suggest that in his approach he should keep in mind that we are dealing with differentials.</P>
    <P>While the university is an essential part of any modern nation, we should also remember the important part that the university plays in the <Col N="1744" /> economy of the nation through its faculty members, through its contacts with the industrial life and through being in a position to give impartial, independent opinions.  One may not agree with those opinions but they are given <i>bona fide</i> and are backed by facts available to the person at the time.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect of university education which should be developed.  We are seeking new industries and wondering how to attract money into our economy.  Through the university there is an opportunity second to none in catering for students from abroad.  In America with very little effort we could get a large number of undergraduate students to do their undergraduate work in our colleges.  The same holds good for England.  Senator Stanford mentioned that each student coming in would spend £250 or £300.  I would be inclined to say that for American students it would be far higher, about £400 or £500.  Each student who comes here from abroad is as valuable to our economy as a worker in a new industry.  They both play the same role in creating wealth for the community.  Whether it is the worker operating his machine and producing a new article or the student who is drawing his allowance from outside, they are making an equally big contribution to our economy.</P>
    <P>At present we are anxious to attract new industry.  We consider £3,000 per worker employed as a rather modest sum.  In fact, in the oil refinery we spent £30,000 per worker and in relation to other industries the expenditure is of the order of £15,000 or £20,000 per worker employed. Even if we take the minimum figure of £3,000 per worker, that means that a university that is prepared to cater for 300 additional students is as valuable to this country as a factory employing 300 workers which we would be able to put up at a cost of 300 times 3,000, almost £1,000,000.</P>
    <P>I suggest, therefore, that when the report of the &ldquo;space&rdquo; commission is approached that should be kept in mind, even if a long-term programme <Col N="1745" /> emerges from the &ldquo;space&rdquo; commission. The expenditure of, say, £6,000,000 or £8,000,000 on providing facilities for university education, should be thought of in the same terms as factories and as what you would pay to give employment here to 1,500 to 2,000 workers.</P>
    <P>One bad omission here in relation to university education is an omission on the part of the Department of Agriculture.  No improvement is being made in the grant to the dairy science faculty in University College, Cork, which stands at exactly the same figure as it stood last year, that is, £25,000.  Are we serious about this problem in relation to the whole dairying industry, from the creamery platform to the production of butter, cheese, milk products, milk powder, the provision of machinery for the creameries, and so on, when we are prepared to spend only £25,000 per annum on all that?  Is it any wonder that we are having difficulty in selling dairy products, when out of a total output of at least £40,000,000 per year, we can spend only £25,000? I suggest that the Minister for Finance should see that that glaring ommission is rectified.  It contrasts rather markedly with the fact that we can afford to spend £78,000 on the Institute for Advanced Studies.  I am not for one moment saying that that is money badly spent but surely, if we as a nation can afford to spend £78,000 on theoretical physics and Celtic studies, it is ridiculous that we spend only a third of that amount on our major industry, the dairying industry.</P>
    <P>I mentioned in the course of the debate three weeks ago that I intended raising an important matter in relation to foreign affairs on the Vote on Account.  Due to the absence of the Minister for External Affairs in the United States, it is only fair that I should not proceed with this matter but I hope to raise it by way of motion during the next session of the Seanad.</P>

      <P>To come to agriculture&mdash;in this case, I must, first of all, congratulate the Government on the Agricultural Institute.  We debated it 12 months ago last January, and the debate was very satisfying in that the Taoiseach faced up to all our queries, and all our suggestions, in the most admirable manner, and the Agricultural Institute which had so long been a subject of controversy, began under very favourable circumstances.</P>
      <P>It began with an absolute guarantee from the Taoiseach that much of what we had fought for, over the years&mdash; and we fought both Governments on this as Deputy Dillon could testify&mdash; had been achieved in that, above all, we had secured a guarantee that this new institute should be autonomous&mdash; it should be every bit as autonomous as the universities&mdash;so it was a great shock to me when I opened page 209 of this Book of Estimates to find that that has not been implemented.  We have right here what we fought against.  In paragraph (b) at the end of the page, it says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Issues from the Grant will be made from time to time of such amounts as the Minister for Agriculture with the consent of the Minister for Finance may think proper.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That undermines the complete autonomy of this Agricultural Institute and makes a mockery of it.  That is what we fought against.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I refer to the group that constituted the Agricultural Institute Commission and I refer to many of the speakers in the Seanad debate on the Agricultural Institute 12 months ago.  The essential point is that the Taoiseach assured us it would have the same autonomy as the universities. University grants are made in the same way as grants to the Tourist Board or other such grants.  They are <Col N="1748" /> given and the check afterwards lies with the Comptroller and Auditor General who audits the accounts.  That has been departed from in the case of the Agricultural Institute and, I suggest, that is a very serious departure and one we should resist in this House, because it is no function of the Minister for Agriculture when the grant is being made, to say: &ldquo;Oh, yes, you may get this £10,000 now and when you want the next £10,000, you will have to show what you want it for.&rdquo;  It should be given the same measure of autonomy as the universities.  We are looking to the institute to do tremendous work for us.  I must congratulate the Government heartily on their choice, both of a director of this institute, and I think everybody recognises his&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I just wanted to mention the director and the chairman, but I shall move from it now.  The grant of £50,000 as given here is two-thirds of what is given to the School of Theoretical Physics, or one-third of the increase to the Tourist Board.  That is ridiculous.  I cannot imagine how the Agricultural Institute can carry out their very ambitious programme with such a grant.  I know they have funds of their own, but these funds could not amount to more than £70,000 or £80,000.  Furthermore, I thought we were accepting that certain institutions run by the Department would be transferred to this institute.  I wonder has anything been done in that regard.  I should like the Minister to let us know when we may hear something further on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I come now to the question of small farms.  I wish to endorse very strongly everything Senator Baxter said about the abandonment of Section B of the land project, because that directly hits the small farmer.  It might be said that the fertilisation of the lands of the large farmers is being subsidised by the small farmers.  We read in the papers about four months ago that the Government had decided to give £1,500,000 subsidy to fertilisers and in the next <Col N="1749" /> announcement, we read that that was to begin from 1st October last.  I ask: What are we doing in the House at all?  Where do the Dáil and the Seanad come into this?  In other words, if you can make a couple of million pounds suddenly available for the development of agriculture, surely it stands to reason that this House and the Dáil should have debated very fully the best possible way of using that money.  In fact, I should have thought that the Dáil should have &ldquo;okayed&rdquo; it before the money was spent.  It strikes me as being a very strange position that that could happen.  With all due respect, I think there were probably many other uses to which that money could have been put.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>We should have debated the issue and, for instance, I hope in a few moments to develop what might have been a better use for it.  This hinges on the greatest blemish which I found in the White Paper and in the Programme for Economic Development.  I praise it highly for what is in it, but there is the blemish that it writes off additional employment and takes it only as a secondary effect of more production.  Above all &mdash;and this is the most serious point in it&mdash;it completely dismisses the land as a source of additional employment.  If that position is taken, we might as well accept the fact that we are defeated in our struggle for economic survival, even before we begin.</P>
      <P>The land is shown in <i>Economic Development,</i> and is taken for granted in the White Paper, as the source from which we can get rich quickly. It is the mine in the country which shows the greatest possibility of sudden exploitation.  As well as that, the land is the source of additional employment.  One may say that these things are contradictory.  I see that there was a newspaper controversy on that recently.  They are not contradictory. You say that the present production from our land could be obtained with fewer workers.  We will grant that, but how much fewer?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It depends on the quality of the <Col N="1750" /> workers.  Some nice calculations have been made, that if we were only as efficient as the English workers on the land, we could produce what we are producing at present with 250,000 people instead of our 430,000 or 440,000.</P>
    <P>There is one slight omission in that calculation.  Those making it conveniently overlook the capital per worker engaged and the capital per acre.  The capital per acre in England in agriculture is almost £40. Here, as shown in the Farm Survey, it is about £20.  Therefore, even if our men were as efficient and as well-trained, we cannot expect them to produce the same as their English counterparts, unless we give them the tools&mdash;and the tools are an increase in capital input into agriculture of at least £20 per acre.  Do the sum and see how much you get.  It is £250,000,000.  One might say that those advocating that policy, who say we have too many on the land and that we should take English standards, if they are to be realistic, could phrase it that it would cost £250,000,000 for the catastrophe of dismissing 180,000 people off the land &mdash;in other words, committing absolute national suicide.</P>
    <P>Let us move on to the brighter picture, which is that our land is capable of much more production than it is giving at present.  When we get that production from the land. we can employ more at a higher standard of living than is enjoyed by those engaged at present.  That is the central fact to grasp.  I do not wish to go into the details of it, which I am hoping to do in a paper to one of the societies here, in a month or so, a paper based on the hard facts as gleaned from the Farm Survey.  It is a most encouraging picture, but one we have to get down to.</P>
    <P>This picture, shows that, if we set it as our target to raise the level of all the farms up to the level of the top third of our farms&mdash;surely that is not a tremendous objective for, say, a ten year period&mdash;we would increase our over-all production by about 75 per cent.  Again, that figure is not impossible, since all it calls for is a <Col N="1751" /> little over 5 per cent. per annum compound increase.  We are capable of doing that, if we get that increase. We can go through the facts and figures.  You do not need a farm survey to tell you that the good farmers employ more labour than the poorer farmers or the bad farmers. That is a self-evident fact, and the farm survey, of course, shows that. It enables you to calculate how many more you would need if you raised the standard all round up to that of the top third of the farmers in each parish.  You can make that calculation and you will find&mdash;I give only a rough figure&mdash;that the increased production would be valued at something like £144,000,000 or, reducing it slightly for external prices, it would be worth about £126,000,000 extra.</P>
    <P>That is a prize which we cannot hope to get out of any industry we set up at the moment.  In industries we are dealing in hundreds of thousands of pounds, but in this, our main industry, we are dealing in millions.  If we have an increase of £126,000,000, from the farm survey, we can calculate what the cost of that would be. It would mean more fertilisers, more equipment, more seeds and so on.  We find from the farm survey that the cost would be about £54,000,000, leaving a balance behind of about £72,000,000.  That £72,000,000 has to cater for three things.  It has to enable the farmer to plough back something; it has to give a higher standard of living to those working on the land at present, whether they are farmers or labourers; and, thirdly, it has to provide the pay for the additional labour required to get that output. The additional labour, by the calculation I have made here, works out at over 40,000 workers, assuming that the present rate of increase of efficiency continues.  Efficiency is increasing at about 4 per cent.  If you assume that to continue, you still need the additional workers.</P>
    <P>The global results of it are that you could afford to increase the whole income of the farmers at present by about 30 per cent., including the real income of those labourers working on <Col N="1752" /> the land.  That is a prize and a target which is worthy of any national effort and it is something which would make a tremendous difference to our country. As well as that, the 40,000 additional workers would absorb something like £15,000,000 of the £72,000,000.</P>
    <P>Over and above everything else, we must set aside quite a big sum&mdash; £12,000,000 per year&mdash;for capitalising the increased output.  Agriculture is simply an obsolete factory.  If you are to get the production out of it, you must build it, you must put the money into it, just as surely as you put the money into the oil refinery or any other industry.  That is where the real crux comes in.  I may say that the amount of capital necessary, again working from the farm survey, would work out at something between £100,000,000 and £120,000,000, to get this 75 per cent. increase, which we could get in ten years at an average rate of 5 per cent.  That means we are faced with the task, if we want this prize, of pumping into agriculture £100,000,000 to £120,000,000 in ten years.  That is what we have to do.</P>
    <P>I can show the side effects briefly. You give an additional £60,000,000 worth of purchasing power to the agricultural community.  Approximately half that is spent on consuming additional agricultural produce.  The other half goes into the factories to buy the products of the factories which the agricultural community are then in a position to buy.  In that way you build up the spiral.  As well as that, the increased costs&mdash;fertilisers, seeds and so on&mdash;will largely go towards buying the products of Irish industries.  I have made some rough calculations.  Assuming efficiency and so forth, in order to cater for this increased purchasing power and the increased demands of the agricultural community in relation to fertilisers and so on, we need at least an additional 20,000 to 30,000 workers in our factories.  That would increase the present net output of our factories by 25 per cent.  These are prizes worth striving for.  These are targets worth aiming at.</P>
    <P>The crucial point is, of course, the provision of this additional capital.  If we want to bring this about over the <Col N="1753" /> next ten years we are faced with putting at least £100,000,000 into agriculture. In the Estimate we see a sum of £11,000,000.  Most of that can be written off.  At most it means about £2,000,000.  Now it cannot be held that the taxpayers should carry the burden because clearly they cannot. Taxation has reached the limit.  It cannot go higher.  We should have courage then and make an act of faith in the future of our country and in the future of agriculture, the same act of faith as the British Government made in our farmers in 1900 when they passed the Land Acts&mdash;no more and no less.  At that time there had to be a tremendous change over in order to buy out the landlords.  The total cost to date has been £128,000,000.  Probably in the British days something like £80,000,000 to £90,000,000 was spent. By present day standards that would amount to at least £300,000,000 to £400,000,000.</P>
    <P>Let us think then of the enormous task that faces us.  Let us think of the enormous task that faced the British and the way in which they met it.  They simply borrowed the money, put the farmers into possession and let them pay it back afterwards.  I suggest we adopt the same approach.  If we build up our farmers into the position in which they can produce extra wealth they will be very much better off.  When they are better off they will be able to pay back that which enabled them to become better off.</P>
    <P>The land purchase annuities are run out.  The money raised under the Land Acts is almost paid back. Let us make a second effort.  Let us raise the money again now and get it back in the same way.  The £2,500,000 paid in land annuities is the least worry the farmers have.  If the farmers are put into this greatly improved position four times that figure will present no difficulties to them.  The figure they were faced with in 1912 to 1915 was actually double the present figure.  It was £5,000,000&mdash;and that at a time when the £ was worth at least four times what it is worth to-day.  I do not think a repayment period of 50 years would be suitable in our present <Col N="1754" /> circumstances.  Let the period be 20 years and let them pay back at the rate of £10,000,000 per year.  That will enable us to recoup a gross of £200,000,000 or get back a loan of about £150,000,000.  That is about the amount we need to make this first stage transition.  Any money we can spare, like the money in the fertiliser scheme, should be used to pay part of the interest on the loans given to farmers in the early years of development.  That is the scheme we have adopted in relation to hoteliers and the development of our tourist traffic.  Let the State carry the interest for the first four or five years. That would be a real use to make of the taxpayers' money as an incentive to the development of agriculture.</P>
    <P>Many schemes have been announced by the banks in the past year for advancing credit, with the full approval of the Government and the farmers' organisations.  Really all that is merely trifling with the problem.  It will never do much more than window-dressing because it does not reach down to the small farmer and so credit is not spread as widely as it needs to be spread.  The first step in the development of credit should be the abolition of the Agricultural Credit Corporation.  We can dispense with that altogether.  We have readymade schemes if we will only develop them.  Every farmer has a receivable order and that receivable order has been used in the fertiliser scheme. The farmer could get eight to ten times the face value of that order, and all the lending authority need do is pass on the charge to the Land Commission and let the Land Commission deal with it subsequently.  A credit scheme on that basis could be worked at minimum cost.  In such a scheme we should not worry too much about the fellow who squanders what he gets, provided two or three make good use of it.  The Land Commission never yet failed to get their money and the Land Commission can deal with the squanderer and make his farm available to some young man who will be prepared to work it.</P>
    <P>I appeal for a completely new approach to the question of agricultural <Col N="1755" /> credit.  We would need some committee, like the Investment Committee which has done such good work, to plan&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>In the very brief outline I have given, I have been trying to stimulate the interest of Senators in the problem.  The supporting facts will all be available in this paper I mentioned.  We should begin to think again and look at agriculture as a source of additional employment. Remember that, on the admission of the White Paper and everywhere else there is no other really worthwhile source available to us.</P>
      <P>I have not time to give the figures now but I can say that with increased agricultural production we could have an additional 30,000 workers in our industrial arm.  I ask the House to think of it in the same way as the Land Acts were approached before.  You cannot tackle the problem of current resources; you have to make an act of faith in the future.  We have all to put our shoulder to the wheel to ensure that this will be brought about.</P>
      <P>With regard to emigration, I suggest that increased development on the land is the only key, and the completely new social revolution that is to go with it.  That will all be part of the whole philosophy and idea of farming apprenticeship, and so on.  The best of our young lads will turn their minds to the land as a career.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>If I were to develop this theme it would probably take four or five hours.  I shall turn now to Vote 49.  I am afraid the Department of Agriculture is deserving of no little censure in this connection.  It is recognised by all that we need more education in agriculture. <Col N="1757" /> It is recognised that education is the key to everything.  It is recognised equally that our private agricultural schools at Pallaskenry, Copsewood, Warrenstown, St. Patrick's, Mountbellew, Gurteen and Multyfarnham are all doing excellent work and turning out splendidly-equipped young farmers to accomplish our agricultural revolution.</P>
      <P>Side by side with that, we have four State schools&mdash;Athenry, Ballyhaise and the other two.  In this Book of Estimates, the total grant to the private schools, excluding buildings, is £26,000.  The net grant to Ballyhaise is £25,000.  It is shown in the book as £41,000, to which the Appropriations-in-Aid are £16,000.  The same holds for Athenry.  We give as much to one State school as we give to all these private schools.  That is absolutely unjust and unfair.  In a branch of education where we need absolute development, are the Government afraid that these private schools will suddenly buy up the country if they get grants comparable with what we give the State schools? I suggest that if we gave the money to these schools they would expand and cater for more of our young farmers.  Surely that is what we require?  This is the greatest blot on the whole of the Book of Estimates. It should not happen in a community committed to fair play and committed. we say, to private enterprise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our private agricultural schools are every bit as much private enterprise as a firm run in any of our cities.  It is high time we gave them fair play and recognised the marvellous work they are doing.  You have to be careful in taking figures from the Book of Estimates in regard to this matter because, in the case of State schools, their buildings are provided for under the Vote for the Office of Public Works and, consequently the few pounds building grant given to the private schools must be kept out and likewise pensions for teachers, which are included in the establishment section in the Book of Estimates.  Even stationery is included under the Stationery Office.  There are several ways of hiding away what is given to State-operated bodies.  There <Col N="1758" /> are at least six headings under which you can find money.  Here is a ridiculous thing.  In relation to private schools, there is a sum of £209 refund of pension&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Chair.  It is not a political principle. The previous Government did it, I think, just the same as the present Government.  It is high time, however, that we broke that vicious circle and gave to our private enterprise what is due to private enterprise.  If you read the White Paper on economic development you will find that the greater part of the burden of our future development is placed on private enterprise. I have one very reasonable criticism of both those valuable documents.  The emphasis and the onus has been placed, quite rightly, on private enterprise, but the actions of all our Governments so favour the Government-controlled body and scoop out the amount of capital available that there is little or nothing left for private enterprise to do its job.  If, after five or ten years, we meet again to review the situation and find that the Government companies have done what we asked them to do, but that private enterprise has let us down, we may jump to the wrong conclusion, that it is private enterprise that has failed rather than we or the Government who have failed.  If we do not give the conditions, we cannot expect the results.</P>
      <P>I conclude with a plea for two matters; No.1, the grant to Maynooth College and, No. 2, that private agricultural schools be given parity with State agricultural schools.  Remember, it will cost only another £250,000 to do that and I venture to say that there is no better investment for that £250,000 than to give it to Copsewood, Mountbellew, Warrenstown or any of the other agricultural colleges that are doing such tremendous work.</P>

      <P>Listening to Fianna Fáil speakers in this House, throughout the country and throughout the world at the present time, one would think that this was a land flowing with <Col N="1759" /> milk and honey, that everything in the garden was rosy.  That may appear to be the case to globe-trotting Ministers or Ministers speaking after a big dinner, but unfortunately that does not seem to be the case to the majority of our people at present.  Those of us who move through the country know that depression and pessimism stalk the land and that the farmers, shopkeepers, business people, old age pensioners, widows and orphans have never got it harder to live than they are getting it to-day.  That cannot be denied.  At the last election, the people were promised better times for all.  So far, they have not materialised.  We were told that the cost of living would be reduced but we all know that to-day the cost of living&mdash;&mdash;</P>

If we have £10,000,000 to spend to-day on jet aeroplanes to build up our prestige abroad and to take our emigrants abroad, I think it would be much <Col N="1762" /> better if that money were spent in different ways in this country in an endeavour to increase production and give employment to our people at home.</P>

One would think that everything in this country which was for the good of the country was started by Fianna Fáil.  We all know that is not true.  He mentioned rural electrification.  I will just deal in passing with rural electirfication which was started in 1924.  The Shannon scheme started away back in 1924 and it was Deputy McGilligan, who was then Minister for Industry and Commerce, who started it.  At that time it was referred to by the Fianna Fáil Party as a white elephant.</P>

      <P>They are completing fewer than 20 areas at the present time than were completed in 1944. 1945 or 1946.  We heard much about the White Paper.  Senator Carter told us to-day that the White Paper points the way.  I claim that the White Paper takes up only where the inter-Party Government left off in 1957.  In the White Paper you had 15 paragraphs and five pages devoted to grass and the raising of mutton and beef. You have one single paragraph and half a page devoted to the growing of wheat.  That is a big change.</P>

      <P>You are converted to the Fine Gael policy.  When Deputies James Dillon and Patrick Hogan preached that we should have better grass I remember what they <Col N="1763" /> were called.  Deputy Hogan was called the Minister for Grass and those associated with him were referred to as ranchers who wanted nothing on the land of Ireland but the man and the dog.  Now the people on the far side of the House realise the importance of having good grass on the land of Ireland.  That is a change.  It is a pity that they did not learn the importance of good grass 20 or 25 years ago.  The White Paper says: &ldquo;Grass is the raw material of our principal export trade, beef and cattle, of milk production and of sheep and lamb production.&rdquo;  They realise now the importance of our beef, our cattle and our milk production.  There was a time when they did not.  There was a time when the present Minister for Finance had the throats of the calves slit from ear to ear and 20 years later they realise their mistake.</P>

      <P>Paragraph 18 of the White Paper states:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The liming programme followed in recent years has made considerable progress, with the result that we are now one of the largest users of lime per acre in Europe...&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I suppose they will tell us that Fianna Fáil started that.  As a matter of fact, in 1947, as Deputy Dillon has so often stated, there was not enough ground limestone in this country to fill one egg-cup.  The success of that scheme is due to Deputy James Dillon, and the inter-Party Government.</P>
      <P>Now let me quote from paragraph 56 of the White Paper:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;There is no doubt, however, that the bulk of our agricultural exports will continue to be marketed in Britain, and our trade relations with that country are, therefore, a matter of prime importance.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a grand thing to see this Party, after the havoc and destruction they <Col N="1764" /> wrought in this country in the past, now converted and that they realise the importance of the British market&mdash;a market they told us at one time &ldquo;was gone and gone for ever, thanks be to God.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Instead of the farmers keeping cattle, the present Taoiseach told the farmers on one cold winter's day at the fair of Arva, it would be much better if they started to keep bees.  He told them that the best type of bee to keep was the Egyptain bee.  Unfortunately, many of the poor farmers in the country were stung and badly stung by the drones that exist in the Fianna Fáil Government and in the Fianna Fáil Party for the past 20 years. Despite the fact that they told us they would do without Britain and the rest of the world if every damn ship was sent to the bottom of the sea they now in the year 1959 realise that all they said in the past was wrong as they now realise that all they claimed about P.R. was wrong.</P>
    <P>There is one thing certain.  Fianna Fáil have been consistent in their inconsistency for the past 20 or 25 years but, again, it is a pity they did not realise the importance of the British market 20 or 25 years ago.  If they did this would be a better country for all our people and we might not have the high unemployment and the high emigration that we have from Ireland at the present time.</P>
    <P>We know that this is an agricultural country.  If the people on the land of Ireland are prosperous, then the whole nation will be prosperous.  We have 12,000,000 acres of fertile arable soil. We have a population of little over 2,500,000 people representing roughly five acres of land for every person in the country.  Let us go back to 1947. After 16 long years of Fianna Fáil Government we had not even enough butter to feed our own people.  At that time we imported butter from New Zealand and other countries.</P>
    <P>I heard speakers to-day referring to our adverse trade balance.  It might be no harm to point out that in 1932 our total exports were £36.3 million. Fianna Fáil then came into power and they were in power for 16 long years of uninterrupted Government.  We have <Col N="1765" /> been listening for the past week to people telling us here that Fianna Fáil under P.R. could not pursue a proper policy because Governments would come and go.  They could not get a Government strong enough to do their work properly.  Fianna Fáil were in office for 16 long years at that time.  A world war intervened and the price of our cattle doubled, not due to anything Fianna Fáil did, but due to the fact that there was a war. As I have said, we exported £36.5 million worth in 1931.</P>
    <P>Sixteen years later the price of what we had to export doubled, not due to anything the Government did, and in 1947 our total exports were £39.5 million, or an increase of £3.5 million in 16 years.  If the price of our exports had not doubled we would have been exporting roughly £18,000,000 worth less than we exported 16 years before that, and this is the Government who tell us they have the plan, and that they have accomplished anything that has been accomplished in this country during the last 40 years.</P>
    <P>It might be no harm to remind Senator Kissane, who was talking about the adverse trade balance in 1947, that the adverse trade balance left by Fianna Fáil at that time was £91,823,364.  In case there is anyone on the opposite side who would doubt that I am giving the exact figure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>Our total exports in 1947 were £39.5 million and, when a different Government came into power, in 1948, the number of cattle on the land was the lowest on record. In addition to that the fertility of our soil was at its lowest point.  That Government got to work and, due to the programme they initiated, due to the Cattle Trade Agreement that they made with the British Government&mdash;and remember they sent their Minister to make that agreement, and not civil servants, as Fianna Fáil sent over&mdash; our total exports in 1957 had risen to £131,000,000.  That is a record of <Col N="1766" /> which any Party, or any Government, should be proud.  It was effected by the inter-Party Government in which different Parties came together to work in the interests of all sections of the community, irrespective of class, creed or politics.</P>
      <P>I shall not go through the whole list but, for example, we exported £870,000 worth of wool in 1947 but, by 1957, the value of our wool exports was over £4,000,000.  In 1947 our bacon exports were as low as £50 worth but in 1957 they were worth £4,250,000. It is only a few months since the Taoiseach told us that cattle seemed to be paying better than anything else at the present time, and that the people should rear more cattle.  Twenty years ago it was bees, but now it is cattle. I do not know why he changed his mind unless it was that he was stung in the meantime.  At any rate, he now realises the importance of the cattle population.</P>
      <P>In 1931 there were 4.4 million cattle in this country but, after 16 years of Fianna Fáil government, they had decreased to 3.9 million in 1947.  A change of Government then took place and we had the 1948 Cattle Trade Agreement with Britain.  If there is anybody in the Fianna Fáil Party who will say that if they had remained in power they would have made as good an agreement with the British Government I would like to ask him, or the Minister, is it not true that between 1939 and 1945 Britain was in the middle of a world war, and that her ships were being sent to the bottom of the sea&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and that the British people were rationed to two ounces of meat per week?  Fianna Fáil have always told us that Britain's difficulties were Ireland's opportunities. Was that not Britain's difficulty and Ireland's opportunity, and why did the Minister for Agriculture at that time not negotiate a trade agreement and demand a fair price from the British Government for our cattle exports?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>They could have hit them in their pride, or anywhere else.  Britain was dependent on our cattle and she would have had to pay a fair and just price.  We sold our cattle to Britain at from 50/- to 60/- a cwt. when the British people were on the brink of starvation, but, due to Deputy Dillon as Minister for Agriculture, the price was increased from 70/- a cwt. in 1947 to £9 a cwt. in 1957.  There is no credit due to the Fianna Fáil Party for that.  In addition, the number of cattle increased in ten years from 3.9 million to 4.5 million.</P>
      <P>The very same thing applies to sheep and yet Fianna Fáil call themselves &ldquo;the Progressive Party&rdquo;.  In 1931, when they came into power, there were 3.5 million sheep in the country but, after their 16 years of glorious government, of strong government, they succeeded in reducing that number to 2.09 million.  The inter-Party Government by encouraging the farmers&mdash;not by filling ten fields with inspectors, but by giving them a fair return for their labour&mdash;succeeded in increasing the number of sheep to 3.4 million. Now, let us take pigs.  We know that the small farmers are interested in pigs.  The production of pigs helps them to make their livelihoods. In 1931 we had 1.2 million pigs in this country but, after 16 years of stable Fianna Fáil Government, the number of pigs was reduced from 1.2 million to 456,973.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dillon, as Minister for Agriculture, gave a guaranteed price for pigs and encouraged pig production. He introduced Ymer barley into this country, and barley for feeding pigs, with the result that in 1957 we had enough barley to do us for ten months of the year.  The result was that the number of pigs increased from 456,973 to almost 1,000,000, and we know that last year we exported almost £6,000,000 worth of bacon. Nobody in the Fianna Fáil Party need tell us that all those cattle, sheep and pigs were bred and reared during the last two years since Fianna Fáil came into office.  They may try to put that impression across in the city, where the people may not know much about <Col N="1768" /> agriculture, but they will not succeed in fooling the farmers.</P>

      <P>We have heard a lot about unemployment and emigration. We have been told by Senator Carter that a great drive is under way but unfortunately it is a great driving away of the people from this country. Most Rev. Dr. Lucey, Bishop of Cork, put it very well in the <i>Cork Examiner.</i>  He is a man with his ear to the ground.  He knows what goes on and is not driving about in a big State car.  He is meeting the ordinary, plain people of the country and knows their views.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A month ago in the Dáil when the Taoiseach was asked by a Fine Gael Deputy to state the number who had emigrated, the Deputy was informed that he could not be given any reliable information.  He could not be told the number that emigrated.  But now Fianna Fáil come in with prepared <Col N="1769" /> figures trying to prove that emigration has been reduced.  That is &ldquo;tommyrot&rdquo;.  What is happening at present is that whole families are emigrating. They are locking the kitchen door.  Small farmers&mdash;in some cases the father, his wife and five or six children&mdash;are going over to England. When they arrive only one person applies for a work permit and perhaps only one member of the family is registered as having entered the country whereas in fact a whole family of six or eight is involved.  When the Government speak of the number of unemployed being reduced by a few thousand they should know that you cannot expect people to be registered as unemployed in Ireland when they have emigrated and are working in Liverpool, Birmingham, London or some other English city.

      <P>Most Rev. Dr. Lucey speaking of the total population here now said there was less work and more unemployment than at an time since the famine.  That is quite true. The population of the country has decreased; anyone saying that we have 4,000 fewer people unemployed or that fewer people have emigrated must realise that.  If that is so, why did the <Col N="1771" /> Taoiseach not give the figures when he was asked to do so?  There are fewer people employed to-day under Fianna Fáil.  The average number of insurable people employed each week for the year ending 31st March, 1958 was the lowest for five years, 21,000 fewer than in 1957 and 36,700 fewer than in 1956. Those are facts and cannot be contradicted.</P>
      <P>There are more unemployed.  Let us take the numbers.  There are 902 fewer people employed on the roads at present.  The Minister cannot deny that because the figures were given recently in the Dáil.  In the past, money was given by the Government under the Local Authorities (Works) Act; in my own county during the term of office of the inter-Party Government, we got from £50,000 to £60,000.  That was money well spent because it helped to increase production. We know that a resolution was passed at the Fianna Fáil Ard Fheis last October asking the Government to reintroduce that scheme, but they will not do it because it was a scheme begun by the inter-Party Government.</P>
      <P>Despite all we heard here from Senator Colley and other Senators two years ago about the housing programme and despite the crocodile tears they shed about people unemployed, there were 2,439 fewer people employed on local authority housing in August 1958, as compared with August 1957.  We were told to-day about 1955 and about the then Government running away from its duties at that time.  I would like to nail that lie because I think that at that time the Government put Party before country and that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Senator L'Estrange was previously asked to stop to let the Minister in.  If the Minister is not getting in, I suggest Senator L'Estrange is entitled to continue his speech and we are entitled to go on here to-night or adjourn to-night and resume to-morrow.</P>

      <P>I asked Senator L'Estrange to stop for the purpose of letting the Minister in at a quarter to ten.  Before the matter was mentioned in the House, I spoke to the Minister outside on the basis that as far as I could see, with Senator Quinlan and Senator L'Estrange wanting to speak, he could not get in before a quarter to ten.  If the Minister is not going to get in at that time, Senator L'Estrange has been deceived and should be allowed to finish his speech.  It seems to me there are two courses open to us: first, to allow Senator L'Estrange to continue his speech and then adjourn at 10 o'clock and resume to-morrow, or secondly, let the Minister in to conclude as agreed.  After all, the Minister and Senator L'Estrange are on different side of the House, and how can we have two conclusions on behalf of the Government side?</P>

      <P>I think it is time to put the cards on the table about this matter.  I warned at the start of this debate between you and Senator L'Estrange that if Senator L'Estrange proceeded on the lines on which he was going, I would have a few words to say.  I also warned Senator Hayes to the same effect.  I sat here all day listening to the speeches, and if you read the Official Report, you will find that the number of speakers was heavily weighted on the <Col N="1773" /> side of the Opposition.  Senator L'Estrange began at a quarter past nine and, even according to Senator Hayes's interpretation of an agreement, he was to be finished before a quarter to ten.  At a quarter to ten, he showed no signs of finishing, and Senator Hayes then looked for another five minutes.  Why should we be bullied by either Senator Hayes or Senator L'Estrange?  The same thing happens every time.  Senator L'Estrange is put up as a bogey man to threaten the rest of us that if we do not give way for a few minutes, the Seanad will sit all night.</P>

      <P>Senator Mullins will now leave the matter to the Chair.  I understood, and I drew the attention of Senator L'Estrange and the House to the fact, that the Minister was to get in at a quarter to ten and I proposed to call on the Minister at a quarter to ten.  At that time, we had some interruptions.  As I said earlier, I suggested that if we had no interruptions, we would get the debate concluded more quickly.  Senator Hayes suggested that Senator L'Estrange should get five minutes. Senator Mullins did not protest and, in fact, Senator L'Estrange did not use the five minutes.  I assumed that would conclude the debate.  If Senator Mullins has a different point of view, the ruling of the Chair in this matter is that there is no agreement, that Senator L'Estrange is in possession and the House adjourns at 10 o'clock until to-morrow.  I just want to know what is in the mind of the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not unwilling to take responsibility.  I am quite prepared to take all kinds of responsibility. I have said privately to my friend, Senator ó Maoláin, that the less talk we have in the House about these matters, the better.  I did not put up Senator L'Estrange to speak at all.  It simply happened that <Col N="1774" /> Senator Quinlan was speaking and Senator L'Estrange wanted to speak. I made an arrangement with the Minister, of which Senator ó Maoláin is aware, that the Minister would get in at a quarter to ten.  I am not bullying or deceiving anybody.</P>
      <P>May I say there is no good in Senator ó Maoláin warning the Chair or the House that if a particular Senator does not make a particular kind of speech he, Senator ó Maoláin, will make a speech.  The only person entitled to judge what kind of speech a Senator makes is the Chair.  My intention was quite genuine all day to let the Minister in at 9.30 or 9.45. I suggested that Senator L'Estrange get five minutes.  He did not even use them.  If he stops now and the Minister gets in, well and good.  If the Minister does not get in, then obviously Senator L'Estrange has a right to continue and we ought to adjourn and meet to-morrow.</P>

      <P>Then I suggested at twenty to nine that the Minister should be called on at 9.30.  It was suggested by Senator Hayes that we make it a quarter to ten.  It was understood that people would try to make their speeches short.  At a quarter past nine, Senator Quinlan concluded and Senator L'Estrange began.  When he began, I drew the attention of the Chair to the fact that if he continued on the line on which he was going, and which he has adopted many times here, I would be compelled to say a few words.  I had no intention of speaking in this debate if Senator L'Estrange had not adopted that line.  This has happened so often in regard to misunderstandings about arrangements that in future I do not propose to sit here and listen to the character assassination campaign of Senator L'Estrange <Col N="1775" /> without asserting my right to speak. Senator L'Estrange is always put up as the bogey-man.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to deal with all the misstatements which Senator L'Estrange made because that would take me until daylight, and it would take too long to unravel them. There are two or three points which I wish to make clear. Senator L'Estrange probably thinks he is being smart and offensive to me by talking about the slaughtering of calves.  I always like to have the opportunity of explaining what happened.  I was Minister for Agriculture.  I was not in favour of slaughtering calves and it was not our policy to slaughter calves, but we were fighting an economic war with Britain and getting a poor price.  The farmers in the South of Ireland, who always slaughtered the inferior calves, slaughtered more calves than previously.  In order to compensate them to some extent, we gave them a bounty on calf skins.  The economic war ended because the farmers stood by us.  They fought that war successfully to a conclusion and we won the economic war, while Senator L'Estrange and his friends were going around in blue shirts trying to get the farmers to give in.  I have nothing to be ashamed of, but if I had worn a blue shirt I certainly would be ashamed for the rest of my life.  I would be ashamed to have put on a blue shirt and to have tried at that time to get the farmers to go against the Government.  That was the issue and that was what the Blue-shirts tried to do, but the farmers stood by us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another point which the Senator made was that we were now all in favour of grass.  We are not.  We are in favour of producing all the crops we can and whatever Deputy Dillon may get credit for, he certainly cannot get credit for wheat growing here.  In 1931, when we were in opposition, we introduced a motion advocating that wheat should be grown in order that we could supply ourselves with bread.  There was a Cumann na nGaedheal Government in office and they opposed it.  They said that millable wheat could not be grown and <Col N="1778" /> they issued a pamphlet to that effect. When we came into the office, we introduced the wheat scheme which was opposed by Cumann na nGaedheal. On one occasion, Deputy Dillon said that he would not be caught dead in a field of wheat, but we succeeded in getting millable wheat grown and, as a result, we were able to keep neutral during the 1939-45 war.  That we remained neutral may have been no concern of Deputy Dillon, but it was the concern of the Irish people.  Certainly we could never have done that but for the wheat policy.  It was absolutely a Fianna Fáil policy and there was no other Party in favour of it.</P>
    <P>We advocated also that we should grow barley and oats for feeding stuffs.  I remember arguing in the Dáil with the members of Fine Gael&mdash;I am not sufficiently well up in history to know when they changed their name from Cumann na nGaedheal&mdash;and that Party were always against us on the question of growing barley and oats on the grounds that we would lessen the amount of land for live stock.  We argued that there would be sufficient land for live stock and I remember quoting a very famous survey by Lord Bledisloe&mdash;I always remember the name&mdash;which showed that where good tillage was carried out, it would increase, and not decrease, the pasture that would be available for cattle; it would increase the produce from pasture because pasture would be improved as a result of tillage.</P>
    <P>I mention that to show our argument all the time was that you could carry the live stock as well.  Why now should we have a Senator like Senator L'Estrange&mdash;who we know has no great regard for the truth&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Hayes said the same thing before.  It is very good technique for Senator Hayes to have a man here to say things which he himself would not like to say. Senator L'Estrange said something which he says every time I come into this House.  He talks about production in 1947 and 1957, the number of cattle in the country, exports and so on, and he does not advert to the fact that there was a large scale war being fought, a desperate war for us.  We imported no feeding stuffs, and no fertilisers and as a result, we could not get production from the land. There were no seeds being imported, so that production was down for that reason also.  We had to depend entirely on our own production to feed our own people.  We got nothing into the country and had to rely on what we produced ourselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Naturally, we were down in stocks, but, by 1948, the country began to build up again.  Senator L'Estrange says that was due to Deputy Dillon and it always reminds me of those who attribute everything to Stalin and say: &ldquo;Stalin did that.&rdquo;  Look at the O.E.E.C. figures for Europe and you will find that, from 1947 to 1957, we were practically the lowest country in Europe, so far as improvement was concerned.  We have not done as well in production as other countries from 1947 to 1957.  We have not done as well in exports or any of the things that Senator L'Estrange mentioned <Col N="1781" /> as the achievements of Deputy Dillon. In all these countries in Europe where they have done so well, some of them have done twice as well as we have and a few, but very few, have done worse.  In these countries that did so well from 1947 to 1957 they had no Deputy Dillon as Minister for Agriculture or no Fine Gael Party to back him up and they certainly had no Fianna Fáil Party in 1947 to make the trouble to which Senator L'Estrange refers.</P>
    <P>Is it not time to drop all that talk about 1947 and 1957?  From 1939 to 1945 we had the biggest war ever in this world and Fianna Fáil, to the admiration of the people of this country, held out neutral, a thing the other Parties did not expect we could do. Naturally we were in very low water economically in 1947.  Senator L'Estrange also spoke about the big adverse balance of trade.  The very day the ports were open we imported all we could.  If we imported goods to the value of £130,000,000, that was a sign of a good Government.  Every Government was trying to get things in then not send them out.  I remember going over to England and asking: &ldquo;What will you give us?&rdquo;  That was the trend of negotiation all round and the countries that imported a lot were those where you had successful government. Therefore, the figure quoted by Senator L'Estrange for big imports in 1947 was a credit to the Fianna Fáil Government.</P>

      <P>With reference to 1956, Senator L'Estrange and others who stand behind Deputy Dillon talk about the Suez trouble.  The Suez trouble had no influence whatever on this country.  It could not have had any influence on this country when it had no influence on England, and the English economists have said that it had no effect on them.  The Opposition talk <Col N="1782" /> about Suez to cover up their mistakes of 1956 and ignore the last war as if it had never taken place at all.</P>
      <P>We ought to get down to a better basis of comparison than that.  If you take the economic indices for 1956 and compare them with those for 1955 and 1956 you will get a true measure of the incompetency of the Coalition Government.  Senator L'Estrange spoke about the agreement of 1948.  He did not tell us that it did any more than was done in 1938.</P>
      <P>Before the 1948 agreement was made, when our store cattle went over to England they had to be kept two months before they were slaughtered for the benefit of the British market, and the earmark put on them meant that they were cut by 5/- per cwt. Deputy Dillon said when going across that he intended to cut that 5/- per cwt. and he had it cut, I think, to 4/-, but he gave away a month's waiting period which was a very good bargain from the British point of view.</P>

      <P>No, only 1/-, and the cattle had to wait three months in England instead of two which was a very bad bargain from our point of view.  That was the only thing achieved by Deputy Dillon.  We have been told that everything we produce in this country had free access to the British market.  We always had that but how did it work?  About three months after the period I speak of, there was a by-election in Donegal.  At this time we could not sell our oats and the Government had to bring in a tariff on oats, a thing which Deputy Dillon was against in respect of any agricultural produce. We know what happened after that. Turkeys could not be sold.  They would be taken all right but at very low prices.  The same applied to eggs and poultry and that concession given by Britain to take all our produce was worth nothing except where Britain needed it, as in the case of cattle and sheep which they always needed and which we hope they always will need. <Col N="1783" /> I have not time to go through all the misstatements made by Senator L'Estrange so I shall leave it at that. However, I hope that the next time he speaks he will not repeat them because it will mean I shall lose a quarter of an hour or 20 minutes correcting him.</P>

      <P>Several Opposition Senators including Senator O'Brien and Senator Burke criticised our proposal to treat the fertiliser subsidy as a capital item.  Let me first of all quote from the White Paper which says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;To bring about a rapid expansion in the use of phosphates on grasslands is one of the main objectives of the Government policy.  It is not proposed to rely only on exhortation and advice.  The Government will make available a sum of £1.75 million each year for the next five years to reduce the price of phosphates and thus encourage farmers to use them more extensively.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to draw attention to the fact that in drafting this White Paper we had in mind&mdash;and nothing has occurred to make us change our minds in that respect&mdash;that it would be a temporary and intensive subsidisation of fertiliser.  For that reason it has been treated for the time being as a capital investment.  If it should be found necessary or advisable by a Government, say, in three or four years' time to make this a more lasting subsidy, then there would be every reason why it should be treated as current expenditure.  However, at the <Col N="1784" /> end of five years, having got the land into better shape and the farmers having developed the habit of using more fertilisers, it would be necessary either to drop the subsidy or, if we were to continue it, to find it out of current expenditure.</P>
    <P>Senator Baxter said that the phosphates would be used especially by the larger farmers.  I do not agree with that.  During the war when we were getting very little fertiliser into this country&mdash;we had a very small quantity some of which we mined from our own resources and some of which we got on a very limited quota abroad &mdash;the greatest clamour for fertiliser was from the small farmers of the West of Ireland.  They pointed out to me that they could not go on producing their potatoes and oats unless they used more fertiliser. There was not the same demand at all from the large farmers.</P>
    <P>Senator Baxter also spoke about changing Section B of the land drainage improvement scheme to a fertiliser scheme and said that this would mean that fertilisers would be used by the larger farmers.  If we were to take a census of the fertilisers used under this scheme and a census of the land improved under Section B of the land project, we would find that much more money was spent by the large farmers under the land project than under the fertiliser scheme.  As a matter of fact, so far as my observation goes in my own county, and the county in which I now live, every farmer I saw who took advantage of the B scheme was a big farmer.  It was not suitable for the small man so it was the big farmer who took advantage of it.  It cannot, therefore, be contended that in transferring this money over to the fertilisers, we are doing a disservice to the small farmer.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Donovan referred to paragraph 137 of the White Paper which sets out the four factors which are to be borne in mind in considering the extent to which external reserves should be drawn on to finance any gap in investments from available sources. The Senator said he disagreed with our conclusions, that is, so far as I have taken a note of his suggestions.  He <Col N="1785" /> expressed some criticism of the remarks in the White Paper concerning these external reserves and, so far as I could follow him, he thought if we had a different monetary system, we would be better off.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  What I wanted to put forward was simply that as a piece of currency theory, this was just tripe.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I must say in the system as it is, I do not see that any objection can be found to these conclusions. I was giving the Senator a bit of the benefit of the doubt in saying that perhaps he had another monetary system in mind.  Personally I do not believe&mdash;perhaps the Senator does&mdash;that any miracle would be worked by another monetary arrangement. Our economic ills will be settled by more production, not by more money, whatever way the money could be got and, therefore, I cannot see that miracles can be worked by a change in our monetary system.  As things stand at the moment, more harm than good might be done by making any change.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator O'Brien expressed disappointment at the 2 per cent. rate of increase in production, and said it would not solve our problems.  He said it would be less than the rate secured in Europe generally.  I agree that is quite true, but there is nothing to prevent us from getting an increase and we certainly will not object if the target is too low.  In other words, if we achieve more than we expect, if we get a higher increase than 2 per cent., naturally we shall be very glad. We came to the conclusion, in drawing up this White Paper, that it would be better not to put up targets we could not attain, because people are then disappointed, and it would be better really to exceed our target rather than not reach it.  For that <Col N="1786" /> reason, we were, perhaps, somewhat conservative.</P>
    <P>I am afraid, on the whole, Senator O'Brien's criticism of the White Paper was rather depressing.  I should have expected from an economist making an objective statement something different from what he gave expression to here yesterday evening.  We expect, as we state in the White Paper, to double our production inside of 35 years.  Well, of course, anybody may say to me: &ldquo;Why not treble or quadruple it?&rdquo;  Why not?  If we can, of course, why not?  We are just giving an estimate of what we can do with our present resources.</P>
    <P>We were not taking into account, I think, in that, what private enterprise may do, and we are making conditions for private enterprise, if you like, as favourable as we possibly can, by giving as Senators know, concessions in taxes on exports, concessions to people who start industries here.  I want to make it quite clear that whether they are native or foreign, they will get these concessions.  As a matter of fact, foreigners may not get exactly the same concessions as our own people at home, but they will get concessions in any case.  If we get a return from private enterprise, we expect to do better than two per cent. per year.</P>
    <P>I should also like to say that we have had general approval and general welcome for this White Paper.  It has been very well received on the whole. I do not want to give the impression that I am in any way disappointed or annoyed with any criticism that may be made.  Naturally, a certain amount of criticism could be made of any document that might be produced. What I am disappointed in, perhaps, is that when a person like Senator O'Brien offers a certain amount of criticism, we get nothing by way of an alternative to any of our proposals. It would be very welcome indeed if we could get some alternative from some of our critics.</P>
    <P>Generally speaking, this White Paper lays down targets of production. It does not even give an estimate of what the employment may be, but if there is more production, <Col N="1787" /> employment will naturally follow.  On the agricultural side, let me say that I do not believe there will be any increased employment certainly for the first five or ten years during which this White Paper is operating, because if you take, and they have already been quoted here, the figures of our employment in agriculture as compared with England or Sweden&mdash;two examples which rather coincide, where conditions are much the same as our own or at least quite near to our own&mdash;we would have to be producing about twice as much as we are producing at present, on the existing employment, to give the same return to those engaged in agriculture. Naturally, our people will look for a better return because that is what I suppose emigration means&mdash;if they are not getting the same conditions here as they can get elsewhere, they go. Therefore, they will look for the same return.</P>
    <P>We must face the issue that our production will be very much increased before the present force engaged in agriculture will be increased.  On the other hand, the fact that we increase agricultural production will give a fillip to our economy generally, because the farmers, the farmers' sons and the farm labourers, who we expect will do better as time goes on, will have more money to spend and the spending of that money will, in turn, I hope, promote industry.</P>
    <P>On the industrial side, we hope to get increased production.  In our efforts to increase production, we must see that it is efficient.  We cannot produce very much more for home consumption, so the extra production must be for export; and when we go into the export market, we have to compete against the world generally.  That means that we must be efficient in our methods, in order to capture the export markets.  The future there lies in developing our resources as quickly and as efficiently as we can, so that we will have a bigger volume and range of goods and services capable of being sold against all competitors.</P>
    <P>Although we have not given any estimate as to how that will affect unemployment and emigration, if we <Col N="1788" /> succeed in getting production going in that way, I think that employment will follow naturally, and then emigration will, of course, go down.  I am not claiming, and I do not want ever to be quoted as claiming, that we have solved unemployment and emigration by this White Paper; but if we achieve what we are aiming at in the White Paper, we at least are dealing with unemployment and emigration as effectively as they can be dealt with at the moment.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Donovan also quoted another figure, to the effect that between 1951 and 1954, when Deputy MacEntee was Minister for Finance, expenditure went up from £75,000,000 to £115,000,000.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>£105,000,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not checked on the figure.  I have accepted that figure from the Senator.  I remember one figure, because at that time I was Minister for Social Welfare and Minister for Health.  I know that during those three years I was responsible for taking £15,000,000 of that.  Actually, when leaving office in 1954, our expenditure on Social Welfare and Health had increased by £15,000,000 from 1951.  Therefore, if the expenditure by Deputy MacEntee went up by £30,000,000, half of it at least went on Social Welfare and Health.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator O'Donovan raised another point.  I said in the Dáil that the Book of Estimates was with the printer. Senator O'Donovan pointed out, since he came in, that it was not with the printer but with the Department of Finance.  That only strengthens my case, that I had nothing to do with the preparation of the Book of Estimates. I certainly had nothing to do with it, if the book was not printed when we came in; and I thought I had made my case when I showed it was with the printer, and that I had done enough. Now I am told by Senator O'Donovan that it had left the printer.  I certainly had nothing to do with the preparation of the Book of Estimates.  However, I am not going into that, as it would take too long.  I said that when challenging statements made by Deputies Costello and Sweetman with regard <Col N="1789" /> to the amount by which the Estimates should be reduced for 1957-58.</P>
    <P>There was a lot of talk here about unemployment.  I shall take the employment figure, as I think it is a better figure to take, since unemployment and emigration are so intermixed.  Anyone might easily get a favourable unemployment figure by more emigration, or an unfavourable unemployment figure by less emigration.  Therefore, the employment figure is the better one to take.  I take the employment figure for transportable goods industries, which is the one taken very often as an index of economic recovery.  In that particular year, 1958 over 1957, the figure went up by 2,000.  It is not very much, I admit, but it showed a definite trend.  It had come down by 6,000 from March, 1957, when we took office.  Obviously, we came in on a downward trend; and, as Senator Carter said here, a Government cannot stop a trend very quickly&mdash;it takes some time.  That figure probably went down and down until June or September, and then it began to rise again.  We are now on the upgrade, at any rate, and that is a more hopeful sign.</P>
    <P>One Senator here expressed his doubts about the amount of money which will be available for agriculture by way of credit.  We mention a figure in the White Paper&mdash;I think somewhere about £7,000,000.  As a matter of fact, we found that the commercial banks&mdash;and we did not have this figure at the time we were preparing the White Paper&mdash;between October, 1957, and October, 1958, had increased their advances to farmers by £3,000,000.  They went up from £16,500,000 to £19,500,000.  I was asked in the Dáil if that meant that farmers were hard up after the bad harvest and that they had borrowed for that reason.  That was not the reason, since the farmers' balances in the banks had gone up slightly at the same time, I think.  Anyway, we all know that the joint stock banks now are generally issuing schemes, every day of the week.  One bank is issuing one scheme and another bank has a different scheme; and the general trend now is that bankers are inviting farmers to come in and ask for money.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1790" /> It is a great change, it must be admitted, over a period of two years. When we came into office, the banks were taking in loans; there was a credit squeeze; and they were pressing for money.  People were coming along and saying: &ldquo;For goodness' sake, talk to the bank and ask for a little more time.&rdquo;  It is a very good economic trend that credit should be available now so easily.  It is not there for everybody, of course, but at least it is more readily available than it was two years ago.  I suppose we can claim, as other Governments have claimed in the past&mdash;though we do not often claim things for ourselves&mdash; that we have brought the country from despair to hope and confidence.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Brien talked about a reduction of taxation, as did other Senators.  I am not clear on what the Senators have in mind.  When they talk about a reduction in taxation, they might mean, for instance, that we should do with less money than we had last year.  Or they might mean that some tax should be reduced, by taking something off beer or income-tax, and in that way taxation would be reduced.  It is possible that we might reduce the incidence of taxation by reducing income-tax or by reducing the taxes on, say, beer or tobacco, and at the same time, collect more money.  If the country were on the upward trend and money were coming in better, we would collect more money.</P>
    <P>The revenue, as Senators know, in 1958, was on the same tax level as in 1957, but the revenue yield itself was much better.  I do not know how much better for this year yet, but I know it is going to be better.  If the tax incidence were not increased or, better still, if the tax incidence were reduced, even though more money may be taken in for expenditure, the Government which could do that would be doing fairly well.  Of course, I am not in a position to say that anything either way can be done in the Budget which is coming along at the moment.</P>
    <P>Senator Murphy said the Government had become complacent about <Col N="1791" /> unemployment.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  As a matter of fact, I think we have always that figure in front of us, as regards unemployment and emigration; and every economic step which we are taking is taken with a view to absorbing the unemployed and cutting down emigration. We do not come along and say we are going to employ 150 men here or 100 there, but we know that, if the methods we are adopting succeed, employment will follow.</P>
    <P>Senator Barry started off by saying that he would not talk Party politics. I always get suspicious when I hear someone saying that.  However, I think it would have been better for Senator Barry to have talked Party politics than start attacking one Party after the other.  He tried to kill confidence generally in politicians and that is a very bad thing to do. Cynicism is the easiest thing in the world for anyone to practise, but it is very damaging.</P>
    <P>The Senator who spoke next said that the coalition's first care is agriculture, while Fianna Fáil's first care is always industry.  I do not think that is true.  In another part of his speech, he said that expenditure had gone up by £6,000,000 since we came into office.  If you take industry and agriculture and put his statement to the test, you find that in those three years&mdash;the third Book of Estimates is before you&mdash;agricultural expenditure is up by £3.35 million during that time; Education is up by £1.8 million; Social Welfare is up by £2.6 million. That is more than the £6,000,000 he spoke of.  On the other hand, the Industry and Commerce Vote has gone down very much&mdash;more, actually, than the amount of the food subsidies which were taken from that Vote. There is no support then for the statement that the Coalition Government always put agriculture first while the Fianna Fáil Government always put industry first.  We keep both before our minds all the time.  I hope the coalition did too.</P>
    <P>Senator Stanford, and other speakers, made a comparison&mdash;it is a type of comparison I dislike very much&mdash;<Col N="1792" /> between the amount of money spent on education and the amount provided for some other services.  These speakers talked about our spending £5,000,000 on a transatlantic air service while only £100,000 was provided for something else.  One can draw any number of comparisons like that.  Is it the idea that we should not spend money on, say, a transatlantic air service, shipping, or some other scheme until certain other things are done first?  It is possible the country needs other things, but we must at all times preserve a balanced economy.  When we devote £5,000,000 to developing a transatlantic air service, that is capital development. We are assured by the experts&mdash;I myself know little or nothing about it&mdash; that this service will be a paying proposition.  If it is, well and good. We put in £5,000,000 and on that £5,000,000 we get interest.</P>
    <P>Senator Stanford talked about giving more to the universities.  The sum he mentioned was, if you like, a comparatively small amount&mdash;£20,000, £30,000 or £40,000.  There is no reason, of course, why we should refuse to have a transatlantic air service in order to give this money, if it is necessary, to the universities.  But one must preserve a certain proportion.  The type of argument advanced is founded on the pedagogic approach.  People making the comparison say: &ldquo;You can give all you like to a transatlantic air service but you cannot give £20,000 to this or £10,000 to that.&rdquo;  I admit a Government has to put up with that sort of criticism; it is all too common.  But the argument is not well founded.</P>
    <P>Senator Donegan accused us of establishing this service because the coalition scrapped it.  I think it would be truer to say the coalition scrapped it because it was our idea first.  Indeed, I think the coalition made a grave mistake in scrapping it, but they set out in 1948 to prove that we had been an extravagant Government.  They stopped the transatlantic air service, and the Bray Road scheme.  I could never understand why the Bray Road should be regarded as a Fianna Fáil road while the Naas Road was not.  But that appears to be the coalition reasoning. I saw three people killed on the <Col N="1793" /> Bray Road and, when I cannot leave Dublin before half past ten, I wait until after 12 because I do not want to be killed on the Bray Road.  Apparently the coalition did not care who was killed on it so long as they could call it a Fianna Fáil road.</P>
    <P>Senator Stanford talked about capital expenditure on our universities. That is a different matter, but there is a limit to the amount of capital one can find.  It is much easier for a Minister for Finance, on the whole, to supply capital rather than current expenditure because he may not get the revenue to meet current expenditure.  With capital expenditure, however, he will have a pretty fair idea as to whether or not the proposed expenditure will recoup itself and therefore it is much easier for him to find capital expenditure.  If the committee inquiring into the matter make a recommendation in relation to University College, Dublin, and if the Government agree&mdash;the Government naturally must agree&mdash;things will be done.</P>
    <P>Senator Stanford referred to our attitude towards Trinity College.  I cannot speak with any familiarity on all the little details&mdash;this is the bailiwick of the Minister for Education&mdash; but I know some of the principles he has in mind.  I know that many factors were taken into consideration in deciding the amount of the grant to each of the four colleges.  Number of staff as compared with the students was one; another was the growth in the number of students&mdash;how many new students since the last grant was given.  It would obviously be unfair to give the same percentage grant all round because one college might have had no increase in the number of students and another might have had a very big increase. All that had to be taken into account and that brought one down to the average grant per student.  The amount was not fixed, of course, but there was a comparison made.</P>
    <P>There is also a different standard of remuneration in the colleges.  That had to be borne in mind.  All these factors were taken into account.  I do not know how they were weighted, but they were all taken into account <Col N="1794" /> before the money was apportioned between the four colleges.</P>
    <P>A question was asked as to why Maynooth was not included.  I would advise Senators to let Maynooth look after itself.  There is no doubt it can look after itself.  The same advice applies in relation to the religious authorities in charge of these auxiliary agricultural colleges.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister please explain?  How can they look after themselves?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am merely saying that Maynooth is a very efficient organisation. It has a very efficient governing body.  They are well able to look after themselves.  I do not think they want any interference.</P>
      <P>Senator Baxter said that there can be no hope of reducing taxation unless there is increased production and increased employment.  Our income from taxation was higher in 1958 than it was in 1957 so, on Senator Baxter's formula, there must have been more people in production and more people in employment in 1958 as compared with 1957.  That is a fairly good indication of the position. When people are productive and when people are in employment they spend more on goods which are taxed and in that way revenue increases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think it right for Senator Baxter to say that the problem of emigration is not receiving the attention it should.  Perhaps he is right in a way because, no matter how much attention it gets, I agree it would not be too much.  At the same time I should not like it to be taken that we are ignoring or neglecting the problem.  We certainly keep it in the forefront as far as we possibly can. The White Paper clearly indicates our aims for increasing production.  If we succeed in that, employment will follow.  When employment follows, emigration will be reduced.  I am not finding fault with Senator Baxter for his criticism, but what we would really like are concrete suggestions.  Apart from what we have tried to do ourselves, we have not got any useful suggestions from others as to how we <Col N="1795" /> could increase employment.  We have certainly got no feasible suggestions. We should be glad to get them.</P>
    <P>It is not correct to say that we have stopped land improvement.  We have stopped Section B of the scheme because we felt there was a good deal of waste under it.  I shall not go into the figures now because it will not help my case, or prove anything, just to show that a huge sum was paid out, and not always to the best advantage. Any Senator can say: &ldquo;Stop that, and put a limit on the amount.&rdquo;  As far as I could see, the scheme appeared to me to be essentially wasteful.</P>
    <P>I think Senators generally have believed that Government Departments do not do things as well as private enterprise will do them.  I think a farmer who is spending a certain grant on reclamation will make much better use of it than the Department of Agriculture.  If it is done under Section A, where the farmer gets a certain grant and puts a certain amount to it himself, he will see that the work is done to better advantage. Therefore, I think we will get better work under that Section.</P>
    <P>To talk about reclamation in Bangor Erris is not a comparison.  That was done as an experiment&mdash;to do a certain amount of research on reclamation of that kind and see what good use it could be put to.  It may be very expensive indeed.  We are trying to find out if it is economic for the ordinary farmer to do it commercially. We have not learned enough yet to be able to pronounce on that.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator McGuire: I think we all agree that we have, maybe, to add to our plans now for the development of industry&mdash;particularly because we have now reached the stage of practically supplying our own needs in most of the things we want.  To have any sort of substantial increase in industry means that we must go into export.  In turn, that means that it must be very much more efficient and better organised.  I think we have offered any inducements we can offer to people who propose to go into that sphere of activity.</P>
    <P>As Senators know, we are remitting income-tax on export profits and also <Col N="1796" /> giving certain grants and loans to people to start industry, and so on.  We cannot, from the financial side, be expected to do any more.  I think Senator McGuire said we were not perhaps advertising our wares sufficiently in that regard.  That may be.  However, we can have a look at that, too.</P>
    <P>I do not want to enter into the point made about decentralisation.  There may be a good lot indeed in what Senator McGuire says, namely, that for an industry to be efficient, it must be able to compete against industries in other countries and that it should, therefore, get everything possible in its favour and should be allowed to go wherever those engaged in it think is the best place to go.  In a case like that, they are not finding any great difficulty.  It was all right, in starting small industries in the past for the home market, to try to direct them to the smaller centres in order to give a bit of employment here and there. They probably could carry on all right.</P>
    <P>I should like to assure Senator Donegan that I myself got an invoice for fertilisers and, as he points out, superphosphate is down, I think, at £12 10s. per ton and then, underneath, is written &ldquo;Subsidy £4; net £8 10s.&rdquo; Senator Donegan wanted to know if that is put in by the Fianna Fáil Government for political kudos.  I do not think so.  I think it is put in by the Department of Agriculture in order to go as far as they possibly can to see that the subsidy is passed on to the consumer.  I think it is a safeguard in that way for the consumer.</P>
    <P>Senator Donegan also said that the abolition of the food subsidies is still having its effect.  He talked about the increases in the costs of local authority institutions which stem from that and says that the same thing applies to revenue here.  Whatever about the revenue, this applies to expenditure: when I say to him that the current expenditure as forecast for 1959-60, is lower actually than that which he had in 1958-59, it means that there is no point whatever in his case.</P>
    <P>Senator Donegan says it is difficult for farmers to know what they got for their wheat last year.  I should love to deal with that question, but perhaps it <Col N="1797" /> is getting too late.  They got more than they were promised because 90 per cent. of last year's wheat was unmillable. No promise was ever made to any farmer that unmillable wheat would be taken from him.  I think I can say, in respect of every scheme by every Government, that the prices were fixed for millable wheat.  Last year, 90 per cent. of the wheat was unmillable.  It was taken from the farmers as an <i>ex gratia</i> gesture by the Fianna Fáil Government.  Therefore, the farmers got more than they were promised.  I shall leave that to my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, when he is dealing with the motion on the Order Paper.</P>
    <P>I am grateful to Senator Donegan. He said he would defend the Government against a group movement for more for old age pensioners.  He said it would cost £1,000,000 and that the Government find it very hard to get £1,000,000&mdash;which is very good and kind of the Senator.  But when they said to him: &ldquo;What about the £5,000,000 for transatlantic air services?&rdquo; he probably said: &ldquo;There you are.  We did away with that and they are putting it on again.&rdquo;  I do not know if he really defended this Government very strongly.</P>
    <P>Senator Sheehy Skeffington spoke about penal reform.  Nearly all the leaders of Fianna Fáil and some of Fine Gael were in jail in their time. While he was speaking, I asked myself why we do not take more interest in it.  I think it is that, from our experience, the penalty of being in jail consists of 95 per cent. loss of freedom and that the conditions there do not matter so much.  Being away at all is the really hard part of it.  I suppose that is why we have not taken great interest in these penal settlements, wherever they may be.</P>
    <P>To abolish the means test for old age pensioners would cost £2,500,000, but I do not think I could agree with doing that.  I am speaking very academically now, I can assure the House.  If I had £1,000,000 to spare and the Government told me to devote it to the old age pensioners, I would give it to the existing old age <Col N="1798" /> pensioners rather than abolish the means test.  Those who have no means whatever could probably do with a little more and those who have not the old age pension have means and are not so terribly badly off as the others.</P>
    <P>I do not agree, either, with Senator Sheehy Skeffington about Irish.  He says we should regard it as a live language and have an oral examination. I regard it not only as a live language but as an official language. Therefore, I do not see the necessity for an oral examination.  We do not have an oral examination in English, for instance.  Why should we have it in Irish if it is to be put on the same footing as English?  I do not think I have anything else to deal with on the points put up to me.</P>

      <P>I promised Senator Dowdall that I would give her the reference to a statement by Mr. Verolme.  I went to the trouble of looking up the reference.  It is in the <i>Irish Independent,</i> Saturday, January 10th, 1959, on the main page.  It is at <Col N="1800" /> a news conference that Mr. Verolme held.  This is the note:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Asked why he had come to Ireland, Mr. Verolme replied: &lsquo;I have not come to make money.  I have been plagued by your ambassador and your Government to come&rsquo;.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I used the word &ldquo;badgered&rdquo;.  That is the only point on which I should amend that reference.  Senator Dowdall is quite wrong in suggesting that my reference was not correct.</P>
