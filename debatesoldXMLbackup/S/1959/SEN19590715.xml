      <P>It is with feelings of profound regret that I have to announce the death of our colleague, Senator Johnny O'Leary.  Go ndéana Dia trócaire ar a anam.</P>
      <P>At our last meeting he was here amongst us and, to all intents and purposes, he appeared to be his usual self.  While we all know that he had been in indifferent health for some time past, nevertheless, his passing was most unexpected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From his earliest years, the late Senator displayed a deep interest in the trade union movement and it was as a member of the Labour Party he first entered public life.  He took a prominent part in the affairs of his native county and was, for some <Col N="218" /> years, Chairman of the Wexford County Council and also of the Enniscorthy Urban Council.  In addition he was a member of the Wexford County Committee of Agriculture and the County Vocational Education Committee taking a very particular interest in the latter.</P>
    <P>In 1943, he was first elected a member of Dáil Éireann in the Labour interest and remained a member of that House until 1957 when he was elected a member of Seanad Éireann on the Administrative Panel.</P>
    <P>A forceful and vigorous speaker, he was most zealous in his parliamentary duties both as a Deputy and as a Senator.  He rarely missed a meeting of the Seanad or the Dáil when he was a member of that House.  During his years as a public representative, he devoted his time and energy unsparingly to the welfare of the people in national and local spheres.  Of a kindly and humorous disposition, he was popular with members of the Oireachtas of all Parties.</P>
    <P>To the widow and relatives of the late Senator, I shall convey on your behalf and on my own, our sympathy and appreciation.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That Section 2 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="OwenSkeffington" hpid="Dr. Sheehy Skeffington Dr. Sheehy Skeffington">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>There are just two points I should like to put.  I notice that Section 2 deals with certain grants for the erection of dwelling-houses and so on, their improvement and extension, under four heads.  Sums of £80 for two rooms, £110 for three rooms, £130 for four rooms and £150 for five rooms are being granted.  I notice that there is an implication here that the price per room will drop fairly considerably the more rooms you add. I should like to hear the Minister comment on that.  At first sight, it seems to be a legitimate presumption, but I notice that when, for instance, a primary school of 78 classrooms is being put up, the price per classroom remains somewhere around £5,000 or £6,000.  It does not seem to drop much, no matter how many classrooms you have.  I wonder if the Minister has any precise data on this suggestion that it will be cheaper per room if you put up three or four or more.  Will it be so in practice?</P>
      <P>The second question I should like to ask is: have any steps been taken, or have any arrangements been made, to help the recipients of such grants with the design of the extension of their premises?  Is there any help given to them in selecting the design or in planning the extension, or in making the best out of the money and also making the extension fit in best not only with their present accommodation but also with the countryside?  Do they get any specific help with the planning of this improvement or extension of their dwellings?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Minister for the Gaeltacht (Mr. Moran) Michael Moran">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Gaeltacht (Mr. Moran)</NameTxt>
      <P>These grants are improvement grants.  They are not for additional rooms.  They are normal improvement grants where you have a house which people want to improve, just in the same way as you have improvement grants under the Department of Local Government.  As far as the design is concerned or any help being given to the applicants, if they wish to get help, our housing inspectors are there to help and advise them <Col N="224" /> with any proposed improvements they wish to make.  I think the Senator is under a misapprehension and that he is contemplating that these are additional rooms.  Actually, the purpose here is to improve the house as it exists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OwenSkeffington" hpid="Dr. Sheehy Skeffington Dr. Sheehy Skeffington">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of that reply, this is for the improvement or extension of existing premises. I find it harder to justify in my mind, therefore, the reduction of the grants according as you improve three rooms or two rooms.  If you decide, for instance, to put an additional window in each of the two rooms, it does not really become cheaper if you decide to put them in three or four rooms.  I should like to hear why there is this implication that it will be cheaper per room if you do a lot of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>Offhand, I would suggest to the Senator that the bigger the job of improvement, the cheaper it would be for the contractor.  For instance, if he has to do only two windows as the Senator suggests, and has to get his equipment there, it would probably be much more economic for him, if he has to do three or four rooms.  The Senator will appreciate that these grants, like the Local Government grants, are designed not to cover the full cost of the work. They are supplemental and in all these cases naturally the applicant has got to provide a certain amount of his own money.  The Senator will also appreciate that we must keep somewhat in line with the Department of Local Government and the grants provided by them.  We give a lot more for improvement than they do, but we have gone further in this than has been done before for this purpose, that is, for improving existing accommodation.  In another section of the Bill, there is special help being given for additional rooms.  I just want to make that clear, that this is for improving houses that are there and it does not contemplate additional rooms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a fact that this money is intended, in the main, for people who will not employ a contractor at all?  A great deal of the work in these areas is done by the <Col N="225" /> people themselves, with the exception of certain jobs such as repairing roofs and windows and so on, and the price, therefore, is not a price which is such as would satisfy a contractor.  I do not think the Minister is right when he says that it is not contemplated that a room will be added.  It is quite plain that it is so contemplated and if you work mathematically, the more rooms you add on&mdash;and Senator Sheehy Skeffington was right&mdash;the less you get per room for doing so.  The real argument for the section would appear to be to help people, who in their circumstances and having a considerable amount of free time at certain times of the year and having certain materials convenient to them, in the main, do the work themselves.  That is the justification, I think, rather than the statement that the more you give a contractor to do, the less per unit it will be.  It seems to me it is based largely on the consideration that people will put a lot of their own labour into the work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>In practice, the Senator is correct.  They do quite a lot of this work themselves, but again I should like to make it clear that the purpose of this section is to increase the improvement grants that have been provided over the years.  That is the main purpose of this section.  Senators will see later on that we have special grants for additional rooms but the real purpose of this section is to increase the improvement grants which were in existence before under our housing code.</P>

      <P>Faoi Alt a 3 (1), ba mhaith liom ceist a chur ar an Aire.  Mar shocraíonn fear tí, nó úinéir tí, uisce a tharraingt isteach go dtí a thí agus muna bhfuil casán poiblí ann chun an t-uisce sin a thabhairt chun an tí, bhfuil aon chumhacht ann chun cabhrú leis cead d'fháil ón bhfear gur leis an talamh timpeall an tí chun píopaí nó gléasanna camraí a chur tríd an talamh sin?  Sin ceann de sna ceisteanna achrannacha atá ann.  Go minic, bíonn tobar in áit amháin agus tigh cónaithe in áit eile, nó bíonn an tobar i bpáirc gur le daoine eile é.  Bhfuil aon tslí ann chun ceadúnas d'fháil ó aoine, ceadúnas do-sheacanta, chun uisce d'fháil?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tá ceist eile agus is dóigh liom gur ceart go mbeadh léargas ina taobh.  Is minic nach bhfuil bóithre cearta, casáin chearta, isteach chun cuid de sna tithe.  Tarlíonn tubaistí den tsaghas san.  Tagann an fhairrge agus scuabann sí an casán nó an bealach sin.  Bíonn an cheist chéanna ann, i gcás slí chun an tí a dheisiú.  Bhfuil aon córas nó gléas a gheobhaidh chead dóibh chun na nithe sin a dhéanamh? Is dóigh liom go mbaineann an cheist <Col N="227" /> sin leis an Roinn Talmhaíochta nó leis an Roinn Tailte.  Is ceist í a thagann isteach go minic, go mór mhór i leith uisce, i dtaobh draeneacha, le hiad a chur go dtí áit oiriúnach chun nithe do bhreith ón tigh agus sa chás sin bíonn talamh ag an gcomharsan sa tslí. B'fhéidir nach bhfuil réiteach éigin chun ceadúnas den tsórt san d'fháil.</P>

      <P>I asked the Minister a question on the previous section&mdash;I was under a misapprehension, and he corrected me, that the section related to new buildings.  This section does relate to new buildings. It relates to the building of holiday chalets, or to the building of holiday hostels, and there are grants available up to the amount of £200 for the holiday chalets, and £5,000 for the hostels.  The Minister told us earlier that with regard to design, the receivers of grants will have available to them the services, help and advice of Government inspectors.  I should like to ask does that include architectural advice and help free of charge?  Will that be provided?  That is my first point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My second point is: will there be any obligation upon them to seek architectural advice, because, particularly in <Col N="229" /> the case of the bigger buildings, it would be necessary, from the community point of view, that they should be obliged to seek such architectural advice?  That advice would be necessary even in the case of the smaller chalets and there should be an obligation on them to seek architectural advice because one can imagine springing up a sort of bungaloid growth which would be very unpleasing. Therefore, I should like to know (a) will free architectural help be made available to them and (b) will there be any obligation upon them to use that advice?</P>

      <P>Senator Sheehy Skeffington has made a very important point.  There is some risk of houses being built, under this Bill, which might really spoil the landscape and which might be ugly and unsuitable.  Is there any provision for controlling that?  If there is not, I suggest to the Minister that there should be.  There is some risk that these houses might be on the cheap and ugly side.  I am sure the Minister will do anything he can to avoid that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I should be very anxious to avoid anything that has been suggested by both Senators on that line.  At the moment, I am drafting regulations which will specify what we consider should be the minimum space to qualify for our chalet grants. I should tell Senators that the plans of the proposed chalets will have to be approved by my inspectors and, in so far as we have that power, we shall have control so as to provide against the type of development Senators have in mind.</P>

      <P>The Minister's answer is satisfactory, as far as it goes, in relation to the power he has to ensure that these buildings are physically sound and I hope he will see to it that they are not eyesores, as he says.  It would be possible for the buildings to be sound architecturally and yet be horrible to look at, or without necessarily being horrible to look at, they might be out of place in their context.  He did not answer the other question as to whether free advice will be given to these people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say that I have never been enthusiastic about increasing State control in every department of our lives as has gone on here since 1922.  Aesthetic control is the kind of control that the State and civil servants are least able to exercise satisfactorily.  I realise, of course, that these grants might have lamentable results from the point of view of the landscape, and the visitor's eye.  At the same time, I rather think that if there is to be any form of control with regard to the type of chalet or building that is to be put up, that control should be as little as possible from Dublin.  If it is to be exercised from Dublin, it should be done by some people who know something about the local landscape.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An effort should be made not to put something up which would be beautiful to the eye of a Dubliner, but something which blends with the landscape, <Col N="231" /> which, by the way, the old comfortable unhygienic house did, and which a number of new houses built under the 1929 Act did not.  I happen to know that very well.  I have lived in some of these houses and they are hard to live in.  The old houses were built by very intelligent country people in shelter and when the prevailing wind was blowing, you were always sheltered from it in the kind of house which a countryman built.</P>
    <P>The house which an inspector built which was condemned in Irish as &ldquo;tig ar árd&rdquo;&ldquo;house on a height&rdquo; was full of doors and in the month of July you were blown out of it.  There is something to be said for the ordinary countryman as against the inspector or even the Dublin architect.  I say that with bated breath and in a humble whisper. I feel it is a problem which cannot be solved by somebody in a Dublin office drawing up a plan and saying: &ldquo;There now, put that up in Connemara or in Gweedore.&rdquo;  He should know something about Connemara and Gweedore. If we are going to build these houses, an effort should be made to put them in the kind of place where they will have the most shelter and where they will blend best with the landscape. Notoriously, a number of newly built houses do not so blend.</P>
    <P>There is another point with which I should like to deal, that is, the Irish language point.  This whole scheme is supposed&mdash;I should not say supposed; I give the Minister credit for sincerity &mdash;to be in the interest of the Irish language and to enable people to provide accommodation for visitors in these areas.  They are the Gaeltacht areas and, by definition, they are remote and they are all the more beautiful for being so remote.  In them you get cleanliness, good food and great friendliness from the people, and if you add to that the advantages this Bill confers, you make them very satisfactory as resorts for the visitors and very cheap. I know people who go to Connemara who have not a word of Irish, and have no interest in Irish, but they find it very cheap, very friendly and very beautiful.</P>
    <P>I do not know if the Minister or anybody <Col N="232" /> else can frame any regulations to prevent this kind of building from being used simply for pecuniary benefit by people who have no regard for the Irish language.  For example, when a grant has been made for this type of chalet, can it be sold?  Can it not be sold without the Minister's consent?  Is that right?  Can it be transferred to other people who have no interest in Irish?  I do not object to that but I think since people are getting these grants because of their situation and because of the Irish language, it should be used for the benefit of the language.</P>
    <P>There is a considerable influx already into these areas, which are beautiful by definition and which are now clean, have good food and can be frequented by people who do not want to go to a luxury hotel in Dublin but who want a holiday and who want to benefit from the great friendliness and charm of the people, with no regard at all for the Irish language.  If regulations can be made to prevent that situation from arising I should be glad, but I think it is a matter of very great difficulty.</P>
    <P>I come back now to the first point about the aesthetic control.  With regard to the bigger building which is contemplated here, the £5,000 building, I think great care should be taken to see that it is suitably built&mdash;and &ldquo;suitability&rdquo; to me means that it should blend with the landscape in the area. That would be my definition of &ldquo;aesthetic control&rdquo; in that matter.</P>
    <P>I strongly recommend that the Minister should endeavour to get that done and not in accordance with new ideas, strange ideas, and so on.  I recommend that he should see what happens in the particular area and see that any building put up is suitable for that particular area and blends with its features.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OwenSkeffington" hpid="Dr. Sheehy Skeffington Dr. Sheehy Skeffington">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make it clear that I agree with Senator Hayes.  It is obvious that you cannot plan this simply from a Dublin office. On the other hand, I think he recognises, too, the danger of allowing them to go unplanned.  The way in which they should be directed is the way he suggests.  I think he would agree that if you leave it to the local man to put <Col N="233" /> up a holiday chalet he will, in accordance with his usual practice, make a good job of it.  However, the building of a £6,000 or £7,000 hostel is not part of the country craft and it is possible he might put up a monstrosity.  I would plead, therefore, not just for desk help but for intelligent help which I think he would get from the Department and relate it very strictly to the locality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFirmullaghOReilly" hpid="Mr. O'Reilly Mr. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am inclined to inquire at this stage how far the powers given under this Bill will harmonise or clash with the Town Planning Acts.  As things are, the control and the operation of the Town Planning Acts are matters for the local authority.  Take the cases of Donegal, Mayo and Kerry.  It would be a matter for the county councils of Donegal or of Mayo or of Kerry.  While it is optional for these county councils to put a Town Planning Act into operation, once it is in operation and a town planning officer is appointed, the control of all buildings, private or public, would appear to be vested in the town planning officer.  That would apply in the case of Mayo if the Mayo County Council put the Town Planning Act into operation and the same can be said in relation to Donegal or Kerry.</P>
      <P>Since this power to control buildings is being given to the Minister, will he have extra territorial rights or will plans of those buildings still have to be perused by the town planning officer in the counties I have mentioned? I do not know the position. I fancy that if the Act referred to is in force, then the power given under this Bill will not prevent the town planning officer in the areas from having a word to say on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to support Senator Sheehy Skeffington.  I think the person who objects to the use of the word &ldquo;aesthetic&rdquo; is often an inverted aesthete.  I am sure it is possible to get minimum standards of quality and character.  I am also quite sure it is not impossible that even a Dublin architect could devise buildings that will be both sheltered and aesthetic.  I believe that standard should be admitted in this case.  We could do a great deal of harm.  The <Col N="234" /> worst thing that happened to the countryside in my lifetime was the introduction of concrete.  I have seen some horrible productions.  Do not let that happen here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>In the case of the Bruanna or the hostels, plans from an architect will have to be submitted to my Department before we approve of a grant.  Therefore, in these cases, the question of the architect comes in.  I should also say that, where we give a grant for a hostel, for instance, to a local development committee or to a religious community or to an Irish college, they will have to appoint trustees who will be answerable to us and submit to us the plans from their architect of the building for our approval.</P>
      <P>As far as the chalets are concerned, Senators will notice&mdash;I think there was some mention of it here the last day&mdash; that I did not attempt to define chalets in this Bill.  I had a number of reasons for that, outside of the difficulty of getting a definition.  One of the things I did not want to do was by this legislation to produce a mass product&mdash; the same all over the place.  I wanted to give the people the opportunity to work out their own ideas on this matter.  It may well be, and I am sure it will come to pass under this Bill, that you will have competition between different chalet owners.  Some of them may be prepared to put up a much more elaborate chalet&mdash;three of them, for instance&mdash;than others for the sake of attracting better or a more remunerative type of occupant.  Therefore, I wanted to leave that free.</P>
      <P>I should also like to tell the House that it is my intention, with the help of some of our Irish organisations such as Comhdháil Náisiúnta na Gaeilge, to start parish committees in the Gaeltacht that will, in conjunction with my inspectors or my stiúrthóirí, not alone urge the people to take advantage of these provisions but also give them any help and advice they may require on questions of location and other matters that have been referred to here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Hayes raised the matter of these people selling the chalets.  I propose to take power under the regulations <Col N="235" /> to provide that they will not be able to sell them for a period of five years.  I think that will be sufficient control for my purpose.  I hope that, having got their three chalets, they will be ploughing back some of the profits they make, to put up a couple more. That is the ultimate development I have in mind.</P>
    <P>I do not think the question raised about town planning will affect us.  As far as I know, I have not come across the provisions of the Town Planning Acts in any of the Gaeltacht areas I am dealing with.  That has been confined, as far as I know, in the West to towns with a certain population.  I do not think we will run up against any of the difficulties or have any clashes as far as the town planning question is concerned.</P>

      <P>I am still not satisfied with regard to the Minister's reply in relation to the operation of <Col N="237" /> the Town and Regional Planning Act. As far as I know, once a county council decides to put the Town and Regional Planning Act into operation, say, in the case of the Mayo County Council, every building in County Mayo, whether in Castlebar or in Achill, must be submitted to the planning officer for a decision.  While some counties have not put the Act into operation, other counties, even counties which have no urban area, have implemented it to try to prevent those monstrosities that have been referred to by the Senator on the other side of the House.  It has been said that many of the monstrosities are made of concrete.  That may be true, but many very useful buildings have been erected in concrete, more useful than monstrous; the monstrosities are few.  With a certain amount of artistry and symmetry in design, quite graceful buildings can be erected in concrete.  However, that is a separate issue.  I still think I am right when I say that once a Town Planning Act is put into operation in Donegal or Mayo the officer is entitled to see that the plan of the building is all right, whether it is sited properly, and to give approval or refuse approval, as the case may be.</P>
      <P>I wish to inquire whether it will be necessary when this Bill is enacted for people to submit their plans to the town planning officer, if and when the Mayo County Council put that Act into operation, if it is not already in operation.  The Minister may say he does not foresee any clash in relation to these two measures.  That is not the issue.  It is the question as to whether the local authority or the town planning officer of the local authority will still have the power vested in him which he has under the Town Planning Act.</P>

      <P>If Senator O'Reilly is right, of course we shall submit plans to the planning authority.  I am speaking from recollection but I was under the impression that town planning, where it had been adopted by a local authority in my part of the world was confined to towns over a certain population. I may be wrong in that, but if <Col N="238" /> the local authority has adopted the Town Planning Act and it is necessary for us to submit our plans, we shall certainly do so.  We shall be very glad to co-operate with the local authority. In fact, my Department in every county in which there is a Gaeltacht area is relying largely on the goodwill we have built up with the local authorities and the county committees of agriculture. They have been very helpful to us in putting through some of our new schemes and we work in very close cooperation with them.  I shall look into what the Senator has said and if it is necessary to submit plans, we shall have that done.</P>

      <P>We are not contemplating the Senator's suggestion of one group putting up a number of hostels. What we are contemplating here is that we would have accommodation, in the first instance, for students in the summer time coming down there where we had a local committee, a religious community or some people like that in charge and that we could make use <Col N="239" /> of some of these hostels in the winter time in conjunction with the local vocational education committee to put on classes or possibly use them for some social activities in the Gaeltacht in the winter months.</P>
      <P>I do not think that the power suggested by the Senator is necessary because, needless to say, wherever we allow one of these hostels, we are certainly not going to let anybody run riot, putting up a whole series of them in one place.  Mainly, I had this idea to fit in with where you have Irish colleges to make further accommodation available for children coming down in the summer months.</P>

      <P>This amendment is to provide that the remission of rates set out in the Table in this section which is granted in respect of the first chalet built by an applicant will also be applicable to the second and third chalets which may be built by the <Col N="241" /> same applicant without the aid of a grant.  This had been the intention all along but the fact that, as the section stands, the remission could be granted only in respect of chalets for which grants had been made, was overlooked. There is a grant for the first chalet and loans for the other two.  As the section stood, there might be some question of the other two not coming in for the rate remission.  To put that right this amendment is being inserted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister expressed the hope that, having got a grant for one or two chalets, the owner might then expand and put up some others.  We all hope that will happen but I should like to see some incentive given to such owners.  I think the very least that might be given is that the rating provisions would apply equally to additional chalets which are constructed by the owners without the grant.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>This, as Senators will appreciate, is a completely new start in a completely new line of country to develop the tourist business in the Gaeltacht areas.  I think that, starting off at all events, the provisions in respect of rates for all three chalets is a very substantial inducement.  It is very important on the other side of this Bill dealing with the ordinary new houses that we retain the goodwill of our local authorities.  Many local authorities, as Senators are aware, provide supplementary grants.  If we went too far in one direction without providing anything in the way of rates for local authorities, there would be the temptation for some of them to exclude the Gaeltacht areas, in view of the fact that they are getting substantially more grants than other parts of their jurisdiction. I think that, taking one thing with another, this rating provision, as far as the chalets are concerned, is as far as I could be expected to go at this stage.  If further developments take place, we can always come in and amend the law when we have some experience in a year or two.</P>

      <P>With regard to the table headed: &ldquo;Proportion of Increase in Valuation to be Reduced&rdquo; in this section, in every case in which a building grant, hostel building grant or holiday chalet building grant is made, the valuation shall be reduced for rateable purposes for the next 19 years.  Is it necessary in, say, the building of chalets to go as far as 19 years?  To a certain extent, I appeal on behalf of the local authorities.  Surely their time will be wasted calculating that over the next 19 years.  Could the position not be met by removing the rate altogether for the first five years?</P>
      <P>After all, if you take one of these chalets, or hostels, then long before the 19 years are up, the owner will either have made a success of it and be able to pay his rates, or will have sold it to some one else and the local authorities will be left working out the fractions that he will have to pay over 19 years.  That will put an added burden on the local authorities if these chalets spring up in any numbers.  The rates on one of these chalets must be very small.  The Minister should be able to envisage what the valuation will be and what the rates will be. Under Section 4, the grant will be £200 or half the amount, whichever is the lesser, so it does not appear to be a very expensive building and therefore the rates will be very small and it will leave the local authorities the job of calculating those figures for the next 19 years, which seems rather unnecessary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Senator may be under a misapprehension.  The provision in the table to which the Senator refers, relates mainly to ordinary houses, the new houses in the Gaeltacht.  It is true to say it refers also to the chalets but it refers to the ordinary houses, the new houses that will go up and the new rooms and so on.  Up to now, they were completely free from rates for a period of 20 years. The Department of Local Government have introduced a sliding scale&mdash;I forget what the remission is but I think it is ten years&mdash;and we felt that outside the question of uniformity&mdash;I have found this in practice&mdash;some of the houses built 20 years ago never had to <Col N="243" /> pay any rates and all the charges, rates, E.S.B. and so on, came in on top of them at the same time.  I think it is more desirable that they would start off realising that they will have some rates to pay as time goes on.  I am also informed that it is the Valuation Office who would have the headache of calculating the figures involved.</P>

Ar eagla go mbeadh <Col N="246" /> cásanna ann nach bhfuil ar eolas ag mo Roinn, cuirfear fógra sna páipéir nuachta ina míneofar an scéal chomh soiléir agus is féidir.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this Bill is to remove a few anomalies from the existing Army Pensions Acts and to provide for a number of improvements or concessions which have been represented to be desirable.  Certain widows and children of deceased pensioners&mdash; broadly speaking, these were persons who were killed or incurred their disabilities in the 1916-24 period&mdash;were required under the Acts of 1923 and 1927 to have been totally dependent on the deceased in order to be eligible for allowances.  Such widows and children will now, under Section 2 and 3 of the Bill, be enabled to qualify for allowances without the imposition of the condition in question.  Only a few widows or children, as far as is known, failed to establish total dependency on their deceased husband or father for the purposes of the 1923 and 1927 Acts, and it is considered that, in these few cases, the condition should now be removed, seeing that it is not contained in other similar Acts, for instance, the 1932 Act.</P>
    <P>In the same way, Section 4 will enable certain children&mdash;again, only a very small number is likely to be involved&mdash;to qualify for allowances in respect of the deceased father even if he was not, at the date of his death, what is technically known as a &ldquo;married pensioner&rdquo;.  The classes of pensioners in respect of the children of whom this section will apply are those who, having served in the Forces, were pensioned under the Acts of 1946 or 1949, and again it is a case of according the same treatment as is given to similar types of persons under other Army Pensions Acts.</P>
    <P>Section 6 will, for special allowances purposes, make what is known as &ldquo;the appropriate annual sum&rdquo; the same for all married persons.  As Senators are aware, the position at present is that the appropriate annual sum for persons married on or after the Ist October, 1942 is the same as that for unmarried or widowed persons, and lower than that for persons married before the 1st October, 1942, so that a number of <Col N="247" /> people will benefit under this section.</P>
    <P>Section 8 will enable an allowance of £125 a year to be paid to one permanently invalided son or one permanently invalided and unmarried or widowed daughter of a person who had pre-truce service and died as a result of service in the 1916-1923 period.  The permanent invalidism must have existed before the child, if a son, reached the age of 18 years, and if a daughter, before she reached the age of 21.  Only two such cases are known to my Department; they were mentioned here when the Army Pensions Bill, 1957 was being considered.</P>
    <P>By Section 9, persons who were late in applying for allowances under Part II of the Act of 1953 will have a further opportunity of doing so within the twelve months after this Bill becomes law.  Part II of the Act of 1953 provided for allowances for parents, widows and other dependants of persons who had pre-truce service and died as a result of service in the 1916-1923 period.  My Department has a record of 37 late applications which, upon the enactment of this Bill, will be able to be considered.</P>
    <P>Section 10 is intended to enable a person to apply for a married pension which he was unable to claim following the enactment of Section 39 of the Act of 1953 because his disability pension had become temporarily discontinued at the particular time.  Only one such case is recorded.  By Section 13, certain children adopted under the Adoption Act, 1952, will be made eligible for benefits under the Army Pensions Acts as if they were children born in lawful wedlock to the adopting parents.  Under Section 14, taken in conjunction with the Schedule, there will no longer, for special allowance purposes, be any statutory date of application for a Service (1917-1921) Medal.</P>
    <P>As to the remaining provisions of the Bill, Sections 5, 7 and 12 set down, in connection with some of the benefits for which this Bill provides, the principle which generally governs the Army Pensions code&mdash;namely, that marriage must have taken place, in a wound case, before the date of the <Col N="248" /> wound and, in a disease case, before the date of discharge from the Forces. Section 11 removes a difficulty of interpretation caused unwittingly by the wording of a section in the 1953 Act.</P>
    <P>As Senators know, the Army Pensions code is a very complicated one, and it is difficult, in a short statement, to go into all the details of a Bill such as this.  It is intended, where my Department has a record of persons who would appear to be eligible for consideration under the Bill and where they will have to make application, to communicate with them as soon as the Bill becomes law and give them an opportunity of applying.  To cover the possibility that there may be cases of which the Department is not aware, an advertisement setting out the position as clearly as possible will be inserted in the newspapers.</P>

      <P>I welcome this Bill as I have always welcomed every Bill which tends to improve the lot of those who offered their lives, or suffered wounds or diseases, for the cause of the independence of the country.  I welcome it very specially because of one section in the Bill which makes provision for the dependants of men who died, men who were killed in action, and for whom, unfortunately, down the years, no provision has been made in any of the Army Pensions Acts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have had Army Pensions Acts passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas over the past 35 years, but as time went on, it was found that there were various anomalies in them, and perhaps I should describe some of them as injustices, which necessitated amendments from time to time. That is of course as it should be. Deputies in the other House, and Senators here, have always been most anxious to make provision for disabled I.R.A. men and their dependants, in so far as it was possible to do so, at the time of the passing of those Acts. As time went on, we always found that most of the Acts had fallen short in some way or another of what was required.  However, I am glad that <Col N="249" /> we have an opportunity of improving and amending some of the Acts again and I am grateful indeed to the Minister for giving us this opportunity by bringing in this Bill.</P>
    <P>In December, 1956, I moved a motion at column 1675, Volume 46, of the Official Report, asking the Minister:</P>
    <P>(a) to abolish the closing dates for applications for military service pensions and military service medals, (b) make provision for invalid children of I.R.A. men killed in action, and (c) make all I.R.A. service medal holders eligible for a special allowance irrespective of the date of issue of the medal provided that the claimants are otherwise qualified.</P>
    <P>I added my voice to the voices of other Senators in welcoming a Bill that only barely remedied some of the grievances, and I say now, and I said then, that while this Bill goes another part of the way to give reliefs which we all desire to give, I am still not satisfied that it goes far enough.  In fact, I am disappointed that there are not further amendments in this Bill to some of the older Pensions Acts.  I should like to say that I hope the debate will&mdash;past debates on these matters here and in the other House have encouraged different Ministers and Governments to bring in further amendments&mdash;succeed in having a little more done.</P>
    <P>Section 2 and 3 of this Bill will, I hope, remove many outstanding grievances, for example, where the dependent widow or child of an officer or soldier who was a member of the forces of this country could be declared not to be a dependant.  That is a strange anomaly surely, that the widow or child of an officer or a soldier, because of the wording of the Act, was declared not to be a dependant.  Surely it was time to amend that, and we are very glad indeed that it is being done.</P>
    <P>In many of the cases to which I have referred, where certain children and widows were declared not to be dependants, even though they were dependants, gratuities were given.  But under this Bill, an allowance can be given and, of course, the Departments of <Col N="250" /> Defence and Finance will take credit for the gratuities already paid.</P>
    <P>In Section 4, we have another anomaly rectified where orphan children of members of the Forces were declared not to be dependants because the father was not in receipt of a married pension.  That sounds queer but, just like the other section we had, orphaned dependants of soldiers were not recognised as dependants because the father was not in receipt of a married pension.  I am sure every Senator will welcome these two amendments.</P>
    <P>Sections 5 and 7 appear to me to be continuing what I may describe as a marriage ban in connection with the Army Pensions Acts.  I should like to have these two sections explained in more detail by the Minister because I did not get the full import of them. Why have we got one marriage date, 10th December, 1932, in this section and abolition of the marriage date, 30th September, 1942, in the next section?  Surely, for the purpose of any Pensions Act, the marriage date should be the same all round, if we are to have a marriage date at all.</P>
    <P>We see that the marriage date here is actually abolished&mdash;the date of 30th September, 1942&mdash;and in other sections the marriage date of 10th December, 1932, is retained.  Therefore, Section 6 is very welcome indeed as it removes this marriage ban in respect of special allowances so that a person married after 30th September, 1942, will now, as a married person under the Acts, qualify where before he was treated as a single person.  This is a great improvement and I am sure the House will welcome it as such.  I am glad to see the marriage date abolished here. I hope to see it abolished or at least extended at any rate in other sections of the other Acts I have referred to.</P>
    <P>As I said earlier, I, as well as many other Senators, made a case here in 1956 and again in 1957 for the introduction of Section 8.  I held at that time, and I still hold, that it was a disgrace to this country and to both Houses of the Oireachtas that we had failed so far in our duty to the men who gave their lives for us that we made no provision in any of the Army <Col N="251" /> Pensions Acts for the invalid or disabled child of such a man.  Provision is made in all the Army Pensions Acts for the father, mother, wife, brother and sister of men killed in action, but, by a curious anomaly, no provision was made for that man's own child, if that child were invalided or disabled or unable to earn his or her living. Because of that, I heartily welcome Section 8 as making such provision even at this late date.  I wish to thank the Minister for acceding to the request of the Seanad in this matter.</P>
    <P>Section 9 extends the time for making these applications.  I was glad to note that the Minister said it would be advertised in the daily papers.  However, I think that would not be enough. So far as I remember, these matters were also advertised by way of poster in post offices.  I suggest that that be done in this case also.  There are not many cases in the country but if any one of them could not make application 12 months after the passing of this Act, it would mean bringing in another amending Bill here.  Surely it would be much easier to advertise it by poster in the local post office?</P>
    <P>Section 10 deals with persons who had not made application 12 months from the passing of the 1953 Act because their degree of disablement at the time had fallen below the minimum standard.  Then, as time went on, that degree of disablement increased and they were locked out.  We are very glad to see these people given justice because they are disabled and it is justice to the members of the Old I.R.A. as well as to all members of the Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>Section 11 will correct an anomaly contained in the 1953 Act because of Section 10 and still preserves the marriage date with which, of course, I cannot agree.  I cannot agree that these marriage dates must be preserved right down through the years. When you think of the age a man, giving him credit for starting very young in the service of this country, might be on these marriage dates, surely they are unjust and unfair? I shall refer to them further, I hope.  Section 13 brings in certain <Col N="252" /> children adopted under the Adoption Act, 1952.  That is merely justice.</P>
    <P>I should like especially to welcome Section 14 which abolishes the time limit for making application for a service medal.  It is hard to understand why a time limit should at any time be imposed in this matter.  It is hard to understand why a person may be entitled to a service medal today but will not be entitled to it five or ten years' hence or would not be entitled to it five years previously.  There should be no time limit in that respect. The system of considering applications is very simple, except for the fact that many of the people who could verify these applications have passed away.  Still, they have a certain system in the Department that works reasonably well.  I do not understand why there should be any time limit and I am glad indeed that it is being abolished.</P>
    <P>I hold that exactly the same case as has been conceded here in this section can be made for military service pensions.  I believe that if a man, in the same way as in the case of a service medal, was entitled to a military service pension five years ago or will be entitled to one five years from now he is, of course, entitled all the time.  If he does not make application for one reason or another&mdash;if he does not understand it or for any other reason&mdash;I do not see why he should be deprived of the opportunity of doing so, if at any time during his life he wishes to make application for something to which he is justly entitled, if it can be proved he is justly entitled to it.</P>
    <P>We know we had a Pensions Board and a judge dealing with this matter. Nevertheless, at this stage, it should be possible to set up some simple system in the Department for dealing with them such as exists for dealing with verification in relation to applications for medals.  I respectfully suggest that is a matter which calls for amendment.</P>
    <P>I stated earlier on that Section 6 was welcome because it removed the marriage date for the special allowance. It is right and just that no man should be penalised because he marries <Col N="253" /> at a certain date.  It is morally wrong, surely.  I feel sure that everybody will agree that it is a good thing to abolish that marriage date, but I fear that now that the marriage date has been abolished for the special allowance, we may be creating another anomaly in this Bill because we are retaining a marriage date for disability pensions and we are still saying that if a man did not get married by a certain date, he is not entitled to a married pension.</P>
    <P>There is no reason why we should have any fears about abolishing that marriage date because since 1937 no further disability pensions can be granted, and therefore no additional persons can be brought in.  I expect that at least 50 per cent. of the people who were wounded or disabled have passed to their reward.  Surely it is only justice to remove this marriage date for the small number who are still alive and who have been disabled in the service of their country.  There will be no marriage date or marriage ban for persons who, by reason of membership only, can qualify for a special allowance, but there is such a ban for persons who were wounded or disabled while actually fighting and serving their country and whose chances of living to a very old age are very much diminished because of their disability.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister, who has done so much in this Bill, to go this step further and bring in an amendment to rectify this matter.  This is a non-contentious, non-political question and I request the support of all sides in relation to it.  The few persons I have referred to who are still alive are all persons who have suffered from wounds and disease over the years, and in the ordinary course of nature, they cannot be expected to live to the same age as a man who never was wounded or never suffered from any of these diseases.  They are the casualties left to us still from the War of Independence.</P>
    <P>If the marriage date of December, 1932, is adhered to, it means that a man who married after the age of 30 years, putting it at a reasonable age, is refused the marriage pension.  I do not know what the average marriage age <Col N="254" /> is for the whole country, but I think that if a man marries at 28, 30, or 32, which would be the average ages in 1932 of men who fought in 1920-21, he should not be considered an old man and should not be barred from a married pension by reason of this fixed marriage date.</P>
    <P>Under Section 7 of the 1943 Act in relation to special allowances, the marriage date has been 30th September, 1942.  That means that a man could be 50 years and still get the married special allowance.  Even that date has been abolished now, and rightly so, and it is very difficult to understand why we must retain the marriage date of December, 1932, in the other case.</P>
    <P>It would appear, for some reasons unknown to me, that down through the years, the Departments of Defence and Finance have been very particular about retaining the marriage date, but if they are to retain a marriage date at all, why not make it the highest marriage date we have had, even though we have had to abolish it, that is, 30th September, 1942?  It would be at least an extension of the 1932 marriage date and it would bring the disability allowance into line with the special allowance and would be an improvement of ten years.</P>
    <P>I hope the House will assist me in pressing the Minister and the Government to accept what I consider to be a reasonable suggestion.  I welcome the Bill for what is in it and appeal for the Minister's favourable consideration for the things that are not in it and which I think should be in it.</P>

      <P>We on this side of the House welcome this Bill or any Bill that will be of benefit to the dependants of those who gave their lives for the independence of this country. The only thing I regret is that, as has been stated, over 50 per cent. of the people who would benefit even under these amendments have gone to their reward.  There are various dates given in the different Acts and I have noticed that these dates are often overlooked. Even as late as this present year, nearly 40 years afterwards, we find deserving cases who have not <Col N="255" /> claimed and through misadventure did not receive the reward to which they are entitled.  As late as last week, I met two people who I know deserve a service medal and who are not yet in receipt of it.  I know that dates have been extended from time to time but I agree with the previous speaker that there should not be any date.</P>
      <P>Why should there be any date for anybody who deserves a medal?  If he or she gave service that entitles him or her to a medal, I do not see why any Minister or any Government should stipulate an exact date for those applications. As I have stated, during the years those dates were extended and those Bills were amended.  I hope that this Bill will go a part of the way towards helping these people.  If the occasion arises in the near future, I know that every Senator will support any amendment that will give some consideration to the people who gave their lives to the country and service when it needed them.</P>

      <P>It has taken from 1921 until now to give some benefit to an individual who was actually born the night her father died for Irish freedom. That is the case of Miss Blanchfied, in Carrigtwohill, who was born on the night her father died for Irish freedom in 1921.  It took until 1959 to bring in a Bill that would help her to get a livelihood in her own country.  I thank the Minister for that.  The veterans of the old I.R.A.  Association in East Cork, irrespective of what part they took after the fight for freedom, will also thank the Minister.  He is the only person to take steps to give her a livelihood in the country for which her father fought and died.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have many who have got medals, the old I.R.A. medals, during the fight for freedom.  As one of the young generation, I know several of them.  They may not have been in the flying column but they helped to achieve what gives us the right to be here today.  I am sorry that a means test should be applied at all where the old I.R.A. are concerned.  I know the Minister will give consideration to the old I.R.A. allowances and the means <Col N="256" /> test some time in the near future.  I am pleased that it was Deputy Boland, the Minister for Defence, who was the first to give that help since 1921 to the daughter of one who gave his life in that period.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Connolly O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I was delighted to see this Bill but rather disappointed that, when the Minister was making all these changes which are to confer benefit and which have been required for so long, there was one change that was asked for during all the years since pensions were given but which has not yet been given. There is no mention of it in this Bill. I refer to the widows of the men who served in 1916.  None of these has received a pension.  It was their act that brought into being the Army whose pensions we are discussing today.</P>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister to consider the matter.  I am not referring to officers.  I am not referring to the men who died or were wounded in 1916.  I refer to the widows of the ordinary men whose initial act brought into being the present Army.  I know of two cases myself, one of the widow of a 1916 man who fought all through the Black and Tan War who is trying to exist on the ordinary widow's pension of 20/- a week.  The other is the case of a widow who is trying to live on less than 25/- a week.</P>
      <P>I would ask the Minister to consider these.  There are not so many of them left now.  They are the widows of the ordinary men who were not able to put up any fund for the benefit of their widows when they were gone. These are widows who are left with no means of earning their living and I should be very grateful if the Minister would consider that question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Not only have I raised the question but it has been raised through the years but for some reason or another it has always been the same that the widows of the 1916 men&mdash;the ordinary men who were out in the fight&mdash;were not entitled to any special treatment or any special consideration whatsoever and are allowed to spend their last days in penury and suffering and on the charity of other people.  I should <Col N="257" /> like the Minister to look into the matter and to give them something which will make their last few years, not years of penury and misery, but years of a little comfort, something they would have as a right and not subject to a means test.</P>

      <P>I thank Senators for the manner in which they received this Bill.  I think that, generally, the provisions it made were welcome even if there were a few complaints about things that were not in it.  With regard to the matter raised by Senator Mrs. Connolly O'Brien, that I think, does not arise from the Army Pensions Acts or this Bill at all.  The Army Pensions Acts refer purely and simply to disability pensions.  What Senator Mrs. Connolly O'Brien referred to was military service pensions. I do not think you could possibly bring in a provision to apply only to the widows of people who were in receipt of military service pensions for service in 1916.  You would have to include widows of all military service pensioners.  It does not arise under the Army Pensions Acts but under the Military Service Pensions Acts.  It would obviously be a big question to be decided.  I cannot see how you could exclude other military service pensioners from it.  It would be a completely new principle.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>No doubt, we would all like to do it if we could.  The only other criticism was in relation to the question of the marriage date, in relation to the pensions of people who qualified under the Acts of 1923, 1927, and 1932.  It is a universally recognised principle in this type of legislation, where there is a married element in a pension which relates to a disability arising out of service, that that element is granted only when the marriage took place prior to the date of the wound, if there is a wound, or the date of the discharge, if it is a question of discharge from the forces due to disease.  The only case in which that was departed from was in the Act of 1953, which extended to <Col N="258" /> 10th December, 1932&mdash;the date of the enactment of the 1932 Act&mdash;the qualifying marriage date for persons with pre-Truce service.  This was done because it was argued that, prior to the enactment of the Army Pensions Act, 1932, people might not have known that they were ineligible for a married pension if they married after the date of wound or discharge.  But it is only in respect of these cases that the qualifying marriage date is a date subsequent to the date of wound or discharge.  In the other Acts, the date is the date of wound or discharge.</P>
      <P>Special allowances are not analogous to disability pensions.  A pension under the Army Pensions Acts is granted in respect of a disability or a wound received during service. Special allowances are completely different. They are granted to persons who had service or membership and who find themselves in need and unable to work, due to something that developed in their normal lives, and not necessarily arising out of any definite wound or disability incurred during their service.  They have to prove membership only, and there is also a rigid means test applied to them, but the disability does not have to be related to any definite date.</P>
      <P>The justification for removing the marriage date in their cases is that at the time they got married, they were not in receipt of a disability pension. In cases of disability pension under the Army Pensions Acts, the position is that if a pensioner got married after the date of the wound or discharge, it would mean that he was aware of the conditions obtaining.  There does not seem to be a great deal of justification for giving him an increase in pension purely because he got married.  As I say, the only cases where that has been departed from is in those covered by the Act of 1953.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I feel just as much inclined as Senators to make every possible provision for people who gave valuable service during that period but, as I say, it would be a complete departure from principle.  However, in view of the pressure that has been brought here, and also in the Dáil, I will undertake <Col N="259" /> to look into the matter, but I cannot hold out any promise of being able to deal with it.  Certainly, in any case, there would obviously have to be some time limit since these are pensions which enable allowances to be paid to dependants after the death of the pensioner. That is another thing which does not apply to the special allowances.</P>

      <P>There were some other questions raised and they were not really criticisms of the Bill.  There was the question of why was there ever a time limit for applying for medals.  It is obvious that it is a difficult thing to establish service in a lot of these cases, and obviously it is desirable that the applications should be in as soon as possible so that there will be a reasonable chance of being able to establish whether the person had service or not. The further it goes the more difficult that becomes, and it is desirable that there should be a time limit.  However, in regard to applications for medals, we have given in.  We have admitted defeat in that we have not found it possible to get people to apply in time and we have decided to remove the time limit for applying for the medals.</P>
      <P>It would be a much bigger thing to do that for applications for military pensions because you have to establish elaborate machinery to decide the applications.  The whole question has been reopened on a number of occasions and I think everybody has got ample opportunity for applying.</P>

      <P>What I said was that it would be impossible to resist the pressure.  As Senators know, when the special allowances were introduced originally, they applied only to 1916 men and they were then extended to all military service pensioners, and then eventually to all medal holders. Obviously, there are people who had not got service in 1916 but who gave probably just as valuable and meritorious service in the later struggle, and it would be difficult to exclude them.  So it is a big question and I think it could only be considered on the basis of military service pensioners generally.</P>

      <P>The Finance Bill is particularly lengthy this year and includes some very complex provisions, but I trust that the Explanatory Memorandum which was circulated with it has, to a large extent, compensated for this. It contains very little that was not adverted to in the Financial Statement on Budget Day.  The more important additional items are the provisions to combat &ldquo;bond washing&rdquo; and the widening of the exports tax relief to cover profits derived from all shipbuilding and ship repairing in this country, both on home and foreign account.</P>
      <P>The Bill is divided into eight Parts only one of which is likely to present any great difficulty to Senators as regards interpretation.  I allude to Part V which gives relief from Income Tax and Corporation Profits Tax in respect of capital expenditure on assets &mdash;industrial buildings and structures, machinery and plant and patents&mdash; used up in the earning of profits.  The first two chapters in this Part deal with the only two recommendations of the Industrial Taxation Committee which have not already been carried into law. The two recommendations were concerned with the grant of an annual allowance on industrial buildings and for an obsolescence allowance where machinery is not replaced.  Chapter I provides broadly for an annual allowance of 2% in respect of capital expenditure on the construction of industrial buildings or structures.  Chapter II provides that, whether or not machinery is replaced, a balancing allowance will be given where the machinery is put out of use and the sale price or scrap value is less than the written-down value for tax purposes. Both Chapters I and II provide for circumstances where balancing charges, rather than balancing allowances, may have to be made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="262" /> There are three other chapters in Part V.  The first of these, Chapter III, deals with patents.  It provides that there is to be an allowance for tax purposes over a span of seventeen years of capital expenditure incurred after the 6th April, 1960, on the acquisition of patent rights and that there is to be a charge to tax on the seller in respect of the sum he receives.  It also provides for a deduction in respect of expenses incurred in taking out a patent and for other reliefs in the same connection. The remaining two chapters are concerned, one, with securing that capital expenditure on dredging is to rank for capital allowance in more or less the same way as capital expenditure on industrial buildings and the other with miscellaneous technical provisions.</P>
    <P>The purposes of the rest of the Bill are reasonably clear.  Part I is concerned with Income Tax matters, all of which were adverted to in the Financial Statement except the &ldquo;bond washing&rdquo; provisions and the provision granting tax relief in respect of covenanted subscriptions for the teaching of the natural sciences.  The provisions in regard to &ldquo;bond washing&rdquo; formed the subject of a separate Financial Resolution passed after Budget Day; they are intended to combat a device by which an unfair tax advantage might be obtained where securities are bought cum-dividend and sold ex-dividend.</P>
    <P>Part II is also confined, in the main, to matters, on the Customs and Excise side, to which reference was made in the Budget Speech.  The budget proposal in regard to the granting of relief from entertainments Duty of greyhound racing and professional boxing has, however, been extended so as to relieve all sports as from the Ist August, 1959.  In effect, this means extending relief to indoor professional sports, as the others are already more or less excluded.</P>
    <P>The short section which comprises Part III continues the exemption from Corporation Profits Tax of public utility companies, such as railways, of building societies and of the Agricultural Credit Corporation Ltd.</P>
    <P>The two rather lengthy sections which comprise Part IV of the Bill <Col N="263" /> have as their intention the relief from tax of the portion of a purchased life annuity which may be regarded as representing the return to the annuitant of capital laid out in purchasing the annuity.</P>
    <P>I have already referred to the purposes of Part V.  Under Part VI, the scope of the tax relief in respect of profits derived from exports is widened in two respects, one being to include ship building and ship repairing, as mentioned at the outset; the other to extend to greeting cards the relief at present granted where a person exports books published but not printed by him.  Another section in this Part eliminates the distortion which might otherwise arise in the calculation of the relief where the price of goods carries an element of duty. In this Part, also, there are sections which bring docks within the definition of industrial buildings, provide that capital expenditure on preparing or cutting land may rank for allowances and grant relief from taxation in respect of the expense of training local staff before a new industry begins.</P>
    <P>The first of the two sections in Part VII simplifies the rates of Stamp Duty on marine insurance policies.  The second section, which was added to the Bill by way of amendment in the Dáil, extends Section 19 of the Finance Act, 1952, so as to relieve from ad valorem Stamp Duty transfers from subsidiaries to their parent companies and transfers between subsidiaries of the same parent company.</P>
    <P>Part VIII completes the Bill, except for the Schedules.  In that Part, Section 77 makes provision in the usual form for the annuity in respect of borrowing for voted capital services; Section 78 increases the maximum rate of interest payable on trustee savings banks deposits and Section 79 extends the time limit within which trading must commence in order to gain the tax exemption for the mining of non-bedded minerals.  The remaining sections relating to repeals, care and management of taxes, short title and kindred matters, require no explanation.</P>
    <P>These, very briefly, are the purposes of this Bill.  It is hardly necessary for <Col N="264" /> me at this stage to enter into any more detailed repetition of its provisions. Senators will be familiar with the purpose of many of its provisions already from the Financial Statement and from the ensuing debates in Dáil Eireann. The Explanatory Memorandum, moreover, has already indicated broadly what is intended in the various sections of the Bill.  It is essentially a Committee Stage Bill and I shall be glad to deal with any particular point of difficulty on that Stage.</P>

      <P>The Minister has dealt purely technically with the Bill on this occasion.  On other occasions, we heard of other matters from him.  I do not propose to follow him into the technicalities of the Bill.  I think I said last year&mdash;I went over my remarks&mdash; that last year the Bill was the biggest one for many years.  This Bill certainly rivals it in size.  The same might be said of the accounting bill the country has to meet.  I notice that my remarks were a bit ambiguous on that point.  At any rate, last year I was referring to the number of pages in the Finance Bill and I am referring now to the same thing, the size of it and the complications in it.</P>
      <P>I should like, first of all, for the second occasion this year, to express my personal appreciation of a decision of the Government&mdash;that is, a decision to build the new University College on the Stillorgan road.  In view of the extremely difficult conditions in Earlsfort Terrace, it would be desirable if provision were made to go ahead immediately with the erection of those buildings.  Even the erection of a single building of the same size would make a very big difference to the conditions. A small sum of money which was made available has been used by the College to renovate the temporary building.</P>

      <P>Not on this occasion. Then perhaps I should leave that subject for the moment but I think it would be desirable if the work were gone ahead with.</P>
      <P>In the Budget this year, the Minister did two really important things from the point of view of the general run of the community.  He increased the old age pensions by 2/6d, which had been advocated by many people, including myself, and he cut, by sixpence in the £, the standard rate of taxation.  Added to that, the minimum point at which sur-tax is imposed was raised to £2,000 a year.</P>
      <P>The increase of 2/6d. to the old age pensioners was really the very minimum that could be given in social justice.  It merely brought the purchasing power of their pensions to the level of 1938 because they had no stake at all in the generally improved standard of living of the community. They had no part whatever in that. I admit it is a difficult matter because, on the whole, the improved standard of living went to the farming community whose standard was very low in 1938.  I personally see no reason why the old age pensioners, if the general standard of living increases by 15 or 20 per cent., should not get some part of that increase.  At any rate, I welcome the decision of the Government, and the Minister's implementation of it, to put the old age pensioners back at least to where they were in 1938.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the other matter, I think that, from an economic point of view, the position was reached some years ago when income tax should be reduced.  It was, of course, increased in the famous Budget of 1952 from 6/6d. to 7/6d. in the £.  There is not the slightest doubt that from the point of view of the development of our economy, that is about the most valuable concession the Minister could make in taxation.  Like every other concession, it has its difficulties and the Minister may well find himself next year, if he is still in office, in an extremely awkward situation, when his <Col N="266" /> Budget receipts from income tax will be lower next January, in the fourth quarter of the year.</P>
    <P>Certainly, the position at the moment in relation to the Exchequer is not nearly so good as it was 12 months ago.  Figures published in the newspapers this morning show that expenditure has exceeded revenue by £2 million up to the present, whereas, this time last year, revenue was greater by £3 million.  We all know that a certain amount of window-dressing, to use the mildest appropriate term, can be indulged in, in relation to these figures, but, at the same time, there is the fact that the Exchequer position shows a deterioration in the first 15 weeks of the year, of £5 million.</P>
    <P>With the reduction in income tax to come and the lower receipts for sur-tax and so on, the Minister certainly seems to have been a brave man in this year's Budget.  Many of us felt that he was giving away something which he had not got to give away.  Perhaps the enforcing authority in that regard was not public opinion in this country, but the fact that the British rate of income tax had come down to 7/9d. in the £.  It is not so very long&mdash;prior to the famous Budget of 1952 again, in fact&mdash;since the income tax rate in Britain was 9/6d. in the £ when it was 6/6d. here and when the stage was reached that there was only 3d. between the two rates, I take it, the Minister's advisers decided that it was not a very solid position to be in.  They were caught between two forces.</P>
    <P>According to the Minister, last year's Budget just barely balanced; at least, if my recollection is right, that is what he said.  If that is so, on his own standard, taking his own standard as appropriate, I think he is in for serious trouble.  I have had disputes with him about the question as to whether or not he made certain savings last year.  It is primarily a matter of interpretation.  You can say you will make a saving of £300,000 and you may make that saving, but if you make an extra expenditure of £1 million or £2 million, I do not think that is a saving in the sense which is understood <Col N="267" /> ordinarily by the people.  A saving of £300,000 on the Estimates is, or should be, a genuine saving and should be a net decrease in expenditure.</P>
    <P>Of course, the Minister did nothing of that sort.  The fact is that the Government got themselves into so much trouble during the years 1952 and 1953, and they got the economy of the country into so much trouble, that nobody has since been able to rectify it.  The fact is that in 1952 and 1953, the Government were aware that overhead expenditure had become too great, but they were in such a position politically that they were able to do nothing about it, and did nothing about it.  The other side of the picture, the purely financial side, is beginning to be apparent to everybody.  There is deterioration again in the balance of trade and it is primarily in the balance of trade that this deterioration occurs. It is not in the balance of payments, as such, though, of course, it is taken out progressively from the balance of trade into the balance of payments. The place where the deterioration occurs and has occurred is in trade.</P>
    <P>In the first six months of this year, imports are up from £100 million to £107.7 million.  That is an increase of £7½ million in imports.  Exports are down by about £5 million from £65 million to £60 million, so that there has been a deterioration in the trading position of this country of £12.4 million, from an adverse balance of just under £35 million to one of more than £47 million.  If this continues for another six months, we shall have all the old balance of payments arguments again and different points of view being put forward, but on this occasion many of the remedies have now been used up, or turned to other purposes.  Neither the Government nor the Department of Finance will have very much room for manoeuvring and, willy-nilly, may have to adopt the methods adopted in other countries to rectify their balance of payments.</P>
    <P>On this question, I cannot see any great objection to the import figures being kept as high as possible.  There is a great deal of employment arising <Col N="268" /> from them.  Many people make their living from them.  We shall have great difficulty keeping the import figures up, unless something is done about exports. There has been a good deal of talk about that.  I shall come back to it later on.  There has been a great deal more discussion about it than there has been effective work.</P>
    <P>The system of levies adopted in 1956 &mdash;whatever its demerits politically&mdash; at least was effective from the point of view of rectifying the position.  Part of these have been taken into ordinary taxation and you cannot do it again or, if you do it again, you will get a diminishing return.  This inevitably suggests the solution of physical controls that has successfully been adopted in other countries.</P>
    <P>There is, however, one part of our imports for which one wonders whether there is justification, that is, the large amounts of money spent on machinery manufactured in other countries.  If this machinery, when purchased by our external capital, were to be used here for the purpose of making external income, I would see no great objection to it, but it is extremely doubtful if it makes any net income at all.  The kind of machinery I have in mind is jet aeroplanes or ships that are purchased.  You get into the realm of the nebulous when you attempt to estimate what they contribute to the economy.  The suggestion is that the jet plane will bring American tourists here.  The fact is that they could come here in other jet planes and, also, there are various other ways by which the tourists can come.</P>
    <P>In the circumstances that existed here&mdash;there is the other kind of machinery imports&mdash;with the movement of the working population out of agriculture, there was really no other solution to the problem except agricultural machinery.  It may well be, also, that these imports have been at such a high level for some years back that they may now recede some years in the future.</P>
    <P>As regards the exports which I think are the more important part of this problem, it is extremely disappointing to see the poor results got from certain of the efforts made.  I always <Col N="269" /> feel, personally, that it is extremely objectionable that semi-State bodies who have a considerable amount of advertising to give away to newspapers should, as a result of that advertising, be able to get blurbs put into the newspapers about this or that matter.  By &ldquo;blurbs&rdquo;, I mean inaccurate statements as to what they have achieved.  I could give numerous instances.</P>
    <P>I do not want to pillory any company but certainly some of the companies who have spread considerable amounts of advertising from time to time have had no difficulty in getting statements published, when in fact their achievements were a great deal less than they were alleged to be. These statements&mdash;&ldquo;news items&rdquo; we will call them&mdash;certainly were put into the national daily papers of this country; I do not want to make any discrimination between them.  They have no difficulty in getting junks of &ldquo;handout&rdquo; printed by the daily papers which I, as an individual, felt were bought by their advertising.  It may not have been a direct transaction. It may merely have been that they inserted some big advertising matter some months previously and then handed this into the news offices some time later&mdash;an explanation of some matter on which they were being criticised by the public, for instance.</P>
    <P>From a figure point of view, the exports were down in the first six months of this year by 5 per cent. That reduction of 5 per cent.&mdash;actually it is more than 5 per cent.; it is 7 or 8 per cent.&mdash;has come about despite the fact that the terms of trade, that is, our export prices, have been rising fairly steadily in the last couple of years.  It is quite obvious, therefore, that the physical quantity of exports is down somewhere between 10 per cent. and 15 per cent. during the first half of the year.  That is a very substantial decrease indeed.</P>
    <P>If the outlook were favourable for the immediate future, we might say that that decrease could be made good in the second half of the year.  Many of the commentators&mdash;I thought with more enthusiasm than ingenuity or accuracy&mdash;came down heavily on the <Col N="270" /> side that this balance of payments movement was temporary months ago. It is extremely doubtful if it is temporary. There are a few items that will not be repeated but the general trend at the moment suggests that it will continue for the remainder of this year, at any rate.</P>
    <P>I saw recently a reference in the <i>Irish Press</i> to the effect that the farmers have many more cattle now than 12 months ago or something of that sort&mdash;that they were keeping their cattle.  The one thing I am certain about in this regard is that the Irish banks made very large sums available to farmers to purchase cattle during last autumn and winter, when they were sky-high in price, but the same banks were not prepared to lend a blooming &ldquo;bob&rdquo; in 1956 when cattle were infinitely cheaper.  That was at a time when cattle were £30 to £40 a head lower than they were in the autumn and winter of last year.  The banks would not lend a &ldquo;bob&rdquo; at that time for any other purpose, more or less.</P>
    <P>One thing I am certain about as regards the cattle trade at the moment, as regards the question of the total number of cattle in the country, and so on, is that the figures have been so discredited by now that nobody would pay the slightest attention to them.  He would be a brave man who would say there are more cattle in the country on this day in 1959 than there were on the same day in 1958.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder if Senator Carter counted them.  I want to say a few words now about the bacon industry and not primarily in regard to the negotiations taking place at present because this is a problem that was considered by the previous Government as well as by this Government.  In retrospect, it looks now as though both Governments did not put nearly enough resources at the disposal of or into the pig-raising and the bacon-curing <Col N="271" /> industries.  The results achieved were reasonably good but they did not by any means compensate for the great deterioration in the exports of eggs.</P>
      <P>When you look at the position of our country to-day from a general point of view, it would seem that, so far as trade is concerned, the only opportunities available to us are in the food-processing industries.  Then you start examining what you could do on a major scale.  Certainly, the bacon industry, the raising of pigs and the production of bacon and hams, seems in recent times to have given the best trading.  Even with the ten per cent. tariff on Danish bacon, our part of the British market was only about five per cent., the Danes and the British dividing the rest between them in equal parts, well over 40 per cent. each.  It was, of course, one of the major points in the old trade agreements originating with the Ottawa agreement of 1932.</P>
      <P>The point immediately arises: if with this ten per cent. tariff&mdash;do not forget this is a ten per cent. tariff on the value of the Danish product&mdash;we can get only five per cent. of the market in Britain for bacon and hams, and that despite the fact that in the late 1920s, our bacon and hams commanded a very substantial premium over Danish bacon and hams on the London market, what will be the position with that ten per cent. tariff gone.</P>
      <P>Last year, the value of our exports of bacon and hams was about £8,000,000.  Our exports of eggs were valued at £170,000.  That export of £170,000 worth of eggs was only a marginal export.  It has no significance as an industry.  Eggs were cheap in the country and farmers had a surplus which they could either feed to their greyhounds, pigs or whatever other animals they had around the place, or put them on the market for what they could get for them; but in relation to what is, I suppose, one of the oldest of the Irish industries, the production of high-class bacon and ham, are we going to the position of having a marginal export as we have with hen eggs at present?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is easy enough to jeer about this <Col N="272" /> matter.  Some years ago, I was discussing with one of the British people who was concerned about financial matters the problem as to why the Government did not do something which he was very strongly in favour of doing.  He said: &ldquo;They were engaged in the Persian oil crisis and a Government can engage in only one thing at a time.&rdquo;  I shall not say what our Government has been engaged in over the last six or nine months.  We all have a fair idea.</P>
    <P>About 12 months ago, many people, for example, business people, began to be extremely worried about the whole outlook in the community.  This penetrated to Government circles and certain documents were produced putting forward points of view with some of which one could agree and with others of which one might not agree.  However, if we think of the social and economic outlook, the total result up to the present seems to be negligible. When one makes a diagnosis of a situation, although one is proved correct, one might prefer not to be correct. Looking back over what I said during the last couple of years, I think the views I expressed, last year in particular, have been vindicated.</P>
    <P>One gets the impression that the only activity in Government at present is in the line of large-scale expenditure on industrial projects, if you would call them industrial projects, by the semi-Government concerns.  The great bulk of them relate to transport.  The transport companies, taking them both individually and globally, have, from the financial point of view, the worst record of any of the semi-State concerns. They do not seem to believe not alone that there is any obligation on them to pay a dividend or pay any interest on the capital invested in the concern but that there is any obligation on them to make any provision for depreciation so that they will be able to replace their machines when they wear out.  Therefore, they come back to the community for increased sums of money.</P>
    <P>The most recent example of this attitude is the £3,000,000 loan raised by C.I.E.  An ordinary person might have thought that with the sale of all <Col N="273" /> the properties in relation to the disused railways they are closing down, C.I.E. would be able to finance its other requirements.  It is the least one would expect from a concern which is drawing in its horns, that it would not proceed to give fewer services to the community and, at the same time, ask the community for more capital, realising its real capital as well.</P>
    <P>The programme so far brought forward by the Government on the capital side to replace the social capital programme which was the subject of so many minatory, depreciatory and other kinds of statements by the bankers and particularly the managers of the semi-Government concerns, who were some of the most vocal about it, is now coming to an end very rapidly.  A whole chunk of it has closed down completely, that is, housing.  That being the case, one would say that here is a great opportunity to produce the plans for which they require capital which they said was being used up on the erection of houses, schools, hospitals, and so on.  Up to the present there is no evidence of their producing anything that is worth a thraneen.  The Government and the bankers have had the whole thing to themselves for two or three years and have produced practically nothing.</P>
    <P>There is one part of the economy from which everybody would agree you might get results&mdash;I think you would get results but certainly everybody would agree you might&mdash;that is, by putting a great deal of capital into agriculture.</P>

      <P>Before the interval, I was speaking about the position in relation to the investment of capital in this country.  The Minister said last year that on the whole the farmers with 100 acres were in a fairly good position.  I think that is a view I would be prepared to accept.  At certain times there may be a movement of prices or a bad harvest like last year. They may have temporary difficulties, but, taking a decade review of the <Col N="274" /> economic position, they are probably in a better position than they were, say, before the war.  On the other hand, the farm of 15 to 25 acres is rapidly being eliminated and the farmer of 30 to 40 acres, unless he has considerable capital resources, is in difficulties.  In particular, where he has family commitments, he is really unable to build up either his capital stock or the equipment on his farm.</P>
      <P>For farmers up to 40 acres in extent &mdash;in number, of course, they are the great bulk of the farmers, even if they do not farm the bulk of the land&mdash; it is literally true to say that, except for what might be called slush money, that is to say, moneys made available on some kind of social principle, nothing has been done in this community in recent times to make available to them the capital which they require in considerable quantities.  There seems to me at times to be almost a conspiracy in the Oireachtas on both sides of the House to give these farmers of 40 acres or less no facilities whatever to place their hands on money.</P>

      <P>Before beginning my remarks, I should say that I think it is quite right to get a ruling with regard to what has just happened to my colleague.  The Finance Bill really corresponds to the Budget debate in the Dáil and I must say that I should have thought, from my experience here, that Senators are given a fair amount of latitude to discuss the general economic position of the country.  It is fairly difficult to discuss public finance except against the background of the general economic position.  I certainly had intended to speak on some aspects of the general economic position, apart from the mere raising of taxation.</P>
      <P>I really think, in fairness to the previous speaker and to myself, that we should get a definite ruling from the Chair on just exactly what latitude we will be allowed.  If we are confined to the numerous clauses in this highly technical Finance Bill, I suppose we can have some sort of highly technical debate&mdash;as the Minister said, it is mainly a Committee Stage Bill&mdash; but if we are not allowed to discuss anything except the raising of taxation on the Finance Bill, then the debate will have altered its character from that of previous years.  I for one would like to know before beginning how much precise latitude it is proposed to give speakers.</P>

      <P>I shall proceed until I am stopped and I hope that I shall not exceed the bounds of relevance. As I say, this corresponds to the Budget debate in the Dáil.  The Dáil, on the Estimates, has ample opportunity of discussing expenditure in great detail for each Department and I accept the ruling of the Chair that that is a matter we discuss on the <Col N="276" /> Appropriation Bill.  The raising of taxation is, of course, what is discussed during the Budget debate and the Finance Bill implements the Budget policy and the raising of taxation really must be read, I think, against the general background of the economic position of the country.</P>
      <P>In the Budget debate, policy was raised by every speaker on every side of the Dáil and until I am ruled out of order, I propose to try to relate this Budget to the general economic background against which it is framed. In doing so, I make no apology, apart from an apology for some technical breach of the rules of the Seanad, because in modern times, it is universally recognised that the Budget is not merely an income and expenditure account of the Exchequer, that it is something more than that.  In modern times, a Budget is looked on as the means of affecting the general economic climate of the country in conjunction with the Central Bank.  If the country is inclined to go too fast, if there are signs of inflation, the Budget can be used, in conjunction with the Central Bank, to put on the brake.  If the country is showing signs of a recession, or a depression, the Budget, in conjunction with the Central Bank, can be used to try to improve economic activity.</P>
      <P>This is particularly true of the Capital Budget, because the State capital expenditure and the borrowing which is necessary to finance it, can be more easily accelerated or postponed than the current expenditure.  Therefore, the Budget nowadays, which is primarily concerned, of course, with the raising of taxation, does perform two purposes.  First of all, it enables the Minister for Finance to balance his annual accounts; it enables the housekeeping of the country to be conducted on proper lines, that the country should pay its way; but it also aims at something much wider than that.  It aims&mdash; to quote from memory the speech of the Minister in the Dáil&mdash;at providing full employment, subject to the avoidance of inflation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Inflation in this country is shown, I think, by a disequilibrium in the balance of payments.  I think that the <Col N="277" /> balance of payments in Ireland is rather like a thermometer; it shows whether the patient is feverish or not. The Irish economy is a very open economy.  In this respect, it is like the British economy.  External transactions play a very large part in total activity. Therefore, the Irish economy is very sensitive to changes in world prices through imports and exports and to changes in the world economic climate, changes in the conditions of progress or regression in Europe and, indeed, in the United States.</P>
    <P>An open economy of this kind must preserve equilibrium in the balance of payments.  It is the first duty of the people who are in charge of the economic circumstances of a country of this kind&mdash;whether it be the Central Bank or the Minister for Finance&mdash;to preserve equilibrium in the balance of payments.  I do not suggest that equilibrium must be preserved every year.  I admit that there may be abnormal circumstances such as we encountered last year, bad harvests and things of that kind, that will allow payments to be unbalanced in the short period.  I think that position is accepted by the Central Bank.  In the latest Report of the Central Bank, page 21, it is stated:</P>
    <P>On the basis of these assumptions, and if the recent underlying trends in external trade prevail, the balance of payments position would continue to move in the direction of a deficit larger than in 1958, and possibly equivalent to the surplus in 1957, thus resulting in a rough equilibrium over the three years.</P>
    <P>I would be prepared to agree with that definition of a period for equilibrium in the balance of payments, that there may be seasonal or climatic factors, exceptional circumstances, that make it difficult to balance every year and that, therefore, a period of three years may be regarded as a reasonable period in which to preserve equilibrium.  But if the country begins to exhibit a disequilibrium for a longer period than that, and a disequilibrium that does not contain within itself the seeds of its own correction, that is a position which, in an economy of this kind, should not be tolerated.</P>
    <P>A prolonged disequilibrium in the <Col N="278" /> balance of payments which does not show signs of self-correction within a reasonable period, leads in the first place to a depletion of our external reserves.  That, in turn, necessarily leads to internal contractions of credit. That could easily lead to lack of confidence in the future of the currency or even to a depreciation of the currency, which has been so often undertaken in other countries which have had recurring deficits of payments in recent years.</P>
    <P>The alternative is a painful correction and, if the process is allowed to go too far, the country may experience a painful correction such as this country experienced in 1955-1956, leading to unemployment, business losses, severe contractions of credit and, sooner or later, an economic crisis.  It has been suggested, in the course of the discussion recently on this matter, that there could be tolerated in this country a disequilibrium in the balance of payments in order to import capital goods, that a disequilibrium caused by the import of consumption goods is admitted by everybody to be intolerable, but that during a period of time, there could be a disequilibrium tolerated for the import of capital goods.  I do not accept that argument.  I think it is a very dangerous argument.</P>
    <P>In the first place, it is extremely difficult to define what are capital goods.  The same article may become a capital good or a consumption good, according to the use to which it is put.  If a motor car is brought into Ireland as a motor car to be used by an hotel for the tourist trade, it is a capital good; if it is to be used by a private individual for enjoyment, it is a consumption good.  How can anyone say, at the time of importation, into which category it fits?  Similarly, with mere consumption goods such as tea, wine and things of that kind&mdash;if dealers are stocking more rapidly than normal, a large amount of these imports, although they may appear as consumption goods, are capital goods in the sense that dealers are building up stocks.  Therefore, the line between capital goods and consumption goods is not to be found merely by the nature <Col N="279" /> of the import but by the use to which it is to be put, and that is a matter which is quite incapable of definition.</P>
    <P>Even assuming that agreement could be found on such a definition, the administration of this distinction would involve something in the nature of an exchange control or an elaborate system of licensing and that, from the political point of view, is extremely undesirable.  Furthermore, in this country, capital imports lead, certainly in the short period, to the necessity for further imports, because one of the underlying facts in the economy of this country, which we cannot get away from, whether we like it or not, is that every activity that is generated here sets up a demand for imports.  Therefore, the importation of capital, assuming that it is put to immediate use, will set up a demand for imports of raw materials, for wage goods for the people employed, and will in itself generally create further imports.</P>
    <P>Finally, even if capital goods can be distinguished and if the distinction can be administered, the invisible account of the country suffers by a disequilibrium in the balance of payments, even in respect of capital imports.  Those imports must be paid for, either by the sale of external securities&mdash;in which case our external reserves and the earnings on them are reduced and, therefore, our invisible exports suffer&mdash; or by borrowing abroad, in which case we impose a burden on the invisible side of the account for future years.</P>
    <P>There is one exception, I think, to what I am saying, that is, if capital goods are imported into this country by foreign investors who pay for them with their own foreign currency.  Then, whatever the effect of that import of capital goods may be on the demand for further imports, at least it does not in itself deplete our external reserves or weaken our external position.</P>
    <P>It is in the light of that attitude&mdash; which may be correct or not&mdash;that I should like to look at the balance of payments in this country.  In 1958, the over-all balance was a deficit of £1 million, as compared with a surplus <Col N="280" /> in 1957 of £9.2 million.  These comparatively good results arose from the favourable movement in the terms of trade.  If the terms of trade did not move in our favour in the past two years, the deficit in the balance of payments would have been very much greater than, in fact, it was.  That can be accounted for also by certain abnormal influences.  As a result of the bad harvest last year, imports of cereals and fuel were greater than they normally would be and there was a large number of recurring capital imports in relation to certain major investments in the South of Ireland.</P>
    <P>When I come to look at the picture of the present year, what sort of balance of payments picture are we to have in our next year's Budget?  On the import side, we are still suffering from the effect of last year's bad harvest.  Imports of cereals and fuel are still higher than they normally would be, but that is something which will correct itself.</P>
    <P>On the export side, as Senator O'Donovan said this evening, the picture is far more disquieting.  The recent volume of <i>Economic Statistics</i> pointed to the existence of something in the nature of a rhythmic cycle movement in the export of cattle.  The disquieting thing is that this is the time at which the upward phase of the cycle is due and yet it has not taken place.  I know the reason for that, but that does not make the position any less serious. In the first place, over a short period, there has been a drought in Great Britain and the grass and pastures are bad.  The British farmers are, therefore, delaying buying cattle.  The prices of fat stock in Great Britain also have not been good and for that reason the farmers are reducing their purchases. A more disquieting feature is that, many British farmers are now very slow to purchase once-tested cattle.  That is something which must be looked at by the Government with the greatest possible care&mdash;the necessity for accelerating the complete eradication of bovine tuberculosis.</P>
    <P>On the Irish side, possibly a factor which, in the long run, may correct itself, but in the short run does not help our balance of payments, is the <Col N="281" /> retention of more heifers by farmers for breeding purposes.  The result of those factors together is that cattle exports this year have been less than was expected and, if there is no improvement in the cattle exports in the course of the year, the balance of payments in the present year could be quite unsatisfactory.</P>
    <P>It is too much to hope for an improvement in the terms of trade. The terms of trade cannot go on for ever moving in the same direction and I believe we have reaped all the improvements that are to be found in the terms of trade.  Therefore, I think I am correct in saying that, looking at the balance of payments, the drift is in the wrong direction and if the present trend is continued, without being reversed, measures of correction by the Central Bank and the Government will become imperatively necessary within the next 12 months.</P>
    <P>The balance of payments, of course, is only one of the factors against which the Budget must be viewed.  Before the Budget, the Government published a very valuable volume entitled <i>Economic Statistics.</i>  I shall not weary the House with extracts from it, beyond just saying that the general picture is not particularly encouraging, The national income has diminished by two per cent. but that could largely be accounted for by the bad harvest. Savings are down; capital formation remains constant; although there has been an increase in industrial employment, the total number employed is down by 10,000; and emigration seems to have showed down.  Some people believe that the Irish population has now reached a new stability and that we can hope for some years ahead that the amount of emigration will not be so large as to cause a further decrease in the size of the population.</P>
    <P>Coming nearer to the Budget and to public finance, revenue last year was buoyant and the Minister was lucky that debt charges were lower. Owing to falls in the short rate of interest, the money market rates were lower and, therefore, the amount that had to be paid on Exchequer bills was lower than it might have been if the rates had not gone the way they <Col N="282" /> did.  The result was that there was a small surplus shown in the Budget. That being so, I think the Minister was justified in introducing what might be called his mildly expansionist Budget. By that I mean a Budget which contains incentives for the private investor and also proposes a certain amount of increase in public investment.</P>
    <P>The provisions in the Budget were described by the Minister in the Dáil as calculated risks.  I think those calculated risks were probably justified for their incentive effect.  There was a certain amount of pessimism prevailing in the country which required to be corrected and therefore, psychologically, I think the Minister was justified in giving the country what he described in his Budget speech as a shot in the arm.</P>
    <P>There are one or two features of the Budget which call for comment&mdash; not for adverse criticism, but it is no harm that the attention of the Seanad should be drawn to them.  The balance in the Budget was obtained by a very generous allowance for what is now known as &ldquo;errors of estimation&rdquo;. Speaking subject to correction from the Minister in his reply, I think that a subtle change of terminology has been introduced at this point, and that the errors of estimation now include optimism regarding expenditure falling short of what appears in the Estimates and revenue being more buoyant than what appears in the Estimates, but that may not be correct.  I should like to know if it is true because apparently it introduces two elements of uncertainty instead of one and, as I say, whatever the interpretation may be, the terminology is unmistakeable, and what used to be called &ldquo;errors of over-estimation&rdquo; has now become &ldquo;errors of estimation&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>However, as I say, we all wish the Minister well in these calculated risks. He has taken two gambles and we in this House certainly hope they will both come off.  His optimistic forecast has enabled him to abolish a certain amount of indirect taxation.  The import levies which I mentioned a few moments ago as being part of the drastic remedy for the bad balance of <Col N="283" /> payments in 1956 have now been worked out.  They have either become customs duties or disappeared altogether.</P>
    <P>The Minister has also succeeded in giving a slight increase to pensioners. Everybody, of course, would like that increase to be more but we must accept the fact that it just cannot be afforded at the present moment.  The best way to help pensioners is to avoid inflation and a great deal of our inflation, of course, is imported.  It is part of the price of living in an open economy, but, at the same time, we cannot avoid a certain amount of domestic inflation, so by far the best way to help the pensioners is to avoid inflation.</P>
    <P>There have also been reliefs for certain industries suffering from undue competition and concessions have been given to dances, greyhound racing and boxing, but the most important concession in the Budget is the reduction in the standard rate of income tax. I should like to quote the Minister in order to express my agreement with him:&mdash;</P>
    <P>I am convinced that the objective of economic expansion is better served by giving any tax reliefs we can afford this year mainly to ease direct taxation.  This accords with the principle, enunciated both by this Government and the Opposition, that whatever taxation is necessary should in the circumstances of this country, fall more heavily on expenditure than on income.</P>
    <P>In that expression of sentiments, the Minister has my entire agreement.</P>
    <P>The raising of the beginning point for surtax is something that is long overdue.  Surtax, owing to the change in the value of money, had become quite unreal and very unfair to a great many people.  The whole tax code, of course, still needs a great deal of overhauling but, pending the publication of the Report of the Commission on Income Tax, I do not propose to deal with it any further.  The increases in the wear and tear and obsolescence allowances are also welcome from the point of view of investment.</P>
    <P>I should just like to mention that a <Col N="284" /> reduction of death duties could have a very beneficial effect on the question of people coming to reside in this country.  I do not wish to labour this point.  The Minister quite fairly stated in his reply on the Budget speech that he cannot reduce everything at the same time and that he thought surtax this year would be a more useful reduction.  I should like him to put his mind down to the question of death duties.  They are higher here in many ranges than they are in the Six Counties.  They particularly hit small family businesses.  They act as a disincentive to people to come to reside in this country.  The yield is comparatively small and the cost of collection is rather high.  Therefore, it seems to me that there is a possibility there of further easement in direct taxation. We cannot expect the Minister to do everything the same year.  We must welcome the reductions in income tax and surtax, while reminding him that other reductions could be made in death duties as well.</P>
    <P>Having taken all these factors into account, the Budget emerges from the debate as balanced.  There is a certain amount of what I might call tolerated manipulation in obtaining this balance. In the first place, I said this £2½ million of errors of estimation may not just go right.  Also, there is always a certain amount&mdash;I do not like to use the word &ldquo;juggling&rdquo;&mdash; of manipulation in what goes over and above the line.  These are orthodox methods in the game of balancing the Budget, so I think we can say that the Budget is balanced, even if on a narrow edge.  After all, this is the centenary of the greatest balancing feat in history&mdash;the crossing of the Niagara Falls on a tight rope by Blondin.  Possibly it is to celebrate that centenary that the Minister is balancing his Budget also on a very tight rope.  I hope he will cross with the same success as Blondin had.</P>
    <P>I think, on the whole, in view of the state of mind of the country, the Minister's optimistic assumptions and calculated risks are justified.  I think the background is slightly deflationary and that, therefore, the shot in the arm is justified.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="285" /> I have merely recorded, as its first function as the State housekeeping accounts, that the Budget is orthodox and sound and can be recorded as an incentive Budget.  The capital programme which, I realise, is very much more expenditure than revenue, I shall barely mention.  The capital programme is based on the White Paper. Actually, it provides for £3½ million more than the White Paper and £7.38 million more in Government capital expenditure than in the year 1958/59. It is mainly productive in the long run.  I am prepared to agree that such things as fertilisers, the eradiction of bovine T.B., agricultural and industrial credit, are mainly productive but they involve £30 million for borrowing.</P>
    <P>It must be remembered that although they may be productive in the long run, they may not be productive in the short run.  It may be quite a long time before the assets created by this borrowing bring in a revenue.  Therefore, there is no getting away from the conclusion that the Government capital programme in the short run will add to the amount and burden of the national debt.  This is a matter which we have dealt with in the Seanad before and for returning to which I do not apologise.</P>
    <P>One of the most dangerous symptoms in the Irish economic position is the growth of the national debt against a nearly stationary national income and a falling population.  The Central Bank directs special attention to this matter in page 12 of the current report. It points out that from 1951 to 1959 the net liabilities of the Government grew from £80 million to £192 million and at the same time, the contingent liabilities grew from £63 million to £85 million and, as it points out in the footnote, extensive commitments had to be made in some of these guarantees both as regards interest and principal.</P>
    <P>This growing debt has involved a growing interest charge.  On the same page of the report of the Central Bank, figures are given showing that the amount of debt we have charged to taxation has grown from £5.3 million in 1951 to £16 million in 1959 and an <Col N="286" /> estimated £16.6 million in 1960.  These are disquieting figures for a country with a falling population.  It seems to me that when one regards them, looking back over ten years, one rather gets out of the discussion of the Budget as a mere exercise in State bookkeeping for one year to the general question of the growth of the economic system in this country.  I hope I am not becoming irrelevant.  If so, I shall sit down immediately.  However, I should like to call attention to the great changes of opinion coming about in this State.  The book <i>Economic Development</i> and the White Paper <i>Programme for Economic Expansion</i>, are examples of the way in which people are now attending to the question of economic growth.</P>
    <P>The fact of the matter is that an infra-structure of public services in this country has more or less been created and that now what is happening is that an increasing super-structure of debt is being superimposed on an infra-structural foundation which is not increasing equally fast.  That is why this informed opinion at the present time is being directed to long-period rather than merely annual problems. On that, I should like to quote from the June issue of the <i>Irish Banking Review</i>, page 12, as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Perhaps it may be correct to say that the emphasis in Irish economic discussion should shift from the economics of equilibrium to the economics of growth.  The mere attainment of balance in external payments and the Budget, however desirable in themselves, is not enough to generate the dynamism necessary for progress.  In this connection, the following quotation from the address of Mr. Browaldh to the shareholders of the Swedish Bank of Commerce is relevant.  &ldquo;Searching for a single catchword to describe the aims of economic policy, people nowadays talk of &lsquo;balanced growth&rsquo;.  If we assess recent economic developments in our country with this aim in view, we can say: In important respects the economic equilibrium has improved, but the second link in the chain of objectives, economic growth, has slowed down and judged <Col N="287" /> by modern standards we are at present below the level of full employment.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That quotation regarding Sweden is precisely relevant to Irish conditions.</P>
    <P>The discussion that has been taking place in recent years on the necessary for growth in Ireland has shown the acceptance of a number of assumptions and new ideas that would not have been accepted a few years ago. I should like to draw particular attention to a lecture given at the Conference of the <i>Tuairim</i> organisation by my colleague Mr. Lynch, which has now been published under the title <i>The Economics of Independence.</i>  This is only one example of new thinking on this matter.</P>
    <P>The articles in the Press and statements by Ministers, especially by the Taoiseach, some of which I shall quote, show that Irish opinion is moving and moving in the right direction.  It is a hopeful sign, I think, that these questions are being very largely taken out of Party politics, that a good many of the old catch cries, slogans, shibboleths, are not being repeated any more.</P>
    <P>One change is that it is now generally accepted that the cure for unemployment does not rest in greater self-sufficiency, that the home market has been largely satisfied.  This does not condemn the protection programme of earlier Governments.  It was inevitable and on the whole beneficial, but it has now exhausted its beneficial effects.  Many of the social services catering for the home market have already been saturated.  House building is slowing down and therefore people are beginning to realise that future growth depends more on exports than on satisfying a naturally limited home market.</P>
    <P>This realisation that exports are important has coincided with an extremely important change in the nature of export markets.  This is not the occasion to discuss the Free Trade Area, the Common Market, the Outer Seven or the Anglo-Danish agreement. All I want to draw attention to is that the export market environment is <Col N="288" /> changing.  However it is changing, it is changing in some direction and it will not be what it was.  Changes of that kind may create new difficulties but they also create new opportunities. Therefore, the country must be very much alive, very flexible, in trying to take advantage of the opportunities presented by this new international situation.  It is only fair in passing to pay a tribute to the work of Córas Tráchtála which has already done a great deal to increase Irish exports and, we hope, will do a great deal more in future.</P>
    <P>One thing that has been emerging with great clarity quite recently is that this country does depend to a very large extent on the British market.  It has been accepted more and more that the British and Irish economies are in many respects complementary, that indeed the two countries, the United Kingdom and Ireland, are a kind of common market.  There are free movements of labour and capital; there are related currencies, free movements of funds, and preferential tariffs on trade in both directions.  In other words, the political and economic frontiers in the area covered by the United Kingdom and Ireland are not the same.  It is now being realised that recent political changes have not really got rid of some of the underlying economic realities, that we must make our future policy in the light of these realities and, having obtained independence, try to get some mutual benefit with the other people concerned.  Every effort should be made for Irish farmers to share whatever benefits they can with the British farmers.</P>
    <P>In order to show that what I am saying is not merely personal opinion and to clothe it with some political respectability, I should like to quote from the Taoiseach's speech in the Dáil, as reported at column 939, Volume 175, of the Dáil Debates of 3rd June, 1959, in which he says precisely what I have been trying to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>There can be no question that any prospect or possibility of expanding trade with Britain, particularly in agricultural products, and of obtaining reasonable security of markets and prices would be of very great <Col N="289" /> interest.  Geographical proximity has forced a degree of integration of the economies of both countries which has been strengthened by arrangements which permit of the free movement of men and money and provide a common currency basis between them.  Indeed, it could be said that between this country and Britain there already exist many aspects of the type of economic community which the European countries who signed the Rome Treaty are trying to develop between themselves.  In the world as it is developing the interests of both countries would appear to require arrangements for the continuous examination of possibilities of further association in developing trade opportunities.</P>
    <P>Whatever our external markets may be, whether they are mainly British markets or other European markets, it is necessary that we should be able to export at competitive prices.  No country has a duty to keep the people of this country alive and, if we want to trade with our neighbours, we must be able to sell to them on competitive terms.  This, of course, is obvious but it needs stressing.  It is emphasised in the Report of the Central Bank:</P>
    <P>The position in 1958 should also be considered in relation to the expectation, which continued during that year, of the establishment of a European Free Trade Area of which this country would be a member, albeit on special terms.  In the light of this possibility, it became clearer than ever before that our economic policies should be adapted to our situation as a virtually open economy, largely dependent on external trade.  The fact that the prospect of a Free Trade Area embracing all or most of the countries of Western Europe appears to have receded should not be regarded as reducing the need or urgency of efforts to increase the competitive capacity of our agriculture and industry.</P>
    <P>That cannot be sufficiently emphasised. The real trouble about our competing in external markets is really related to what I mentioned a moment ago, <Col N="290" /> about our being to some extent already in a common market with the United Kingdom.  The fact is that we find ourselves in a common market with a country with extremely high wage levels based on high productivity and it is very difficult for a country with lesser natural resources to produce at competitive prices inside an area of that kind, unless either wages can be reduced, which is impossible, or efficiency can be raised, which is very difficult.</P>
    <P>In that connection, I should like to draw the attention of the Seanad to an article in <i>Studies,</i> Summer, 1959, by Dr. David O'Mahony of University College, Cork, where many of the difficulties of our economic situation are put very clearly.  Everybody will agree that the time has come for plain speaking and clear thinking on these difficulties, that they are not to be conjured away by denying that they exist.  I propose to quote two or three passages from this article but I should like Senators to read it because it does bring out our difficulties very clearly.  Dr. O'Mahony says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Most of the problems of the Irish economy arise from its two most characteristic features&mdash;or peculiarities, as some might say.  The first of these is its unusual openness, familiar to us by reason of our constant need for vigilance with regard to the balance of payments. The second, but more important, is the fact that&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>Then there is a quotation from <i>Economic Development.</i></P>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;proximity to and ease of intercourse with Britain tend to set, at British levels, the expected standards for Irish wages and salaries, private consumption and services generally, irrespective of differences in natural resources and productivity.</P>
    <P>Our economy is one of the most open in the world.  Relatively speaking, we are far more dependent on the outside world than Britain is, although the British seem to be more conscious of the limitations imposed by an open economy on policy-making than we are.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="291" /> Some of the consequences of that position are developed in this article:</P>
    <P>Important as the openness of our economy is, it is very much overshadowed by the second matter already mentioned.  The &ldquo;ease of intercourse with Britain&rdquo; is frequently referred to in discussions about emigration, but its nature and significance for the national economy have not yet received the attention they deserve.</P>
    <P>The article then considers them at some length.  I cannot delay the Seanad by quoting from the article at length but the point made is that this is a high cost economy, owing to lack of natural resources, with small scale industries, a small home market, and that, in addition to that, we have to deal with a very high level of wages, a level of wages dictated by a very efficient and prosperous economy.  That is the position.  It is because of that position that it is exceedingly difficult for profitable openings for investment to be found in Ireland by private enterprise.  That is the position and we must face it. There is no use in not facing it.  It is there.  It is a high cost economy and we cannot expect to get wages down, even if we wish to do so.  Therefore, the only way in which we can find profitable openings is by greatly increasing the efficiency of the individual worker.</P>
    <P>One of the troubles about that is that increases of efficiency by individual workers nowadays are almost always the result of a great deal of mechanisation.  The more increased output per head we get, the less labour we need.  That is the fundamental dilemma facing the country.  It has got to be faced.  If we want to keep a large population, we can do so only at the level of wages which will enable us to export competitively.  If we want to be really efficient by modern standards, we must have a type of labour saving device which leads to a lower labour content for our export industry.</P>
    <P>That is not a very popular thing to say but we need to tell the truth.  I think this analogy is very close to it. <Col N="292" /> If there were the same openness and mobility between the United Kingdom and the United States as there is between the United Kingdom and Ireland, British industry would find itself in an extremely difficult position.  If English wages had to be the same as American wages, owing to this complete mobility of labour, most of the British export industries would be completely priced out of the export market because American wages are much higher that British because American productivity is higher.  If British industries had to pay American wages and compete with American exports, they would find it extremely difficult to do so, unless they were able to raise their output per head quite dramatically.</P>
    <P>That is a fair analogy.  That is the position.  We are in relation to Great Britain in the same position as Great Britain would be in regard to the United States, if there were identity of wages levels in the two countries.  The only hope we have of competing in foreign countries would be by dramatically increasing our efficiency and that means, not more labour, but less.</P>
    <P>That is the point.  Some people wonder nowadays whether private investment will solve our problems.  I make no secret of the fact that I am all for private investment.  I am completely individualist in that way.  My whole mental bias is towards private investment and against every form of socialism.  The Central Bank takes the same view.  It says that the private sector must be regarded as the principal source of new productive projects. It goes on:</P>
    <P>The fundamental importance of the private sector&mdash;or more simply of the individual farmer and manufacturer, shopkeeper, salary-earner and wage-earner&mdash;has often been stressed.  In an economy such as ours the most useful rôle of the State is to encourage and stimulate private enterprise and, by suitable fiscal and financial policies and the provision of educational and other essential services, to create conditions in which economic advancement can be secured by the efforts of the <Col N="293" /> members of the community themselves.</P>
    <P>That is undoubtedly true.  Private enterprise, other things being equal, is always preferable to State enterprise. The private investor invests his own resources.  He pays the penalties of his own mistakes.  He has to accept the acid test of profit or loss.  He has to obey the verdict of that market.  That makes for flexibility and adaptability for new projects.</P>
    <P>Most of the most progressive countries, such as the United Kingdom and the United States, have progressed under private enterprise.  We have had numerous very successful private enterprises in Ireland.  I certainly think that most people in the Seanad would agree that if private enterprise could be stimulated, it would be most desirable but the regrettable fact, looking at the history of recent years, is that the amount of private investment in Ireland has been disappointingly small.</P>
    <P>The Central Bank Report shows the total amount of new capital issues in the years 1954-58&mdash;a period of five years.  Of a total amount of £111 million, only £3.2 million was raised by private enterprise, that is, by industry and commerce other than the Industrial Credit Company and the Agricultural Credit Corporation.  That understates the fact because private business people invest their own savings and borrow a good deal from the bank, but even had they made full allowance for all that, the amount of new private investment in this country has been disappointing in recent years.</P>
    <P>That is the result of the lack of profitable openings.  That lack of profitable openings is largely the result of what I have already referred to, the high costs.  If costs are lower, there would be more openings and if there were more openings, there would be more enterprise.  Be that as it may, people who are wedded ideologically to private enterprise, are beginning to admit that more public enterprise in this country may be needed in the future.  It is only fair, in passing, to pay a tribute to some of the successful State bodies and public utilities which <Col N="294" /> have greatly developed the resources of the country in the past 35 years.</P>
    <P>Again, I should like to quote from the Taoiseach's speech in the Dáil on 3rd June which shows that he has come to the point of view that additional public enterprise may be necessary, however ideologically one would prefer private enterprise.  At column 934, the Taoiseach said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>In so far as manufacturing industry is concerned, we have said that our main reliance is on private enterprise. I think that must continue to be so.  Indeed, present indications are that private enterprise will produce significant developments which will contribute substantially to the country's economic progress. But looking at the results which we have achieved to date against the background of our needs it is not obvious that private enterprise alone will suffice to secure the maximum exploitation of the country's industrial potentialities.  In these circumstances we have to think in terms of an expansion of State enterprise in the industrial field and that is what the Government are now doing.</P>
    <P>I do not suggest for a moment that private enterprise cannot play a very important part but, if it is incapable of filling the whole gap necessary, the need for more public enterprise must be accepted.  If there is to be public enterprise, there must be more conscious direction of investment&mdash;more planning.  If the State or State-controlled bodies are to invest, there must be no overlapping.  There must be a conscious direction of policy, so that the capital, which is scarce enough already, will be most intelligently applied.</P>
    <P>One of the concluding recommendations of <i>Economic Development</i> is the setting up of an advisory committee for this purpose.  The Taoiseach recently referred in the Dáil to the setting up of what he called a special planning board in the Department of Finance.  I should like to remind the Minister that the Banking Commission in its report in 1938 made two recommendations. It recommended the establishment of a Central Bank and <Col N="295" /> of a Debt and Investment Council.  The Central Bank was set up in 1942.  I suggest that the Debt and Investment Council recommended in the report should now be set up, possibly with enlarged functions, and that it could form the nucleus of some sort of commission for the planning of investment.</P>
    <P>I want to make it perfectly clear that in making a recommendation of this kind, I am not arguing in favour of the so-called planned economy system. I still maintain my faith in individualism, but, in a society where a good deal of investment has to be initiated by the State, one must recognise realities, one must recognise that capital is scarce and that there must be some method of directing priorities. Possibly the most fruitful subject of inquiry would be the possibility of evolving new forms of investment in which public and private investment might to some extent be combined. This matter was referred to by the Taoiseach when he said:</P>
    <P>In addition to such extensions of activity as may be undertaken by existing State-sponsored organisations under their own direction and from their own resources, we contemplate the possibility in some instances of partnership arrangements between these organisations and private enterprise.  I think it is likely we will find, in practice, that additional State-participation in industrial development can best be effected through the medium of existing organisations, but if new organisations are required, they can of course be created.</P>
    <P>When new industrial concerns are set up by State initiative, the possibility and indeed the desirability of translating them ultimately into public companies by the offer of shares on the stock exchanges should, I think, always be kept in mind.</P>
    <P>That seems to me to be a fruitful line of development, that in these matters we must not be doctrinaire but must be empirical and must be pragmatic. We must rid ourselves of ideological preconceptions and we must deal with <Col N="296" /> problems as they arise.  The acceptance of a great deal of Government assistance and direction in the investment field is not inconsistent with the maintenance of private enterprise as the main mover, the motive, in the system. Other countries have to face up to this problem; it is not peculiar to us.</P>
    <P>The newly appointed Chairman of Imperial Chemical Industries, which is one of the largest concerns in the world, has made some interesting suggestions in regard to England's economic policy&mdash;I am quoting from <i>The Observer</i> of Sunday, July 5th&mdash; which are worth quoting to illustrate that even what I might call one of the arch-priests of capitalism recognises the necessity today of a certain amount of Government interference in the economic field.  The quotation is:&mdash;</P>
    <P>The effort to mitigate Britain's natural commercial handicap on world trade should, Mr. Chambers suggests, be pursued along three lines.  First we should grow more food and do it more cheaply; this means bigger farms and less sentimental emphasis on the small man. Secondly, we should try much more vigorously to foster the home market for our coal.  Thirdly, we should concentrate on improving the national transport system and bring down our home costs that way.</P>
    <P>These are the priorities, then, as seen by the new Chairman-elect of I.C.I.  It is interesting to observe that all three depend ultimately on action by public authorities rather than on private enterprise.  I pointed this out to Mr. Chambers, but he was entirely unperturbed by the notion that this was &ldquo;planning&rdquo;. His belief is evidently that the country, like I.C.I., must plan a long way ahead and know where it is going, in order to survive and prosper.</P>
    <P>One may argue that his view of Britain's vulnerability is exaggerated &mdash;I should do so myself&mdash;or question his particular choice of priorities. But it is salutary to hear it asserted plainly from this source that we must have a set of national priorities and consciously pursue them.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="297" /> If that is true of England, it is equally true of Ireland and, as I said, we must be pragmatic and empirical in this matter.  We must not allow ourselves to waste energy by political debates between right and left, between capitalism and socialism.  We must take the facts as we find them and try to adopt an intelligent policy.</P>
    <P>Finally&mdash;I apologise for delaying the Seanad overlong and perhaps exceeding the terms of reference of the debate&mdash;to come back to where I began.  Whatever we do in this country&mdash;and this cannot be sufficiently emphasised&mdash;we must have regard to the balance of payments.  Whatever form of investment we indulge in, private or public, we must not run into a permanent disequilibrium in the balance of payments.  That may sound perhaps defeatist and pessimistic but this must be remembered.  An open economy gives certain opportunities as well as certain difficulties. It is not entirely a bad thing to have an open economy.  In a recent lecture by Sir Dennis Robertson, late Professor of Economics in Cambridge, it was stated that in regard to Great Britain an open economy has many advantages.</P>
    <P>Now, that is very true of this country.  It has been pointed out in the Central Bank Report, that this is an open economy and that we will benefit from the successes of our neighbours and that with an economy like ours which exports so much, we have everything to gain when other countries are pursuing expansionist policies.  The report says that the improvement in the economic outlook abroad is generally encouraging as is also the emphasis placed in official quarters on the need for economically stronger countries to resume economic expansion.</P>
    <P>That is particularly true in our case because the British Government, in recent years, have been very successfully pursuing an expansionist policy and that policy, it has been pointed out, made it so attractive to other agricultural countries.  If other agricultural countries are clamouring to get into that market, they really should not discourage as much as encourage us because they have natural advantages <Col N="298" /> with regard to the great expanding market and we must trim our sails according to prevailing winds and take the advantages of the open economy that already we have gained in the recent terms of trade.  That is one of the signs of an open economy and now if we are intelligent we will gain more from the expansionist policies being pursued by European countries.  We should direct our policy towards taking advantage of the prosperity of our neighbours.  After all, every businessman likes his customers to be well off and we should benefit by the prosperity of our neighbours.</P>
    <P>Finally, to end up this rather long speech, looking at the Budget from the point of view of the annual housekeeping account, we can say that it is balanced, balanced rather like Blondin. He got across; his optimism was justified; and we certainly hope the Minister's optimism is justified and that he will get across.  It is an expansionist Budget and rightly so, always subject to the overriding position of the balance of payments. If the balance of payments in the second part of the year does not improve, some of the Budget assumptions may have to be revised.  That however, is something about which we cannot prophesy.  In the long period, the Budget perhaps is irrelevant and we shall have to try to get something more than a balance from year to year and take the longer view.</P>
    <P>I shall quote from the <i>Irish Banking Review</i> for June where that point is well put:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In the short run the country's accounts are satisfactory.</P>
    <P>Equilibrium has been attained&mdash; or at least nearly attained&mdash;in the balance of payments and in the Budget.  The acceleration of the rate of growth of the national economy must next receive attention.  For this, more than the &lsquo;shot in the arm&rsquo; as the Budget has been described, will be needed.  Prolonged nourishment, exercise and possibly blood transfusions may be the essentials of healthy growth.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamStanford" hpid="Professor Stanford Professor Stanford">
      <NameTxt>Professor Stanford</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the House is very grateful to the last two <Col N="299" /> speakers for their most intructive and, in general, I would say, constructive surveys of financial policy.  What I have to say will seem very minor, indeed, in contrast.  It is simply one specific point affecting quite a small group in the community.  However, I am encouraged by the well-known quotation from the Book of Wisdom: &ldquo;He that despiseth small things shall perish by little and little&rdquo;.  The Minister, being a wise man, will not, I think, despise this small thing. In fact, the welfare of a country depends on the accumulation of the small advances, small improvements, together with what Senator O'Brien and Senator O'Donovan have just given us, the wide view which sees the general pattern as well.  My small contribution is simply this.</P>
      <P>I would ask the Minister whether he would not, next year, consider in his income tax policy, making allowance for this small section of the community. I refer to wage earners who are paying for courses of study for themselves at either of our universities.  It seems to me to be a worthy thing for the citizen to do, to try to improve himself, to try to get a degree in that way.  At the moment, I understand he gets no remission of income tax. Parents, on the other hand, do get a remission of income tax for their children over 18, if they are pursuing a full time course of studies at either of the universities.  It does not seem to me unreasonable&mdash;and I hope the Minister on consideration may think the same&mdash;that a wage earner who is paying for himself should be given a remission of income tax on those fees. It cannot, of course, be a full time course of studies in this case, because he has to earn his living as well, but it is a considerable and exacting course of studies, leading to a degree or diploma at either of the universities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a small thing, but I think a worthy section of the community would be encouraged by it.  It is a very small financial loss to the State, but it would ultimately, I think, be a gain to the State in efficiency and intelligence. I appeal to the Minister to consider this small point for his Budget next year; as some hundreds would be very <Col N="300" /> greatly gratified if he saw his way to introduce this small change.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryDavidson" hpid="Miss Davidson Miss Davidson">
      <NameTxt>Miss Davidson</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not find in the Budget Statement anything which gave any hope of a reduction in unemployment or emigration or, indeed, anything to brighten the gloomy scene we have in the country today.</P>
      <P>In the matter of reliefs, the Minister said that he had only a small amount of money to spare, but in response to many representations to ease the lot of the old age pensioners, he was taking the opportunity to do something practical this year.  He said he had decided, therefore, to increase the old age pension from 25/- to 27/6d. a week.  This half-crown was given also in the case of a man with a dependent wife drawing unemployment assistance and to the recipients of non-contributory widows' pensions. The rate for a man and his wife in unemployment assistance at the present time, in the urban areas, is 30/- and for a non-contributory widows' pension the rate is 23/-.  The new rates will be increased by half a crown, that is, to 32/6d. for one and 25/6d. for the other&mdash;which, to my mind, cannot be described as giving relief in a practical way.  Even these increased payments, when they come shortly, will still look a very pathetic rent and housekeeping allowance, particularly when those recipients are precluded from earning, in small casual jobs, any addition to the pension.  If they take jobs or increase their means, the pension will either be withdrawn or reduced.</P>
      <P>This half-crown increase which the Minister is giving to those people is of no practical value at all, if we view it from the angle of what the people lost by the abolition of the food subsidies, by the value of money today or, indeed, by the rise in the cost of living since the Government came into office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know the Minister's money was limited, but I think he could have laid it out better.  He might have left the entertainments duty on, say, greyhound racing.  He could even have put a small tax on horse racing and coursing, for I am sure the sporting <Col N="301" /> fraternity would not have minded the few extra pence that would have been put on those sports.  I am sure they would have faced up to it in a sporting manner, particularly if the Minister had made it clear that he would use the money to ease the conditions of the aged and the widowed.</P>
    <P>I cannot let this measure go through without making a reference to the relief granted to professional boxing.  Surely this money, clearly should have been given to our underprivileged citizens? These disgusting spectacles of human beings battering each other to pulp should be discouraged rather than encouraged. To hear the Minister for Finance, whom I always looked upon as a very gentle soul, saying that they might prove a tourist attraction, shocked me deeply.  Lest I might be considered to be a crank in this matter, I would like to recall that the late Pope Pius XII condemned these tournaments in no uncertain words.</P>
    <P>In the matter of income tax, the real grievance of the wage-earner still remains, that is, that there has been no adjustment in the allowances, with the result that many workers, earning wages that in money value are no higher than those not subject to income tax before the Emergency, now have to meet a considerable amount in income tax.  This fact overshadows any easement which may come from P.A.Y.E.</P>
    <P>In the matter of the sixpence relief granted in the Budget, that goes practically nowhere against the grievances regarding the allowances and I think, indeed, that those who enjoy the sixpence reduction would very willingly have let the Minister keep it for the old age pensioners.  I would ask the Minister seriously to look into the matter of adjusting the allowances and putting the tax on the shoulders best able to bear it.</P>
    <P>I think, too, that the Minister could have withheld for a while the concessions to the surtax payers and the refunds of tax since 1932 to certain companies, until there was a fairer levelling up of the classes within the State. I realise, of course, that those in the higher income class have also to meet the increased cost of living but they <Col N="302" /> do not find themselves, like the old age pensioners a few days before pay day, trying to decide what necessaries it is possible to purchase with the few pennies left over from the pension.  I should like to ask the Minister why he held up the 2/6d. increase in pensions until August.  I am sure he knows the saying: &ldquo;He gives twice who gives quickly&rdquo;, but the old age pensioners have had to wait almost four months for the increase, while certain other concessions were given immediately.</P>
    <P>Going back to income tax, I should like to say that the extension of the children's allowances to children over 16 years of age undergoing apprenticeship is much appreciated as, in the main, these apprentices are in receipt of only nominal payments and depend for their maintenance on their parents.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Two or three big questions have been raised during the course of the debate.  I shall take, first of all, the case raised by Senator O'Donovan and the last speaker with regard to the Budget reliefs.  The cost of giving these benefits to the old age pensioners, the widows and orphans, people in receipt of unemployment assistance and State pensioners who have very small pensions, is about £1½ million per year.  It will not, of course, be so much this year because it does not come into operation until 1st August.  The usual date for most concessions is, by tradition if you like, 1st August and I adopt that date in my Budget because if I had taken 1st July, we could not have given so much. It was a case of trying to balance things as best we could.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The sum of £1½ million is very large and in reference to what the last speaker said with regard to the fact that we might get it back on the greyhounds, that would make no impression whatever.  The most we have ever got from greyhound taxation was £20,000 a year.  When the scheme for the reorganisation of greyhound racing was brought into the Dáil&mdash; there was a Commission sitting on that question&mdash;Senators may remember that we were strongly urged to try to do for greyhound racing what had been done for horse racing.  We were <Col N="303" /> asked to put it on a proper basis so that good prizes could be given in order to encourage people to rear more greyhounds than we had had in the past and in that way to bring an income into the country from the export of those good greyhounds such as we have achieved in the horse-breeding business by the reorganisation of horse racing.</P>
    <P>The idea was that people will not keep greyhounds unless they get something good by way of stakes if they run them, and unless they run them nobody will know their value, so the inference is that you must have greyhound tracks and good prizes.  In that way, the value of the greyhounds will be known and good export prices will be got.  That, of course, involved the withdrawal of tax on greyhound racing.  That was done because it was the comparatively small amount of £20,000.</P>
    <P>With regard to boxing, there were not many sports left and we decided that that tax could go.  As a matter of fact, so far as I know, only indoor boxing was taxed; outdoor boxing was not taxed.  There were just a few odds and ends like that, so we took the tax from boxing because the case was made to us that they could not organise a boxing contest and pay tax and, therefore, such contests were not organised at all.  We may have our opinions as to whether or not boxing should be allowed but I do not think that is a matter for me to decide.  I am only concerned with where I can get taxes and where I cannot.  If there is an attitude against boxing, I think it should be dealt with in another manner.</P>
    <P>The next point which was referred to by some speakers was the reduction in income tax.  Senator O'Donovan said that I am taking a big risk and he pointed out that I may find myself in difficulties in next year's Budget.  I quite recognise that and indeed it was one of the things which was foremost in my mind when I was deciding whether or not I should recommend a reduction of income tax to the Government. I felt I could make that recommendation for this year but I did say to the Government: &ldquo;We must keep <Col N="304" /> in mind that we may be taking a risk for next year.&rdquo;  I came to the conclusion, and the Government agreed, that if we were to be afraid of next year and the year after we would never do anything, that if we were justified this year in giving a relief in income tax, we should go ahead and do it.</P>
    <P>The present position is not as bad as it may appear.  Senator O'Donovan pointed out that compared with last year's figures the figures for income and expenditure this year are nearly as good.  Income is lower and expenditure is higher, but there are fairly obvious explanations, perhaps not obvious to everybody, but obvious to those who have the key to the situation.  The big expenditure is due, to a great extent, to two items, bovine tuberculosis and the subsidy on fertilizers.  They are two capital items, as we all know.  I should not like to say that the total increase in expenditure is accounted for by those two items, but certainly they account for a great deal of it and they are items, of course, that have been increased purposely.  Expenditure has gone up because it was thought necessary to try to exterminate bovine tuberculosis and to increase the fertilisation of the land by giving cheaper fertilizers, so that those twin items account to a great extent for the increased expenditure.</P>
    <P>On the side, there is income which would be as good this year as last year, I think I can truthfully say, if we were collecting duty on tobacco in the same way as last year.  Senators may not know that we are not collecting duty on tobacco in the same way as last year.  The tobacco manufacturers up to 5th April, or perhaps the end of April, paid duty on the day they took the tobacco out of bond.  They were at a disadvantage as compared with other people in that the other people who pay excise duty were required to pay at the end of the month and, in some cases, at the end of the month after they drew it out. The tobacco manufacturers have been looking for the same concession for many years.</P>
    <P>They came to see me and I said: &ldquo;Well, I cannot argue against the justice of the case but what will I do <Col N="305" /> to make up for the loss of revenue at the end of March because it will mean our Budget will be about £2,000,000 short?&rdquo;.  They said: &ldquo;We can agree to pay up to date at the end of March and your financial year will be made right&rdquo;.  I said there was another point, that if I were short of £2,000,000 the whole year through, it meant I would have to pay interest on £2,000,000 against that.  They made that up to us by agreeing that we could put an extra tax of a couple of pence on the lb. of tobacco, without increasing the price of tobacco and, in that way, we were recouped the interest on the outstanding money.</P>
    <P>The result is that the payment of tobacco duty is now very much in arrear compared with last year and if it were paid up as it was paid last year our income would be as good as last year's.  I may say, therefore, that I am not at all worried about the statement of accounts this year with regard to expenditure or income.  So far, it is working out all right.</P>
    <P>The balance of payments, however, also requires explanation.  I should say, perhaps, that it is not as reassuring as the income and expenditure on the Budgetary side.  I think Senator O'Donovan was right in saying we were £12½ million worse off this year than last year on the balance of payments&mdash;something like that figure anyway. One big item in that is the bad harvest.  Our import this year in wheat and feeding stuffs and sugar&mdash; especially in wheat&mdash;has been very much higher than last year because, as Senators are all aware, we produced very little Irish wheat for consumption in last harvest.  We, therefore, have to import practically all our wheat this year and we have been importing wheat heavily up to now, during this year.</P>
    <P>To some extent, the bad harvest also accounts for our increased import of feeding stuffs and to some extent for our increased import of sugar.  Therefore, we may say that the bad harvest has a very big influence in that £12½ million.  I do not want to name a figure but it would be a substantial figure, anyway, in that £12½ million.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="306" /> On the other hand, our exports are down.  We had a carry-over of butter during the winter of 1957/58 from the 1957 production of butter which was ready for export in the beginning of 1958.  We have no carry-over of butter this year and, as well as that, our production of butter is down&mdash; again, I think, to some extent, anyway, as a result of the bad harvest last year and the bad hay that was produced. The cows did not get over the bad treatment during the winter.  I do not say that accounts for the reduction in milk yield entirely but to some extent it does.</P>
    <P>There is also a very big reduction in the export of cattle and that is an item that is rather hard to understand. There are various explanations given for that.  Senator O'Brien gave the explanation that there was a resistance on the part of the British farmer to buying our cattle because they are not fully attested, as they are in England. There may be something in that.</P>
    <P>It is also true that the grass production in England in the early part of this year was not as good as usual and that, therefore, they did not need as many cattle as usual.  I do not know whether our farmers have been offering cattle so freely for sale this year as they did in other years, either.  As Senators are aware, there was a very good return on the census in January, and last June also, in relation to the number of cattle in the country.  In the case of cows and heifers in-calf and in the case of calves and yearlings, the numbers were up but for older cattle the numbers were not up.  Therefore, we have not as many cattle for export this year or perhaps even as many.</P>
    <P>That goes somewhat to explain the reduction in our exports and the increase in our imports.  On the whole, we have a more unfavourable balance in our trade relations this year than last year.  We do not know to what extent capital comes into our imports. Senator O'Brien was rather critical even of importing capital.  I have a note of that to which I shall refer again. Anyway, we do not know whether our imports may be swollen to some extent by capital items such as equipment, where new industries are about to commence. Certainly, this balance of payments <Col N="307" /> is a matter we must watch very carefully.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Brien says that the balance of payments does harm in this way, that it leads inevitably to a depletion in our external assets&mdash;I mean where the balance of payments goes against us&mdash;and this in turn leads to restricted internal credit.  We all know what restricted internal credit does, and its effects.  None of us would like to face it, if we could avoid it.  Then he goes on to say that even in the case of capital goods, it would be detrimental to our economy because, he says, the imports of capital goods will set up a demand for more imports, raw materials, and so on.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Brien also says it is very hard to define &ldquo;capital goods.&rdquo;  If Senator O'Brien is right in that argument that we must guard against the import of capital goods because they in turn will be followed by more imports in the way of raw materials, and so on, it makes the solution of our difficulties appear very difficult.  I should have thought that if we import capital goods here and if they are used for productive purposes and especially if the production from this new factory or new capital is for export, in exporting our goods, whatever they may be, we are paying for the capital we brought in and, on the whole, it should have a good effect economically in the country.</P>
    <P>I may not have followed Senator O'Brien's argument completely.  I should like, however, at another time, to find out exactly what the argument is in this case.  I should like Senator O'Brien also to consider this.  It is not so much the import of capital goods that matters as the total national capital formation in the country, to which he referred.  If the total national capital formation is satisfactory, even though our external assets are going down, I think we would not have very much to worry about.  After all, if the national capital formation is satisfactory, we know we are going in the right direction and we should not worry even if we are bringing in capital goods.</P>
    <P>The figure for national capital formation <Col N="308" /> over the past four or five years has been on the whole, and must be accepted as, satisfactory.  It was much better in 1958 than it was in 1955 or 1956, but it was much better because we had to add in that case the favourable balance of trade and that gave us a very good figure.  But, even last year, 1958, when our balance of trade was practically at equilibrium, the figure again was satisfactory and I think we had nothing very much to worry about for that reason.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Brien's interpretation of &ldquo;errors of estimation&rdquo;, to which I have referred in my Budget speech in the Dáil, is correct.  It covers overestimation of expenditure and underestimation of revenue.  We took the sum, one against the other, and on that calculation I had allowed in my Budget for an error of £3 million.  I hope that will be realised.</P>
    <P>On the question of mechanisation, I do not know if it could be absolutely taken for granted that mechanisation will mean reduced labour requirements. Let us look around us and see what has been the experience in other countries.  Countries like England and America have become highly mechanised over the past 30, 40 or 50 years but employment there is very high.  In fact, as they went on mechanising, employment seemed to rise all the time.  As a result of mechanisation, production is going up and with production going up employment is also going up, because not alone are people employed in the factory where there is mechanisation but elsewhere in various ways as a result of the output of that factory.  Therefore, we should not take it for granted that if we adopt mechanisation here, we shall have fewer people employed.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Brien spoke of the second recommendation of the Banking Commission, saying that when it recommended the formation of a Central Bank, it also recommended&mdash;as far as I could catch what Senator O'Brien said&mdash;a Debt and Investment Council. I have a fair idea of what their functions were, although I do not remember exactly what the title of it was.  However, I can say that in the setting up of the Capital Investment Advisory Committee, the recommendation of <Col N="309" /> that commission was being adopted more or less.  As Senators are aware, they reported on two or three subjects that were referred to them and they very kindly agreed to be at our service again, if we should require them to report on any other question.  Therefore, I think we can take it that we have more or less adopted the recommendation of the Banking Commission in getting the services of these gentlemen.</P>
    <P>Senator Stanford raised the question of wage earners.  I admit that we allow relief in income tax up to a certain amount for every child being educated and, having extended the principle of this Bill to apprentices in that a certain allowance is given to the parents for a boy or girl who is doing an apprenticeship, logically, the man who pays for himself at a university should also be allowed freedom to some extent from income tax.</P>
    <P>That case has been considered more than once and there are arguments against it.  It is felt that a man who gives his time to a course at a university and pays a fee, does it in order to improve himself, and very frequently, if not always, he gets the benefit of that improvement very soon.  The companies with which I was connected before I became a Minister this time, always gave an increment as a matter of course to a person who had got a diploma or anything of that kind, and a great many companies do the same thing.  That is one of the reasons taken into account in considering this matter which convinced me that there was no pressing necessity for doing this.  If it were done, it would be giving a double reward to a great many people.  However, these things can always be considered again and there may be a different opinion on it at another time.</P>
