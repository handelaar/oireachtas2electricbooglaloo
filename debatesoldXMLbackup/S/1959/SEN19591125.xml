    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Minister for Local Government (Mr. Blaney) Neil T. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Blaney)</NameTxt>
      <P>Under sub-section 4 of Section 2 of Article 16 of the Constitution, the Oireachtas is required to revise Dáil constituencies at least once in every 12 years, with due regard to changes in distribution of the population. The purpose of the present Bill is to provide for the revision which is now due.  The Bill provides for the reduction, as from the next dissolution, in the number of constituencies from 40 to 39 and the number of Deputies from 147 to 144, which is the maximum permitted by the Constitution on the basis of a population of 2,898,264 as ascertained at the census in April, 1956.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Senators are aware, the Bill as introduced provided for 142 Deputies. <Col N="1014" /> The number was raised to 144 during the Committee Stage in the Dáil and the two extra seats were allocated to the Dublin South (East) and Wexford constituencies.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the first point to which I should draw attention in connection with this Bill is that it provides for the retention of the maximum number of Deputies permitted by the Constitution. The principal reasons for this can, I think, be summarised by saying first, that from each Dáil a Government must be formed and, assuming that the membership of the House is divided into two approximately equal groups representing Government and Opposition, then only half the total membership will be available from which to choose the members of the Government and Parliamentary Secretaries. Two Ministers can be appointed from this House but this does not, I think, weaken the argument unduly.  It would obviously be undesirable to have the number of Ministers and Parliamentary Secretaries too high a proportion of the Government side of the House in the Dail.</P>
    <P>Then, as a general rule, a high proportion of Deputies may not seek or may fail to secure re-election.  In the last two general elections, the proportion varied round one-quarter of the total membership.  This limits severely the pool of experienced legislators from which a Government or Opposition may be formed.</P>
    <P>Further, with the extension of the State's activities and the large legislative programme of recent years the amount of work which a Deputy must perform if he is to discharge his duties conscientiously has not grown any lighter.  If a severe reduction were made in the total Dáil membership, it could become impossible for Deputies to attend properly to their business, with obvious detriment to the nation.</P>
    <P>The allocation of the numbers of Deputies to be returned for each constituency is governed by sub-section (3) of Section 2 of Article 16 of the Constitution which provides that the ratio between the number of members to be elected at any time for each constituency and the population of each <Col N="1015" /> constituency, as ascertained at the last preceding census, shall, so far as it is practicable, be the same throughout the country.</P>
    <P>In the proposals now before the House, it may appear that there is, in a purely mathematical sense, a slight bias in favour of rural constituencies. That this bias is more a matter of appearance than of fact will be obvious to anyone who has done constituency work in various parts of the country. I am thinking particularly of rural constituencies where the people are not, for the most part, concentrated in districts of high population density but are scattered over wide areas and sometimes in remote and inaccessible places. The difference in population density between a rural and an urban constituency can be very marked.  To cite some figures: in Dublin city, the number of persons per 100 acres is 1,892; in county Dublin, it is 83; in Cork city, the figure is 2,391, which is considerably higher than in Dublin city.  At the other end of the scale is county Clare were the figure is 9.8 persons per 100 acres.  It is obvious that in any equitable revision scheme such divergencies cannot be ignored.</P>
    <P>The nature of the western seaboard is also a factor.  In my own constituency of East Donegal, Fanad Head and Malin Head are 12 miles apart as the crow flies but travelling by road involves a journey of 88 miles.  This is further than a journey from Dublin to Monaghan and almost as far as that from Dublin to Thurles.  Many similar examples of long journeys over mountainous territory with a much indented coastline, could be taken from other western constituencies.</P>
    <P>I may seem to emphasise unduly the difficulty of communication but, if I do, it is because I believe that it is essential to the democratic process that each Deputy should be able to reflect in the Dáil the trends of thought in his constituency so that he can help to ensure that the measures which the Legislature enacts are as accurate as possible a reflection of enlightened public opinion throughout the country. It is part of the same fundamental process that every citizen should have the <Col N="1016" /> right to interview his Deputy on any serious matter relating to himself, his neighbours or his district, without disproportionate loss of time, trouble or expense.</P>
    <P>This right is important in every constituency in the country but it is particularly difficult to see that it is accorded in the large sprawling rural constituencies, particularly in the poorer areas along the western seaboard, where, because of the greater variety of State benefits the need to avail of a Deputy's assistance is often greatest.  The proposals in the Bill go as far as it is practicable to preserve these rights and to ensure equal representation for urban and rural constituencies alike, in compliance with the constitutional provisions.</P>
    <P>In the 12 years since the last revision took place, changes in population have thrown the ratio of population per member in many constituencies seriously out of line.  This effect is seen in its extreme form in the Dublin area where the range is from 45,153 of the population to each Deputy in the county Dublin constituency&mdash;by far the highest ratio in the country&mdash;to 14,120 to each Deputy in Dublin North (Central)&mdash;by far the lowest ratio in the country.</P>
    <P>We can go a long way towards evening out these disparities by incorporating in the city constituencies the areas brought within the city by recent boundary extensions.  These areas, as I need hardly remind Senators, are in the city for administrative purposes but remain outside it for Dáil election purposes. The areas in question comprising the Artane, Baldoyle, Ballyfermot, Beann Éadair, Coolock, Crumlin West, Finglas East, Finglas West, Rathfarnham South and Santry Wards, contain a population of 70,916.  Unfortunately, this is insufficient to raise the average population per member in the city constituencies up to the average for the Dublin area as a whole and we found it necessary to depart from the city boundary and bring within the South (East) constituency an area in Dún Laoghaire consisting of the Blackrock No. 1 district electoral division and an area in the county consisting <Col N="1017" /> of the Milltown district electoral division and certain townlands in the district electoral divisions of Dundrum and Stillorgan.  These areas contain a population of 29,362 and are mainly urban in character.</P>
    <P>The changes in the city constituencies follow more or less as a corollary of these alterations.  On the north side, the city constituencies will generally be the same as the old ones but will include the contiguous areas from the county constituency and some minor modifications to make the new constituencies conform with the ward boundaries.</P>
    <P>On the south side, the only constituency in which a change of membership is proposed is Dublin South (East) which will return four, instead of three members.  The constituency will gain from the Dun Laoghaire and Rathdown constituency, the Rathfarnham South ward and the area outside the city boundary to which I have referred, and, from South (West), the greater part of the Rathfarnham and Rathmines West wards.  It will lose portion of the Pembroke East and Pembroke West wards to Dublin South (Central).  Its population after these changes will be 91,833.</P>
    <P>The South (West) constituency will lose portion of the Rathfarnham and Rathmines West wards to South (East) together with a portion of the Kilmainham ward to South (Central) and, on its outer boundary, will gain the Ballyfermot and Crumlin West wards.  Its population after the change will be 115,641.  South (Central) will gain part of Kilmainham, Pembroke East and Pembroke West wards from South (West) and South (East) respectively. The boundary of the county constituency will follow the city boundary from Baldoyle to Templeogue where it will leave it to follow the present boundary between the county and Dun Laoghaire and Rathdown constituencies southwards to the county boundary.</P>
    <P>The Dun Laoghaire and Rathdown constituency will cede the area about Churchtown, Dundrum, Drummartin, Merrion and Roebuck, and the Rathfarnham South ward to South (East) and, on the south, will lose the part of <Col N="1018" /> the district electoral division of Rathmichael which was transferred to County Wicklow in 1957.</P>
    <P>The task of dealing with population changes in other areas is simpler.  In Cavan, Roscommon and Longford-Westmeath, we propose a reduction of one member without any alteration of the boundaries.</P>
    <P>The Cork area is, after Dublin, that containing the largest concentration of population in the country, with a total representation at present of 17 Deputies.  We propose no change in the present representation or boundaries of the Cork city constituency but a reduction is proposed in the number of members to be returned by the county from 12 to 11, as well as a re-drawing of the constituency boundaries in the county so as to constitute one five-member constituency in mid-Cork and two three-member constituencies in East Cork and West Cork to replace the four existing three-member constituencies. I may mention that the five-member Mid-Cork constituency is not appreciably longer or more difficult to traverse than many of the existing three-member constituencies.  In county Limerick, a minor change is proposed in order to transfer some of the surplus population from East Limerick to West Limerick.  The number involved is 2,582.</P>
    <P>Since the last constituency revision, a small part of county Dublin has, as I have mentioned, been transferred to county Wicklow and now forms part of the Bray urban district.  The Waterford county borough has also been extended to include an area which was formerly in county Kilkenny.  It is proposed in the Bill to alter the boundaries of the Wicklow and Dun Laoghaire and Rathdown constituencies as well as the boundaries of the Carlow-Kilkenny and Waterford constituencies in order to make them conform with the changed administrative boundaries. Only minor changes are involved.</P>
    <P>The provisions of the Bill itself follow the lines of the 1947 Act and do not need any elaborate explanation at this stage.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I may say that the Bill provides for nine five-member and <Col N="1019" /> nine four-member constituencies which is the same number as at present.  The number of three-member constituencies at 21 is one less than at present. I might mention that I have arranged for maps showing the constituencies where boundary changes are involved to be displayed in the Oireachtas Library.</P>

      <P>My personal view on this Bill is the same as the view I expressed in 1947 on a similar Bill. This House undoubtedly has a constitutional right to discuss, or even to amend, this Bill, but it seems to me that as the Bill got a very full discussion in the other House, there is not very much left for us to do but to accept it as it comes to us from the other House, because it does, in fact, concern them exclusively.</P>
      <P>However, the Minister has raised certain points and perhaps, very briefly, I might give my views upon them.  The notion of a very small Dáil is a bad one when you consider that the Dáil must contain at least two sets of people capable of forming a Government.  There are other reasons, too.  Having regard to the nature of the work Deputies have to do, it seems that the membership of the Dáil is fair enough.  The Minister went to considerable pains to explain that the Bill retains what he calls a bias towards the rural constituencies. There may be some merit in that, and I do not want particularly to discuss it, but in the other House a point was raised as to whether or not it is constitutional to have a constituency in which considerably more voters are required to put one member into the Dáil than are required in another.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Attention was drawn by the Minister to-day, and in the other House, to the difficulties which rural Deputies experienced in getting to their constituents and the physical difficulties the constituents have in reaching Deputies for interviews.  That, I think, is correct, particularly in certain areas, but it is also true to say that the Constitution is not framed in such a way as to take account of that kind of difficulty.  There is no doubt at all about that.  There is nothing in the <Col N="1020" /> Constitution to justify what one may call a rural bias.  The word &ldquo;practicable&rdquo; in the Constitution has nothing whatever to do with what the Minister called a democratic process to give facility of access as between a Deputy and his constituents.  The provision in the Constitution reads:&mdash;</P>
    <P>The ratio between the number of members to be elected at any time for each constituency and the population of each constituency, as ascertained at the last preceding census shall, so far as it is practicable, be the same throughout the country.</P>
    <P>There can be no doubt whatever that it would have been practicable for the Minister and the Oireachtas to arrange that the number of people electing a Deputy would be roughly the same throughout the country and there can be no doubt that would be in accord with the Constitution. Whether what has been done is, in fact, in accord with the Constitution is a moot point and certainly the Constitution takes no account whatever of the matters upon which the Minister laid such stress.</P>
    <P>Having said that, I revert to my original opinion.  Leaving the matter of the Constitution aside to be settled in whatever way may be determined, I think this Bill is one which this House should pass.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DominickMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Unlike Senator Hayes, I think this is a Bill which should be opposed.  I say that because I think, even though the Constitution is being met in so far as the electoral areas are being reviewed within the time provided, the result of the review is not, in my opinion, in conformity with the Constitution.  I refer, of course, to that section of the Constitution which says:</P>
      <P>The ratio between the number of members to be elected at any time for each constituency and the population of each constituency, as ascertained at the last preceding census, shall, so far as it is practicable, be the same throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister made a good argument as to why there should be a rural bias in regard to the allocation of seats <Col N="1021" /> between the rural areas and the cities but that is not provided for in the Constitution.  I think the argument as to whether there should or should not be a rural bias is rather beside the point.  The Constitution is silent on that matter and it is a matter for this House, as a House constituted under the Constitution, to have regard to what the Constitution says.</P>
    <P>Even though we are dealing with the allocation of seats in the Dáil, I think the Seanad should oppose this measure because of the result produced by the review.  The Minister says that the rural bias is very slight.  Whether or not it is slight again is beside the point. The Minister went on to quote some interesting figures about the persons per hundred acres in various areas in various constituencies.  Again, I suggest, that is beside the point.  What we are dealing with is a review of the constituencies as laid down by the Constitution and I suggest under the terms provided for in the Constitution.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the changes in population and this brings us to what I consider is an interesting point, namely, not only what the population is in the various constituencies at the moment but also what are the reasonable expectations of changes and developments in the next 12 years.  We are starting off in the year 1959 by providing a rural bias, with the result that certain rural areas, particularly Galway and Donegal&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>And Wexford.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DominickMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not got the current figures but Galway and Donegal are being unduly favoured in regard to the number of Deputies in relation to the population.  It seems to me that we can hardly expect in the next 12 years that there will be a drift of population towards those rural areas from the cities.  I should like to hope that such would be the case but I do not think any reasonable person would expect that result.  On the contrary, from our experience, it would appear that there will continue to be that drift from the country to the cities and at the end of 12 years, the bias and the injustice to the cities will be even greater than is proposed in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1022" /> Let us not ignore the fact that in giving a rural bias, we are, whether we like it or not, inflicting an injustice on the cities.  In effect, we are making the Dublinman's vote less valuable than the vote of a Galwayman or a Donegalman. I am not a Dublin man, as Senators may know, but I am a democrat and I think it is thoroughly undemocratic that we should conceive and arrange a situation in which the vote of a person&mdash;merely because he happens to be living in one area&mdash;will be of appreciably less value than the vote of a person living in another area.</P>
    <P>The Minister said in the Dáil that one of the principles adopted in approaching this review was that there should be as little change as possible in the constituencies as they stand at the moment.  I think that is desirable but that is not the sole criterion.  It is not one of the principles laid down in the Constitution. Let us look at the result of the review that has taken place, the result embodied in this Bill.  We find, as is very well explained to us in the explanatory memorandum which accompanies the Bill, that there is a reduction of one Deputy in each of the constituencies of Cavan, Longford-Westmeath and Roscommon.  I was interested in looking at the position which resulted in those constituencies when the people were last asked to cast their votes, namely, in the referendum during the summer.  It may be a coincidence but it is still strange that in the first of them, Cavan, there was a majority for the Government, for the abolition of P.R., but in all the others, Longford-Westmeath, Roscommon and in Cork North and Cork South&mdash;which it is proposed to merge&mdash;there was a substantial majority against the Government and in favour of the Constitution as it stands at present.</P>
    <P>That sort of result was even more marked in the cities.  It was even more marked in the large centres of population.  Under this Bill, we are providing that their votes in coming elections will be of less value than the votes in other rural areas.  The Minister in his final speech on this measure in the Dáil said that nothing new was involved and that, in effect, <Col N="1023" /> he was not doing anything to Dublin that did not already exist.  Those may not be the exact words he used but I think the sense of what he said was that he is not introducing any new principle in taking the hammer at Dublin.  For the past decade, Dublin has been under an injustice in this matter and the Minister is not simply introducing that injustice. However, the Minister, and the Oireachtas, have a duty to correct any injustice that might have arisen in the preceding 12 years and it is because of that that the Constitution provides there shall be a review every 12 years.</P>
    <P>The Minister and the Government in this measure have not tackled the problem properly.  They have not had sufficient regard to the Constitution and they have not done a good job. I notice that the number of Deputies is being reduced.  There is, I think, a fairly widespread public opinion at the moment that the number of Deputies should be further reduced but I do not subscribe to that opinion. Nevertheless, we have here the maximum number of Deputies that can be provided under the Constitution. Again we have the experience that unfortunately the population is tending to drop.  I hope that trend can be reversed but really are we not being a little optimistic in providing that as the population stands at the moment we shall have the very maximum number of Deputies there can be and not have regard to what might be reasonable expectations in the next 12 years?</P>
    <P>One drastic change has been made by the Minister.  I referred to the principles he adopted in approaching this review, namely, to try to avoid disturbance of the constituencies as they stand at present, but I find that in my native county, Cork, he is really taking the hatchet and has decided to merge North and South Cork, and thus we have what was a frightful thing, according to the Minister when we last saw him&mdash;in connection with P.R. and the Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill&mdash;in that we have an unwieldy constituency with a length <Col N="1024" /> from one end to the other of 110 miles.  If it was necessary, as I think it was, to reduce the numbers of Deputies and to rearrange the constituencies, I think that other constituencies were more deserving of some drastic and severe rearrangement than the constituencies I refer to, namely, Cork North and Cork South.</P>
    <P>The Minister has embodied proposals&mdash;and I see that here he has the support of the Leader of the Opposition in the Dáil&mdash;which gave a rural bias but some areas are more equal than others.  Galway and Donegal are certainly more equal than Cork, Cork North and Cork South.  I think the Bill does not meet the letter or the spirit of the Constitution and because of that, and because I believe in democracy, believe in equal rights and equal values attached to votes, I oppose this measure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamStanford" hpid="Professor Stanford Professor Stanford">
      <NameTxt>Professor Stanford</NameTxt>
      <P>Despite what Senator Murphy has said, I still think this is a fair minded and sensible Bill, and I should like to support it.  It seems to me that, as a matter of national policy, we are right to have a rural bias.  The word &ldquo;bias&rdquo; sounds ugly, but in this case I think it faces the facts.  Economically, we have to remember that we draw our main wealth from the country and anything we can do to preserve its morale and to strengthen it is wise nationally.  I think, too, as a matter of equity, that there is something to be said for giving the country voter slightly more weight than the city voter because area and distance are not to be neglected.  They have to travel further and are responsible, as it were, for a larger slice of the country.  I think it is a kind of equity to give their votes a little more weight than those in the city.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Psychologically, too, although I am a city man myself, I think the country voter is often a wiser man in taking the long view than the city voter.  I think the reason is that very often he has to act and think for himself in a way in which the city man has not got to do when he is working in an industry or a large firm.  The countryman has to be a man of initiative while the working man, whether he is in a factory or in the university or <Col N="1025" /> wherever he is chiefly goes by the rules and regulations laid down.</P>
    <P>Speaking as a city man, I think the Government are right to have this rural bias.  But what I want to commend the Bill for chiefly is this.  The Government have not reduced the number of five and four members constituencies. I do not know whether it was deliberately so or not, but I think that it was a fair minded action because, as I see it, the Government could have nullified much of the effect of the referendum by cutting down the constituencies with the larger number of members, which it was within their powers to do.  If there had been rancour or meanness in the Government's mind, they could have reduced these. And, if they had reduced these multiple-member constituencies, they would have gone right against the principle which I and some others put forward in the Seanad, that the minorities had their rights better preserved by proportional representation than by the so-called straight vote.</P>
    <P>I think it is wise and commendable on the Government's part to preserve these constituencies with the larger number of representatives, and I think the various minorities will appreciate that point.  I have nothing more to say.  I simply wish to commend the Bill, both for its preservation of the good points of proportional representation, and for its rural bias.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>In his preamble, the Minister devoted a great deal of time to discussing the difficulty of forming an Executive from the present small House.  I think in that he indicated he had what we all have a little of, that is, a guilty conscience about the large number of Parliamentarians we have and the small number of people in the country.  For many years, there has been public criticism of the size of the Dáil.  Those of us who are aware of the work of public representatives, and of the difficulties they encounter due to geographical considerations, particularly in country areas, feel that that side of the case has not been put sufficiently fully to the people.  At any rate, though I am a member of a Party who took a very positive decision in another matter, I think the cost to the <Col N="1026" /> people here per public representative is probably very much lower than it is in any other country.</P>
      <P>If we do have that guilty conscience about what is alleged to be over-representation, and if the Minister finds it necessary to make a speech defending this piece of legislation, having so much of its framework based on that point, I want to suggest that it is not lack of members that we suffer from but lack of ability, and I want to state something that might seem to be a little hypercritical, namely, that it is lack of quality.  There is a great lack of quality in the Irish Houses of Parliament. I am a member of one of those Houses and that is my considered opinion.  What you should do to rectify that is another story.</P>
      <P>I think the representation is ample, and in seeking certain changes in the Bill, we have had a very attractive phrase coined, that we are tending towards a rural bias.  That might be unconstitutional but it sounds very well.  However in seeking that rural bias, we have turned into some rather curious labyrinths.  Briefly the result is that Galway can laugh at the Mid-Cork constituency, and what is apparently rural in Galway is not so rural in one of the best farming and most industrious areas in the Twenty-Six Counties.</P>

      <P>I suppose one should not talk politics in a place like this, but I think that had the two constituencies in Mid-Cork done better than one-third for the Government Party in many elections, they would have done better for themselves in this Bill.  Maybe Cork city and Cork county together are to be punished for rejecting the Government's very paternal advice regarding the proportional representation system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do want the House to note that the delightful intimacy which the President upheld, the intimacy of a single-seat constituency with its homely, over-the-garden-wall contact with its public representative, has been completely lost sight of in the 110 miles long constituency in the middle of the county from which I come.  There is <Col N="1027" /> no intimacy there.  The Leader of the House knows that area better than I do.  He knows how far it is from the town of Kinsale to the borders of Cork and Tipperary, and I think he would prefer to be a member of the Seanad for the whole country than to be a Dáil Deputy for that area.</P>
    <P>I do not believe it is the duty of the Opposition to delay this Bill, but I hope that the criticisms I have made will occasion some comment from what I must say is a rather silent Government side of the House.</P>

      <P>I might repeat the observation of the last speaker and say that we should like to hear from the other side of the House, preferably from some Galwayman.  The Constitution sets out that the constituencies must be revised once every 12 years. This Electoral (Amendment) Bill was circulated about a month ago, that is to say, at the 11th hour and 59th minute of the 12th year.  Strictly speaking, I think it should become law to-morrow or the day after.  It should be passed before 27th November, 1959. If it is not law, no general election can be legally held in this country after that.</P>

      <P>I was really astonished that the Bill did not make its appearance earlier.  Actually I prepared a letter to the Press which I did not send for a reason which was personal to the Minister.  I had it drafted, but I thought it might be personal if I sent it at a particular time. My reason for feeling that way about it is that the previous Government had before them a proposal from the civil servants in the Department of Local Government, before they left office at the beginning of 1957.  I shall come back to the nature of those proposals later.  What happened in the intervening <Col N="1028" /> three years?  I think it is obvious what happened.  The Government put all its eggs into the basket labelled &ldquo;Abolition of proportional representation,&rdquo; and they made no arrangements for the contingency of the attempt to abolish proportional representation going wrong.</P>
      <P>When it did go wrong subsequently &mdash;I disagree with Senator Stanford&mdash; it seems to me that the Government did direct their mind very definitely towards an attempt to nullify the affect of the referendum on proportional representation, in so far as it could under a Bill of this sort, but, as Deputy McGilligan said in the Dáil, Ministers are wasting their time doing that kind of thing.  It only shows whether they are fair minded, to use Senator Stanford's phrase.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>During the course of my speech, I shall make it clear, Senator.  Regarding the Bill, the usual phrase may be &ldquo;fairminded and sensible&rdquo;.  That is not the question we are here to discuss.  We are here to discuss representation as provided by the Constitution.  This Bill does not provide for representation as laid down in the Constitution.  I agree with what Senator Murphy said about that subject and also with the case, which was not answered, made by Deputy McGilligan on the Fifth Stage of the Bill in the Dáil.  When the Minister came to deal with Deputy McGilligan's carefully reasoned arguments, the Minister indulged in a great deal of personal abuse.  If anybody wants to hear them, I can quote them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we examine the Bill, as it comes to us, let us not forget that the Seanad is entitled, if it insisted on its constitutional rights, to hold up this Bill for three months.  Suppose it did hold up the Bill for three months, would we be accused, as we were last Spring, of standing on the people's rights and not allowing the people to fulfil their function?  That was the real thread of the argument <Col N="1029" /> which went through the speeches made on Proportional Representation in the early part of the Spring.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Leader of the Fine Gael Party in this House.  This is not a Bill which the Seanad should hold up.  At the same time, I think the Seanad would be quite entitled to amend the Bill, if it felt so inclined. The relevant part of the Constitution is at Article 16, Section 2, Paragraph 3.  It states:</P>
    <P>The ratio between the number of members to be elected at any time for each constituency and the population of each constituency, as ascertained at the last preceding census, shall, so far as it is practicable, be the same throughout the country.</P>
    <P>The important phrase there is &ldquo;so far as it is practicable.&rdquo;  There is no use talking about whether you can move across a range of mountains when one is not quite sure whether it runs north-west to south-east or northeast to south-west or whether it runs both ways, depending upon how you look at it.  On a strict interpretation of the Constitution, the county and city of Dublin are entitled on this redistribution of seats to five extra seats. Unlike the people who believe in this rural bias, I am not a hog for the last ounce of representation for the city of Dublin.  If this Bill had given three extra seats to the city and county of Dublin, I do not think you would have heard a great deal of criticism. Although it would not be in accord with the Constitution, it would be nearer by far than is the present Bill. With the amendment in, the county and city of Dublin have got one extra seat.  If it had got three extra seats, I do not think any sensible person would have objected.  It would still have allowed the Government to allocate two seats somewhere else.  That was not satisfactory from the Government's point of view.</P>
    <P>When one examines this Bill, one realises that the Government do not really believe in democracy.  Like Senator Murphy, I believe in the principle of democracy&mdash;one man, one vote and all votes of equal value.  We all know the history of &ldquo;rotten&rdquo; boroughs and &ldquo;pocket&rdquo; boroughs.  If <Col N="1030" /> county Galway, under this Bill, is not a &ldquo;rotten&rdquo; borough or a &ldquo;pocket&rdquo; borough, it is near enough to it.  What is the position?  The position, in fact, is that five votes in county Galway are equal to eight votes in certain parts of the city and county of Dublin. It might be 7½ or something like that but it was five equal to eight without calculating out to the nearest place of decimals.  I see Senator Lahiffe smiling blandly at that position. Naturally, he does.  I would, too, if it referred to Dublin South (East).</P>
    <P>I must say that the Minister made one statement during his speech that shocked me.  He said that while Dublin county had the largest ratio of population to the number of Deputies in the existing Dáil, Dublin North (Central) had by far the lowest ratio in the country.  He gave the figure as 14,750.  It might be the lowest ratio in the country but to suggest that it was by far the lowest ratio in the country is a gross misstatement of the facts.  It is completely false.  It is not by far the lowest.  Galway is within one-eighth or a decimal point of it.  I think that the Minister spoiled his case by making that grossly inaccurate statement.</P>
    <P>I come now to the proposals which were put to the previous Minister for Local Government at the beginning of 1957.  The House should remember that these proposals came from the Department of Local Government. What did they suggest for the city, particularly the south side of the city of Dublin, that part of Dublin south of the Liffey?  This was the proposal that was put to the Minister.  The constituency of Dublin South (East) was to have three Deputies and it was not to be changed.  It was about right. Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown was to have five Deputies to which it was entitled.  A new Dublin South (West) constituency, consisting, roughly speaking, of Rathmines, Rathfarnham and Crumlin areas was to have four Deputies.  Dublin South (Central) was to have four Deputies, which was dead right.  It was to be cut one, which was perfectly in accord with population.  Finally, there was a new constituency of three Deputies which, for want of a better name, I shall call <Col N="1031" /> Ballyfermot.  It was the Drimnagh-Ballyfermot area.  That is a total of 19 seats.</P>
    <P>What, in fact, did the Minister put into his Bill?  He made no change whatever.  I am speaking from recollection. It is a total of 16.  It is extraordinary how this happened. There was no information available between 1957 and the time this Bill was prepared in the early autumn of 1959&mdash;the end of 1956 and the later part of 1959.  The fact is that that was what fair-minded people would have done, to use Senator Stanford's phrase. They would have given 19 seats to that area.  In fact, the city and county of Dublin were entitled to somewhat more seats.</P>
    <P>That was what any fair-minded person would have done.  It is obvious from the debate that has taken place&mdash; I do not see it quite so obviously&mdash; that other people think that Donegal has been the guiding line in this whole matter.  If I accept the Taoiseach's statement that the mountains run north to south, I cannot understand why there are three in East Donegal and three in West Donegal under this Bill. In county Donegal, there is only 119,000 of a population.  It does not quite qualify for six seats but so far as it is practicable, it is near enough.  No one is going to argue about one or two thousand.  Similarly, speaking from recollection, the population of county Galway is 155,000.  I would not object to Galway getting eight seats.  It would be quite an easy thing to do.  Make two coherent constituencies, West and East Galway constituencies, calling it North and East Galway constituency. Combine the two constituencies and there you have your two constituencies, five plus three seats, Galway city and west of it.</P>

      <P>I frequently go to Galway on my holidays.  I think they will have as good a reception for me as I have always got.  Words are important in this matter.  The Minister talked about the Bill and said it retains <Col N="1032" /> a bias towards the rural areas.  There is no justification for the assertion that the Bill retains a bias towards the rural areas.</P>
      <P>Again speaking from recollection, the constituency that had the highest population per Deputy under the 1947 arrangement was that of Louth. It is a fifty-fifty constituency.  As far as I can make out, Dundalk, Drogheda and Ardee comprise about half the population of Louth which, speaking from recollection, is about 69,000. Therefore, there were 23,000 votes per Deputy there compared with 20,000 for the county as a whole.  That could have been rectified by an additional seat.  Also, in County Meath, there were too many.  You could divide a seat between Louth and Meath, or something of that sort, if you wanted to.</P>
      <P>I examined the figures given following replies to Parliamentary Questions. My conclusion was that in the 1937 Bill or Act and in the 1947 Bill or Act&mdash;these were years, as far as I recollect, when there was a ten-year interval compared with the full 12 years now&mdash;taking the areas round the country, a fair effort was made, on the whole, to allocate the seats by population.  I am not saying there was not a slight element of turning a line a bit to the North or South of where it should go in certain areas. However, in the 1937 Act, I think the Minister for Local Government of the day, Deputy MacEntee, turned his attention more towards creating a three-seat constituency in the belief that his Party would in most cases get two out of three seats.  If you are having a Parliamentary system of Government I think it is as good a way of getting it as any.  I do not believe in four-seat constituencies.</P>

      <P>I would not.  From such elementary arithmetical calculations as I have made, a Party can get two seats out of four with under 40 per cent. of the votes.  I do not agree with 39 per cent. of the electors getting 50 per cent. of the seats.  Apparently the Government Party do, in a global way, taking the country as a whole.  They would like 39 per cent. of the electors&mdash;which is roughly what the Government had; 37 per cent. to 40 per cent. of the electorate&mdash;to get 50 per cent. or more of the seats, 55 per cent. of the seats.</P>
      <P>I think the argument about the constitutionality of this Bill was put excellently by Deputy McGilligan on the Fifth Stage of the Bill in the Dáil. It is not necessary for me to go into the meaning of the word &ldquo;practicable&rdquo;. It is quite well set out by Deputy McGilligan.  There is no question about his accuracy in relation to it and the various points about it, taking it from the Oxford Dictionary. The ratio at present is seriously out of line with what it should be under the Constitution.  My opinion is that if this Bill goes to the Supreme Court it will not be upheld.  I am not a lawyer, but I firmly believe this Bill has no hope of being upheld by the Supreme Court.</P>

I do not think there is any point in putting down amendments to this Bill.  This Bill is drafted in such a way that the Opposition should have said to the Government: &ldquo;If that is the kind of thing you want you can have it.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Murphy made this excellent point: why could the Government not have transferred one of the seats from Galway&mdash;still having Galway over-represented, technically&mdash;to the mid-Cork area?  Of course, Senator Barry <Col N="1034" /> gave the answer&mdash;because the Government wanted to get two seats out of five in mid-Cork which they will get, they hope, and I think, instead of two seats out of six.  In the present arrangement, with three-seat constituencies in Galway, they hope to retain six out of nine seats in Galway&mdash; perhaps, at the worst, five out of nine.</P>

      <P>I agree with a good deal of what Senator O'Donovan has said about this Bill. I do not think there is any point in putting down amendments.  I do not think it is a Bill that could be much improved in Committee.  I think it would need to be redesigned <i>ab initio</i> to satisfy the demands of justice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the arguments put in this House in favour of the retention of <Col N="1035" /> P.R. was that, under P.R., it is relatively difficult to gerrymander a constituency, whereas, under the single-seat constituency system, you get some very queer-shaped constituencies which render the whole operation considerably easier.  I do not think there is any major new injustice brought in by this Bill, though I do think it continues the kind of injustice and disparity we have had under previous Bills.  Nevertheless, if you look at the shape of some of the Dublin constituencies, for instance, on the maps downstairs, one begins to wonder whether it would take much more of a change and a twist here and there to make them look like the original gerrymandered constituency which was somewhere in New York, I believe. The shape is beginning to look peculiar. You are getting places like Ringsend cut off from the constituency in which they have been for a very long time, for purposes to which the Minister did not advert.  I am not quite sure why this arrangement is considered necessary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>There may be a range of mountains there.  It may be due to the silting of the canals there, resulting possibly from the giving over of the canals, or as a result of some change in topographical conditions I have not yet spotted.  The Minister did not advert to this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think this Bill introduces any major new injustice, but it does continue, as Senator Dr. O'Donovan suggests, many other ones.  It does continue disparities that have existed before.  I think it is in that sense that Senator Stanford says that this Bill, judged in the light of existing conditions is a fair-minded Bill, and to some extent I think I could agree there.  Where Senator Dr. O'Donovan seems to be slightly innocent is that he thinks that if his Party, for instance, were introducing such a Bill, all these disproportions, and so forth, would be abolished and we would get pretty even representation.  I reject that view.  I do not accept or believe that either of the big Parties are prepared, <Col N="1036" /> in practice, to try to see that the principle &ldquo;one man, one vote&rdquo; and the equality of voting power should be given throughout the country.  I have not seen any sign of that in any electoral Bill or any amending Bills.</P>
    <P>I think it should be possible under proportional representation, if properly used, when there is an increase in population in a certain area, presuming the constituency to have been reasonably designed in the first place, simply to add a seat, to increase it from a five to a six or seven member constituency, and where there is a decrease in population, either to reduce the number of members or, better still, fuse two constituencies.  I do not think there would be any objection.  I should like to see the constituency division centring around five- or seven-member constituencies rather than upon the smaller one with only three members.</P>
    <P>It is true, as the Minister has been able to point out, that the number of constituencies which have been changed is, if I understood him correctly, only one.  Only one three-member constituency has disappeared, and there remain nine five-member, nine four-member and 21 three-member constituencies. These 21 three-member constituencies are too many.  I should at least like to see far more five-member constituencies.</P>
    <P>I do not share the Minister's view, either, that the question of distance within a constituency is so difficult.  I think that is hokum.  I do not believe it is at all so difficult to get around Ireland, much less around one constituency. Furthermore, I do not believe T.D.s spend time going round their constituencies in this way.  I do not believe they seek their constituents out, except of course immediately before an election.  Then you get a big circulation of T.D.s in a constituency. They cover the area and they might find it a little expensive in petrol to run around a big area then, but that only applies immediately before an election.</P>
    <P>I do not think T.D.s spend much time going to the outlying areas and if there were some voters from those areas in this House to-day, they <Col N="1037" /> would bear me out and say they have not seen their T.D. since before the last election.  The distance to Dublin is considerably less than the distance from Aberdeen to London. It is quite possible to cover all the distances within Ireland, so it is nonsense to talk about these gigantic mountain ranges and impossible geographical barriers.  I would not object to having considerably bigger constituencies.</P>
    <P>According to the Constitution:&mdash;</P>
    <P>The ratio between the numbers of members to be elected at any time for each constituency and the population of each constituency, as ascertained at the last preceding census, shall, so far as it is practicable, be the same throughout the country.</P>
    <P>When do numbers cease to be the same?  When does an increase, for instance, on the number 16,000 begin to look like a disparity?  If you find you get one T.D. for 16,000, one T.D. for 16,500 and one T.D. for 17,000, is that a disparity or is that still &ldquo;the same&rdquo;?  When do we regard 17,000 as being the same as 16,000, and if so, can we go so far as 17,500?  You have one T.D. representing 16,000 and one representing 17,500.  At what point does a number cease to be &ldquo;the same&rdquo;?  The words used in the Constitution are &ldquo;shall ... be the same throughout the country.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We are asked in this Bill to believe that it is the same when one T.D. represents 16,000 people, another represents 17,000 or 17,500 and another 24,000.  So, under the terms of this Bill, 24,000 is equal to 16,000.  I do not know what our primary schoolteachers would think of that piece of mathematics, or what the children in our schools would think of the mathematical capacity of those who ask us to believe that, for practical purposes, 24,000 is equal to 16,000.</P>
    <P>It is quite clear that this disparity is there far in excess of what is rendered necessary by practical considerations. That brings me back to the phrase in the constitution &ldquo;so far as it is practicable&rdquo;.  Senator <Col N="1038" /> O'Donovan made the point that this in fact means that, in practice, it is not possible to have an absolutely identical figure but it certainly is perfectly possible&mdash;that is to say, practicable&mdash;to have the figure considerably closer than the distance between 16,000 and 24,000.  Therefore, I think there is a strong presumption that what Senator O'Donovan says is right and that this Bill does not conform to the spirit and the letter of the Constitution.  The figures I give, by the way, 16,000 and 24,000, were given by the Minister himself when speaking in the other House.  He mentioned, if I understood him correctly, as a justification for the disparity, not that it was not practicable to have the numbers the same throughout the country, but that it did not suit the Government and did not suit the country, because the Government thought there should be a bias in favour of the rural areas and the rural voter.</P>
    <P>In my contention, that amounts to this: the Government says: &ldquo;We are not going to obey the Constitution, because we do not think it would be good for the country to obey the Constitution.&rdquo;  The Constitution says representation must be &ldquo;the same&rdquo;, and the Government say you must give a bias to the rural area.  It is for the Minister to demonstrate to us&mdash;if he will give his attention to the problem&mdash;that to give a bias to the rural votes can be considered the exact equivalent of having the same representation for country and town.</P>
    <P>In other words, the Government are trying deliberately and openly and admittedly to give a bias in favour of one section of the electorate and they must prove that, in doing that, they are in fact giving the same representation throughout the country.  The phrase &ldquo;throughout the country&rdquo; is the phrase used in the Constitution.  I feel there is a heavy onus upon the Government to show that they have in some Article of the Constitution the right to give a bias to the rural areas. I contend they have no such right.</P>
    <P>I contend, too, that it certainly is not covered in the phrase &ldquo;so far as it is practicable&rdquo; because the phrase does <Col N="1039" /> not say: &ldquo;So far as you can help the country people and produce a bias in their favour.&rdquo;  There is nothing like that implied in it.  I feel the Minister has gone outside his brief, and so have the Government, in telling us they are not obeying the Constitution simply because they think a bias in favour of the rural areas would be a good idea.</P>
    <P>Perhaps I am cynical&mdash;more cynical than my colleague, Senator Stanford&mdash; because I am afraid there is a connection, as has been suggested by Senator O'Donovan and Senator Murphy, between the fact that in the recent referendum, the country voters followed pretty docilely, in the majority of cases, the Government's view on the abolition of P.R., while the city voters said no, and stood by the Constitution.</P>
    <P>I believe there is a connection between that and the strong desire on the part of the Government to give a bias in favour of the rural voters.  The case for that bias is not contained in the paragraph of the Constitution which is quoted in the explanatory memorandum. I have not followed the geographical implications very closely, but judging by the Dáil debate, apparently faith in the Government has actually moved mountains in Donegal. That is a very impressive thing to see happening.  I do not know whether there is any aerial photography to show precisely what happened, but there seems to be a preoccupation with imaginary geography behind the laying down of the dividing line in certain constituencies.  I think that is an unhappy thing.  It may be an entertaining thing, but I do not think it provides good political administration.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, the Minister has put it to us that population density has got something to do with a man's importance as a voter.  He quoted figures to show us, and, while I am afraid I did not jot them all down, the general tenor was that the fewer people living on the acres around you, the more important your vote is.  I do not accept that.  I do not believe it is true.  I do not think that population density ought to have anything at all to do with the individual importance of one man's, or woman's vote.  The T.D.s <Col N="1040" /> should represent not acres but people. That is so simple and obvious that we ought all accept it, and I am surprised at the Minister mentioning the number of acres that are to be represented by T.D.s.  Some T.D.s may come to be regarded as representatives of very empty acres indeed, if the present trend of emigration goes on.</P>
    <P>I do not think acreage or area has anything to do with representation. Representation in Parliament must depend on the counting of heads, on individual votes and on individual people. That is not a perfect system, but it is the democratic system and I suggest that in applying&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The distances are very great to the other House.  I do not know whether the transport is available or not.</P>
      <P>If I may continue, in the hope that we shall have the Minister with us again soon, having got in touch with these outlying areas of our own particular House, the point I am making is that any suggestion that the density of the population&mdash;and I am using the word &ldquo;density&rdquo; meaning overcrowding and not mental incapacity&mdash;should have anything to do with the number of votes is wrong, but if one were to make such a suggestion, I think one might put it the other way, in some circumstances.  For instance, in relation to housing, I would say that if it was a question of a decision on overcrowding more weight might possibly lie with those people who have to put up with the overcrowding, and who are congested together in tenements, than with those outside in the wide open spaces.  If there were to be this argument, it would seem to be the other way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, I would stick to the view that no matter what one's living conditions, or wealth, or importance, or acreage, one should have one vote which proportionately should carry no more weight than that enjoyed by one's neighbour.  The voter is not more <Col N="1041" /> important if he is living by himself on one hundred acres than if he is living with 54 other people in a Dublin tenement.</P>
    <P>There are other matters which I should like to have seen dealt with in an Electoral (Amendment) Bill.  I have a feeling that some of them would probably require a special Bill, although they all deal with electoral methods.  Therefore, I do not want to dwell at length on them.  I should like to think of the Government being preoccupied and concerned with changes in, for instance, the lay-out of the ballot paper.  It seems to me that a reform in that connection has long been needed.  What I mean is that it seems to me that the function of the ballot paper is to place the voter, as far as possible, in a position to make an informed choice.  The ballot paper should be fully explanatory and should show to what Party each candidate belongs.  That would require perhaps a special Electoral (Amendment) Bill.  I am prepared to accept that it could not be introduced into such a Bill as this, but there should be such an Electoral (Amendment) Bill.</P>
    <P>In my opinion, the Government should introduce a fuller type of Electoral (Amendment) Bill in order to simplify the voting process for the benefit of the voter and in order to allow him or her to choose with a full knowledge of the facts.  Similarly, the whole question of deposits, the amount and forfeiting of deposits, the proportion of the quota which has to be got to save one's deposit, are all details which require amendment in our electoral system.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OwenSkeffington" hpid="Dr. Sheehy Skeffington Dr. Sheehy Skeffington">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>I realise that.  There is just one point here which seems to be related to the size of constituencies.  I really mean to the number of Deputies per constituency. I think it will be agreed that the fewer the number of members in a constituency, the bigger the quota is likely to be, that is to say, the division of the number of seats into the total electorate is likely to produce a bigger quota.  Therefore, it may well happen in a constituency <Col N="1042" /> where there are very few members&mdash; a three member constituency&mdash;that it may be more difficult than it would be in a nine-member constituency to achieve the amount of quota necessary to save one's deposit.  I accept the view that this might be a bit outside the scope of this particular Bill and I pass on, having thrown out the suggestion that some of us would like to see the Government concerned at some future date with some of these apparently minor, but I think, quite important, changes in our electoral system.</P>
      <P>I pass on to the final question of the ideal size of the Dáil.  On a previous occasion, in relation to the Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill. I proposed amendments which would have produced a Dáil ranging, if I remember correctly, from somewhere between 90 and 130, or 120 members. One of the sections of this Bill lays down the actual size of the Dáil, so it is very much in order to say whether or not we favour this view. The Government have decided what the size, of the Dáil should be, the ideal size, though the population is diminishing, and they have decided to drop its membership by two only The Minister adverted to that in his opening speech, and said a Dáil was required which should provide a sufficient number of people from whom to select a Government and an Opposition, and perhaps an alternative, as it were, another Opposition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We would all agree with that but where I would differ from the Minister is on the figure.  He says that the Government think about 140 members is right.  I think 120 would be plenty and I should like to see throughout the country something like 17 or 18 seven-member constituencies.  I do not really mind whether some of these would be very extensive in area, and I think they could be designed to produce a House of somewhere around 120 members.  It should be recognised that in this Dáil of ours where we are to have one Deputy for every 20,000 of the population, as opposed to every 80,000 in Britain, our Deputies are not, in fact, asked to do the same amount of Committee work, responsible Committee work, that is <Col N="1043" /> asked of their counterparts in the British House of Commons.  I do not suggest there is not a good deal of work done outside the House itself, but the amount of responsible Committee work expected of Dáil members is not anything like as great as that expected of the people across the water.  Yet there they have one member to 80,000 and here we have representation four times as strong.  I think that disparity is too big.  If we were to have representation similar to Britain, our Dáil would be too small, but the difference between the two at the moment is too great.</P>
    <P>If we were to reduce our Dáil to 120 members, I believe the quality of the individual members would go up, because it would be&mdash;shall I say?&mdash; the less strenuous T.D.s who would disappear.  The better ones would remain.  I do not think we would lose anything by cutting down the Dáil by about 20 members.  The fact is that in one constituency&mdash;I am not sure whether it is Donegal or Galway; actually, I think it is Donegal and I am sorry the Minister is not yet back here, as he might be able to give me the actual figure&mdash;there is to be one Deputy for every 16,000 of the population, whereas in Dublin we are to have one for every 24,000.  I have stressed that before and I do not wish to dwell further on this disparity.  Yet I must say that people in Dublin are not resigned to the presumption that any two Donegal men are worth any three Dublin men.  That might be popular in Donegal; it might be popular in other parts of the country; but is it really fair play, and does it conform with the Constitution which says that the representation shall be &ldquo;the same throughout the country&rdquo;?</P>
    <P>It seems to me that the Government are asking us to accept the continuance of such disparities.  I do not suggest that these are being invented by the Government, because they are, to a great extent, only continuing what has been too long tolerated.  They are not doing their duty as a Government however in failing to right these wrongs and amend these disparities and have produced a Bill consequently which is only a shadow of the Bill which should be brought before us.</P>

      <P>And he also gave expression to the view, which is mine too, that a measure of this kind, which deals with Dáil elections, is more the concern of the members of the Dáil than it is of the members of the Seanad.  Of course, that is not to say that the Seanad has not a constitutional right to deal with it, and to put down amendments as it thinks fit, but, despite all the criticisms we have heard today from some of the Senators opposite who are attached to political Parties, it is very strange that there were very few amendments, if any, put down to the Bill in the Dáil.  If my recollection does not lead me astray, I think the Second Reading was accepted by the Dáil without opposition; yet we were told today by several Senators, especially by Senator Murphy, that this measure is undemocratic, and that we <Col N="1045" /> are taking away rights from certain sections of the people which we should not take away.</P>
      <P>I do not agree with that at all and I do not agree, either, with those who find fault with the Bill because, as they said, it has a rural bias.  I think it is only natural to expect that a Bill of this kind should have that bias because this is an agricultural country, our chief industry is the agricultural industry, and it is only right that in Dáil Éireann proper representation should be given to the country's major industry.</P>

      <P>I think that would be utterly impossible.  Those who say that the number of seats in a place like the city of Dublin should bear the same ratio to the population as in the country are not facing up to the realities of the situation.  How could any realistic person try to convince himself that the same number of seats could be given in Dublin in ratio to the population as would be given up and down the country?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister was right when he said that the trend of population in the country must be taken into account, the lie of the land, the mountains, the nature of the land in certain places and so on.  All these things must be taken into account.  Some of us know from experience that some T.D.s elected for certain rural parts have to travel a distance of 80, 100 and more than 100 miles from time to time to meet their constituents and attend meetings.  In other words, I should like to point out to those people who find fault with and belittle the efforts <Col N="1046" /> and duties of T.D.s in rural Ireland that representation in the country parts is a whole-time job.  It is not a five-day job, or a six-day job but a seven-day job.  These people have to do as much work and sometimes more work than even civil servants have to do.</P>
    <P>As to this question of the constitutionality or otherwise of this measure there can, of course, be divergent views on that, but my view, for all it is worth, is that the provisions of this Bill are in accordance with the Constitution. Perhaps, the House will bear with me if I again read the relevant sub-section of the Constitution.  Article 16, paragraph 2, subparagraph (3) states:-</P>
    <P>The ratio between the number of members to be elected at any time for each constituency and the population of each constituency, as ascertained at the last preceding census, shall, so far as it is practicable, be the same throughout the country.</P>
    <P>The whole thing centres round the word &ldquo;practicable&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OwenSkeffington" hpid="Dr. Sheehy Skeffington Dr. Sheehy Skeffington">

      <NameTxt>Éamon Ó Ciosáin</NameTxt>
      <P>I say that it centres round the word &ldquo;practicable&rdquo; and not round the words &ldquo;the same&rdquo;. As to the practicability or otherwise, we must have regard to the realities of the situation and, as I have pointed out, to try to give the same number of seats in ratio to the population in Dublin as down the country would not be practicable.</P>

      <P>That being so, I think it would be as well to get away from that argument.  If there are people who feel strongly on it, no doubt an opportunity will be found elsewhere to have the matter tested. As I said at the outset, I think the Minister has done a good job with this measure.  I think it is fair and equitable&mdash;as equitable as any Minister could make it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If there is a rural bias, that is, as I said, only natural in a country like this, but the question is whether there is that great rural bias that Senators <Col N="1047" /> have been referring to because, in actual fact, in the general elections that have taken place before now, it has taken more voters on the average to elect a T.D. to the Dáil in the country than it has in the city of Dublin.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister in introducing this Bill sounded like a person who was making a justification for doing wrong and saying that what he was doing was not so wrong.  The whole tenor of the Minister's speech was to justify the manner in which the provisions of the Constitution with regard to the limiting of the constituencies was being dealt with in the Bill.</P>
      <P>I think that this House is bound to take some notice of what the Constitution provides.  The other Senators who have spoken have all dealt with the constitutional aspect of this Bill.  On a previous occasion, this same question of constitutionality of Acts of the Oireachtas came up here.  I am beginning to wonder whether the Government in drafting legislation have any regard whatever for the provisions of the Constitution because the Constitution is quite specific on the point.  It says:-</P>
      <P>The Oireachtas shall not enact any law which is in any respect repugnant to the Constitution or any of the provisions thereof.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is quite specific but the view taken by the Minister for Health on the Greyhound Industry Act was that <Col N="1048" /> the Oireachtas could enact any legislation it liked, provided it was not blatantly in contravention of the Constitution.  That is not what the Constitution provides.  The Minister and the Government apparently in relation to this Bill think it is sufficient if the Bill is not blatantly in defiance of the provisions of the Constitution.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that there is a slight bias in favour of rural districts. That certainly is an understatement in the light of the figures that have been produced here by different Senators.  The point that has been made&mdash;and I repeat it&mdash;is that there is no provision in the Constitution for a bias in favour of anything.  The Minister must be well aware of that. The mountains in Donegal were there when the Constitution was passed in 1937 and the coastline on the western seaboard was much the same in 1937 as it is today.  If the farmers of the Constitution wanted to provide for a bias or take into account certain geographical features of the country, that could have been done in the Constitution but it was not done.</P>
    <P>Therefore, the Oireachtas is tied to an ordinary interpretation of Article 16, Section 2, Paragraph 3 of the Constitution which provides that the ratio shall be on a mathematical basis so far as it is practicable and the practicability centres entirely on the odd thousand here and there where you could not get exactly even numbers.</P>
    <P>The Minister's arguments in favour of departing from the provisions of the Constitution do not seem to hold any water.  The Minister has spoken about Deputies in rural areas having vast distances to cover and said that the need for more Deputies in rural areas arises from the fact that these distances are big in some constituencies. It would seem to me that, in a place like the city of Dublin, the Deputy, by reason, of the density of population, is much more harassed by his constituents than the Deputy in a rural area because the means of communication are much more readily available than in a rural area. <Col N="1049" /> The Dublin Deputy can be contacted by telephone.  If he is not at home, he can be contacted at Leinster House or at his place of business.  To meet all the needs of the population of Dublin would require more Deputies because the people can all the time be in touch with their Deputies.</P>
    <P>In rural areas, people do not travel great distances, except in extreme cases, to see their Deputies.  Consequently, if the Minister talks about this facility being made available in rural areas to enable constituents to see their Deputies, he is not talking about something that is a fact.  Apart altogether from that, the population is a literate population.  The people are able to write and do write to their Deputies.  The postal service is always available as a means of communication between Deputies and constituents in rural areas and, as far as my information goes, is very much availed of.</P>
    <P>The Minister has also said that by reason of the whole range of social welfare and other benefits, people require to get in touch with their Deputies about them.  If people have problems in relation to their rights under various enactments and schemes, I think this is not the way to solve them.  A Deputy's primary function is to represent the whole of the people in his constituency.  Much of the time of Deputies that might be devoted to the more important aspects of the national economy and to national problems is taken up in dealing with matters that need never require to be dealt with by Deputies or Senators, if local and Government authorities were a great deal more helpful to people who think they have grievances or who think they have rights in explaining these to them.</P>
    <P>The Deputy can give very little assistance to any person who approaches him to know whether he is entitled, for instance, to a particular allowance under the Infectious Diseases (Maintenance) Regulations. A Senior Counsel would find the greatest difficulty in telling him that because they are all in regulations which are not to be found anywhere, <Col N="1050" /> hardly.  Therefore, the problems with which Deputies are confronted by their individual constituents cannot be cured by having more Deputies but by an attack from an entirely different angle.  The whole range of duties which devolve upon Deputies at present will not be lessened in the case of Donegal by giving the representation it is proposed to give them under this Bill but in an entirely different way, as I have indicated.</P>
    <P>The Bill itself is not very easy to follow in some cases, particularly where constituency boundaries are being changed.  I think we must regret, despite the fact that maps are supplied in the Oireachtas Library, that maps were not supplied to Deputies and Senators so that these matters could be followed with some precision.  I cannot understand why, in this modern age, with photostatic equipment available, it was not possible, without the necessity of printing maps, to provide photostatic maps to enable people to see what precisely is being done in this Bill.</P>
    <P>Senator Stanford rather commended the Government for not nullifying the effects of the Referendum.  It would have been entirely deplorable if the Government had done anything more than they have done in this Bill to nullify the effects of the Referendum on P.R.  It is perfectly clear that the Government did not find favour with Dublin in the Referendum and now Dublin does not find favour with the Government in this Bill.  To that extent, this Bill is a product of the results of the Referendum on the Constitution.</P>
    <P>Senator Sheehy Skeffington commented upon the fact that neither of the big Parties was prepared to do justice in relation to the distribution of seats and the allocation of Deputies in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution.  I think Senator Sheehy Skeffington should accept the word of Deputy O'Donnell, the former Minister for Local Government, in the Dáil on this Bill, when he indicated that he had asked his own Department, the Department of Local Government, to draft a Bill in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution and having regard to the changes in population <Col N="1051" /> since the last revision and that it was the intention of Deputy O'Donnell, when Minister for Local Government, that the product of that examination of his Department should be the basis of the Bill.</P>
    <P>It is quite unfair of Senator Sheehy Skeffington to brand everybody with the same tarred brush and to give the impression that nobody could be right and nobody was prepared to do justice except apparently Senator Sheehy Skeffington.  He is erroneous in his view of the activities of Deputies in rural areas.  He expressed the view that Deputies go into circulation only at election time.  If Senator Sheehy Skeffington stopped now and again and had a conversation with some of the rural Deputies and asked where they were last week and the week before and the week before that again and where they were going next week, he would find that Deputies of all Parties are constantly in touch with their constituents.  He might even have regard to reports in a paper like the <i>Irish Press</i>, for instance, where you find Deputies constantly attending meetings of the various Fianna Fáil cumainn.  That is one way of keeping in touch with a section of the electorate and, at any rate, it indicates that Deputies are keeping in touch with the electorate.  Senator Sheehy Skeffington's view is quite erroneous in point of fact.</P>
    <P>With regard to the practicability of having constituencies drawn differently from the manner in which they have been drawn up to the present time, I want to point out that under the new Health Authorities Act it is proposed, with apparently no difficulty whatever, to constitue several counties and parts of counties into new health authority areas that can be administered quite well.  It is expected that they can be administered quite well under the new Bill.  I cannot see any reason why constituencies cannot be drawn differently from the manner in which they have been drawn up to the present time, somewhat on the same basis&mdash; not necessarily the health authority basis&mdash;but it could be done.  The county boundaries and the siting of <Col N="1052" /> towns and so on, are not the be-all and the end-all of representation in Parliament.</P>
    <P>I share the view expressed by Senator Hayes that this Bill is primarily a Bill for the Dáil but nevertheless the Seanad, of course, has its own rights in relation to it.  As the Minister for Health indicated during the debate on the Greyhound Industry Bill, there is always another day, and there is always another place, in which matters such as this Bill may be capable of correction.  I suppose we ought to be grateful that if some provisions of the Constitutions are not being observed by the Government, there are at least other provisions in the Constitution which can be put into operation by ordinary private citizens to ensure due compliance by the Government with the provisions of the Constitution in matters such as this Bill.</P>

Senator Sheehy Skeffington used it many times but when he came to describe another situation in regard to giving greater representation to city areas he did not then use the word, but he used a word which I had written down prior to his using it&mdash;the word &ldquo;weighted&rdquo;. If this Bill does anything, I suggest it weights representation in favour of the rural areas and I do not think that is a biassed thing to do.  I argue that it is a just thing to do.  I am not convinced by the arguments of people with a city mentality that it is unfair and biassed to weight representation in favour of the rural areas.  I hope the Minister will see fit to understand properly what he means when he uses the word &ldquo;bias&rdquo; and that other members of the House, and of Dáil Éireann, will go to the trouble of finding out exactly what they mean when using that word. In my opinion, the word &ldquo;weighted&rdquo; describes the situation.  It was an unfortunate choice of word on the part of the Minister.</P>

      <P>Senator Hayes was quite reasonable in his approach.  He criticised the measure mildly and expressed, generally, his agreement in principle, as also did Senator Stanford. While I believe Senator Stanford was honest and unbiassed&mdash; and he certainly cannot be accused of being political in his approach to this issue&mdash;I disagreed with him when he argued that there is a virtue in this measure because it contains so many five-seat constituencies.  I suggest to Senator Stanford that that does not add any particular merit.  It is not a virtue in itself.  Senator Stanford argued that it is a good thing to have multi-seat constituencies because it would appear to give a guarantee to minorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1054" /> I want to say&mdash;and quite a lot will have been said when the dust has died down&mdash;that I am not convinced on that point.  I believe there is no safeguard in the multi-seat constituencies for minority groups.  It is my experience, and I think it is the verdict of history, that the rights of minorities are really in jeopardy when you have two conditions: one, when you have a dictatorship and extreme tyranny, and the other when you have extreme liberty.  It is under those conditions that minority groups suffer most and I think most people will agree that is the verdict of history, in practice.</P>
    <P>In so far as multi-seat constituencies tend to give the balance of power to minorities, that situation has been responsible for the collapse of democracies which were based on these constituencies in other countries. It brought about a position in which you had dictatorship, under which large minorities of all types suffered. It is when you have chaos or dictatorship that minorities suffer.  I do not think there is any virtue at all in having a multi-seat constituency.  It may suit a particular geographical area and then it may be desirable to have a five-seat constituency, but after that I do not see any particular merit in it.</P>
    <P>Certainly I would never subscribe at all to the ready-made plan of having eighteen seven-seat constituencies as advocated by Senator Sheehy Skeffington.  The result would be that you would have at least 18, or possibly 20, or maybe 30 people who would find themselves in the position of being a dominant minority.  They could then successfully dictate to the majority in Parliament.  That would be government by the minority and that is not the type of democracy I wish to see.</P>
    <P>People who argue on those lines, and who argue that there should be mathematical representation, convince me that they have not really studied the situation.  They convince me that they have no real contact with the country, apart from contact with the city.  They may elect to say that they have, but, in practice, they have not.</P>

      <P>I am well aware of that and I am so well aware of it that I know that quite a lot of the people in this city have their interests attended to by people elected in the country.  I know where people from such places as Donegal, Leitrim and Kerry go when they want representations made.  It is quite common for people living in this city to go to Deputies from the country when they want something.  If the Senator can contradict my suggestion that people from Leitrim or Mayo have gone to Senators or Deputies to get representations made about houses, old age pensions or such matters, then I withdraw my statement.</P>
      <P>It would be chaotic if we were to adopt this mathematical scheme suggested by Senator Sheehy Skeffington. Imagine 18 constituencies with seven Deputies each&mdash;126 Deputies.  Many of the Deputies would not even know the limits of their own constituencies. I had experience, when I was a younger man of working on elections. The seven-seat constituency of Leitrim &mdash;Sligo stretched and still stretches from the gates of Ballina to the gates of Cavan.</P>

      <P>It depends on the way you go.  If you go as the fly crows&mdash;I say that quite deliberately&mdash; and not as the crow flies, it is 100 miles.  I was rather surprised at Senator O'Donovan's case&mdash;and he went much further than Senator Hayes in the matter&mdash;about what he referred to as &ldquo;a rural bias&rdquo;.  He tried to work out the mathematical proportion: &ldquo;as five is to eight&rdquo;, and I expected him to add &ldquo;so FG is to FF&rdquo; to complete the proportion.  If he were to complete his ratio, he should have said &ldquo;so Fine Gael is to Fianna Fáil&rdquo; and then it could be argued what the <Col N="1056" /> result would be.  It would depend on whether you put the eight first or last.</P>
      <P>I honestly think that it is desirable to weight representation in favour of the rural areas.  I think that is the opinion of most Deputies and that is why this Bill was received reasonably well by all sides.  Now it is left apparently to a number of people, because it may suit a particular political equation, to try to destroy the measure by suggesting it is unconstitutional.</P>
      <P>In regard to this matter of representation from the rural areas, surely reasonable people will agree that a Deputy in Kerry, Clare, Donegal or Galway has a much harder task to give that representation than those in non-rural areas.  Mind you, I do not argue that representation is the first duty of a member of Dáil Éireann.  The Government of the country is the first duty of the Parliament and representation comes second.  But it is an important duty and because of the pattern of our public life here, it does appear that Deputies and Senators do give that representation to their constituents.</P>
      <P>The position has developed here that rural Deputies and Senators&mdash;I am not sure whether this is true of city members&mdash;find themselves in the position of being public relations officers to every Department of the State.  They have to do that job well and fairly efficiently and their ability as public representatives seems to be judged by their efficiency as public relations officers to the different Departments. Because of the distances from Government Departments, it is a necessary service in rural areas and when people argue that it is unfair, unjust and unconstitutional to weight representation in favour of rural areas, it proves that those people really have a bias, that they have a city mentality and they are not interested in affairs or people outside the city area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one matter which I feel I should mention before I conclude.  It is the question of that lovely scheme produced by the Department of Local Government for redesigning the constituencies. I heard it being described by Senator O'Donovan and I gathered it was a scheme considered by the then Minister for Local Government, <Col N="1057" /> Deputy O'Donnell.  I take it that was the implication of the Senator's statement. If I am wrong, I am sure the Senator will correct me.  To me that scheme seemed so nice, so precise and so accurate that it could have been drawn with a set-square.  It reminds me of the right-angle triangle of Pythagoras.  It had straight lines, set angles, and corners in the right places. I felt that the Senator did not want to be taken seriously, and he said something about the Minister not implementing it at that time.</P>
    <P>Does the Senator know why it was not implemented at that time?  It was possible for the Minister to frame a Bill along those lines, to bring it to the Dáil and to the Seanad, if it had all the virtues suggested by Senator O'Donovan.  I suggest that agreement could not be found because of the very structure of the Coalition Government. It was impossible to find agreement among the different members of that Government.</P>

      <P>That is why the scheme lay in abeyance, to use a very much-used word, when there was an onus on the Government to comply with the terms of the Constitution. The reason was that a majority could not be found, even in the Government, to undertake that scheme, which, in the words of Senator O'Donovan, seemed to be a very good scheme.</P>

      <P>In speaking on this Bill, like Senator O'Reilly, I shall dwell a little on rural bias.  I am sure if the Minister and Senator O'Reilly went down to North or South Cork, they would have extreme difficulty in convincing the people there that there was any kind of bias, as far as Cork county is concerned.  One has only to look at the figures to find that in East Donegal there is 17,990 of a population per Deputy, and in West Donegal 16,700.  In Cork South, the figure is 19,382 and in Cork North 19,448.  Will anybody try to convince the people down there that whoever was the architect of this Bill had a <Col N="1058" /> rural bias?  There is no answer to the figures.  We will invite Senator O'Reilly down to Cork, and I do not wonder that he is disturbed by this word &ldquo;bias&rdquo;.  I would be, too, if I were in his position, but I can assure him that whoever was the architect of the Bill&mdash;some say it was the Minister and I should not be surprised, because he has looked after his own so very well that he has not interfered with the representation of Donegal; in fact, he came further down to look after other counties in his neighbourhood&mdash;had not a bias in favour of Cork.  Some people tell me that the chief carver of this was a Corkman himself.  I do not believe it.  I am not sure, but it was stated around this House that the chief architect is a Corkman.</P>

      <P>I should be very worried if a Corkman were responsible.  It is just not fair to the rural population of Cork.  The two constituencies of South and North Cork are merged together in one, running from Clonakilty Bay to the Limerick border, a distance of well over 110 miles.  Surely there must be some reason other than rural bias for creating this constituency?</P>

      <P>Come down with me, we will travel it tomorrow and it will take us all day.  In the case of two constituencies that had well up to the population required per Deputy, surely there must be some other reason for amending their boundaries?  Mind you, if one examines it closely, the reasons are very apparent.  The people down there are well aware of the reasons.  They are well aware that they are being denied the right to get a Deputy to represent them.  They are well aware that they are having 11 Deputies instead of 12 and, if you take in the city, you will find between the city and county, if the votes were <Col N="1059" /> divided between 12 Deputies, there would be 22,000 odd of population per representative.  Surely there must be some discrimination in favour of some place else as against Cork?</P>
      <P>I am sure that Senators on the other side who are Corkmen will stand up and say that we in our county have been denied what has been given to other rural areas.  I would appeal to the Minister, to the civil servants, or to the Corkman who I said was the head carver, to give Cork what it is entitled to, in the same manner as it is given to other constituencies.</P>

      <P>In my opinion, this Bill is a talented piece of gerrymandering, and is partisan in the worst possible way.  Article 16, 2º of the Constitution states in subsection 3:</P>
      <P>The ratio between the number of members to be elected at any time for each constituency and the population of each constituency, as ascertained at the last preceding census, shall, so far as it is practicable, be the same throughout the country.</P>
      <P>That is what the Constitution says but in this Bill there is over-representation in the west of Ireland, and under-representation in the city of Dublin.  I stand for parity, equal rights, and equal powers for all Irish men and women, no matter what part of the country they may be living in.</P>

      <P>Even if they are living in Cork.  There is no doubt that this Bill is punishing the citizens of Dublin because they dared vote against Fianna Fáil in the recent referendum and in the Presidential election.  It is bestowing more power on the people of Donegal, Galway and Mayo, who have consistently voted for the Fianna Fáil Party.  We all know that Fianna Fáil would lose at least four or five seats if they did their duty and obeyed the terms of their own Constitution, that is, if they reduced, as they should have, <Col N="1060" /> the number of seats in Donegal, Mayo, Galway and other parts of the western seaboard.</P>
      <P>If you take the whole county of Donegal, you find that one representative represents 17,437 people; if you take West Donegal, you have a representative for 16,700 people; if you take Cork borough, you find a Deputy at the present time representing 22,420 people; if you take the whole of county Cork, you have one Deputy representing 19,800 people. Yet Cork is to lose a seat and Donegal is not to lose a seat, and we wonder why.  The counties of Roscommon, Westmeath and Cavan are to lose a seat and we know that in those counties it is one of the opposition who will lose the seat in each constituency.</P>
      <P>Fianna Fáil now seem to have a fatherly love for rural Ireland.  Senator O'Reilly a few minutes ago criticised those Senators who stated that the Bill was unfair, unjust and unconstitutional he said they were biassed and had a city mentality.  Some of the Fianna Fáil Party have stated that because Ireland is an agricultural country, everything is dependent on rural Ireland.  I should like to bring their minds back to 1947 when the city of Dublin was different from what it is today, when it supported Fianna Fáil.</P>
      <P>According to the 1947 Act in one constituency in the city of Dublin, 21,700 people elected a Deputy; in another, 14,100 people; in another, 20,200 people; in another, 18,300 people; in another, 17,300 people.  In other words, the people who now claim to have such a love for rural Ireland at that time found that between 16,000 and 17,000 people were sufficient to elect a Deputy in the city of Dublin. That was when the tide was in Fianna Fáil's favour here in the city of Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now the tide is going out and in the Dublin constituency where it took 21,700 people to elect a Deputy, it will now take 22,700; where it took 14,100, it will now take 22,600 people; where it took 20,200, it will now take 22,500; where it took 18,300, it will now take almost 22,000; where it took 17,300, it will now take 22,200 people to elect a Deputy.  When the tide was in Fianna Fáil's favour, when the city of Dublin <Col N="1061" /> was consistently voting Fianna Fáil, a Deputy could be elected by between 16,000 and 17,000 votes, but now when the danger is that they will vote against Fianna Fáil, it will take, on average, 22,000 votes to elect a Deputy in the city of Dublin.  I do not think that is correct or right.  The people in the Fianna Fáil Party are not living up to the terms of their own Constitution.</P>
    <P>The western seaboard is to retain the same number of seats, though we all know that the population is dropping and has dropped very much in the past three years.  The Government should look forward.  This Bill is designed to deal with the next 12 years.  We all know that in 12 years' time, if emigration continues from the west as it is proceeding at present, you may have 13,000 or 14,000 people electing a Deputy in the west of Ireland and here in the city where you have a growth of population, 23,000, 24,000 or perhaps 25,000 people electing one representative.</P>
    <P>Although I come from the country myself, I claim that that is unfair. Fianna Fáil know that they would lose if they did their duty and took the seats, as they should have taken them, from the western seaboard.  If the same mathematical calculations were applied to Galway for example as were applied to Cavan, Roscommon and Westmeath, there would be two seats less in Galway, but Fianna Fáil did not do that in case they would lose&mdash;they have six seats at the present time out of nine in county Galway.</P>
    <P>The Preamble to the Constitution begins, &ldquo;In the name of the most Holy Trinity from Whom is all authority...&rdquo; The whole tenor of the Constitution is that it spreads &ldquo;evenly&rdquo;&mdash;I would quote &ldquo;evenly&rdquo;&mdash;among the Irish people the power that comes from God to all people. But this Bill states that the people of Dublin are to have only three-quarters of the power given to the people in the rest of the country.  That is altogether wrong.  As far as our Constitution is concerned, there is no room for bias.  I will not mind if there is a difference of 1,000 or 1,500 in certain cases, but it is different when it <Col N="1062" /> is deliberate as it definitely is in this case.  I claim that it is the duty of this Government or of any other Government according to the terms of their own Constitution to hold the scales as evenly as possible between all sections of the community, irrespective of creed, class or politics, whether they live in the north, south, east or west of the country.</P>
    <P>I further claim that before Parliament can govern properly, we must have a democratically elected Parliament on the basis of universal, equal and direct suffrage.  We have not equal suffrage in this Bill.  We all remember the fanfare of trumpets with which the new Constitution was announced in 1937.  I should like to think that this Bill was another addition to the many Articles of the Constitution to which lip-service is now being paid by Fianna Fáil and by the Fianna Fáil Government.  In this very Bill which we are discussng to-night, however, the high ideals and very basic rights enshrined in the Constitution are being compromised and sacrificed on the altar of expendiency and all for the political gain of one Party. I claim that the rights of our people and the obligations of the Government or of any Government in power in this country are rooted in natural morality and what is morally wrong cannot be politically right.  I stand for democracy and for equal rights and voting powers for all our people and definitely they are not getting these in this Bill.</P>

      <P>There seems to be some lack of geographical knowledge amongst several Senators who seemed to think that they had a point to score in referring to the Donegal mountains.  All I should like to say to those Senators is that I walked those mountains from north to south and from east to west and that both the Taoiseach and the Minister for Local Government are quite correct in describing them as mountain ranges which run from north to south and east to west.  I wish the Senators who seem to lack the knowledge which a physical map of Donegal would have given them would have equipped themselves, before <Col N="1063" /> they took part in the debate, with such a map.  Then they would not have wasted their time in cheap sneers of that nature.</P>
      <P>Several references were made by Senators to the motives which inspired this Bill and suggestions were made that there was something diabolical about the way in which the constituencies which were affected were dealt with.  I do not intend to act the part of a constitutional lawyer or to follow Senator O'Quigley into the by-lanes of constitutional law, nor do I intend to follow the other Senators into every point which they made, but I should like to refresh their minds on the point which I was glad to note Senator Hayes, in his very reasonable approach, emphasised, that this Bill is a matter principally of concern to the Dáil and in the Dáil, the House which is directly affected by it, Senators will find, if they look up the Dáil debates on all Stages of the Bill, that the leading figures did not seem to see in it the same dire conspiracy as some of the Senators alleged here this evening.</P>
      <P>I should like to remind the Senators of what Deputy M.J. O'Higgins, who spoke for the Fine Gael Party in the debate, said at column 385, Volume 177 of the Official Report:</P>
      <P>...this Party recognises the fact that the introduction of this Bill is a constitutional requirement...</P>
      <P>That is completely different from the insinuation that it was introduced in a spirit of spite, malice or revenge for events which might have happened somewhere, some time in the recent past.  Deputy P. O'Donnell, a former Minister for Local Government, whose name we heard mentioned here to-day as having asked for the heads of a Bill when he was in control of the Department of Local Government, answered in advance the insinuations which were made here of gerrymandering. At column 415 of the same volume he said:</P>
      <P>I...agree with him...</P>
      <P>that is, the Taoiseach&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1064" /> that no matter what Minister is in charge of a Bill such as this, he will be accused of political gerrymandering.</P>

      <P>The former leader of the Farmers' Party, Clann na Talmhan, in Dáil Éireann, who comes from the constituency much mentioned here&mdash;county Galway and who is a dyed-in-the-wool opponent of the Government and of the Government Party, had no hesitation whatever in regard to this Bill when at columns 401 and 402, Volume 177, he said:</P>
      <P>I welcome this Bill and I will vote for it as it stands because it gives consideration to rural Ireland.</P>
      <P>Later on, he said that all the members of his group supported the Bill.</P>
      <P>Speaking from the Labour benches, Deputy Corish, at column 429, declared:</P>
      <P>It is only right for me to say at first that in about 80 per cent. or 85 per cent. of this Bill, the Minister did reasonably well.</P>
      <P>Deputy Corish proceeded to make an analysis of the Bill and he did not seem to depart from his original statement that, to his mind anyhow, 80 per cent. or 85 per cent. of the Bill was reasonably satisfactory.</P>
      <P>With regard to the tears which we saw shed over the Independents and the minority who might be penalised, I noted that Deputy Sherwin at column 444 declared:</P>
      <P>Broadly speaking, I have no great complaints to make about this Bill.</P>
      <P>And then, condemning the Senators who spoke here, from the Fine Gael side was their leader, Deputy Dillon, who at column 498 endorsed and approved of the idea of maintaining what he described as a rural bias.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill, as was stated, sticks pretty well to the county boundaries <Col N="1065" /> and involves the fewest possible changes.  It was carefully considered by the Dáil and by all the Parties in the Dáil.  No amendments were moved to it.  There was no division on the Second Stage of the Bill or on the Committee Stage.  There was no division, except on the question of whether Wexford or Cork should have this seat.</P>
    <P>Following the discussions which took place in the period from the Second Stage on 29th October to 19th November, Deputy M.J. O'Higgins summarised in his speech the feelings which actuated him and, I take it, the majority of the Dáil when he said:</P>
    <P>...I feel it right to say, particularly to the Taoiseach, that I feel the Government have certainly gone a distance within the framework of the Bill ... to meet the points of view put forward here.</P>
    <P>That shows that when criticism was made by the Opposition Deputies in the Dáil and when requests were made for consideration of the points, those who made them were quite satisfied that due consideration had been given by the Government to their points of view and expressed themselves as satisfied that the Government had gone a long way to meet their views.  The proof of it is that no serious amendment was put down, either by the Fine Gael Party or the Labour Party, and that the Clann na Talmhan Party accepted, approved and supported the Bill.</P>
    <P>With regard to the penalisation, as it was stated here, of Dublin, Deputy M.J. O'Higgins, speaking on behalf of his Party, at column 407 urged that the two additional seats which were offered by the Taoiseach should be given to Dublin.  After discussion and on the next Stage of the Bill, Dublin was allocated one of the seats and in order to achieve that purpose it was necessary to redraw the constituency. I might mention that that is one constituency which gets an extra seat and which did not, as some of the Senators suggested, prove favourable to the Government point of view in the recent referendum.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1066" /> On that point, by the way, Senator Sheehy Skeffington asked for information as to the difference between the number of votes required in the country and in the city to elect a Deputy.  It took more votes to elect a Deputy in the country at the last election than it did to elect a Deputy in the city.  In fact, in the 1957 general election, taking the Dublin city constituencies, the number of votes per Deputy was 11,795.  The number of voters who voted per Deputy and who elected a Deputy was 7,202, while in the country it took 8,105 voters per Deputy to send a representative to the Dáil.</P>
    <P>I do not think it is necessary to follow the Senators down all the byways of this Bill but I should like, in connection with the figures given here in regard to the voting strength in Dublin, to give the ratio per member as it is now under this Bill.  It does not show such a great discrepancy as has been insinuated here.  In Dublin South (West), there will be 23,128; South (Central), 22,383; South (East), 22,958; Dún Laoghaire, 23,024; Dublin County, 22,366.  That is a fairly even division and a fairly reasonable solution to the problem presented by the decision to give a second seat to Dublin.</P>

      <P>I believe the Bill is a good Bill and that, in the circumstances, it offers the least interference with existing boundaries and causes the least upset consistent with the requirements of the Constitution.  I believe the Dáil showed its wisdom in facilitating its passage in the expeditious manner in which it did. I trust we shall have the same result in the Seanad.</P>

      <P>There are not really very many points of particular note <Col N="1067" /> that I feel called on to reply to.  Might I say at the outset that, in general, I want to reply to insinuations, innuendoes and statements in regard to the question of whether or not these proposals are in conformity with the Constitution.  The Government are satisfied that it conforms with the Constitution. I should not say that all the speakers here did so but all the speakers of a particular view continued to misquote me, as I had been misquoted in the Dáil, in relation to what I had said and how I had mentioned the words &ldquo;rural bias&rdquo;.  Let me, just for the sake of accuracy, quote the two phrases containing those words. First, as I mentioned these words in the Dáil on the Second Reading speech: &ldquo;It is for these reasons that the proposals in the Bill may appear, if viewed in a purely statistical light, to err on the side of leniency so far as rural representation is concerned.&rdquo; That was the text of the actual words I used in the Dáil and from which so much misrepresentation followed thereafter from so many of the Opposition speakers who could find nothing more concrete to talk about than misrepresenting what I actually had said.</P>
      <P>Here, in the Seanad this afternoon, in my Second Reading speech, I said: &ldquo;In the proposals now before the House, it may appear that there is, in a purely mathematical sense, a slight bias in favour of rural constituencies.&rdquo; I have been misquoted, misrepresented and accused by at least five or six Senators here this evening of admitting, or saying or agreeing that in fact a rural bias has been implemented in the terms of this Bill.  I had the same experience in the Dáil last week.  Why it should have been followed up this week, I fail to see, as the records are there in which the actual words can be found.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not think it was but however, the offer was made, As I said, apart from those two points, it does not appear to me that any really important points have been pressed home with any sort of convincing proof that requires much elaboration from me.  However, as I look through my notes at the moment I am just trying to pick out what requires an answer and what there seems to be an answer to.</P>
      <P>The question of mileage which Senator Barry raised was raised in the Dáil in regard to the new Mid-Cork constituency.  Deputy Norton quoted 110 miles as being the greatest distance between the extremities of this new constituency and Senator Barry quoted the same figure to-night.  I have gone to some pains to try to find out exactly where this journey would take us to and where it would begin and I am afraid as yet I have not found&mdash;if we take a reasonably direct route&mdash;a journey that would extend over 110 miles within the boundary of the proposed new constituency.  Lest there be such a journey, let me say that there are five Deputies to represent the constituency&mdash;or there will be if this House passes this measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Earlier to-night, I mentioned my own constituency the mileage of which I know very well&mdash;that is why I used it.  It is a four-seat constituency and some people would have us believe it should be a three-seat constituency. Allowing that there may be a 110 mile journey, there will be five Deputies to look after the mid-Cork constituency, whereas in mine, there are four Deputies to look after a constituency in which there are many journeys up to 88 miles, so we can divide four into 88 and five into 110&mdash; one figure I am sure of and the other I doubt.  Nevertheless, giving everybody full benefit of their own case, I do not think anyone could dispute the fact that the four-seat constituency in East Donegal is no better, no more fully represented or more adequately represented, than the Mid-Cork constituency <Col N="1071" /> will be, if and when this Bill becomes law.</P>
    <P>I may say in regard to that matter that just as happened in the Dáil, those who made the case for Cork&mdash;and I admit that if I represented Cork I would make just as good and possibly a better argument&mdash; pointing out what Cork was not getting, have evidently forgotten that West Cork is still a part of Cork county and that West Cork is dealt with in the same manner, and for the same reasons in a manner exactly similar to all the other western seaboard counties which stretch from West Cork to North Donegal.  No one has raised the argument that West Cork is being left with more than its share of representation.</P>
    <P>A case has been made with regard to the other western counties and it is a significant fact that those making the case for more representation for Mid-Cork should ignore the fact that West Cork was dealt with in a manner consistent with the manner in which the other western seaboard counties have been dealt.</P>

      <P>Possibly that is what the Senator intended, but, listening to the Senator as I say, it struck me as peculiar and significant that the points made by those who made the case the Senator is making should be repeated here and that West Cork should be forgotten and not mentioned at all. Senator O'Donovan said&mdash;I do not know if it is quite fair to the Leas-Chathaoirleach or myself&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>He referred to our putting <Col N="1072" /> all our eggs into one basket so far as the referendum was concerned and said that was the reason for neglecting the preparation of this Bill and because of that neglect the Bill in the form in which it now appears is, to the Senator's mind, anything but good.  At a later stage, he said that the general reasons why we would not amend this Bill were that it was such a bad Bill.  I want to say, as I already said elsewhere, that the Second Reading of this Bill in the Dáil was passed without a division.  When it came to Committee Stage, despite various points made by Deputies from all over the country, including the cities, practically no amendments were even put down to be considered on Committee Stage, apart from the amendments which I had put down in agreement with, and at the request of, the two major Opposition Parties, Fine Gael and Labour.  That is very strange if there was all this antagonism to the Bill and if it was considered so wrong in so many places.  It is either an admission that these people did not really see what was in the Bill at the time&mdash;which I doubt&mdash;or that they really were pretty well satisfied with the Bill, as I think they were, and that that is the real reason why there were no major amendments put down.  The statement made here that the Bill would not be amended because it was so bad and so much out of line cannot be taken in all seriousness.</P>
      <P>There was just one other matter which was mentioned by Senator O'Donovan and I should like to get it straight.  It is being said that the proposals the previous Government, the Coalition Government, had with regard to this matter have been very much altered.  It may surprise some of the Senators to hear me say that in fact I did not see these detailed proposals. I do not say that there were not such proposals in the Custom House, but I did not go looking for proposals that were already half-baked&mdash;and I deliberately say half-baked&mdash;by my predecessors.  I had to take responsibility finally to try to get this matter into this House.</P>

      <P>I just want the matter to be quite clear.  I also want to ask the question how a Senator could have intimate knowledge of these proposals since no such proposals, and no such Bill in final form, had ever gone to the Coalition Government, so far as the records that I have available to me show.  Now, if that is so, I cannot see from what proposals, in the first instance, we could have departed and in the second instance&mdash;allowing that there were such proposals&mdash;I have not seen the proposals, so that if I have departed from them, I have departed from them unwittingly, unknowingly and completely innocently.  I feel that without having seen them that what I now have before the House is as good as, if not better than, whatever purports to be in that draft.  I am saying that without knowing what is in it, if it exists.</P>
      <P>Senator Sheehy Skeffington had something to say about queer shaped constituencies and generally gave me the idea that these queer shapes led one to the rather disagreeable conclusion that there was something of the gerrymander about them.  I do not think it is possible to gerrymander in this country at all.  &ldquo;Gerrymander&rdquo; is a word I do not like, as I do not like anything that savours of gerrymandering. My reasons are that I am in such close contact with the best and most extreme example of gerrymandering&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of explanation, what I meant was that from the look of the new shape of the constituencies, it might appear to be something moving towards gerrymandering and I instanced the case of Ringsend which is now in Central Dublin and used to be on the coast.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Possibly the Senator's reference to this is all to the good in that it should have been put here to bring out this question of queer shapes. If Ringsend is now in Dublin South <Col N="1074" /> (Central), we have to have regard to the general lay-out of the city.  We have got the Liffey dividing the city into north and south, as we know it. It is not stretching the imagination too far to regard that part of it which lies along the river, either north or south, as being central Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OwenSkeffington" hpid="Dr. Sheehy Skeffington Dr. Sheehy Skeffington">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>It used to be in Dublin South (East).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not disputing that.  We come to the point that along the River Liffey towards the sea is central Dublin.  I think that must be admitted.  The next thing that must be clear is that in the South (Central) Constituency, by virtue of a slum clearance operation which has been going on there over the past 12 years, the population figures have fallen very substantially. They have fallen to such a point that if we were to retain the old names of all the constituencies, and I think we had good reason to do that, particularly in Dublin, in order to keep the people's minds clear as to the various constituency names, and maintain the same number of seats, and disturb as few people, or as few Deputies for that matter as possible, it was necessary to make a substantial addition of population to Dublin South (Central).  I could not go out to County Dublin and bring it in.  That would really justify the charge of gerrymandering.  I had to go to wherever was nearest and to whatever part seemed to be most part of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we take Ringsend, which the Senator said was taken from the South (East), I think nobody will disagree with me when I say that the Ringsend portion of Dublin South (East) is certainly more of the character of Dublin South (Central) than it was ever of the South (East) constituency. I put that to the Senator as one of the arguments which I had in mind, and which my advisers had, when we were studying how we could disturb the least possible number of people particularly in relation to the constituencies and the boundaries and, indeed, the number of representatives.  Taking those things as a sort of guiding line, and <Col N="1075" /> seeing that the Liffey divides us north and south, and also seeing that there is a canal which presents us with a very convenient and easily distinguished new boundary, and also taking in the character of Ringsend&mdash;which, as I may say, is much more akin to the character of the remainder of Dublin South (Central) than it ever was to Dublin South (East)&mdash;if it now looks odd in shape, I do not think it is inconvenient nor do I feel that the Government, if the matter is looked into properly, can ever be charged with any attempt at gerrymandering in the slightest degree. I am not putting that to the Senator in any sort of embittered manner. Actually, I am glad that he should have mentioned it in that context lest others outside the House might at a later stage say that it was gerrymandered because of the queer shape. I do not think it is such a queer shape but others may think so.</P>
    <P>There is just one other point which I should have mentioned in regard to the position of Ringsend and that is in regard to the Pigeon House Road. There is an area here which is in the existing South (Central) constituency so that the taking from the South (East) of that further bit of Ringsend is not really so startling a departure from the present position.  As I said, if I were to try to add to the figures for South (Central) not by going to the adjoining areas, but to County Dublin, then if I was charged with gerrymandering, I could not in conscience have any defence.  I feel that the explanation of our approach to this matter will be accepted by this House in all the good faith in which it is given.</P>
    <P>There was also the usual mention of the mountains which will not stay in the one place and keep moving around in Donegal.  I do not want to dwell too much on our very beautiful mountains, which we call hills up there.  One might say that the Senators who do not seem to understand the difficulty of negotiating some of these mountains would tend to make molehills out of our mountains, rather than the reverse.  I would advise them, <Col N="1076" /> as Senator Ó Maoláin has done, to go up there some time.  I would advise them further to be careful to have somebody with them when they go to the most extreme of those mountains, to make sure they get back, because they are not just as easy and as movable as some Senators would lead us to believe.</P>
    <P>There is something else I should like to deal with.  It has already been replied to&mdash;I forget by whom&mdash;but Senator Sheehy Skeffinngton said he did not believe that T.D.s went around their constituencies much except before elections.  I should love to take Senator Sheehy Skeffington with me one weekend in the middle of winter, from now until next March, and I can assure him that unless he is pretty well used to travel and to long hours of waiting around, long discussions and long meetings, he would be very tired after one weekend foray of mine, or of any other Deputy from the country.  It is not really appreciated and understood but our week-ends are, in fact, entirely given over&mdash;and I say this deliberately &mdash;to trying to get to the various points to facilitate people who, due to the distances, may not be able to travel to their T.D.s because of the large sprawling constituencies.  In rural areas, we have to do it.</P>
    <P>In fact, the Deputy who does not do it, unless he is occupying a very peculiar and special position in the people's minds, will not be very long in the Dáil.  That is very true of present-day T.D.s who are new coming into the House.  Such a Deputy will not remain a T.D. unless he gives the people the service they feel they are entitled to get.  Candidly, I feel they are entitled to get that service, and I should like to add my voice to the voices of those who have already spoken covering this point in defence of rural T.D.s.  Their lot is not an easy one.  It is not a question of a few gallons of petrol and driving through their constituencies to get votes at election time.  The people in the country are far too bright to be caught out by a potential candidate whom they see only at election time and who resides outside his constituency, in Dublin or anywhere else.  If we have that type, we shall not have <Col N="1077" /> many of them in future.  People are much too bright for that any more.</P>
    <P>Senator L'Estrange talked at quite some length, and the only thing that clearly emerged to me was that he had mixed up population numbers with voters' numbers and, knowing Senator L'Estrange, I doubt if it was just purely accidental because it did help his argument.  Furthermore, he mixed up something else.  He was relating the figures of population as revealed in the last census in 1956 and referring those to the provisions of an Electoral Bill, passed in 1947.  In other words, he talked about the figures as we know them to-day, or in 1956, and related those figures as brought out in the last census to the number of seats and to the representation which was given by the 1947 Act and which has been in existence since then. Again, without any reflection on Senator L'Estrange, I wonder very much whether that was just an accident, or whether it was to make an argument pretty good.  It does help the argument undoubtedly.</P>

      <P>The Senator is quite right.  I quite agree with him, and that is rather mutual.  As I said at the start, I find it difficult to get anything really worthwhile to get my teeth into, to reply to, apart from the few points on which I have generalised.  With regard to the Bill as received by the House, despite the various points put up by several of the Senators, considering the type of Bill it is and all the difficulties it must give rise to&mdash;indeed, which it is admitted it will give rise to by my opposite number in the Opposition, Deputy O'Donnell&mdash;I feel that the criticisms, the objections, both in this House and in the Dáil, have <Col N="1078" /> been so slight really, when we look at the type of measure it is, as to give me a feeling of satisfaction that it is not so bad at all.</P>

      <P>I certainly shall not be raising anything on the Schedule. The Minister talks about mountains, rivers and canals and, as I mentioned earlier this evening, there is no reference to geographical features of that kind in the Constitution.  It seems to me, from what was said earlier this evening, that the Government in this Bill are seeking to do what they failed to do in the referendum on the Constitution, and I propose to refer to Part 2 of the Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1958, which was passed by the Oireachtas; in particular to sub-section 2 of Section 4 which appears on Page 13 of the Bill.  It states:</P>
      <P>As soon as it may be after the receipt of the request from the President, the Commission&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1079" /> that is, the constituency commission which was to be established if that Bill went through and was passed by the people&mdash;</P>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;shall proceed to determine or to revise the boundaries of the constituencies on a fair and equitable basis, having due regard to geographical features and established administrative and territorial divisions and, subject to those considerations, in such manner that the population of each constituency, as ascertained at the last preceding census, shall, so far as it is practicable, be the same throughout the country.</P>
    <P>Everything the Minister has said this evening in justification of the departure from the provisions of the Constitution as still enacted&mdash;it is still the Constitution of this country&mdash; is reproductive of what the people rejected in the referendum.  That is what the Minister is trying to bring in here.  These are the provisions which the people objected to.  He is trying to use them as justification for a departure from the strict provisions of the Constitution&mdash;which has nothing whatever to say about geographical features.  In this way the Government are trying to circumvent the will of the people so clearly expressed only a few months ago.  I should like to hear what the Minister has to say.  I think he must have been reading out of the wrong Constitution.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>

      <P>I do not propose to carry any further the proposals I sought for the city of Dublin.  I saw them all right.  The Minister indicated how he did not see them.  It is easy enough to read between the lines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In view of the considerable emphasis the Minister and, later, the <Col N="1080" /> Leader of the House, Senator Ó Maoláin, laid on the hills of Donegal, I should like to read something in respect of the Donegal constituencies. There is no difficulty in having two or three-seat constituencies in county Donegal.</P>
    <P>In reply to the debate on the Fifth Stage in the Dáil, Volume 178, column 230, the Minister said:</P>
    <P>In going through some of them...</P>
    <P>that is, the arguments.</P>
    <P>...one thing that keeps recurring &mdash;although I notice that Deputy McGilligan who first raised the hare later kept away from it&mdash;is the reference to how the mountains run in my county.  Very astutely Deputy McGilligan kept away from that subject.  Deputies may have recourse to this map when the proceedings here are finished.  There is no conflict whatever between the Taoiseach's statement that the mountains run North to South and my statement at a later stage that mountains run East to West and that this had a very big bearing on the actual boundaries of the constituency.</P>
    <P>Of course if the mountains run from east to west, obviously North Donegal must be separated from South Donegal and existing Deputies have to cross these mountain passes.  But Deputy McGilligan did not keep away from the subject.  In fact he dilated on it at some considerable length.  The Minister's point was not correct because Deputy McGilligan said at column 188:</P>
    <P>Donegal was taken as the pivotal constituency and we are told that there is appalling difficulty up there from the point of view of Deputies getting in touch with their constituents or constituents getting in touch with Deputies.  This we are told is caused by a tremendous mountain range in that area, a range which according to the Taoiseach divides the East from the West with only four passes by which people can travel from one part to another. One immediately gets the picture of the Himalayas or some such range. One gets the view of the officials of the Department of Local Government setting out with provisions to <Col N="1081" /> last them for a fortnight or so and getting the native Sherpas up in the area to guide them through the four passes which alone allow for communication over this mountain range which splits Donegal, according to the Taoiseach, from East to West.</P>
    <P>At a later stage, of course, the Minister told us that this range of mountains practically divides the northern half of the country from the southern half.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann regrets the recent refusal of Ministers to attend debates in the Seanad and disagrees with the view of the Government as expressed by the Leader of the House on the 5th August, 1959 (Seanad Debates&mdash;Vol. 51, No. 10, Cols. 842/3).</P>
      <P>The purpose of this motion is not political or personal.  It is rather for the purpose of clarifying a situation that has arisen and it is intended to get a principle and a practice accepted so that in future here in this House we might avoid bickering across the House as to what is or what is not to be discussed.  May I say at the outset that I am very glad to see the Taoiseach here and to hear what he has to say on the matter?  I have no desire to line Senators up on this matter.  I feel that the result of this debate, what the Taoiseach has to say and what we may agree on will affect this Seanad and future Seanaid.  I hope it will be for the better.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The present position of this House is that we have a written constitution. We have Rules and Standing Orders, but it should be made clear that that is not sufficient to enable this House or any Parliament to work. Everything is not foreseeable.  In effect, this House works on practices, <Col N="1083" /> customs and established precedents. It is not always easy to see what the things you write really mean.  It is only in the recent discussions on the Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill that I myself realised the precise implications of the provision in the Constitution of 1922&mdash;it is still there and I approve of it&mdash;that the Ministers have a right to attend and be heard in both Houses.</P>
    <P>If you interpret this with regard to the rights of Ministers, you could have as many as 14 Ministerial speeches on the one Bill which, as Euclid said, is absurd.  No Government would try to do it.  That illustrates that you have to establish a practice and a practice has been established with regard to Ministerial intervention in this House.  It has been the practice, since the House started, for Ministers to come into the House with Bills.  The only thing that is wrong with that, perhaps, from the point of view of a person who has sat on Government benches in the House is that it is not good for the Government Party because it gives them in every case a Minister to argue on their side.</P>
    <P>I know that the Constitution provides that the Government are responsible to the Dáil but I never suggested &mdash;and I do not think anybody would suggest&mdash;that the Government could be put out of office by a vote in this House or that, indeed, a Government is bound even to take account of a vote in this House except in the case where we do something with the Bill and the Bill becomes subject to the provisions of the Constitution.  The complete falacy, however, in what was said by Senator Ó Maoláin on 5th August, is that because you cannot put Ministers out of office, you cannot ask them questions or cannot criticise them or discuss their administration.</P>
    <P>That certainly is not so.  The Seanad is an integral part of the Oireachtas.  We have limited powers and when a Bill comes here, it may be defeated or amended but it can always be passed over our heads.  I should like to recall that the practice <Col N="1084" /> here has always been that a Bill brought here is explained in detail, as, indeed, was a Bill this very afternoon in this House.  That applies to Money Bills, Finance Bills and Appropriation Bills.</P>
    <P>When the Minister for Finance comes in here, he explains in detail everything that is necessary to be explained with regard to finance.  All the Minister for Finance I have heard here have answered in detail any questions asked.  There was an occasion here, I think, when a Minister endeavoured to argue that he was not obliged to explain the financial provisions of a Bill.  I think that before the end of the debate he succeeded in mending his hand on that particular matter.  Ministers, therefore, attend on every kind of a Bill and give every possible kind of information.</P>
    <P>I come now to the question of administration which is specifically mentioned by Senator Ó Maoláin. Perhaps, I should read what he said. This was on 5th August in an Adjournment debate on the circulation of a pamphlet with regard to Ireland's rôle in the United Nations. Senator Ó Maoláin on 5th August, 1959, Volume 51, Number 10, Column 842, is reported as saying:</P>
    <P>The view of the Government regarding the practice which has recently developed in the Seanad, of moving motions of this character on the adjournment, is that it is an attempt to devise a new procedure by which Ministers would be made accountable to the Seanad for their administration.  The constitutional position is that Ministers are responsible to the Dáil only&mdash;members of the Dáil, of course, being elected directly by the people.  Ministers are not responsible to the Seanad.</P>
    <P>That, I think, is a misunderstanding of the position.  The fact that Ministers are not responsible to the Seanad merely means that a vote of the Seanad, unlike a vote of the Dáil, does not put them out of office.  In the Dáil, if the Taoiseach fails to retain the support of the majority, he goes out of office.  That does not apply here.  But that does not imply that the Taoiseach or Ministers cannot be <Col N="1085" /> questioned or that even Government administration cannot be discussed.</P>
    <P>The Appropriation Bill contains the salaries or part of the salary of every Minister.  It raises questions of administration. Various efforts have been made here&mdash;not all of them successful, indeed&mdash;to arrange that different Ministers will be present to hear different administrations discussed and to imitate, therefore, the kind of thing you have in the Dáil on the Estimates. That has not been very satisfactory, but the right to discuss administration is there.</P>
    <P>The Seanad may annual a statutory instrument and to-day and every day on the Seanad Order Paper, when we meet, there is a list of papers laid on the Table.  The normal thing for Bills is that Orders made by the Government&mdash;and, after all, that is administration&mdash;may be annulled by either House.  Senators will recollect that the Government used the Seanad to annul the Solicitors (Remuneration) General Order, 1957, because the time limit was expiring and the Dáil was not sitting. It is quite clear, therefore, that the Seanad may discuss administration.</P>
    <P>Perhaps I may be allowed to define in a rough way what I regard as administration. It is a Minister's exercise of his powers under statute or the way he exercises or fails to exercise them in a particular case.  It follows, therefore, that when that kind of thing is discussed in the Seanad, Ministers should normally attend.  I have gone to the trouble of finding out, for a period, how many questions were raised on the Adjournment.  There were, I think, just 30 in a period of 20 years&mdash;from 1938 to 1959&mdash;which is pretty significant. Some of the matters raised were of great importance and some of minor importance but all of them were questions of administration&mdash;the admission of aliens; air-raid precautions; export of seed potatoes; paraffin supplies for rural areas&mdash;that was during the war &mdash;the depression in the cattle industry; an Ennis company's affairs; transport of turf; price of bread; delay with proposals for the Agricultural Institute; the suspension of Post Office parcel service: that surely is administration. There was a general discussion, at my own instance, which lasted over five <Col N="1086" /> hours on a motion on the Adjournment on 4th October, 1939, with the then Taoiseach present.</P>
    <P>In all, there are only 30 instances in 20 years, that is, three cases on the Adjournment in every two years.  That is not excessive.  I think also that the Leader of the House when he was making his statement did not like what was being discussed but you cannot take that as a criterion.  The fundamental thing in parliamentary government is that you have to listen to the other fellow saying something you do not like.  We all experience that from time to time.  Unless one has the patience to do that, one will become irritated.  A Minister who has not the patience to do that will, I am afraid, be in a very bad way in a very short time, no matter what Government he may belong to.</P>
    <P>We make no claim to make Ministers accountable to the Seanad as they are to the Dáil.  We do not advocate a new procedure.  I have shown that there are examples from 1922 to 1938 and there are 20 examples between 1938 and 1959.  One may ask: &ldquo;Why do people not put down motions instead of raising matters on the Adjournment?&rdquo;  I have not raised anything on the Adjournment since 1939. I cannot be accused of being very strong on Adjournment proceedings. However, there is no machinery in this House for asking Questions, as there is in the Dáil.  Personally, I think it would be quite impracticable.  I would not advocate it.  When it was talked about some years ago, I was opposed to it.  I think it is a burden that should not be placed on Ministers and I think it would not work.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, the Question on the Adjournment is much simpler than a motion.  It does not lead to a division.  Very often, it leads to an immediate discussion.  It has the merit of dealing with a specific point since it should not normally be a matter of first-class importance.  You may say to me, then: &ldquo;It should not be abused.&rdquo;  I agree.  Nothing should be abused.  However, the right to follow a particular procedure should not be removed or diluted simply because some people at particular times endeavour to abuse it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1087" /> I do not claim that a Minister should come to the Seanad at the time the Seanad wants him or that he should always come when he is asked.  I feel Senators should adopt a reasonable attitude in that respect. For instance, I have myself always, when sitting here in the Opposition, adopted a reasonable attitude.  When I was on the other side of the House and endeavouring to get Ministers to come here and transact business, I found that my opponents were reasonable with regard to the attendance of Ministers.  The other House has a prior claim upon Ministers' time.  If a Minister is to come, we can expect to have him only at the moment when he can reasonably come.  Whether I was out of office or in office, I always found it worked smoothly.  I have found it worked smoothly with different people opposed to me, no matter who was leading the other Party.</P>
    <P>It is unwise for Ministers to refuse to come here for motions they dislike because that is not the criterion at all. I think, also, that the more that is done to keep up the reputation and procedure of this House, the better for the Parliament generally&mdash;the better for the Dáil, for the Government, for the State and for the whole lot of us&mdash;because one of the things you have to combat in every other country as in this country is the notion that politicians and politics generally are not for decent people.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to deal with the amendment in the name of Senator Sheehy Skeffington.  The amendment gives Senator Sheehy Skeffington the satisfaction of being against all comers.  I am prepared to leave him in the comfort of that position without knowing what precisely he intends to say.  I am prepared to make a confession. While I was Leader of the House, on one occasion, I advised the then Taoiseach not to attend for a motion set down by Senator Sheehy Skeffington for which there was no seconder and which dealt with illegal military organisations.  I gave that advice because I think just a fortnight earlier the then Taoiseach had made a long statement in the Dáil which had <Col N="1088" /> met with the approval of the Leader of the Opposition in the Dáil and I felt there was no necessity for him to come here.  I said so and in the result, no seconder was found for the motion and a Senator on the Opposition side, Senator Ted O'Sullivan, simply said they were not seconding the motion but they stood by what had been said by the Leader of the Opposition, Mr. de Valera.  On another occasion, purely on a matter of physical disability, I advised the Minister for Education, General Mulcahy, who had been in the Dáil from 10.30 a.m. until 4.30 p.m., not to come here.  He did not take my advice.  He insisted upon coming and he made a statement. Those are the only cases I can remember.</P>
    <P>Before I conclude, there is one more thing I should like to say.  I am not sure whether or not it is really germane to the motion because we are talking about the rights of the Seanad and how Ministers ought to treat us. I suggested here before to the Minister for Finance that more use could properly be made of the Seanad.  I should like to put that case to the Taoiseach also.  More Bills, except Money Bills, should be introduced in this House.  For example, one of the Bills we have here on the Order Paper, the Apprenticeship Bill, could very easily have been introduced here and that would have given certain relief to the Dáil.  As we know, the Dáil is cluttered up with much business for two reasons.  One is that the financial year runs from April to April instead of from January to December and the other is that the Estimates are discussed in detail in the Dáil.  For that reason, just after April, they have to deal with the Budget and the Estimates and whatever Bills they have to transact.  That gives them an immense volume of legislation and financial business.</P>
    <P>What happens to us?  In July or the beginning of August this year, we got several Bills from the Dáil.  The Dáil had risen and we had to pass them, whether we liked or not. I am not blaming the Taoiseach: I make him a present of this: I think no Government is worse than another but I would not say that no <Col N="1089" /> Government is better than another. They are all pretty bad in that respect.  We had to pass Bills this year which involved nearly £20,000,000.  I suggest that if Bills were introduced in the Seanad, it would help to remedy that situation and give us more work beginning in October or November, and it would not in any way take from the powers of the Dáil.  Under the Constitution, when a Bill goes to the Dáil and is amended in any particular, and is sent back to us, the 90 days begin to run from the day we get it from the Dáil.</P>

At the end of every year, in the month of July, Ministers are weary, the Dáil is weary, but the Seanad is not weary because very often we have had very little to do.  We are doing something at a time when we do not really want to do it.</P>
      <P>I do not want the matter of this motion referred to any committee to make regulations about it; I am afraid I do not believe in regulations. Perhaps, in my circumstances, that is a curious thing to say but I hardly believe in Standing Orders.  The only Standing Order I knew well in the Dáil was the one that said that the Ceann Comhairle was the sole judge of order.  It was a good one to quote and it filled the bill on most occasions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The working of this Parliamentary institution, or any Parliamentary institution, does not depend on written rules but on co-operation, goodwill, and common sense.  Since I became a member of this House, I am prepared to say that I have found in abundance these qualities shown here, whether I was sitting in this seat or in the seat occupied by Senator Ó Maoláin.  That state of affairs depends on different Governments and different sets of Ministers and however we differ on <Col N="1090" /> policies, or principles, or legislation, we have rarely quarrelled about the conduct of the business of the House or Ministerial behaviour.  There may have been an odd flare-up but they were very rare when you consider the period of time involved.</P>
    <P>I do not want to have any quarrel about the conduct of the business now. I do not want to assert any new rights but I object to the notion that rights already firmly established should be abandoned and I think that should be the attitude of every Senator.  I think the Taoiseach will approve of that, that the policy that has been adopted heretofore with regard to Ministers' attendance in the House should be continued.  Anyone who gives any thought to our present position, or the future development of this Parliament, and its value to this country should agree with that.  I put down this motion to clarify and confirm that situation and I hope the House will agree and that the Taoiseach will find himself, in the main, in agreement with what I have said.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardMcGuire" hpid="Mr. McGuire Mr. McGuire">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGuire</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the motion. I should like, first of all, to welcome the former Minister for Industry and Commerce in his new capacity as Taoiseach tonight.  It is, in some ways, appropriate that he should appear in this House for the first time as Taoiseach on such a motion as this when, as Taoiseach, he has now got the tools and machinery of government in his hands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Seanad is an integral part of the machinery of government.  This motion has been put down because many Senators feel that in the past the machinery of the Seanad very often was not understood, and not being understood, has not been fully or properly utilised in smoothing and making government efficient.  Therefore, I think the very fact that this motion has had to be put down arising out of the incident which gave rise to it was due very largely, I believe, to a lack of appreciation of the functions and machinery of the Seanad.  I would also say that view was caused in some way by things that have happened in our historical past, such as the abolition of the Seanad.  Doubts about the Seanad <Col N="1091" /> really spring from that occasion when Mr. de Valera, according to his own lights at that time, abolished the Seanad and then re-established it.</P>
    <P>It is very often forgotten that the Seanad is enshrined in the Constitution, but it has been said that we are not as democratically elected as the Dáil and therefore are not as important as the Dáil.  It is quite false to say that.  The fact that the election of the Seanad is a secondary one, if you like, because the Seanad is elected by county councils, does not mean that the Seanad is less democratic than if directly elected by the people because of the fact that we are elected under the Constitution, and if elected under the Constitution, we are just as democratically constituted and therefore just as democratically elected as the Dáil.  Quite a number of people in the Dáil seem to labour under the delusion that they are more democratically elected than the Seanad. Under the Constitution, all legislation is referred to as &ldquo;passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas&rdquo;, and no Bill is legal, unless it comes from the Seanad.  The Seanad is part and parcel of our legislature and machinery for the enactment of legislation.</P>
    <P>Many Senators were disturbed by the refusal of the Minister to attend on the specific occasion referred to in the motion and, I would say, on previous occasions.  It is important that this matter we are discussing should not be discussed in any acrimonious way.  Senator Hayes has introduced his motion in a manner I should like to support.  We simply appeal to the Taoiseach to make a guiding statement here tonight which will put us on an even keel in the future.  Let us show that we are acting together in a dignified and just way.  As Senator Hayes says, we often have to listen to things we do not like but we do stay here and it is no harm that the Government should stay and listen to us.  We may be wrong in criticising them but, nevertheless, that is democratic government.  Oppositions are there to criticise and the Government should be able to take what is coming to them and give their answer.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1092" /> Surely there is nothing a Government will do which they are not fit to stand over and answer for.  It is a very poor state of affairs in any form of committee that a person should not be able to face the committee and hear criticisms and answer them.  Anybody who takes such an attitude is obviously unfit to be in a senior position in any organisation, not to say in the Government. Therefore, we were all shocked on this particular occasion when not alone did the Minister not come to the House but the whole Government Party left the House.  If Ministers ignore and abuse the machinery of legislation and government, they obviously blunt the machinery and damage it.  If I may use a metaphor, a good artist keeps his tools in perfect condition and uses each instrument with care and discrimination and in full to the production of a work of art.  Government is an art but the fact is that it is does not seem to be appreciated by some people in this country, and in other countries for that matter, who are actively and even prominently engaged in it.</P>
    <P>I might say that I do not confine that to any one Government.  In some ways on this motion we should like to speak in generalities as well as on the particular case which gave rise to it.  There is sometimes a tendency to operate with the minimum and the bluntest of instruments and the result very often is that we get arbitrary decisions and arbitrary legislation instead of legislation that has been carefully conceived after careful consultation with everybody concerned, after full debate and, I might say, after full use of the machinery available.</P>
    <P>There is another point which I want to refer to, incidentally.  Very often this House is completely ignored on the question of amendments. Sometimes we get rushed legislation here and sometimes even when it is not rushed, there is an unwillingness to accept our help.  Our proposals and suggestions are very seldom translated into accepted amendments.  I think that is due to the fact that very often Ministers come in here and regard the Seanad <Col N="1093" /> as being merely a stamp that must be put on the documents as quickly and with as little trouble as possible.  Our advice, and even the advice of outside experts&mdash;and we are experts in some ways, in certain things&mdash;is, as I say, not taken; but outside our ranks, in the outer community, more could be done by way of consultation with people who are not in the ranks of the officials around the Minister. Incidentally, I should like to refer in a complimentary manner to the fact that last week we had a Bill here&mdash; and another one today&mdash;which was the result of consultation with people outside the ranks of the officials and a very successful piece of legislation it was.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardMcGuire" hpid="Mr. McGuire Mr. McGuire">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGuire</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I can say that there is some strange reluctance to use our institutions and the full machinery of the Government, and at times there is a veritable jealousy and rivalry to be seen between the Dáil and the Seanad.  I do not say that that is in the top ranks but certain members of the Dáil have been known to refer to the &ldquo;unnecessariness&rdquo;&mdash;if I might use the word&mdash;of the Seanad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Hayes has already referred to the manner in which the Seanad could be used in regard to legislation and I shall not say anything about that.  I had intended to refer to it but it is probably outside the scope of the motion.  However, it has been brought in.  It is no wonder then, in view of past history, and of the rather cursory way the House is being treated, that very often it is thought outside that there is no need for the Seanad, that it is rather useless and could very well be done away with. I have already answered that point, that it was abolished and it was found that it could not be done without and was re-established and enshrined in the Constitution.  The Seanad having been re-established and enshrined in the Constitution, I would appeal to the Taoiseach to ensure that in future <Col N="1094" /> this Chamber is properly and fully used, properly recognised and properly honoured as such, because otherwise, there will be created a general feeling amongst the public that political institutions and politicians are to be rather despised.  We cannot expect to be respected outside if we do not have respect as between one House and another.  People take you at your own valuation and certainly it is not a good evaluation of the Seanad if Ministers refuse to come here and the Government Party walk out and leave the Opposition in possession.  I do not want to say anything more on that point.</P>
    <P>I am glad that Senator Hayes put down this motion.  It has not been put down in any carping manner and he did not wish to have any controversial debate on it.  Having got what we said out of our systems, if the Taoiseach, having done us the honour of coming here, could deal with the motion in a sympathetic and conciliatory manner, we should all be happy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OwenSkeffington" hpid="Dr. Sheehy Skeffington Dr. Sheehy Skeffington">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to move an amendment to this motion. If my amendment were accepted, the motion would read&mdash;&ldquo;That Seanad Éireann regrets the refusal of Ministers of both the present and the previous Governments to attend debates in the Seanad and disagrees with the view of the Government as expressed by the Leader of the House on the 5th August, 1959.&rdquo;  As is obvious, the purpose of my amendment is to make it clear that this is not a Party attitude only but that we as a House deplore the failure of Ministers to attend in these circumstances, whether members of this Government or a previous Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am a little disappointed therefore that Senator Hayes did not accept my amendment, particularly as it has been stressed both by Senator Hayes and by Senator McGuire that this should not be a Party issue.  I feel that acceptance of my amendment raises it above a Party issue in making it a point of general principle that we as a House desire, not we as members of one Party or another Party.  I should like to say at the outset that I agree with Senator <Col N="1095" /> Hayes that the presence of the Taoiseach is a symbol of the very kind of thing that the framers of this motion, myself and other Senators, desire.  I am glad that he does us the compliment of being here, and I feel that had he deputed one of his ministerial colleagues to come before us, we would necessarily have been quite satisfied but he does us the compliment of being present himself, and we all welcome that and regard it as a symbol that he takes seriously the principle which we are trying to have recognised. Senator Hayes makes it seem as if I have been extremely unlucky, because I was the person involved on both the occasions, apparently the only occasions in his whole life since Senator Hayes has been in the House, when he himself advised a Minister not to be present.  I do not know what I owe this ill-fortune to, but apparently I was more unlucky than anybody else has been in relation to Senator Hayes in this connection.  I think he ought to have been a little bit ashamed in proposing this motion, and then having to admit that on two separate occasions he advised a Minister to stay away from this House&mdash;on one occasions simply because he felt the Minister had dealt with the problem fully in the other House, and on the other occasion because he felt that the Minister was very tired.</P>
    <P>I feel that Senator Hayes would have risen to greater heights by accepting my amendment and saying that this must apply to the present Government, to future Governments, and to the previous Government.  I should like to quote from our Standing Orders, Standing Order No. 24, on page 19, which states:</P>
    <P>On the motion for the adjournment of the Seanad, any Senator may bring forward for discussion a matter of which he has given notice in writing to the Cathaoirleach before the opening of that day's sitting, and which has been approved by the Cathaoirleach as suitable for discussion on the motion for the adjournment.</P>
    <P>We may assume, therefore, in so far as we are talking now about matters raised on the Adjournment, that these <Col N="1096" /> matters when they are debated have been deemed to be in order by the Cathaoirleach.  That seems to me to be final and I think it shows contempt for the House for a Minister or Senator to suggest that though the Cathaoirleach considers a thing in order, the Leader of the House does not, and the Leader of the House is going to behave in such a way, and encourages others to behave in such a way as to suggest it was not in order.</P>
    <P>Nothing can come before the House until it has the approval of the Cathaoirleach.  There have been occasions when some of us tried to raise matters that did not get that approval. I suggest, however, that when a subject gets the approval of the Cathaoirleach, it is the duty as far as is humanly possible, of some Minister to appear before the House, to listen to the case and make some reply&mdash;not necessarily the Minister immediately involved, because he may have other more urgent business, but I do feel that in that case he should depute another Minister to be present for him, if the Cathaoirleach considers that the matter is in order.</P>
    <P>I refer now to Rulings and Precedents governing this House and on page 2 I find this reference in relation to matters brought forward for discussion on the Adjournment:</P>
    <P>Matter generally is confined to the Senator who raises it and the Minister, if he is present&mdash;</P>
    <P>there is a suggestion that he may not be</P>
    <P>&mdash;is entitled to reply and Minister must be allowed a sufficient opportunity to reply, and the usual practice is that ten minutes or more, if possible, is given to him.</P>
    <P>The next paragraph states:&mdash;</P>
    <P>When Minister has spoken Senator has not the right to reply to him, but he can put a question in order to get further information provided that his intervention is not by way of a speech.  By agreement of House, half-hour permitted may be extended if it is not unduly so and the Minister is given adequate time to reply.</P>
    <P>There is no ruling which says that the Minister must be present.  In <Col N="1097" /> fact, it foresees the case when he may not be present, but it lays down the practice, customs and precedents which are to be recognised when the Minister is present, which it would appear to accept as general practice. It lays down the practice if the Minister is present, regarding subsequent questions and so on, which quite clearly cannot be applied if he is not present.</P>
    <P>I should like to quote a precedent also in relation to motions, because I think, in one of the cases in which the present Government were involved, it was a motion on which the Minister preferred not to be present. This ruling is on page 47 and states:</P>
    <P>Motion standing in name of Senator which has reference to a matter coming within the responsibility of a Minister should not be made in the absence of the Minister concerned or his Parliamentary Secretary.</P>
    <P>I think that is rather interesting.  That would mean we would have to hold over, until the Minister or Parliamentary Secretary were available, a motion on a matter with which a Minister was concerned.  That means, of course, a general motion, not just the raising of a matter on the Adjournment.  Again, the implication is that the Minister is expected to be present, and surely that is the point of this motion to-night and of my amendment, to have that principle recognised?  I shall not say established. I think Senator Hayes is quite right to say &ldquo;have it recognised&rdquo;, to have what is already established recognised.</P>
    <P>Senator Hayes mentioned the question of raising a matter on the Adjournment and raising a matter by way of motion.  There is, of course, one major difference, that is, if a Senator gives notice before the Seanad assembles, before three o'clock on the afternoon of that day, of his intention to raise a matter on the Adjournment, and if he receives the approval of the Cathaoirleach, that matter will be dealt with that day.  That is a most important fact.  That would vary with different incidents, with different questions, but it may be of extreme importance that <Col N="1098" /> a matter be dealt with that very day or, at any rate, with great expediency. It may happen that motions may remain on the Order Paper for six months or a year.  That is a major difference.  If a Senator wants to have a full discussion on it, wants a general debate, he must put down a motion. But if it is of sufficient urgency, it has to come up by way of motion on the Adjournment, because that is the only way the House has of discussing something rapidly with a Minister, his Parliamentary Secretary, or a Ministerial colleague present to reply.</P>
    <P>I believe I have had, as has been slightly coyly intimated by Senator Hayes, a fairly wide experience of the non-appearance of Ministers in this House when I have tried to raise some matter or another, sometimes by way of motion and sometimes by raising it on the Adjournment.  My first experience of it was on 15th December, 1955, the incident to which Senator Hayes referred, the occasion upon which I put down a motion in relation to the organisation of private armies, and the failure of the Government to take any effective steps to stop them.</P>
    <P>Senator Hayes has said the Taoiseach had made a statement about it a fortnight before, but I should like to tell the House that I requested the permission of the Cathaoirleach, the late Senator Baxter, to be allowed to raise this matter on the Adjournment on the very day the Taoiseach was talking in the Dáil.  My reason for doing that was that I felt this was a matter of extreme urgency, that the Taoiseach was making a statement on it in the Dáil, and it should also be discussed in the Seanad.  One of the things the Taoiseach then appealed for was the vocal support of all T.D.s and Senators, and it seemed to me to be very important, and in line with his desire, that we should discuss it immediately, and have a debate on it in the Seanad as well as in the Dáil.  I do not see why the Seanad should be entirely kept out of discussing such an important matter.  In the event, in the Dáil only the leaders of the various Parties were allowed to speak.  There was at least that measure of discussion but the plans of the Government of that day included no provision at all <Col N="1099" /> for any debate on the subject in the Seanad.</P>
    <P>When I asked to have this raised on the adjournment, the Cathaoirleach said to me: &ldquo;You may raise it.  I shall not prevent you but the Taoiseach will probably not be making his statement in the Dáil until evening.  That would be 6 o'clock or 7 o'clock.  Do you think it is fair to bring him straight from the Dáil up here and ask him to address the Seanad? Would it not be better to put down a motion?&rdquo;  I replied: &ldquo;Yes; I think it would be better, because it would give more Senators a chance to show that something should be done.&rdquo;&ldquo;But,&rdquo; as I said, &ldquo;a motion has a major disadvantage: it may hang fire for weeks or for months.&rdquo; The then Cathaoirleach said: &ldquo;If I guarantee that you will be given an opportunity at an early date to put this motion, will you agree not to press your right to raise it on the Adjournment to-night?&rdquo;  I said: &ldquo;Yes, certainly.&rdquo;  It was in those conditions that this was a motion, and put a fortnight later, rather than being raised immediately on the Adjournment.</P>
    <P>When this motion came to the House&mdash;and I refer here to Volume 45, column 983, Senator Hayes, the then leader of the House, had the good grace to say:</P>
    <P>May I be allowed to apologise to the House in this way?</P>
    <P>I felt that he should.</P>
    <P>No Minister will be present for this motion.  I do not know if the motion has a seconder.  I should like to say that no disrespect to the House, or indeed, to Senator Sheehy Skeffington, is intended.  The Taoiseach made a comprehensive statement about this matter on the 30th ult.  He dealt with the whole question and it is the considered view of the Government that no further discussion or statement at this stage would serve any useful purpose. Therefore no Minister will be in attendance.</P>
    <P>I have quoted that passage to show <Col N="1100" /> you what seems to me a wrong Governmental attitude.  They do not think a debate in the House would &ldquo;serve any useful purpose&rdquo;.  They feel that the Seanad giving of its views to the public would not be of any avail, of any use, and therefore the Government will not attend.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>

      <P>Senator Hayes has now said that it was on his advice that no Minister could attend because it would serve no useful purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">

      <P>Nevertheless, in his Dáil statement, the Taoiseach said, Volume 153, No. 9, of the Official Report of Dáil Éireann, column 1345:</P>
      <P>A grave responsibility rests on all of us in this matter.  It rests with special weight on Deputies of all Parties, on Senators, on members of local authorities.</P>
      <P>He went on to appeal to them to make their views known.  Apparently we were to make our views known in back kitchens, or somewhere similar, but not in the Seanad.  As Senator Hayes says, to the eternal shame of the Seanad, the Seanad was prepared on that occasion to be completely muzzled.  I do not want to dwell on that particular incident.  I think it was a mistake, however, and that the attitude of the Government then was a mistaken one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second occasion on which I ran into this ministerial absence was on 19th April, 1956.  That was when I put down a motion asking for Department of Education regulations <Col N="1101" /> to be modified in such a way as to prohibit corporal punishment for girls. I had originally raised the general question on the Adjournment in June, 1955&mdash;the Minister for Education had been present.  He then listened to what I had to say and replied.  On the occasion of my raising it on the Adjournment, it was put very strongly by another Senator, an ex national school teacher, that I should have had the courtesy to put down a motion and raise it when everyone could speak.  I did so, though I realised that time would drag on.  I put down the motion in December, 1955, and it made a timid first appearance in February, 1956.  I say a timid appearance because only three-quarters of an hour of time for debate was available on that occasion.  But, and this is the point; this is what makes it particularly relevant today: the Minister for Education, General Mulcahy, was ill at the time and he sent a colleague to replace him.  The then Minister for Health, Deputy O'Higgins, came here to listen.  The motion was not in fact finished that evening, but I suggest that in sending a colleague, the Minister was recognising a principle, and that his colleague by coming was recognising a principle, the same principle that we are asking to have recognised to-day, a good principle.</P>
    <P>It was not until April that this motion was resumed.  It was put down in December, started in February and finally disposed of in April.  In April, when it did actually come up, the Minister for Education did appear some time after I had started speaking. Before I had concluded a plea was made on his behalf that he should be allowed to speak in the middle of my speech and go home.  I naturally did not want to inflict any corporal suffering upon him.  It had been mentioned that he had been tired.  So I agreed and let him in.  He made his speech and went away.  His justification was&mdash; Volume 45, Column 1939:</P>
    <P>I will not take part in turning either the Seanad or the Dáil into a district court.  I am prepared to read most carefully any debate which takes place on the subject here in the Seanad.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1102" /> But he was not going to stay.  I appealed to him to stay and reply, but he felt that there was no onus upon him to stay.  I continued my speech, We went away at 6 o'clock.  We reassembled at 7 o'clock.  Not alone was he not there, but there was no representative there, and I carried on in their absence.  Reference was made to a walkout of Government Senators on a recent occasion.  That particular occasion was the only occasion on which I saw no members at all of the then Opposition, who are now the Government, no member of the Fianna Fáil Party at all in the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>What occasion was that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OwenSkeffington" hpid="Dr. Sheehy Skeffington Dr. Sheehy Skeffington">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>That was the motion on the beating of small girls.  No Fianna Fáil Senators were present for the motion debate; none was present when the vote was taken. It was a silent walkout, or complete absence of the whole Party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that is quite so.  There were members of the Party here.  Senator Ó Cíosáin was there after tea when the debate was resumed and some others.  They are not obliged to stay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OwenSkeffington" hpid="Dr. Sheehy Skeffington Dr. Sheehy Skeffington">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quite emphatic that no Fianna Fáil member was here.  I was over there on those benches and the benches around me were completely empty.  It was a walkout, a less spectacular one, but none the less complete.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The third occasion I came across this was when I asked for the right on 5th June, 1957, to raise the matter of he primary school in Fethard-on-Sea which had no teacher by reason of a local boycott.  I wanted to ask the Minister for Education what he was doing, what alternative transport he was providing, what steps he was taking in regard to a situation in which 13 schoolchildren were not getting any schooling at all, although they were still subject to the provisions of the School Attendance Act.  I was officially informed at lunch time on that date, when the matter was agreed as a proper one for raising, that the Minister would be present, but when the <Col N="1103" /> time came and I got up&mdash;I forget the time, at 7, or 6, or 5&mdash;it must have been after 7 o'clock, I suppose&mdash;suddenly we were told: &ldquo;The Minister will not be here.&rdquo;  It was Senator Ó Cíosáin, I think, who spoke.  No Minister, neither the Minister for Education nor one of his colleagues, appeared.  I felt that was very bad.  Some Senators supported me in that contention on that occasion.</P>
    <P>Again&mdash;this was on 4th July, 1957, &mdash;I felt it was necessary to raise the matter of the failure of the Government to implement the recommendations of the Fair Trade Commission on infant foods, chemists' prescriptions, pharmaceutical goods and so on. Again, this was approved as something which could legitimately be raised on the Adjournment.  It seems to me that this particular case was one upon which it was vitally important to have the Minister present, because in fact what happened, and what was admitted to have happened, was that the Minister had failed to comply with the law.  That is not my statement.  It is recognised in the statement issued by the Minister for Industry and Commerce at the time.  There were difficulties intervening we all know but I do not want to go into the details now.</P>
    <P>The law said that within three months of the making of the recommendation of the Fair Trade Commission, the Minister must either implement it or make a statement as to why he had not done so.  It was the previous Minister for Industry and Commerce, the present Taoiseach. March 29th was the time when he should have either explained why he was not implementing the recommendation or else implemented it.  There had been a change of Government in the interim.  But it was not until July 3rd, the very last day of the meeting of the Dáil&mdash;a further three months after March 29th&mdash;that the Minister, in fact, issued a statement, at the very last minute&mdash;there was far too little time for the Dáil to debate it&mdash;that he would not implement these recommendations. This should certainly have been discussed, and fully explained to Parliament.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1104" /> I raised the matter on the Adjournment. It was fortunate that the Seanad was still in session and that the matter could still be discussed in the Oireachtas. But the Minister said he would not come.  He was absent, and he did not send any delegate at all, although it was possible to show as I did show&mdash; the record demonstrates it&mdash;that there had been something, on the face of it at any rate, which looked like a grave dereliction of duty, a failure to comply with an Act of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>The fifth occasion that I remember upon which a Minister absented himself was, perhaps, what we should call a partial absence.  It was an occasion upon which Senator Cogan was replying to the Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Dillon, on that occasion, on a motion about the price of wheat. Senator Cogan had proposed the motion, and there had been quite a debate.  The Minister had replied and Senator Cogan was replying to the Minister.  He was replying with such effect that he greatly embarrassed the Minister.  The Minister suddenly got very annoyed and said he would not listen to any more of this stuff.  He swept out of the House.  I did not really feel it was the House which had lost prestige by this particular piece of petulance.  It is true that the Minister had listened to the proposing of the motion.  He had heard the whole debate.  Nevertheless, it did not seem to me very much to heighten either Ministerial prestige or the prestige of the Oireachtas to see him walk out during the Senator's reply.</P>
    <P>The sixth occasion to which I should like to refer is one which has a special significance and I should like to direct the attention of the Taoiseach to it.  It was an occasion upon which I tried to get permission to raise on the Adjournment the question of the mysterious banning of <i>The Observer.</i>  That point was ruled out of order.  I accepted the ruling as being correct.  I draw attention to the reason it was ruled out of order. It was ruled out of order because no Ministerial responsibility was said to have been involved.</P>
    <P>If we recognise that as a legitimate reason for ruling out of order a point when one seeks to raise it on the <Col N="1105" /> Adjournment, it must surely follow that if a matter is ruled to be in order, then Ministerial responsibility is involved.  I would suggest, therefore, that the very fact of approval by the Cathaoirleach of a matter to be raised on the Adjournment in this way is a sign that, in the opinion of the House, it is a matter in which Ministerial responsibility is involved.</P>
    <P>Now, in any matter in which Ministerial responsibility is involved, surely we have the right to ask the Minister to be present?  In other words, any point the Seanad tries to raise on the Adjournment is either out of order because no Ministerial responsibility is involved&mdash;that automatically puts it out&mdash;or it is accepted, in which case some Minister is at least partly involved.  Therefore, he should be present, to listen to criticism and to defend himself, if necessary.</P>
    <P>One of the last occasions upon which we failed to have a Minister present was an occasion&mdash;I do not refer to them in detail: they will be referred to by others&mdash;upon which Senator O'Quigley asked a question in relation to the revealing of names of unemployed during an election. The other was a matter raised by Senator Quinlan arising out of which we had this statement by Senator Ó Maoláin.  That particular point related to the circulating of speeches made at the United Nations.</P>
    <P>In that particular instance&mdash;I really believe this is true of both these examples&mdash;it seems to me glaringly obvious that the case of the Government was so good, that it could only make it appear bad by running away from criticism.  That seems to me to be the lesson, indeed, to be derived from each of these occasions to which I have referred.  When the Minister runs out under fire as the Minister for Agriculture or as the Minister for Education did, or when the Minister fails to appear in the firing line at all, it is because he implies that the case against him is so strong that he cannot face the music.</P>
    <P>That seems to me to be particularly true in the last instance which is the <Col N="1106" /> one that concerns us and to which reference is actually made in the motion.  It seems to me that obviously the Government had an excellent reply.</P>
    <P>It is because I believe this House must act as a responsible sounding-board for public opinion, a sort of public address system, if you like, with the co-operation of the Press, that I feel it is not only a duty to the House to raise matters in the public interest, but it is the duty of the Minister to come and state his case, if he has a case, if Ministerial responsibility is involved.  So, in every case where the matter is approved for raising by the Cathaoirleach, the Minister or at least one of his colleagues is in honour bound to come and state his case before the Oireachtas and also to the public.</P>
    <P>What the Minister says here will be heard outside the walls of this House. He must not merely state his case, as was done by the Minister for Education in the previous Government, who then ran away, but he must state his case, and humbly listen to those who believe it is possible a Minister can be wrong.</P>
    <P>Senator Ó Maoláin in the statement which the motion asks the House to disapprove of says, and I quote from the Official Report Col. 842, Vol. 51:</P>
    <P>The view of the Government regarding the practice which has recently developed in the Seanad of moving motions of this character on the Adjournment, is that it is an attempt to devise a new procedure by which Ministers would be made accountable to the Seanad for their administration.  The constitutional position is that Ministers are responsible to the Dáil only&mdash;members of the Dáil, of course, being elected directly by the people. Ministers are not responsible to the Seanad.  If the Seanad persists in trying to make Ministers accountable to this House&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>At that point the Cathaoirleach very properly intervened.  That seems to me to be a negation of our rights.  That is why I approve of the terms of Senator Hayes' motion, subject to my <Col N="1107" /> amendment, as supporting the established tradition of both Houses of the Oireachtas.  The mere fact that Dáil members are elected by direct suffrage, and that most Ministers are elected from among their number&mdash;of course, we have had Ministers from our number&mdash;does not mean that the Seanad can be flouted, or that we must regard Ministers as not being in any sense answerable to it.</P>
    <P>I suggested already that in this instance it seemed to me that the Government had an excellent case.  I do not understand at all why they should have felt so coy about coming to state it.  Could it be that they were too sensitive even to listen to criticism? I say, surely not.  Surely, in our political system, we have to get used to listening to some criticism of ourselves?  It is not a question in a supreme sense of the Minister being &ldquo;accountable,&rdquo; in the Senator's words, to the Seanad, but merely that he would be willing to come and listen to us.</P>
    <P>We are a deliberative and also a consultative Assembly.  It seems to me to be, in courtesy alone, the duty of the Minister, whose responsibility is involved, to come and listen to us.  The fact that we have no power to dismiss him is irrelevant.  I suggest that we have the power, and the established power, to criticise his policy, and to ask him questions within the rules of our own procedure.  The simple fact that the Cathaoirleach approved of the raising of these matters shows that all the matters I mentioned were within our own procedure.</P>
    <P>We have no power to dismiss a Minister, it is true, but we have no power, either, to stop a Bill from going through.  We have no power of veto, though we can stop a Bill for 90 days. That is all.  Yet, though we have no power to stop a Bill, a Bill must come before us.  We have no power to dismiss the Bill or the Minister, but the Bill must come before us.  I suggest that for these matters, too, the Minister ought to come.  I do not like to use the word &ldquo;must,&rdquo; but I feel that he is in honour bound to come before us.</P>
    <P>When a Bill does come before us, as <Col N="1108" /> it must, the Minister usually comes with it, listens to our observations and answers our questions.  Senator Hayes referred to the recent occasion on which the Minister for Health, in answer to a question or two of mine, put the view that since I was asking about financial matters, the Seanad had no right to get an answer.  Several Senators objected to this.  The Minister for Health was big enough, subsequently, to get up and alopogise to the House, and say he had been wrong and he gave the answers in quite a full way.  That is right.  That is the right attitude.</P>
    <P>As Senator Hayes said, we have no Question Time here.  Would that we had!  I do not share the rather codling and protective attitude towards Ministers that is taken by Senator Hayes.  Would that we had Question Time.</P>

      <P>I never belonged to the class of Ministers, and I never shall.  I feel that, short of a Question Time, we have certain rights and opportunities to raise matters within our rules of procedure, to ask questions and get some kind of response from a Minister.  I will conclude by asking the House to support this motion and my amendment.  I ask Senators to consider that in this whole matter the prestige of the House and of the Oireachtas, and indeed of the Government&mdash;each Government not just this Government, but all Governments in this country&mdash;depends upon the willingness of Ministers and Governments patiently to hear parliamentary criticism within the rules of procedure, to be glad to do so, and to exercise their right of reply.</P>

      <P>Thank you.  We learn every day.  In saying that, may I pay a tribute to Senator Hayes for his speech this evening?  May I say, quite spontaneously, that we learn almost every day from his experience and knowledge as a parliamentarian. We have all very good reason to be grateful to him, even if we disagree with him at times.  We acquire both knowledge and technique from him as a parliamentarian and it is part of our education here.</P>
      <P>I think Senator Sheehy Skeffington has made a fair case for broadening the terms of the motion.  Personally, too, I prefer it to be a non-Party motion.  We are defending the procedure of the House, which lies very close to the hearts of all of us.  If I felt for a moment it was merely a Party matter, I should be reluctant to support the motion at all.  Senator Hayes has put it forward in a very non-partisan way which makes it a good deal easier for us all.</P>
      <P>We very gratefully appreciate the presence of the Taoiseach here this evening.  By coming here and giving of his valuable time and attention, he has almost answered our unspoken question.  I have great pleasure in seconding the motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator Hayes as to the desirability of clarifying the situation which has arisen and to which the motion he has moved refers.  I think I should make it clear, because of some remark of his, that I am not attempting to define principles or determine practices for all time but rather expressing views which I now hold upon certain aspects of the relationships which exist between the Dáil <Col N="1110" /> and the Seanad and between the Seanad and the Government.</P>
      <P>In order to explain my attitude to the question in the motion it is necessary, I think, to make a brief reference to certain aspects of our Constitution.  I agree with Senator Hayes that the Dáil and the Seanad are equally Houses of the Oireachtas, on equal footing in regard to certain matters, but with quite important differences of fundamental importance in their powers and their functions.</P>
      <P>It may perhaps help Senators to understand my position in relation to the motion if I indicate briefly what I think are these main differences in powers and functions between Dáil and Seanad.  First of all, there is the matter of legislation.  While no law may be promulgated until a Bill has been passed, or been deemed to have been passed, by both Houses, the position of the Seanad in regard to legislation is clearly subordinate to that of the Dáil.  I do not think it is necessary to elaborate that point.</P>
      <P>The Constitution contemplates that, in respect of legislation, the Seanad should be a revising Chamber with limited powers of delay.  That, indeed, is its main function as I understand it in our parliamentary system &mdash;in our &ldquo;machinery of Government&rdquo;, as Senator McGuire described it.  I agree, however, that, to enable them to fulfil that important function, Senators are entitled to get from the Government, through the Minister in charge of any particular measure, all necessary information and explanations. I do not think the question of introducing Bills in the Seanad is relevant to this motion and I do not propose to refer to Senator Hayes's remarks in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the control of the finances of the State, power to exercise that control is conferred by our Constitution on the Dáil to the exclusion of the Seanad.  The Seanad cannot amend, as Senators know, or delay excessively, Bills which are declared to be Money Bills and it is to the Dáil alone that the annual Estimates of receipts and expenditures are presented. <Col N="1111" /> While that is so, I agree fully that there is nothing in the Constitution or in the Standing Orders of the Seanad, which prohibits the Seanad from expressing an opinion, by adopting a motion, in favour of placing charges on the public revenue for a particular purpose, but it is clear that such resolution can have no effect unless it is adopted by the Government and, indeed, even when adopted by the Government, further action in the Dáil would be required before it could be put into effect.</P>
    <P>With regard to external relations, the predominant status of the Dáil is made clear in the Constitution.  An international agreement is required to be laid before the Dáil only, and only the consent of the Dáil is required for the approval of an agreement involving charges upon public funds.  It is, however, mainly in the matter of its relations with the Government that the constitutional position, as I understand it, bears directly upon the motion now under discussion here.  In its relationship with the Government, the position of the Dáil as the predominant House is made very clear in the Constitution. The Seanad, as has been said, has no function at all in regard to the composition of the Government.  The Constitution expressly provides that the Government shall be responsible to Dáil Éireann.</P>
    <P>The position therefore generally is that the Seanad in regard to its powers and functions occupies a position which is subordinate to that of the Dáil.  The Government are not responsible to the Seanad.  They do not occupy in relation to the Seanad the position they occupy in relation to the Dáil.  The reasons for these Constitutional arrangements are, I think, readily understandable.  Senator McGuire's arguments about the democratic basis of the Seanad are, I think, beside the point.  Dáil members are elected by direct popular vote; Seanad members are either nominated by the Taoiseach, elected by the Universities or elected from restricted panels of candidates by a restricted electorate. That predominant position given to the Dáil in our Constitution is in accord <Col N="1112" /> with the general democratic character of the Constitution.</P>
    <P>I mention these matters because I think it is the obligation of the Government to make sure that the position contemplated by the Constitution, and which I regard as desirable in itself, should not be undermined in any way, and we should not allow procedures to grow up which would have the effect of altering that position in practice.  The Seanad, although enjoying not less than the Dáil the status and dignity of a House of the Oireachtas, is clearly in certain respects, in regard to legislation, public finance and external relations in particular, subordinate in powers and functions to the Dáil and that, I suggest, applies particularly in respect of its relations with the Government.</P>
    <P>Without presuming to lay down any hard and fast rules, I think, because of these differences in functions, that it is, to put it mildly, doubtful whether it would be appropriate or desirable for the Seanad to debate, first, a motion whose terms imply formal censure of the Government or call into question the Government's policies or administration in respect of any matter, except to the extent that such criticism or question would arise during the course of the consideration of a Bill before the Seanad or on a motion relating to a statutory order which is, in essence, an extension of legislation; secondly, a motion concerning the finances of the State other than a motion for a recommendation moved during the consideration of a Money Bill, and particularly a motion which advocates an important policy change which would impose a substantial charge on the public; and thirdly, a motion concerning policy bearing on external relations except as envisaged by the Constitution.</P>
    <P>I would, perhaps, modify my opinion in regard to that third category of motions by saying that I would not regard as inappropriate, and indeed practice has established the right of the Seanad, to discuss motions&mdash;which, in the past, I think were usually arranged in accordance with understandings made informally at the instance  <Col N="1113" /> of the Government&mdash;motions of sympathy or congratulation in connection with notable events abroad or protests on assertions of national rights.</P>
    <P>I express these views because I assume motions dealing with financial matters and external relations are generally likely to be motions of censure. Apart from the objections that these matters are clearly intended under the Constitution to be the special concern of the Dáil, such motions are open to the general objection to all motions of censure in this Seanad in that they appear to call upon the Government to defend their policy and administration to the Seanad and imply that the Government are responsible to the Seanad, whereas, as I have tried to make clear, they are in fact responsible to the Dáil only.  Nothing in the Constitution suggests that the Government are responsible to the Seanad in any sense or in any degree.</P>
    <P>As regards questions, I think Senator Hayes mentioned that it was long ago decided by the Seanad Committee on Procedure and Privileges that the answering of questions by Ministers could not be claimed as a right, but the practice of allowing a matter to be raised on the motion for the Adjournment has been established, subject to the decision of the Cathaoirleach that the matter is suitable for discussion in that way.  There is also provision in the Seanad Standing Orders for a motion for the adjournment of the Seanad on a definite matter of urgent public importance.  In the Dáil, whatever may be contained in the Dáil Standing Orders, the practice relating to raising matters on the Adjournment is to regard it as an extension of Question Time.  Generally a topic is raised on the motion for the Adjournment when the limitations imposed at Question Time are such as to prevent the matter which was the subject of a Parliamentary Question being properly ventilated.</P>
    <P>Indeed, I think I am correct in saying that the Ceann Comhairle of the Dáil would not regard as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment any matter of general policy, any matter, for example, which should more appropriately be raised on a formal motion <Col N="1114" /> or where it would be unfair as well as unreasonable to expect the Minister to make a policy statement in the limited time available to him.  This motion which the Seanad is now considering relates very largely, I understand, to the question of attendance of Ministers when matters are raised on the motion for the Adjournment of the Seanad. The Constitution, as has been pointed out, gives Ministers the right to attend and be heard in the Seanad and, under the Standing Orders of the Seanad, a Parliamentary Secretary to a Minister is given the right to attend in his stead, with the permission of the Cathaoirleach.  The Seanad however, has no power whatever to require the attendance of a Minister or a Parliamentary Secretary.</P>
    <P>In saying that, I want to stress that the Government have no desire to limit the power of the Seanad to debate motions, but I want to make it clear also that the Seanad has no right to summon Ministers to appear before them or to try to coerce them into appearing here by allegations of running away or reluctance to defend their policy or by deploring their failure to exercise their right to stay away at any time.  Senator Sheehy Skeffington referred to an incident in 1955, when the then Taoiseach, Deputy Costello, declined to attend here to make a statement to a motion of his relating to a delicate and important matter of public policy. I am not going to express a view as to whether he was right or wrong.  We can however, visualise a situation where the making of a statement on a particular topic, might be regarded by the Taoiseach or by a member of the Government as unwise and indiscreet, and he could not be forced into an indiscretion by a summons from the Seanad to come here and make a statement.</P>
    <P>It is clear also that there will be circumstances in which, for other reasons, Ministers may refuse to attend, just as there will be motions upon which they may think it unnecessary to make any statement.  As a matter of established practice, it can be assumed that a member of the Government will always be present at a meeting of the Seanad when the House is considering <Col N="1115" /> a Government measure with which he is concerned.  But I want to make it clear that a Minister is under no obligation whatever to attend here for a debate or a motion or to defend here, when challenged on a motion, either the policy or administration for which he is responsible to the Government and for which the Government are responsible to the Dáil.  If he does so, it will be either out of courtesy to the Seanad or because he regards the occasion as being a suitable one upon which to state the Government's position.</P>
    <P>Having made that clear, I want to say further that the Seanad may take it that Ministers will normally attend whenever the circumstances are such that their attendance would not confuse the true constitutional position in regard to the powers and functions of the Seanad and the relationship between the Seanad and the Government.</P>
    <P>There is one complaint which I want to make to Senator Sheehy Skeffington in that regard.  There is a motion on the Order Paper in his name&mdash;Motion No. 6&mdash;which has been there for quite a long time.  I do not know how long he is going to keep it there&mdash;perhaps until, with the course of time, it becomes relevant again to the circumstances prevailing. I am submitting that it is quite unfair to a Minister to put a motion on the Order Paper without the Minister knowing when it is to be discussed at a Seanad meeting and giving him the feeling that he has to be available every time the Seanad meets.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OwenSkeffington" hpid="Dr. Sheehy Skeffington Dr. Sheehy Skeffington">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Taoiseach is not in possession of the facts.  When that matter came up, it was ruled to be temporarily out of order until the Commission on Human Rights at Strasbourg gave its decision on the Lawless case.  The ruling that I could not discuss it until that decision had been given was not of my doing and the matter went into abeyance according to the ruling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I was only using it as an illustration.  I think that, in arranging formal motions for discussion, <Col N="1116" /> consideration should be given to the burdens resting on Ministers in relation to their work in the Dáil and that the aim should be so to provide for the progress of business in the Seanad that Ministers will be facilitated.</P>
      <P>In view of what I have said, I hope that Senators will perhaps understand why Ministers declined to attend the Seanad on two recent occasions when adjournment Debates were initiated.  One was on the question of the publication of a pamphlet relating to external affairs, and the other occasion was when certain matters respecting the conduct of a Dáil by-election were raised, matters which could under no conceivable circumstances be regarded as the concern of the Seanad.  I think it would be wrong for me to question the ruling of the Cathaoirleach on that occasion, but may I say that if the Seanad at some future time should decide to discuss the conduct of a Dáil election or by-election, they may well get a more formal request from the Dáil to mind their own business.</P>
      <P>Apart from the character of these motions, the fact that all surrounding circumstances made it clear they were inspired by Party political motives had a bearing on the Government's attitude. I am not trying to prohibit or restrain the Seanad from discussing motions which could be regarded as relating to the Party political situation, but when such a motion does appear in the Order Paper, the Government may well decide to leave it to Senators in the House who support the Government, feeling that they will be able to deal more effectively with the motion or at least deal with it with greater freedom than Ministers could exercise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It may be taken that it will be the normal practice in future as in the past for Ministers to attend for debates upon motions which appear to us to come within the constitutional functions of the Seanad, which deal with important matters of public concern and which offer suitable opportunities for an explanation of Government policy, and that practice will apply to motions on the Adjournment as to more formal motions.  I feel sure, as does <Col N="1117" /> Senator Hayes, that if problems of this kind are approached with common sense no difficulties need arise.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOQuigley" hpid="Mr. O'Quigley Mr. O'Quigley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the concluding sentences of the Taoiseach's speech justify the putting down of this motion because it does appear from what the Taoiseach has said that it is not the view of the Government that tradition, in relation to the attendance of Ministers on various kinds of motions, should be departed from to any great extent, if at all.  The Taoiseach, as I interpreted him, reserved to his Government a certain amount of elbow-room, and it can only remain for us to hope that the latitude which the Taoiseach has allowed himself in his speech, will never be employed by any member of any Government, and that the occasions which the Taoiseach thinks might arise requiring the Government to exercise the latitude which he has laid down will be very few and far between.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach has outlined the relative constitutional positions of Dáil Éireann and Seanad Éireann and, apparently since he took to reading the Constitution, he has adopted very much the lawyers' attitude.  He has not at all referred to some of the concurrent authority on powers which the Seanad shares with the Dáil.  I do not intend to go into these but there are some functions in which the Seanad has an absolutely equal authority with the Dáil, in relation to the office of President, and in relation to the office of the Judiciary, and there is one extremely important concurrent authority which the Seanad has, to which the Taoiseach did not refer.  That is contained in Article 28 of the Constitution. I think it is probably the most important function that can be exercised by either the Dáil or Seanad, when you have said all that has to be said about the relative authority in relation to finance matters, Money Bills and external relations, because that is the clause which determines that the Government can set aside the whole Constitution and that nothing that is done by the Government, for the purposes of maintaining public security in time of war, or armed rebellion, shall be wrong and that the Constitution cannot be invoked to challenge anything the Government <Col N="1118" /> have done, but the Government can do that only upon the passing by each House of the Oireachtas&mdash;each House, mark you&mdash;of a resolution that, arising out of an armed conflict, a national emergency exists affecting the vital interests of the State.</P>
    <P>To me, that shows the desirability for closer harmony and co-operation, and the need for closer harmony and co-operation existing between both Houses of the Oireachtas, because it is quite conceivable, as we demonstrated here recently, that the Government of the day may not have a majority in the Seanad and, for all the Government could do in something they thought was important they might find, in a prolonged war of attrition between themselves and the Seanad, the Seanad might take the same view as to whether or not a state of emergency did exist.</P>
    <P>There could be circumstances in which a Government might think it desirable to have an emergency period declared for three months to meet a particular situation.  The Seanad, if it were hostile, and with a tradition of hostility between it and the Government, might not accept the view of the Government and, under the Constitution, could completely stultify the wishes of the Government which, indeed, might happen to be correct.  It seems to me in this very important matter of relations between the Dáil, the Seanad, and the Government, what are required are, as has been said by Senator Hayes and the Taoiseach, common sense and a desire to co-operate.  There should exist and, in my short time in the Seanad, I think it has given many manifestations of its desire to co-operate even beyond what might be regarded as reasonable.</P>
    <P>There have been occasions when we have been presented with legislation which we have allowed to go by, very much against our will, without amendment, for the purpose of extending to the Government the co-operation which they asked.  Indeed, it has even arisen on an occasion when it was agreed by the Minister&mdash; I do not say the Taoiseach but the Minister handling a Bill&mdash;that an amendment which was suggested here <Col N="1119" /> was for the betterment of the Bill and, rather than hold up the Bill, we let it go in its unamended and wrong form, solely for the purpose of facilitating the Government.  That arises from the sense of responsibility which the Seanad has of its position in regard to legislation.</P>
    <P>The British Constitution, about which we heard a great deal this year, has developed in two ways.  I do not intend to dilate upon this matter, but I do want to point out such things as the conventions of the constitution in Britain.  They are not to be found written anywhere.  They are not rules and regulations.  They are practices and I should certainly hope our Constitution, which has only come of age in the past year or so, would develop as a living organism capable of expanding, and of being adapted to meet particular needs as time goes on.</P>
    <P>I should very much regret if the Dáil or the Government were to say: &ldquo;The Seanad has only got certain rights and we shall keep them to these rights.  We shall keep them in their place.&rdquo;  The Taoiseach, having poured a great deal of oil on troubled waters in the major part of his speech, came out with what I consider to be a most extraordinary statement, quite out of keeping with the rest of his speech.  He referred to a motion which was discussed here concerning a by-election in Dublin.  I do not think the Taoiseach was quite in possession of the facts as to what that motion was about.  It was not in connection with a by-election.  It arose out of a by-election and was connected with the administration of the Department of Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach then went to the length of saying that if the Seanad dared to express its views on by-elections to the Dáil, it might receive a more formal notification on a future occasion.  I rather took the Taoiseach to mean they would get a slap in the face from Dáil Éireann, and be told to mind their own business.  If I am wrong in that summary, I am prepared to stand corrected, but that is what I took to be the effect of what the Taoiseach said.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1120" /> As I understand the Constitution, everything that is not restricted or denied is permitted.  We in this House are not permitted to hold up a Bill for longer than 90 days and, if we do, certain conditions apply, but there is nothing in the Constitution which prevents the Seanad from debating any matter which is within the Standing Orders of the Seanad.  Whether that relates to policy or financial control or administration, there is nothing to prevent the Seanad from debating these matters and expressing its opinion on them.  There is nothing the Dáil can do about it, whether the Dáil likes it or not.  Whether the matter relates to elections to the Dáil, the policy of the Government and Ministers or financial matters, there is nothing the Government or the Dáil can do about it.</P>
    <P>The Seanad is not some kind of wireless that has only a few stations and can play only on those few stations. There is a very wide range of subjects on which it can speak according to Standing Orders.  It is not, as the Taoiseach erroneously thinks, confined to certain matters.  It is another matter whether the Taoiseach chooses to attend on these motions.  The Taoiseach has indicated that we can rest fairly assured that it would be the general view and wish of the Government that they would be in a position to attend by reason of the type of motions they would be.  I think it should be made clear at this stage that there is nothing in the Constitution which prevents this House at any time it thinks proper in accordance with Standing Orders from discussing any matter of Government policy, financial, economic, administration of Government or anything else.</P>
    <P>Beyond these few remarks, I do not wish to say anything except, in conclusion, that I have a feeling of relief as far as this House is concerned.  It has done well in bringing this matter up for debate and it has done its duty to future assemblies of the Seanad in protesting against something which it conceived to be in derogation of traditional practice.</P>

      <P>Anybody who agrees with democracy and all that <Col N="1121" /> flows from it must regret recent refusals of Ministers to attend a debate in the Seanad and the fact that the well-drilled arrays of the Irish would-be dictators walked out of this Seanad&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am surprised that any Party which claims to be democratic should show such disrespect, such discourtesy, such disregard for the institutions of this State which so many good men gave their lives to establish. We all believe in democracy but democracy in all circumstances requires co-operation from all those who use it.  We all, both in Seanad Éireann and Dáil Éireann, believe that democracy is best in practice because it offers a satisfying ideal of fair play for the whole population and it usually struggles, in any case, in that direction. I think, however, it will have to be admitted that we had not either co-operation or fair play from the Government Party, the elected representatives on that side of the House, on that occasion or on previous occasions.</P>
      <P>I think that both the Taoiseach and the Leader of the Seanad have yet to learn that toleration is an essential element in true statesmanship and that the very meaning of toleration is the suffering of people to say and do things with which you are not in agreement, provided that they are within the law. That is the important matter.  Mr. de Valera when he was Taoiseach stated in the Dáil on 19th April, 1934, that the only safeguards for the people in the long run were the good will and the honesty of the people's representatives. If they are the only safeguards of the people, certainly we have not had the good will of the present Government, who are the people's representatives, on a number of occasions in the past.  We certainly had not the good will of Senators when they walked out of this House when an important motion was down for discussion.</P>

I claim that Parliament is the fount of their power and as long as there is government by the majority of Parliament, they must continue to do their duty.  If you have not the co-operation of the elected representatives and the Government, then it will be a bad day for the country.</P>

      <P>I shall finish in a moment.  I claim that the strength of Government depends largely on the regard the general public and its representatives have for it.

I think that Parliament will fail if respect for it or co-operation with it is flouted.</P>

      <P>This motion and the debate on it have done good.  I should like to make only one observation on the amendment and Senator Sheehy Skeffington's contribution. He talked about being unlucky in that Ministers did not come in to hear him.  The truth is that if Senator Sheehy Skeffington gave the matter some thought and studied parliaments here and elsewhere, he would find himself extremely lucky. Nowhere else in the world do Independent members get more liberty, &ldquo;a better show&rdquo;, to use a colloquial phrase, than in this House and in the other House.  I think that is absolutely true.</P>

I merely said that I appeared to have been <Col N="1123" /> unlucky in that upon the only two occasions in his whole life when Senator Hayes advised a Minister not to come and listen to a Senator, it happened to be me.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>He is extremely well off.  He gets an extremely good hearing.  On many occasions he put down a motion on which he could get no seconder &mdash;I want to conclude on this matter and get on to the Taoiseach&mdash;but on one occasion the then Taoiseach, Deputy Costello, did not come.  As the present Taoiseach said, he might have had a variety of reasons, but if he had come, he could not have made a speech.  There were no proceedings in the House.  No motion was made; no question was put from the Chair.  If the Taoiseach had been foolish enough to come, he would have been sitting here and he would have been in the position that, having listened to Senator Sheehy Skeffington, he would have had to go away without saying anything.  So my advice to him and his action were extremely apposite.  The Seanad is never muzzled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us come to the Taoiseach's view. The Taoiseach told us something which, if I may say so without offence to him, we already knew&mdash;that Seanad Éireann has not the same powers as the Dáil.  We agree entirely in regard to that.  I have no desire in anything I said on this motion or in anything I ever put down here to extend the powers of the House as set out in the Constitution.  I realise, too, that we have no absolute right to make Ministers attend.  Ministers do a great many things which nobody can make them do.  It is true to say that Deputies have no right to make Ministers answer questions at Question Time but Ministers keep on doing it.  The truth is that in regard to any particular <Col N="1124" /> question which a Minister does not answer, the Chair has no right to make him do it.  In Parliamentary life, Ministers do a great many things which they are not absolutely compelled to do.  I do not think that any effort has been made to undermine the position of Ministers.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach argues that while we have power to discuss Bills and administration in so far as it may be relevant to Bills, we have no power such as the power to put down a motion censuring the Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry if the Senator misunderstood and took that view.  I think I indicated that I accepted the Seanad had the power under Standing Orders to discuss any motion which might be moved and which the Chair accepted as being in order.  My remarks were directed towards the type of motion the debate on which I would regard as appropriate for the Minister to attend.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the Taoiseach say the Seanad could not put down a motion censuring the Government? The criterion for the Chair is whether a motion affects a Minister or not.  You cannot put down a motion as to whether Wellington or Napoleon was the better general.  It must concern a Minister in some way or another.</P>
      <P>I agree with the Taoiseach that we ought not to put down motions of general censure on the Government. If we are to have any intelligent discussion in the Seanad, it must be discussion of public affairs for which Ministers have some responsibility.  We must be allowed, in discussing the motion, to say either the Ministers, whoever they are, should do something or should not have done something they have done.  That is the great measuring rod.  I remember listening in the Dáil and when a man did not mention the Minister, he was regarded as wandering and out of order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I draw attention to the fact that there are three motions on the Order Paper which are quite relevant.  None of them implies censure.</P>

    <Col N="1125" />
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>A motion about the internees surely implies censure on the Government who are keeping them in.  Of course, if they are released in the meantime, then the motion lapses with the passage of time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I refer to Motions 8, 9 and 10 on the Order Paper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>No. 8 urges the Government to do something which so far they have not done.  No. 9 criticises the Government in relation to a certain scheme to which the Government have already given approval.  I do not want to argue on details.  By and large, what I say is correct.  No. 10 deals with some administrative act taken by the Government.  I am not arguing the merits of these matters.  You will have a Minister coming in and he should explain some part of Government administration.</P>
      <P>I would agree with the Taoiseach that you should not have, perhaps, general motions of censure.  I should not like to agree that you should change the practice that has heretofore been followed, whereby you may put down a motion which involves to some degree censure of the Government.  It is true that it would be foolish to put down a motion involving a substantial charge.  With regard to External Affairs, I am not so sure about that, either.</P>
      <P>In any event, I agree entirely that we have no power to require the attendance of Ministers.  What we have power to do and what I am doing to-night is asking the Taoiseach&mdash;I think he is in substantial agreement with me in spite of certain <i>caveats</i> he has entered&mdash;to continue the tradition created here whereby one of the functions of the Leader of the House is to try to ensure that Ministers will be present on certain occasions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasMullins" hpid="Tomás Ó Maoláin Tomás Ó Maoláin">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Ó Maoláin</NameTxt>
      <P>I have always done that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I know there are occasions when they cannot be present.  I gather from the Taoiseach that he feels the tradition that has been established here over a long period should be followed.  There should be&mdash;I think there always has <Col N="1126" /> been except on the specific occasion mentioned in the motion&mdash;co-operation between individuals and the House and a desire on the part of the Leader of the House to get Ministers and reasonable co-operation from the Opposition by saying: &ldquo;We will take certain things when it suits the convenience of certain Ministers.&rdquo;  I think we have always had that.  I have always found that the people who sat on this side of the House, whoever they were, said that.</P>
      <P>On the whole, I welcome the statement the Taoiseach has made.  I think, too, without making any rules, we shall be able to manage this matter in the future.  I think, therefore, that the motion does not need to be put.  I should like to say, in conclusion, that every one of us, including the Taoiseach, whatever we may think about politics, will show that the members of the Government and those interested in politics desire to uphold our Parliamentary and political institutions.  You cannot uphold these institutions if you belittle any part of them.  That idea has got to be put firmly into the heads of everybody. Goodness knows, there are sufficient people around who are anxious to find fault with polticians sometimes for good reasons and sometimes, indeed for very bad reasons.  If the Seanad is belittled and let down, I do not think that either the Dáil or the Government or anybody in our general political life can escape the consequences.  Therefore, I think this discussion has done good.  The fact of the Taoiseach being present and what he said will lead to a solution of the difficulties that now exist.</P>
