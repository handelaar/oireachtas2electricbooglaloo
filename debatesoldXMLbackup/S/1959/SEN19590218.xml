      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Blaney)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to confirm the Provisional Order set out in the Schedule, i.e., the Borough of Wexford (Alteration of Boundary) Order, 1959, which was made by the Minister for Local Government on 16th January, 1959.</P>
      <P>The area of the Borough of Wexford at present is 505 acres.  The Provisional Order proposes to add to the borough a contiguous portion of the county health district amounting in all to approximately 68 acres.  The purpose of the extension is primarily to facilitate the carrying out of the corporation's housing programme.  It is reasonable that the houses built by a local authority should be within the area over which it has jurisdiction but the building land remaining within the present borough boundary is insufficient for the purposes of the corporation's housing programme.  The corporation have already acquired most of the land proposed to be added to the borough and have constructed houses on approximately half of that land.  Plans have been prepared for the construction of further houses on the remaining half of the land and financial, engineering and administrative difficulties could arise if the land involved were to remain outside the area of jurisdiction of the corporation.</P>
      <P>The whole question was discussed at a public inquiry held at Wexford on 29th July, 1958.  The Wexford County Council was represented at that inquiry and raised no objection to the proposal.  Three private landowners affected by the proposal did not attend the inquiry and, presumably, do not object to the alteration of the boundary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Provisional Order contains provision for the adjustment of property, rights and liabilities by agreement between the county council and the corporation. Should they fail to reach agreement the adjustment will be <Col N="721" /> made by a person appointed by me. Other usual provisions included in the Order relate to the preparation of maps, valuation lists and the registration of electors.</P>
    <P>If the House so agrees I wish, if possible, to get all stages of this Bill to-day.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
    <P>Agreed to take remaining stages to-day.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>When speaking on this Bill last Wednesday evening, I said I believed that a new dynamic was required in Irish life, that this dynamic would help to inspire the youth of our country and that it would canalise our <Col N="722" /> efforts and patriotic aspirations in a practical manner.  I said I believed that our problem was largely economic rather than political, and that I thought the Government in amending the Constitution to give us super-strong Government should have looked for co-operation rather than the strong dominance of one political Party.  I hope briefly to develop some of these ideas in my speech this afternoon.</P>
      <P>I said this Government had no monopoly of political wisdom in this country.  I touched briefly on the civil war in a non-contentious manner. I said I believed that we had got over that episode in our history, perhaps with greater credit to ourselves than many other countries.  The Civil war represented the growing pains of the nation, but in those growing pains, we lost, perhaps, ten of the most valuable formative years.  Many disinterested persons, who left Irish political life as a result of the cleavage that took place in the early 20's, hoped, wished and prayed that we would have a period in which the ideals that had come forward from before the time of Catholic Emancipation and reached fruition with the establishment of an Irish Parliament could be turned in one direction to help us with our problem. It is only by using all sections of the community in something like an all-Party Government and directing it towards an agreed policy&mdash;agreed by either a single Party or all-Party Government&mdash;that we can get real benefit for the nation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also said that in dealing with our economic problem we had only 55 per cent. of the <i>per capita</i> income of the British, and that it behoved all of us to strive by every means in our power to close that gap.  In referring to history, I also wish to mention briefly that we had an economic war, fixed later by agreement, and that Seanad Éireann was abolished.  Anyone reading Donal O'Sullivan's admirable book, <i>The Irish Free State Senate,</i> can see that the Seanad then was far more effective than the Seanad enshrined in our present Constitution.  It was suggested that if we propose to amend the Constitution, we ought to rehabilitate and strengthen Seanad Éireann again <Col N="723" /> by giving back to it some of the strength it originally had as an assembly.  As a deliberative assembly, particularly on this measure, the Seanad has shown a great variety of talent.  That talent should be used in bringing in recommendations for amendments of the Constitution which would be more beneficial than the proposed measure.</P>
    <P>One of my principal objections to this Bill is that I am afraid it will tend to drive underground many of our national, economic, political and other movements.  During the last two weeks, when this Bill was being debated, I felt that perhaps it was dangerous or unwise to mention these matters, but this is Parliament and they should be mentioned here.  To-day we are proposing to enact a measure that may do a great disservice to this nation.  That disservice should be brought out fully here in the light of day.</P>
    <P>Take the political Party of which I am a member.  Maybe it will drive portion of that Party underground for a short period.  We are a Party with a sound, disinterested political philosophy, and we can stand the attacks and ravishes of any political Party.  We are not inclined to go underground, but we may be reduced in numbers for a short period, or perhaps even for a decade. As far as the nation is concerned, the younger people, with more extreme political views and less political experience than we have, may be encouraged by persons to use physical force.  Physical force has formed a great part of our history and the Government should provide the safeguard and safety valve of allowing these people to get into Parliament, to express their opinions.  The Government obviously intend to do away with the safety valve and let the boiler burst. It is very unsound policy, to say the least of it, to do that.</P>
    <P>To a lesser extent, the Government seem to wish to drive the Labour Party underground.  The Labour Party, of course, have greater opportunities and more ways of expressing themselves as compared with the national extremist; be that as it may, it seems to me the Government are doing a great disservice to the nation in introducing this <Col N="724" /> measure.  If it is accepted, we may be faced with years of unrest, political strikes and all the rest of it, because of this imprudent step on the part of the Government at this stage of our development.  It should be the policy of the Government to try to heal the wounds and alleviate the growing pains of the nation.  It should be the object of the Government to lead us into maturity out of adolescence without imposing strains which the people may not be able to bear.</P>
    <P>The British system has been mentioned. It has been lauded.  It is the system which the Government now propose to impose on us.  We ought to look dispassionately at the British system to see whether it may be good or bad for us.  The British system is a two-Party system in which there are inevitably great extremes.  On the one side you have the Conservatives.  On the other side you have a socialistic Party.  Christopher Dawson writing on these problems said: &ldquo;It is very hard to run a country well when each time you change the Government you virtually have a revolution.&rdquo;  The late Sir Stafford Cripps, when questioned by the Conservatives in Parliament, said that he hoped to &ldquo;have the eggs scrambled in such a manner that no one would again be able to unscramble them&rdquo;.  Does our Government wish to put us in a position here in which, each time the Government changes, we shall find ourselves scrambling and unscrambling eggs?  If that is the prospect then I, for one, take a gloomy view of the future.  At one stage we shall have near Socialism; at another turn of the wheel we shall have Conservative industrialism.  In those circumstances it will be impossible for the nation to progress.</P>
    <P>Sometimes I wonder if, perhaps, we do not take things too seriously.  Recently I came across a rather brilliant satire on English affairs called <i>Parkinson's Law.</i>  The writer demonstrates very competently the British facility for laughing at their own system.  Yet, that is the system the Government now propose to impose on us.  At page 44, Professor Northcote Parkinson states:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;...The British, being brought up on team games, enter their <Col N="725" /> House of Commons in the spirit of those who would rather be doing something else.  If they cannot be playing golf or tennis, they can at least pretend that politics is a game with very similar rules.  But for this device, Parliament would arouse even less interest than it does.  So the British instinct is to form two opposing teams, with reference and linesmen, and let them debate until they exhaust themselves. The House of Commons is so arranged that the individual Member is practically compelled to take one side or the other before he knows what the arguments are, or even (in some cases) before he knows the subject of the dispute. His training from birth has been to play for his side, and this saves him from any undue mental effort.  Sliding into a seat toward the end of a speech, he knows exactly how to take up the argument from the point it has reached.  If the speaker is on his own side of the House, he will say &lsquo;Hear, hear!&rsquo;  If he is on the opposite side, he can safely say &lsquo;Shame!&rsquo; or merely &lsquo;Oh!&rsquo;  At some later stage he may have time to ask his neighbour what the debate is supposed to be about. Strictly speaking, however, there is no need for him to do this.  He knows enough in any case not to kick into his own goal.  The men who sit opposite are entirely wrong and all their arguments are so much drivel.  The men on his own side are statesmanlike, by contrast, and their speeches a singular blend of wisdom eloquence, and moderation. Nor does it make the slightest difference whether he learned his politics at Harrow or in following the fortunes of Aston Villa.  In either school he will have learned when to cheer and when to groan.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is the system our Government want to bring in here to solve our political and economic problems.  That is the system which presumably the Government believe will close the gap between the standard of living of our people here and the standard of living of the people in Northern Ireland. That is the system which presumably <Col N="726" /> the Government believe will reconcile the differences between Capital and Labour&mdash;the system which will enable us to run this country as a Christian democracy and help us to be better sociologists.  I believe that this system will not act as a solvent.  It will help, rather, to create for us the greatest difficulties we could meet at this stage of our development.</P>
    <P>One of the advantages of the straight vote system, we were told, was that it would give us better members of Parliament.  I believe nothing could be further from the truth.  I speak from personal experience of politics over 25 years, or so.  What happens in Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael when there is an election in the offing?  A panel of names is drawn up and, on that panel, as we all know, there will be one or two not quite so desirable as the rest.  No political Party is in itself strong enough to erase those names without causing Party schism.  Under P.R. these people can be allowed to go forward and the responsibility of not electing them rests on the people. That helps to keep the political Party together.  It helps the political Party to work successfully.  Under the system proposed here the political hack will have a better opportunity of carrying the committee, or whatever the group may be which will select the man for the single seat constituency. The Taoiseach, who is far wiser and more experienced in politics than any of us, knows that quite well and better than most of us.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to P.R. in Europe.  I do not propose to traverse that ground because it has been very ably covered by both Senator O'Quigley and Senator Quinlan.  Many of the most successful Governments in Europe to-day&mdash;Holland, Belgium, Switzerland&mdash;have P.R.  I wish we could make as much progress in economic, political, social, cultural and religious affairs as the people in these countries have made.  We should copy them.  We should emulate them rather than impose a system here which has not shown itself to be successful in England.</P>
    <P>A grave defect in the British system is the fact that there is not sufficient <Col N="727" /> opportunity for change.  The electorate is faced with the task of voting either Conservative or Labour.  The voter may like only a small part of the policy of either Labour or Conservative but he has little chance of voting for the Liberals.  For that reason, the pendulum has swung very much more violently and with a violent swing of the pendulum, a great deal more strain is exerted on the nation than would be the case if politics were stabilised rather nearer the centre.  If, in Britain, they had with the single-member constituency the single transferable vote, it would mean that very often if people did not like Labour or Conservative, they would be in a position to elect the Liberal Party.  To-day they have a form of Hobson's choice and the measure the Taoiseach now proposes would give Ireland nothing other than a Hobson's choice.  It will always be a Government of compromise, a Government which, in the view of many people, will be the second best.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Quigley stressed a point which has not been answered by any of the Government speakers.  His point was that as well as having a strong Government, we would have a weak Opposition.  In a democracy, the Opposition is very important.  He has covered that point and has shown that in the case of many of the Committees of the House, without the benefit of the Opposition Party, the personnel to run those committees are not available, and the interests of democracy will not be best served under the system proposed.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to take seriously the suggestion made by Senator Ryan that we might consider having P.R. for the whole country.  That is an absurd solution and I do not believe Senator Ryan seriously put it forward but that, in fact, he wanted to show that P.R. was absurd by giving an absurd analogy.</P>
    <P>With regard to Coalition Governments, I should like to make the observation that they have the advantage of bringing together people of widely differing viewpoints and when in the Cabinet these viewpoints are reconciled by discussions and compromise rather <Col N="728" /> than by forced decisions by strong Governments.  Senator Barry said very truly that all life is a form of compromise, that we all have to make accommodations.  We have to make accommodations in our private lives and with the people with whom we work and it is on how we make these accommodations that the success we make in this life depends.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Colley spoke about Switzerland and about several other countries in Europe, but, as I say, he was answered in that respect very fully by Senator Quinlan.  Before speaking on this Bill, I looked up several books and one which I thought was very interesting, as so many examples were given about Switzerland, was the book entitled <i>Nationalism and Liberty,</i> subtitled <i>The Swiss Example,</i> by Hans Kohn.  The interesting thing about this book is that the views of the author run completely counter to the views expressed here by the Government Party.  In fact, everything they hold to be of value he holds to be of no value but to be of disservice to the Swiss nation.</P>
      <P>I shall quote briefly from page 98 where he explains what happened in Switzerland after the revolution of 1847.  We must remember that we had a revolution here and that the success of our economy depends on our management of affairs after the revolution and the lessons we learn from that revolution.  I quote:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;In this spirit Switzerland overcame the civil war of 1847 and outgrew its bitterness into the reconciliation of a nation free in diversity and yet solidly united, a nation which recognised that not strong rule and uniformity, but balances and compromises are the cement which keeps political communities together in a dynamic society.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Switzerland is one of the most successful countries in the world and they have arrived at the conclusion that compromise and accommodations <Col N="729" /> to the various other groups, vocational and otherwise, which form Switzerland, are best.  That is how they have made their country great and how they have progressed.</P>
    <P>I wish to return briefly to the note on which I opened this speech when I said that in the interests of Ireland, we should have a new dynamic.  We must inspire our young people by giving them the leadership and co-operation necessary in order to make our country progress, and by having this diversity which will make Ireland a place well worth living in so that whoever is in charge of the Government will help all the people in their various avocations to make Ireland a worthwhile place.</P>
    <P>While on that note, I think it well to say that when the emergency arose in 1939 and the Government asked the Opposition Party to co-operate with them in fighting this emergency, they did so, and that is the type of spirit which I believe the young people of to-day would like to see.  That patriotic motive is latent in all our young men and women and if they get leadership from the Government, that type of patriotism will help Ireland to progress. Lack of leadership by the Government to-day is probably one of the causes for some of the troubles in the country to-day.</P>
    <P>I want to say&mdash;I think it well that it should be made public&mdash;one of the reasons I am against strong Governments is that they are inclined of their very nature to become oppressive and dictatorial.  Fianna Fáil, be it remembered, introduced politics into local affairs in 1934.  From the time the State was established in 1922 local affairs were conducted more or less on vocational lines, but in 1934 Fianna Fáil decided they would contest corporation, county council and urban council elections on political issues, and it then developed that their nominees were on almost all the committees of public bodies wherever they got a majority. They were against representative government in local affairs.  It is as well that that should be known because many people say: &ldquo;Is it not a pity to have politics in local affairs?&rdquo; but <Col N="730" /> they do not know from what source it emanated.  I believe it is as well that they should know.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I believe our problems here are economic rather than political and that many of the solutions proposed for our economic problems during the past 20 or 30 years have been political rather than economic and that is the reason we have not achieved the success which we ought to have achieved.  That is why we have not achieved the success we should.  If we pause for a moment we shall realise that is so.  We did not have many events like the economic war.  Ours are economic rather than political problems but they are approached politically and it is a pity this should be so when <i>Economic Development</i> and many other journals, emanating from official and semi-official sources, have stressed the need for concentrating our efforts on economic rather than political affairs.</P>
    <P>I should like to quote what Sir Winston Churchill, another monolithic figure in world affairs, said on this point:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Economic problems, unlike political issues, cannot be solved by any expression, however vehement, of the national will but only by taking right action.  We cannot cure cancer by a majority; what is wanted is a remedy.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Let us heed that statement.  Here, we are trying to cure our economic ills by a political expedient.  Taking away P.R. and giving the direct vote and single member constituencies will in no way cure any of our economic ills. That can be done only by gaining the goodwill of every citizen, something the Government apparently are not seeking.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Taoiseach to have this matter considered by a joint committee of both Houses of Parliament. If he tries to force this measure through the House and then through the country he is doing a great disservice to the nation and he will rue the day because he will be responsible for introducing a type of political development that will not be for the benefit of the nation.  I appeal to him <Col N="731" /> as a businessman to find another solution for this problem which is one of economics rather than politics.  The suggestion has been made by other speakers that a commission of both Houses should be set up to suggest the best means of giving us the type of representative government that can give us the best results.  That is what the Irish people want and what each of us should want, but that is not what is being given in this Bill.</P>
    <P>I propose to vote against the measure and to use any influence and energy I have in trying to have it defeated in the country because I believe it is against the best interests of the nation.  From discussions I have had, I am aware the people did not know what it was about when it was originally proposed.  I think the Government will lose on this issue when it goes to the country.  Rather than have that happen, would it not be better to try to find another solution for our political institutions by getting some disinterested group such as can be found in both Houses of the Oireachtas to recommend the best type of electoral and political system to serve the nation, not the interests of a political Party?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrady2" hpid="Mr. Brady Mr. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>I intend to be very brief because the Bill has been debated for the last three or four months in Dáil Éireann and is now in its fifth day in the Seanad.  The Bill is a good one and I support it.  It is long overdue.  I have been a long time in public life and I can remember when we in Clare, as far back as 1917, had the grouping system for members of Parliament&mdash;as it was called then&mdash; and for county councils and district councils.  All were elected on the straight vote system and the terrible things now predicted for that system were not visible in those days.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Taoiseach came to Clare he was practically an unknown man and he came to fight a man who was probably one of the best known, most popular and best-connected men in the county.  That election was fought on a straight vote and everybody knows what the result was.  Long before I <Col N="732" /> ever thought of going into a county council&mdash;I shall have 34 years' experience as a member of a county council next June&mdash;I remember the very fine men elected to those councils on the straight vote system and on the grouped areas.  I cannot understand the air of despair and despondency on the part of Fine Gael and the Labour Party.</P>

      <P>I am not in the habit of interrupting and I believe I am entitled to speak without interruptions so long as I do not tread on anybody's corns, something I do not intend to do. This Bill will strengthen democracy here.  We have heard a good deal about commissions but who is to constitute the commission?  To my mind the highest court under Heaven, as far as we are concerned, is the Irish people and if we think we are keeping the Bill from the people and that the people are as gullible as some of the intellectuals in the Seanad believe&mdash; they seem to think the people down the country are all of a very low standard of intelligence&mdash;they are making an awful mistake as they will find out later on.  Despite the highflown utterances in this House on either side there are very intelligent people down the country.  Are they not the backbone of every national movement?</P>
      <P>Great play has been made to suggest that the Taoiseach has brought in this Bill to try to perpetuate Fianna Fáil and to entrench them more firmly.  I think Fianna Fáil have got on very well under the present system.  They got what very few expected in the last election.  There had been two Coalition Governments, and the people were so disgusted&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that they gave a clear vote to the Taoiseach and gave him a clear majority to form a Government, a strong Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was very amusing the other night to hear Senator Dr. O'Donovan, one <Col N="733" /> of the men who was supposed to rejuvenate Fine Gael according to the ex-Taoiseach.  He said that three Deputies just said: &ldquo;If you do not give us what we want, we are going to bring down the Government.&rdquo;  And they did bring down the Government &mdash;twice.  To my mind that is a farcical situation when three Deputies can bring down a Government of 146 Deputies.  It just shows the futility of the P.R. system.</P>
    <P>I believe the system of the single non-transferable vote and the revised constituencies will be for the better of the country.  Any man with practical experience knows the difficulty of representing a constituency which possibly extends 100 miles in length.  Even in my own county, which is a small one, the constituency extends from the peninsula of Carrigaholt to Galway border.  In such a constituency, it is almost impossible to have proper representation, but I believe that in a single member constituency you will have a representative who will be responsible to the people, and whom the people will be able to contact easily.  As a result of that, you will have better government.</P>
    <P>A few moments ago Senator Burke said that in 1934 Fianna Fáil brought politics into the county councils.  I want to tell the Senator that it was not Fianna Fáil brought politics into the local councils in 1934.  It was Fine Gael.  It was General Eoin O'Duffy and those associated with him, and the Blue Shirt organisation. They said they would sweep the country and that they would carry 20 out of 23 councils.  With their friends here in the Seanad they held up the extension of the franchise, and the result was that it was only extended to ratepayers on that occasion.  Was that democracy?  They delayed that Bill until the local elections were over but, even though the local elections were fought under the restricted franchise, Fianna Fáil got a sweeping victory at the polls.  That was the will of the people which they had tried to thwart by their votes in the Seanad.  I did not intend to introduce that point but, since Senator Burke brought it in a few moments ago, I <Col N="734" /> want to tell him that his statement is not correct.</P>
    <P>When I hear about Independents and non-political people my eyes open and I begin to think because, to my mind, there are very few non-political people in this country.  People pretend that they are non-political but it is a sham.  I would much prefer to see a man openly oppose me rather than the fellow who rubs me down the back and pretends he is my friend.</P>
    <P>I believe that with the enactment of this Bill the people will get the Government that they want, and I also-believe that the Opposition will get their chance.  If there is a swing to the left the people can turn out a Government elected under the straight vote, just the same as they can turn out a Government elected under the other system.  The Bill has been debated for a long time.  At a meeting of the Clare County Council the Chairman of Fine Gael there spoke about it for approximately an hour and a half.  Despite that, and with the support of his assistants, he was able to secure only nine votes out of 31 against it.  I come from the Taoiseach's constituency and I am very proud to be here to support this Bill and to vote for it.  I believe it will confer great benefit upon the country.  The Parties now lined up against this Bill are the same as those who denounced the Constitution and every other Act meant for the good of the country.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, may I say that a reference was made to me in the Seanad by a certain gentleman the other night?  I believe that reference refers to my personal honesty and my personal integrity.  The people of County Clare know me, and everybody belonging to me for three and four generations, and there was nothing we did that was not in the national interests and was not on the side of the people.  I want you, a Cathaoirligh, to see it is entered on the records of this House that that statement was an utter falsehood.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardMcGuire" hpid="Mr. McGuire Mr. McGuire">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGuire</NameTxt>
      <P>If I had spoken earlier in this debate I would have directed my arguments in some detail to the propositions put up in support <Col N="735" /> of this Bill, but I think it is quite unnecessary, at this stage, to take up in detail the arguments, the main arguments, put up by the Taoiseach and the sponsors of the Bill who propose the removal of P.R. from our system and its replacement by the single nontransferable vote.  I think that any fair-minded person would say that this is one of the best debates we have had in this House.  All the arguments have been very well made on the point concerning how P.R. is working here and, particularly, how it is working in other countries.  I, therefore, propose to deal in a rather general way with some ideas which, I may say, have occurred to me as a result of this debate.</P>
      <P>At the outset I would say that I think I was in the same position as everybody else when this question first came up.  I had not really thought about it and, in fact, I can say that now, having thought about it&mdash;having been made to think about it&mdash;I am sorry that this issue has been presented to the House.  I think it is a pity, and I think it is puzzling it has been raised at this time.  If the truth were only known I think the Government Party themselves were surprised and puzzled when the issue was introduced so very recently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At this stage I think it is just not true to say that P.R. has not worked pretty well in this country, and it is a cause of disappointment for many people that the issue is now being brought forward. It is equally not true to declare that any body of opinion believes that the British system of election is a better one than the one we have here.  We have covered a lot of ground in comparing P.R. in other countries, but I suggest that the really important thing at the end of this debate should be to decide for ourselves how P.R. has worked here in the past, and whether it has worked fairly well.  The speeches of all of the Independent members, both in this House and the other House, excepting two in the other House and one in this House, and the speeches of the representatives of the various Parties, with one exception, <Col N="736" /> have paid tribute to the fact that P.R. has worked well and fairly here.  It has given us stable government.  All the Independent speakers, with the exception of one, admit that it has given us stable government here, and has made every citizen feel and know that he has had a voice in the Government and Parliament of the country, and has been represented fairly in that Parliament.</P>
    <P>The system that is being proposed to us now it is admitted&mdash;these are not my words&mdash;is designed to eliminate the effectiveness of many groups.  We are told it is designed to get rid of small Parties and to have two big Parties.  In the debate in the Dáil and Seanad there were only three Independent speakers who could be found to support the Government Party in their proposal to remove P.R.  All the other Parties and the Independent representatives, including the six university representatives in the Seanad, have opposed the proposal.  That fact alone should make it clear that there is no real support for the abolition of P.R. outside the Government Party.</P>
    <P>The Independent representatives, both in the Dáil and in the Seanad, have certainly justified themselves as being very worthy and desirable people to have in Parliament.  Their contributions on this subject alone have shown that.  One of the major propositions in this Bill is that there should be only two Parties in the future.  That has been quite blatantly and clearly stated. That very fine element which has shown itself to be so useful here is to be deliberately eliminated and cannot get into Parliament, only in odd numbers, by mistake.  If they do get in, it will have to be understood to be a mistake because, apparently, the Government do not want them; they want only the two big Parties.</P>
    <P>It is fair to say that the contribution in opposition to this Bill has been reasoned and scientific.  That characterises all the speeches that have been made, I say quite bluntly, mostly against the Bill.  Those characteristics have been very noticeable.  The speeches made by Independents and by members of this side of the House have been in marked contrast to the very arbitrary and weakly-constructed case which has <Col N="737" /> been made by the Government Party for the removal of P.R.</P>
    <P>It is quite clear that little thought has been given to the contents of this Bill.  I believe that the decision was made first and the arguments manufactured afterwards.  The whole proposal has been conceived in impatience and introduced in haste.  This Bill can be put over only by the votes of an electorate that have not had a proper opportunity of studying or understanding what they are asked to do. That is the greatest danger in the situation.</P>
    <P>When this Bill was first introduced here, I did not think very strongly about it, but I think very strongly about it now because, sometimes when a matter is brought to one's notice and one hears the arguments, one begins to see that there are very deep issues involved.  Such is the case in this instance.  The great danger in having this referendum is that the people will not be in a position to understand the issue.  It is all very well to say that the people will be the final judges, but there is no use in going before a judge who does not know what he is talking about.  It will take a long time to get the people to understand the very deep issues on which they are asked to say, &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There is no real case for a referendum. The referendum should be used only to decide questions of burning or urgent national importance.  A referendum should be the result of a clear and persistent demand over a long period from the people on some point of issue which has caused, perhaps, great dissension and discussion.  It is not a matter of suddenly taking a matter out of the hat and saying: &ldquo;Let us have a referendum about it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I suggest that this is an artificially created problem.  A year ago, nobody regarded the question of the abolition of P.R. as an issue, not to say a major issue demanding a referendum.  One of the most dangerous things in the situation is that it is a misuse of the referendum provision and an abuse of the Constitution to have a referendum on this matter and to make it an issue in relation to our Constitution.  This <Col N="738" /> referendum should not be held and, if it is held, it should be held at a very much later date.  There should be years of discussion before such a matter is referred to referendum.</P>
    <P>As I have said, the Fianna Fáil Party were no less surprised than anyone else when this issue was raised. I was surprised, and many people were disappointed, at the brevity and weakness of the Taoiseach's introductory remarks on this Bill, for the very reason that this is of such major importance as to demand a referendum. The Taoiseach dismissed it in a few cursory words and general references, some of them rather vague, to the undesirability of small Parties and to how P.R. did not work in other countries, and so on.  That was an indication of the weakness of this Bill.  I shall refer later to what I think was the reason for introducing this Bill and the reason it was so difficult to find cogent arguments to support the proposals.</P>
    <P>Most business people whom I have met, including very strong supporters of the Government Party, regard the Bill as being unrealistic and unnecessary. They consider that there is unnecessary preoccupation with a purely political issue, which has been artificially created at a time when it is so urgent that we should be engaged in solving our economic problems.  To give the Government their due, they have these problems in mind, as indicated in their White Paper and in the report by Mr. Whitaker which they allowed to be published, but they would have been far better advised to have directed all their energies towards those matters rather than to occupy the time of the Oireachtas for weeks past with this issue.  When I have asked the business people to whom I have referred what they think about the Bill, the reply is: &ldquo;To tell you the truth, I have not thought about it at all.  I do not know very much about it.&rdquo;  One man has said to me:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;This preoccupation with purely political matters while serious economic problems remain to be solved is bringing politics and politicians into discredit and deservedly <Col N="739" /> so, particularly when it is made to appear that the old men and the old Parties in the political life of this country seem to want to cement themselves there forever and to drive youth and other people into the grooves that have been so deeply furrowed over the past 30 or 40 years and out of which many of the younger people want to get.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is very frightening.  It is wrong that politics and politicians should be discredited.  Very often, politicians do not deserve the remarks made against them.  To introduce Bills like this Bill and to try to divide the country into two Parties and to force people into separate ways of thinking is, in fact, to bring politics and politicians into discredit.  I should like to make it clear that I make no imputation against the Taoiseach or anybody that he is consciously doing that.  I am just saying that he is unwittingly doing so.  If we were to subscribe to it, we would be parties to that sort of thing.</P>
    <P>The sponsors of the Bill seemed at times to be puzzled as to why Fine Gael should not join with them in this, because, they say, Fine Gael will benefit ultimately, that it will be only a matter of time until Fianna Fáil become unpopular and that Fine Gael will be the natural Party to swing into Government.  I say, quite honestly, that I am glad that Fine Gael did not enter into a sort of agreement to share the spoils alternately.  Up to the time of the first inter-Party Government, we did not realise that there could be a genuine coming together of people in coalition that would be wholehearted and that would not be the sordid thing that it has been made out to be.</P>
    <P>I genuinely believe that we should have P.R., that we should have small Parties and that we should be able to co-operate with them.  I shall not reiterate what has been said already.  The whole basis of life is co-operation and working with people, even though you may not like them.  I have to do that. I am President of the Federated Union of Employers and am supposed to be very conservative.  The selfish side of <Col N="740" /> me would like in my own business in the employers' organisation, to be allowed to do what I should like to do, but we work with labour.  Originally, we had to whether we liked it or not; now we do it because we like it.  Industrial relations are on a very high level in this country now because employers and workers have learned to work together.  First of all, our fathers before us did not like trade union leaders telling them what they would like them to do and what they could do, but that has all gone.  Now we cooperate willingly and in the interest of all.  I feel the same thing in Government. It has been said here that the Coalition was a pure marriage of convenience, and a sordid affair, but it did not work out that way.  I think it is a great mistake to represent coalitions as a collection of crackpots and splinter people getting together and squabbling all the time.  That is not true.</P>
    <P>The Minister for External Affairs really showed the mentality and mind of the Government on this matter when he said there were 80 Parties in pre-Hitler Germany.  It is a bad comparison and a good example of how his mind is running.  What has happened in this country is that Fianna Fáil genuinely believe that coalitions are terrible things.  The reason is that they have been in undisputed power for so long that they do not understand working with other people because they have not had to do so. They look upon other people as nuisances and as being in the way.</P>
    <P>Like the rest of our Party, I have had my experiences with the inter-Party Government.  I may say now that I was often annoyed with Deputy Norton when he was Minister for Industry and Commerce&mdash;and I said so at different times, but now, looking back on the whole matter, I do not think it was a bad thing to have a Labour Minister for Industry and Commerce.  Labour experience there was very desirable.  The differences between the Parties in Germany, Italy or anywhere else are major differences. As previous speakers here have pointed out, the differences between the Parties in those countries were <Col N="741" /> major differences: they often had totally different philosophies.  But here, for example, I agreed about 90 per cent. with the Clann na Poblachta Party.  I agreed about 90 per cent. with the Labour Party and I agreed about 95 per cent. with the Clann na Talmhan Party.  That is about the difference that existed in our relationship. It is not a fundamental difference; it is only a shade.  You have the very same differences within a single big Party.</P>
    <P>It has been said that a single Party can represent everybody.  That is not my experience.  I find that, even in Fine Gael, I am frequently, as an employer, in a small minority.  I cannot sometimes make myself felt as I should like.  It is the same with a lot of other units.  Although we stand together as a Party, there are times when certain groups are not satisfied with what they are able to achieve. Because I can adjust myself, I am satisfied with what I get in my Party, but there are others who want more freedom to manoeuvre.  These are the kind of people who must be given freedom to form other Parties, the so-called small Parties.</P>
    <P>I think all this talk about the evil of coalitions is something that has been worked up as a result of the upset of the Fianna Fáil Government in 1948.  This Bill has been brought in here with the avowed intention of trying to avoid coalitions in the future. We have been told that they are bad and so on.  I think the Bill is not so much devised against coalitions as against &ldquo;the Coalition&rdquo;.  It was brought in merely because it was decided by Fianna Fáil when the first Coalition of 1948 came into office, that they would never let it happen again.  Then the philosophy of the two great Parties was built up.  If the effect of the inter-Party Government in 1948 was to make Fianna Fáil sit up and take greater notice of things then, even from the point of view of Fianna Fáil and from the point of view of the welfare of the country, the Coalition was a good thing.</P>
    <P>Any Party in power for 17 years without a break needs some skids put under them and a break from office. <Col N="742" /> The Coalition put new people into new seats and brought a breath of fresh air into the life of the country.  In some cases the persons may not have been as good as their predecessors, while in other cases they were better than their predecessors.  If it took an inter-Party Government or a coalition Government to do that, then it was a good thing and there was nothing wrong with the coalition Government or the inter-Party Government that did it.  If the Bill is based on that sort of argument it is not a good argument. If that type of argument is the one upon which the Bill relies, then I would not vote for it or advise anybody else to vote for it.</P>
    <P>Mention has been made of the British system.  It has quite clearly been stated by supporters of Fianna Fáil that the British system has worked well in Britain and in Canada.  I think it has not worked well in Britain.  It is not democratic or stable and it does not give the confidence that is claimed for it.  I think the system in Britain is one that hands over the electorate to Party bosses.  Five-sixths of the seats are safe seats and therefore can only be handed out by the ruling Parties. The remaining one-sixth are marginal seats which alternate between one Party and the other&mdash;leaving nine-tenths of the seats marginal.  Therefore, only one-tenth of one-sixth of five-sixths is what the voter is allowed to decide&mdash;a Party like the Liberals or Independents.  They get one-tenth of one-sixth of five-sixths.  Surely that is not a democratic system?</P>

    <Speaker pid="EdwardMcGuire" hpid="Mr. McGuire Mr. McGuire">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGuire</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to get into a lot of figures just now.  I am talking broadly on the matter.  We were also told that we will get better quality representatives if we get back to this single vote system, in the words of the Minister for Lands, for instance, speaking in Dublin last week-end and as reported by all the newspapers: &ldquo;We believe that we will have more vigorous and significant personalities in the Dáil with a single vote system.&rdquo; However, the Minister was slightly unfortunate <Col N="743" /> in that, I think on the same day, there was a reference in the leading article in the <i>Irish Times</i> which I will quote because the quality of the people elected under the British system is referred to.  The reference is to Mr. Hyde and the Bournemouth case of Mr. Nicolson:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Mr. Hyde has represented North Belfast since 1950; and in that time he has shown himself to be a broadminded parliamentarian who, unlike most of his Unionist colleagues at Westminster, has not been afraid occasionally to speak and vote against the official &lsquo;line&rsquo; of the Conservative Party.  He adopted an &lsquo;unpopular&rsquo; attitude to the controversial Wolfenden Report; he spoke up against the retention of capital punishment (a decision which, he suggested yesterday, was the crucial reason for his rejection by the association); and he has supported Dublin's claim to the Lane pictures.  He has also written a number of books, including studies of Oscar Wilde and Roger Casement. It is a fair guess that the policy-makers at Unionist headquarters have been as uneasy about his presence at Westminster as the officers of the Bournemouth East Conservative Association have been &mdash;and are&mdash;over their representation by Mr. Nigel Nicolson.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This is the point:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The two cases have an essential ingredient in common: both Mr. Nicolson and Mr. Hyde are the sort of men who believe that members of Parliament should not hand over their minds to the party machine, for better or for worse.  If the humane and thoughtful unorthodoxy with which they are associated is to be blacklisted, parliamentary representation henceforward might as well be confined to the Party Whips.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think if this is an example of the British system as a fair system, giving fine representation, it is a poor one. I am afraid it was just unlucky that the Minister for Lands made his statement on the same day as that leading <Col N="744" /> article appeared in the <i>Irish Times.</i>  It states the facts.</P>
    <P>If we do away with P.R. we know that the Party will have the picking of the men who are to be representatives. There will be only one man in each constituency.  Under the present system we have choice of Parties and, within the Parties themselves, we have a choice of men.  At Party conventions&mdash;at Fianna Fáil conventions as well as at ours and at others&mdash;headquarters in Dublin would like a certain person in the constituency but if somebody there does not like or does not want the person in question because it is felt there is a better local person for the candidature the position up to now has been that at least they could put up the local man as one of the three in the Party and thus the people had a fair choice.  That was democracy not only between the Parties but within the Parties.</P>
    <P>We are doing away with all that now.  We are going to have safe seats. I do not want to delay the House by dwelling unduly on the case of a Party seat in Waterford City in the days of John Redmond.  The Party seat was in the hands of the leaders of the Party and in those days the leader was John Redmond.  The man whom he picked was the man who was voted for and that was the end of it.  That is a retrograde step.  If we do that, how will a young Party ever start?  They cannot start from nothing.  Anybody who knows anything about politics knows that a Party will never get anywhere unless they are able to get somebody into Parliament.</P>
    <P>You cannot run a Party outside Parliament and if we are making Parliament a closed shop, are we going to propagate Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael forever?  I think that is a pity.  We are a small country and, in fact, our Christian society here, and our Churches, tell us that the best system is one based on vocational lines.  We are going to rule out any form of vocationalism in our Parliament.  It is unrealistic to think that we can have a healthy vocational life while we have a completely non-vocational system in our Parliament.  We are a small country and all should work together in one united philosophy.  I suggest <Col N="745" /> the emphasis should be on the individual, the group and the small Party all working reasonably and in harmony together.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGuire</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry I am not able to give more accurate information at the moment.  The safe seats are so big as to be really most dramatic and overbearing.  As I said, I do not intend to cover any ground already covered except where it is necessary.  I thought it rather futile to be bringing up all these arguments about P.R. in other countries and I was glad that the people on this side of the House went into the matter in great detail.  I think it is futile to be saying that P.R. did not work in Cuba or here, there and everywhere, when all we have to do was to look at ourselves. One might as well say nobody should get married because marriage is not a success in Hollywood.  That is the argument we have had produced here.  I submit it is quite irrelevant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One country which was trotted out again and again as an example of the failure of P.R. was France and we were told to look at the awful things which have happened there.  P.R. in France does not bear the slightest resemblance to our system here.  The French system was designed to keep out de Gaulle and the Communists. The Communists got about one-quarter of the votes and only got ten or 12 seats.  It was said that they would fit in four taxicabs and the <Col N="746" /> French taxicabs are pretty small.  I only mentioned France because it shows the kind of argument that has been produced and misused here.</P>
    <P>I would like now to come back to the original proposition.  I think P.R. has worked very well here and I think it will work well in the future.  It would be a very retrograde step to get back to the single vote.  It would be letting us down in lots of ways and it would be justifying the North of Ireland.  The system in the North of Ireland is quite unjustifiable and it does not give the Nationalists a fair crack of the whip nor proper representation. Even if we did want to change P.R. here we should not have brought the matter up now.  For tactical reasons alone we might have kept it in abeyance until we did something for our Nationalist brothers in the North of Ireland.  If they had P.R. in the North of Ireland they would have a strong Opposition.  Down here we have seen how all sorts of people can get together, employers, workers and others, and are able to work together for certain aims, even if the aim is only to get rid of the existing Government.  If P.R. operated in the North we would get elements such as Labour, which are splintered at the moment, Nationalist elements, Sinn Féin and the National Party, to work together.  One thing on which they would all unite would be to get rid of the Government.  There is no way of uniting them at present.</P>
    <P>I suggest that P.R. is a good system. It has worked well and it could be made to work better if we became more politically mature.  There is another letter in the papers to-day which raises a point which I think nobody has mentioned and that is the biggest split of all can come within a big Party.  Why are Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael in existence to-day?  They are in existence because of a split over the Treaty.  You can mend splits between small Parties.  They can join together and sometimes their borders are so blurred that it is hard to see any difference between them.  You might have a split over some big issue in the future, perhaps something like the one we had on the Treaty.  In that <Col N="747" /> way we are going to all this trouble for something that is not even certain to arise.</P>
    <P>I would like now to refer to one point made repeatedly.  It is quite clear that this idea was first decided upon and the arguments brought out afterwards. The arguments were used over and over again&mdash;the idea of the splinter Parties, the evil of coalitions and, in addition, the argument that we were preventing the people from making a decision on this matter.  I suggest that the argument that, by debating this Bill and by trying to defeat it here, we were preventing the people from voting upon it does not hold water. There might have been something in it as regard the Dáil but it shows the completely mechanical form of arguments put up for the Bill.</P>
    <P>We know that whatever we do in this House, if we talk about the Bill for three months and then vote against it, the referendum will still be held and the Bill will come into operation 90 days after it has been passed by Dáil Éireann.  I think I am correct in that. That argument that we are holding it up then has no validity at all.  The only reason we have gone on talking about this Bill&mdash;and everybody who spoke on this side of the House had something new to contribute&mdash;is that the electorate needs time to consider the Bill.  Let them have the referendum, but in fairness, and as Irishmen, we should not look upon it as a question of the Government scoring over the Opposition or the Opposition scoring over the Government.</P>
    <P>I suggest that there are men on the other side of the House and sponsors of the Bill who do not know what is in the Bill.  That being so, I do not think we should leave any stone unturned to acquaint the public about it.  That is the only reason we are holding it up and trying to get everyone on this side of the House to make a positive contribution of his own.  We have not made merely speaking points.  I can say that I have not seen any of them. There have been some produced by the Party, but I have not seen them and most of the other speakers have not seen them.  We tried to produce genuine arguments, knowing the seriousness <Col N="748" /> of the question, with a view to having the public decide; as if they decide for or against the Bill, the decision should be on the merits on whether they honestly believe what they are talking about, whether they honestly believe we should have P.R. or do away with it.  It is only in that knowledge that there will be a genuine and a right decision given on this question.</P>
    <P>It will be a pity if this referendum is pushed through merely to &ldquo;vote Dev&rdquo; or to vote Fianna Fáil or to vote anti-Fianna Fáil.  If the people are going to say &ldquo;yes&rdquo;, without considering or knowing what they are doing, it will be a tragedy for the country.  I hope that the speeches made on both sides, in this House and in the other House, will be promulgated round the country and will be read by as many people as possible, so that they will have a proper understanding of what they are doing when they vote &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo; at the referendum.  I hope that the proposal will be defeated and from what we have seen happening in debating societies and elsewhere, I think it will be defeated.</P>

      <P>It was expected here and it was expected down the country that in the course of this debate we would have heard good, rousing, intelligent speeches, especially from the Opposition speakers defending their attitude towards this Bill.  What have we had?  We have had most disappointing speeches from those from whom we expected something sensible. In most cases, their attitude to the Bill could be compared with the aim of the last Russian satellite to the moon&mdash;it went so wide of the moon that it orbited around the sun.  It would give one the idea that some of the speakers went into orbit with it and that some of them went so close to the sun that they got a bit of scorching before arriving back, and it is doubtful if some have not remained there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In his opening remarks, the Leader of the Opposition, Senator Hayes, might have given us something useful in the way of comment.  Instead, what were we greeted with?  &ldquo;The outcome of an election under the <Col N="749" /> straight vote system,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;would result in the two major Parties involved in the civil war being lined up against one another.&rdquo;  How was that statement to be accepted down the country?  With everything poised for another rattle, in other words? Would that be the true position, if we did have, and when we will have, an election under the straight vote system?  Even speakers on the opposite side have disagreed among themselves as to the results.</P>
    <P>Senator Hayes went further.  He feared that the people would be allowed to forget the bitterness of the past and he mentioned executions, and so on.  It is about time that men of his calibre tried to let the young people forget those times.  Some of the speakers, especially those on the Front Benches opposite, have stated that an election under the straight vote system would wipe out all the other Parties. There is even one Senator opposite who has counted the number of seats that would be gained by Fianna Fáil and the number that would be gained by the others.  He gave 120 to Fianna Fáil and 20 to all the others.  He must have spent a long time with the commission that is to set up the constituencies and he must have counted the votes in each constituency.  It would be interesting to know how he arrived at his figures.  It must be the scientific approach of which we were told by one of the learned speakers opposite.</P>
    <P>I was speaking to some of the people in the West of Ireland since last week.  They read some of those learned speeches and their attitude appears to be that the whole trouble in the world to-day is created by scientists and they say: &ldquo;God help us if the scientists have anything to do with it any more.&rdquo;  We have only to mention the fact that the scientists have recommended that we retain P.R. and we have no further trouble about getting them to do what is right.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested from the benches opposite that the purpose of this Bill is to put Fianna Fáil into office in perpetuity.  Its purpose is to give the people an opportunity of deciding whether they want this straight vote system or P.R.  Surely, no speaker <Col N="750" /> opposite will say that the people are so ignorant that they cannot decide for themselves what system of voting they want and what system they should have?  It has been said that under the straight vote system, all the others will be wiped out, leaving only Fianna Fáil.  Some speakers say that, while others disagree with them.  If all others are wiped out, as some say, who is it that is wiping them out?  Is it Fianna Fáil or is it the electors throughout the country?  It is the people who will be responsible and if they decide that all others should be wiped out, who is he who can say that they are not entitled to do that, if they so wish?</P>
    <P>As far as we can judge, the main opposition to this Bill arises from the fact that the people opposite do not trust the people any more.  The words of a Roman dictator were at one time: &ldquo;Never trust nobody.&rdquo;  That is the attitude of the Opposition here&mdash;do not trust the people; do not trust the members of the commission which is to be set up.  Although 50 per cent. of the membership of the commission will be their own people, they do not trust even that 50 per cent.  Have we not had concrete evidence that in the whole coalition framework during their two régimes, they could not trust one another even during those two short terms?  This Bill proposes to allow the people to decide whether they want P.R. retained in their system of election or whether we should go back to the system that obtained here in 1918.  Although we hear speakers in the Front Benches opposite say that the P.R. system is traditional here, I remember as a garsún a famous election in Galway in 1918 under the straight vote system.  The people understood it then and, please God, they will understand it to-morrow too.</P>
    <P>The fault we find with P.R. is that it fosters small Parties and encourages coalition government.  I need not dwell on the undesirability of having another coalition administration here for a very long time at any rate.  Many notable public speakers have been quoted as speaking against P.R., perhaps the <Col N="751" /> most notable being a former Minister in the Cumann na nGaedheal Government. He said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;If we have a multiplicity of Parties the coalition is formed after the election and not before.  The voters are given no opportunity on it or on the programme adopted for the purposes of the coalition until too late, that is until after the next election.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That gentleman, Mr. Blythe, was speaking in Bray and the quotation is as reported in the <i>Irish Press</i> of the 10th February, 1959.</P>

      <P>I shall deal with Senator L'Estrange before I am finished.  As I was speaking of Mr. Blythe, I think I should refer to a scathing remark that was made towards him by a person from whom we would expect more, by a man who was a responsible member of the Coalition Cabinet, in relation to Mr. Blythe's cutting of the old age pension by 1/-.  The reference was a typical example of what you can expect from a Coalition Administration where a Minister can make a decision without the other members of the Cabinet being aware of it.  Perhaps Senator Dr. O'Donovan will inform us if that happened in the instance he gave. <Col N="752" /> Were all the members of that Government not responsible?  They must accept collective responsibility.</P>

That he should be attacked by a junior Minister of the Coalition Administration would lead one to believe that he had taken individual action, whereas he took action which was agreed on by the Cabinet.  Perhaps Senator L'Estrange will see the point now.</P>

      <P>We oppose P.R. because it fosters small Parties.  It encourages coalitions of splinter Parties to form &ldquo;a ramshackle government,&rdquo; to quote Mr. Blythe again.  We have experience of such government.</P>
      <P>In the course of this debate Fianna Fáil have been attacked for daring to change the system of election.  Yet we find that way back in 1933 the Cumann na nGaedheal Party after being re-baptised as the Fine Gael Party, issued an official statement of Party policy which included an item which read:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The abolition of the present P.R. system so as to secure more effective democratic control of national policy and to establish closer personal relationship between parliamentary representatives and their constituents.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That was Fine Gael policy in 1933. Why have they turned tail in 1959? They intended to abolish P.R. in 1933 but they were abolished themselves instead.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lahiffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Our argument in favour of the abolition of P.R. is that it fosters the formation of small Parties which form coalitions and, in time, they break up under strain.  The example of what happened the two Coalition Administrations here has been quoted again and again, and it has <Col N="754" /> happened in other countries, too. Although it has been denied on the opposite side, it was responsible for the situation that grew up in Italy and Germany.  I shall quote again to impress on the people opposite the dangers that could accrue from the formation of coalitions which, in the main, are weak Governments.  I shall quote a statement by the President of the Democratic Party in Germany, Herr Naumann.  I am quoting a speech in Dáil Éireann on this Bill by Deputy Booth at column 1219, Volume 171, of the Dáil Debates:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I do not believe that we will get to a satisfactory solution of the problem of forming a majority, but I fear that we are creating a condition which can be remedied only by a later <i>coup d'état.</i>&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Deputy Booth continued:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Here in Germany under a P.R. system, there were 13 Governments, 11 of which were minority Governments. Again, there was the same trouble of the growth of Parties, the multiplicity of Parties, including, in this instance, the Nazi Party, until it got to the stage where there were over 30 political Parties operating in Germany, pulling and dragging against each other, making coalitions in the formation of cabinets increasingly impossible.  That continued until Hindenburg was unable to call on anyone to form a Government, anyone except Hitler.  Hitler, again like Mussolini, was the only man who was a man of strength and a man who knew where he was going.  Everyone else was dithering around, pulling and dragging and arguing their own Party advantage. Not only was that the end of the situation but that could not have happened if the Nazi Party had not been allowed to grow up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Anyone who looks dispassionately at the election returns of that time, will be quite clear that the Nazi Party would never have been able to gain in strength in the German Parliament, if it had not been for the P.R. system.  Once they got their toe in, the Nazi members surrendered a large proportion of their parliamentary <Col N="755" /> allowances to Party funds, thereby financing Party funds and allowing the Party to grow.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>And the Taoiseach put P.R. into the Constitution of 1937, knowing that had happened.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertLahiffe" hpid="Mr. Lahiffe Mr. Lahiffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lahiffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not interrupt Senator L'Estrange, although I was very much inclined to do so.  That was the case in Germany.  Poland is another country which had a P.R. system. From 1918 to 1926 it had 16 Cabinets with an average life of five and a half months each.  Obviously, the electorate lost heart.  It has been mentioned too that a similar position obtained in Italy.  The troubles there are not over yet.</P>
      <P>I quote again from the Dáil Debates, column 1218 of Volume 171, a speech by Deputy Booth.  He quotes Lord Curzon of the British Parliament, who is on record as saying that:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Italian Premiers and Foreign Ministers to whom he had spoken at the time, all blamed P.R. as the main reason for the political instability of Italy, prior to the advent of Mussolini.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Further on, he quotes Signor Alessio, who, in one of his speeches, said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Application of this system would lead to a very bad functioning of the Chamber, would make it impossible to form a lasting Cabinet and would bring about in the long run a paralysis of public life.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Everybody knows the result when you have a Government formed of groups with policies leading in opposite directions.  It has happened in the countries I have mentioned and it has happened here, too.  The wonder is that it lasted here so long.  We cannot afford to have a Government set up and find that within a short period there are dissensions within the Cabinet.  That must hinder the implementation of any semblance of a policy they may have declared on their formation.  You cannot have stability, and there is nothing more necessary than stable government at present.  We <Col N="756" /> need a Government that will at least run its full term of office in order to give effect to its policy, be that policy right or left.</P>
    <P>While it has been alleged by people opposite that Fianna Fáil, having brought in this measure, are determined to put themselves in the saddle in perpetuity, I think that argument is shattered as a result of some of their speeches.  I shall quote what General MacEoin said at Sligo a few evenings ago.  He stated that he did not subscribe to the idea that the abolition of P.R. would establish Fianna Fáil in office for ever because, he said, the Irish people knew how to deal with people who took too much.  It is a pity the Opposition cannot agree even amongst themselves.  General MacEoin does not subscribe to the idea that the abolition of P.R. will establish Fianna Fáil for ever.</P>

He made no attempt whatsoever to get the truth, though he could have done so.  Senator L'Estrange made the charge&mdash;Senator O'Donovan said it was a scandalous state of affairs&mdash;that in five county councils in which there is a Fianna Fáil majority not a single member of the Opposition was put on any of the subsidiary bodies.</P>

      <P>Senator Lahiffe will resume his seat, please. The recollection of the Chair is that it was when Senator Lahiffe made his statement about the General Council of County Councils that Senator L'Estrange intervened.  It was on that issue of representation on the General Council of County Councils.  I knew the Official Report was available and I wanted to have it clarified.  I hope it has been clarified now and that Senator Lahiffe will be permitted to proceed without interruption.  Senator Ó Maoláin, if I may say so, helped us by producing the Official Report.</P>

      <P>My point, Sir, is that if Senator L'Estrange did not mention the subsidiary bodies particularly, he did so by innuendo.  Now that he has admitted that he mentioned the General Council of County Councils, he is not correct in saying that County Galway representation is entirely Fianna Fáil.  Of course, if you are an Independent and you support Fianna Fáil now and again, you are branded as Fianna Fáil, but if you are an Independent and support the inter-Party or Coalition, you are still an Independent.  That is the attitude of Senators opposite.</P>

      <P>Let us get back to common sense, if we can.  Senator Quinlan suggested single seat constituencies with a transferable vote.  I wonder if he has considered how effective or otherwise such an election would be.  Take, for instance, a three-cornered contest such as we had in South Galway in the last by-election. There were three candidates for one seat&mdash;Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and Sinn Féin.  It could happen under P.R. that one or other of these could get 48 per cent. of the votes, another 35 per cent. and another 17 per cent.  In the process of P.R., the low man goes out and the transfer of his vote would mean that 17 per cent. would have the power of deciding that the 35 per cent. should get the seat as against the 48 per cent., or indeed one could say 49 per cent.  Is that a fair system of representation?  What is there in the policies of Fine Gael and Sinn Féin that could bring them together except just to put out Fianna Fáil and for no other reason?  Is that a system which would be proper and correct and which would lead to stable government? I do not think any sane member of the community, inside or outside the House, would say that such a system would bring about a result which would be fair.</P>
      <P>In a constituency not 1,000 miles away from my own, where there was a four-seat constituency, it happened in the last general election under P.R. that one Party got two and a half quotas and that resulted in electing only one member.  Is that fair representation under P.R.?  If it is, then they are welcome to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Opposition speakers have suggested that we should have appointed a commission from both Houses&mdash;I think that was the suggestion, but if I am wrong I can be corrected&mdash;to examine, first, what might happen from a change over from P.R. to the straight vote system.  If a commission is set up with <Col N="768" /> 50 per cent. from the Opposition and 50 per cent. from the Government side, and if that commission cannot be trusted by the Opposition, how can the Opposition trust another commission to examine anything?  I suggest that the best commission to examine anything in this line is that composed of the people themselves.  The people nowadays are intelligent enough and sufficiently versed in electing Governments, to be able to decide for themselves what exactly they want, how they should go about getting what they want, and by what system they can get what they want.  All that this Bill purports to do is to give the people an opportunity of deciding which system they want, and that opportunity is being denied them by the Opposition. The people themselves form the best tribunal on all such matters and it has always been the policy of Fianna Fáil, where their policy has been questioned or has been in doubt, to refer it back to the people to decide and, on every such occasion, the people have given wise decisions and sound judgment.</P>
    <P>We have Fine Gael protesting against an amendment to the Constitution. They now hail the Constitution as a sacred thing but what was their attitude when that Constitution was being enacted?  Did they hail it as a sacred instrument?  Did they not denounce it, bell, book and candle as they have denounced this Bill now? What has come over Fine Gael since then, and what has happened the Constitution that we now find them the sole protectors of that Constitution? Time has proven that they were wrong and I have no doubt but that time will prove that they are wrong now, too.</P>
    <P>It has even been suggested that this Bill is introduced just to keep Fianna Fáil in the saddle.  What did Fianna Fáil fear from P.R.?  Down through the years if any Party profited by P.R. Fianna Fáil did.  What hope is there of any other Party in this State to-day getting an overall majority under the P.R. system, if not Fianna Fáil?  How can it be said, or how can it be put across to the people, that Fianna Fáil are afraid of P.R.?  Fianna Fáil are not afraid of any system and they are not afraid of the people's <Col N="769" /> verdict.  If the people decide against them, they accept that decision without question.</P>
    <P>Senator McGuire stated that the issue is not of importance sufficient to justify holding a referendum, and he also asks why have it now?  We believe that the issue is of much importance just now.  Senator McGuire knows very well that, in order to have a referendum at all, you must have an overall majority in the Dáil to put the Bill through that House, and you must command a fair majority in this House before it can be put to the people. What hope is there of having such a measure brought before the Dáil by any other Government but the Fianna Fáil Government?</P>
    <P>He also asks why it is introduced now.  This is the time to revise the constituencies.  The 12 year period is up, and what is a more opportune time than to introduce this Bill now?  The simple answer to that question is that this is the most opportune time.  There is a Government strong enough to put the Bill through the Dáil, and we are taking advantage of the overall majority to give the people an opportunity of deciding for themselves.  None of the speakers opposite has given any indication of a better time.  I should like to know what would be a better time?  Should the constituencies not be revised now we would have to wait for another 12 years and meanwhile we might find ourselves in the condition, in which Senator L'Estrange said France was, when the world war nearly brought her to her knees.</P>
    <P>To conclude, I commend to the Opposition speakers, who have spoken against this measure, the speech made by a noble lady who is opposed to the abolition of P.R. but who stated that, though she is opposed to its abolition, she is not opposed to the people having a right to decide for themselves whether they want it or not.  That was stated here by Senator Mrs. Connolly O'Brien last week and the Opposition speakers, who speak so vehemently against this measure, should take heed of her attitude in regard to it.</P>

      <P>Even against orders, <Col N="770" /> I am compelled to say a few words to give my reasons for voting against this Bill.  Had I not so decided before coming into the House, the contribution of the last Senator who spoke would have compelled me to intervene. Listening to him it occurred to me that I never thought I would live to the time to hear the standard of debate in this House being so lowered as to permit reference to such trivial matters as the question of who was elected on a sub-committee down in Galway, or on similar committees here and there throughout the country. I shall not descend to that level though I have been a member of a council for the past 30 years.  There is, however, one thing of which I would remind Senator Lahiffe.  How often has a member of the Opposition been elected as Chairman of Galway County Council?  That is the acid test of justice and fair play&mdash; the rotation of the chairmanship.  I will not deal with that now.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall not enter into the row between Senator L'Estrange and Senator Lahiffe but I would say this to both of them.  The type of debate in which they have indulged is not the type of debate around which we should build a nation.  We should be above that.  It is painful to a man who has served Ireland to have to listen to that type of low stuff.</P>
      <P>As to my reasons for voting against this Bill, I am one of those who have mixed with people up and down the country, from the West of Ireland to Dublin, with a cross-section of the people, and I can follow and understand their views very well.  I have not met one person, even the most ardent Fianna Fáil supporter, who believes that P.R. should be abolished.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I challenge the Fianna Fáil people to say that a year ago, or two years ago, the question of the abolition of P.R. was raised at the annual meetings of that Party.  There has not been one word about it until the Taoiseach <Col N="771" /> introduced this Bill.  Of course, once the Taoiseach has spoken, the rest must obey.  My main reason for opposing the Bill is the fact that there has been no public demand for it.</P>
    <P>The last speaker's contribution to the debate indicated concern for the people.  He must have a very short memory.  The people and their views did not get respect in other times.  At one time it was suggested that the people had no right to go wrong, that the majority of the people were always inclined to go wrong and that majority rule was not sacred.  The words of Éamon de Valera were that majority rule was not sacred, that the majority of the Irish people were inclined to go wrong and to take the easy way, that it was the minority that was always right.</P>
    <P>Now there is a change.  The last speaker has drawn this out of me.  He asks what is the change that has come over the Fine Gael Party since 1927. I should like to know what is the change that has come over other people when they decry this very House and say that it should not exist? Changes have taken place.  It would be well if people could forget how often they have changed.</P>
    <P>Should not the Taoiseach be very well satisfied?  Has he not a nice majority in this House and a nice strong Opposition?  His policy is that there should be an Opposition but that it should be a one-Party Opposition. Are the people not entitled to elect whom they like?  Why should they be deprived of that right?  Why should they be compelled to vote Fine Gael or Fianna Fáil?  On a couple of occasions the Opposition were so strong that they formed a Government. Some people may not value my opinion but my opinion is that, if there were an election to-morrow on the present system, there would be a change of Government.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach referred to pre-election promises by small Parties.  If the Taoiseach had told the people before the last election that he would abolish the food subsidies, that he would introduce this Bill, that he would forget about old age pensioners, Fianna Fáil would not have got the majority that <Col N="772" /> they did.  I detest anyone, Independent or Party member, who promises something before an election that he has no intention of carrying out and that he knows he will not be able to carry out.  From the smallest Party to the largest Party, many promises have been made.  There were promises that food subsidies would not be withdrawn, that the people would be put to work.  Unfortunately, those promises were not kept.</P>
    <P>In view of the fact that the debate has proceeded for so many days, it is difficult to speak without repeating what others have said.  I shall try to avoid repetition.  According to the Taoiseach, it is a great crime to bargain.  Whether you call it bargaining or coming to an understanding, what is wrong in this country is that the leader of the Fianna Fáil Party is not prepared to see anybody's point of view but his own.  If he is replying to this debate I would ask him to say would it be wrong that we should bargain?  I do not like the word &ldquo;bargaining&rdquo; but it is a word that has been used to great effect.  If there is a strike, it is by bargaining it is settled.  After two years of bargaining there has been a recent trade union settlement whereby North and South have united.  It is really a question of reasoning.  Even in family disputes there must be reasoning and bargaining to arrive at a settlement.  Otherwise, there would be no regulation.</P>
    <P>I challenge the Taoiseach to say that it would be unjust to bargain and reason with our colleagues in the North.  I would go a very great distance in order to bring about Irish unity, so much desired.  If there were more bargaining and understanding of the other person's point of view and less vanity this country would have progressed more than it has.  A great deal can be achieved by bargaining and understanding.  Are not the people in the North Irish people?  We should bargain and reason with them.  I hope that the Taoiseach will live to be 100 but, in the last days of his active political career, it would be a great thing if he were to call on the Nationalists and others that might come along in the North and the representatives of Sinn Féin and influential Irishmen all over the world to meet in conference <Col N="773" /> in an effort to put Ireland's point of view before the nations of the world, to publicise the unnatural division of this country and the fact that there can be no happiness and prosperity as long as that division lasts.  Such action on the part of the Taoiseach would be preferable to the introduction of this measure which I may describe as another Bill to divide the people for another 40 years.</P>
    <P>I cannot see that it would be a crime for the Taoiseach to reason with the elected Deputies of Sinn Féin.  The Sinn Féin Deputies have not taken their seats in the Dáil.  There were others who were elected and who would not take their seats at another time.  Is it suggested that it is wrong now for others to do what we did at another time?  I would meet these people.  I would go a great distance along the road in order to show the justice of the claims of this country. The natural boundaries of this country are the seas around it.  Let them follow the pattern that has been given by the leaders of Labour.  I feel confident that, were that line taken, they would be different.</P>
    <P>I have not listened to all the speeches on the debate but I have read all the speeches made so far in this House and all the speeches on this Bill which were made in the other House.  I want to refer to a suggestion made by Senator Quinlan in the course of his speech.  While it was a great speech I must say I was very disappointed with his suggestion, as an educated man, that we should bring in representatives from other countries to tell us how we should elect our Parliament and our Government.  If there were need for it I would agree that that should be done but we have not got our country.</P>
    <P>I want to assure Senator Quinlan and the Taoiseach that we have not a country at all; we have only a part of a country.  If we had a country and if our nation were free and left completely to self-government then, in such circumstances, I have sufficient faith in the Irish people that they themselves would be able and have the ability to formulate a Constitution and a method of providing a Christian <Col N="774" /> Government.  I believe we would be able to have a type of Christian Government that would be the admiration of the nations of the world.  In other words, I believe we would be able, ourselves, to devise a system that would be leadership to the nations of the world.</P>
    <P>I was astonished by Senator Quinlan's suggestion that, at a time when we have only a portion of our country, we should bring in outsiders to tell us how we should elect our representatives.  The same applies as far as the Presidency of the country is concerned.  That is really the portion of the Constitution which we should be amending&mdash;that part of it which deals with the Presidency.  It says that we elect a President of Ireland. We do no such thing.</P>

      <P>Lest there should be any misunderstanding and lest people should say: &ldquo;Tunney's statement was giving encouragement to people to take other steps in connection with the freedom of this country&rdquo;, I want to emphasise that I am an out-and-out Constitutionalist.  I do not believe it is wise to use physical force and, in addition, I am an out-and-out Constitutionalist. I do not believe in <Col N="775" /> physical force against our people who are misled just as a lot of people in this part of the country are misled.</P>
      <P>This amendment to the Constitution was not requested by the people though we are being made to understand now that it is very important to them.  This amendment was not requested by the people&mdash;not even by the Fianna Fáil branch.  If the time spent on the debate on this amendment were devoted instead to bringing the resources of the State and the brains of the nation together to try to bring about the betterment of our people it would be a far wiser step.  We must not forget for one moment the large unemployment figure.  We should endeavour to prevent emigration and to do something for our people in the hope of building up the resources of our nation.  If we spent the time which we are devoting to the consideration of this Bill on seeking effective remedies for the painful economic problems which face us I believe it would give better results.</P>
      <P>I am very much interested in the question of unity.  While I disagree very much with the Taoiseach in his present methods, nevertheless I respect the fact that a very large section of our people admires the Taoiseach and thinks he is right.  I believe that if he gave the proper leadership he would have a very strong following.  As I said at the beginning of my speech, it is a pity he has not given this now to unite the people.  One of the oldest slogans in this country is: &ldquo;United we stand, divided we fall.&rdquo;  It is a pity that the last Bill which he is responsible for piloting through this House is not directed towards unity rather than division.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the method of election, Senator Lahiffe left himself very open by his statement that three candidates in Galway polled, respectively, 48 per cent., 35 per cent. and 17 per cent. and that he is against that and considers it dishonest.  Take a division in or around Dublin where you would have, say, a Labour candidate getting 5,000 votes, a Fine Gael candidate getting 5,000 votes and an Independent candidate getting 5,000 votes and then a Fianna Fáil man, say, <Col N="776" /> getting 5,001 votes and being elected although 15,000 persons voted against him.  If you like, we will reverse it and say, for example, that the Fine Gael man got the 5,001 votes.  Our friend says it would be wrong&mdash;that, on the second preferences, they would give him a majority.</P>
    <P>I hold that there is no majority unless you get, whether on first or second preferences, at least 51 per cent. of the votes that have been cast.  There is no use in saying that a certain position will arise, because there is no doubt that you will have such cases.  Down the country you will have a Fine Gael candidate, a Farmer and probably an Independent, and it will happen.  That is a type of majority that will embitter the people later on.  In many constituencies you will have a Sinn Féin candidate, a Farmers' candidate and a Fine Gael candidate.  I hold that if the other candidate were any good at all he would surely beat the lot of them.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil are established and, because of the length of time they have been in office, they have an advantage over our heads.  I congratulate Senator Donegan on pointing out another defect in the proposed method of election in so far as our country is concerned. First and foremost, this is an agricultural country.  What will happen if this new method of election comes into force?  You will have a Dublin and a town Government in this country.  Take the town of Clonmel as an example, where there are many thousands of voters.  In order to get the same number of voters in an agricultural area you would have to travel miles and miles.  It is obvious, therefore, that the farmers have not a chance against the candidate of any Party, as the town candidate will win every time.</P>
    <P>I want to impress upon Senator Lahiffe and the Fianna Fáil Party that we shall have a very poor type of Government if we do not bear in mind that this is an agricultural country.  I want Senator Lahiffe to examine his conscience in this respect and to try to see if what I am stating is correct. My fear is that we shall have as many Deputies for Dublin as for the entire Province of Connacht, plus Clare and Longford thrown in.  Is that a suitable <Col N="777" /> type of Government for this country? Where do the farmers come into the picture?  Where are the people who count?  The agricultural community are the backbone of the nation.  They stood behind Ireland's struggle for freedom and now they are being wiped out for a city Government.</P>

      <P>Before the adjournment <Col N="778" /> I was saying that I feel that the introduction of this measure is a grave injustice as far as minorities are concerned. No one will deny, and I am sure least of all the Taoiseach, that the farming community is entitled to representation, in other words, to send farmers to represent farmers if it so desires.  I am surprised that all the various farmers' organisations around the country, Muintir na Tíre and all the different organisations, are not absolutely up in arms against this Bill. It is something that is not alone going to deprive them of a Party, but is a measure that will give advantage to the town and city dweller, because you have the huge vote in the towns and voters there are nearer to the polling booths.  Farmers may live seven or eight miles away from the polling booths and unless they have somebody to bring them in to the booths they have no chance of voting.  In other words, this is an injustice to the farming and rural communities.</P>
      <P>On the question of representation I am astonished at the leader of the Fianna Fáil Party putting forward this Bill.  After all it is a Bill that must do untold injustice to the Labour Party.  I must remind the Taoiseach that the Labour Party deserves better. In 1916 when a section of the Irish people struck for liberty, Labour was there.  Labour through the Citizen Army took no small part in the struggle for Irish freedom.  They were never backward as far as the national position was concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At a time when some of our bravest men were on the brink of death on hunger strike in Mountjoy Prison, Labour and trade union organisations called out their men.  I was working on the railway at that time and I remember the stand taken, from North Circular Road to Dorset Street.  The men organised in a body and stood outside the prison and did not leave it until the British Government had to grant their request and release the hunger strikers.  It is sad to think that a Party that has served the country so faithfully, honestly and sincerely and who were always right in what they did&mdash;and it is the labourers and the farmers together who produce the <Col N="779" /> wealth of the nation&mdash;should, at a time when the Taoiseach has indicated that he is leaving public life, be rewarded in such a way.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would remind the Taoiseach that it was the Labour Party in the other House that put him into office.  I suppose people will now say it was wrong but that was the nearest thing to a coalition there could be and it should not be wrong to do now what was done at the establishment of the State.  Senator Lahiffe asked why had the Fine Gael Party changed.  They may have changed but they have not changed half as much as other people and Parties.  One thing certain is that the Labour Party and its policy have not changed since the State was established.  They were always prepared to stand in the gap of danger and help the cause of Irish freedom and unity.  They were ready to work to build up the nation and if they supported the Fine Gael Party and other Parties to form a coalition they were sent there by the people. Did they not have a perfect right to do that?  If we have freedom, we have freedom.</P>
    <P>I have a very open mind on the subject despite all the decrying of coalitions. My idea would be to pick the best people who would serve the country most sincerely and honestly. Do we forget the type of Government they had in Britain during the war and which got them up off their knees after the war?  I am not one to praise anything British but I would give credit where it is deserved and when one considers the state in which Britain was after the war&mdash;all the bombing, the destruction of Coventry and other cities&mdash;I believe no other country in the world could have pulled round in the same way as Britain did.  It was a Coalition Government that did that; it was not a one-Party Government.  Do the people who speak so much against coalitions think they are talking to a lot of fools?  They are not; unfortunately, there are many people in the country who have a certain respect for certain individuals and if these individuals tell them something they accept it without bothering to think or consider whether it is right or wrong.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="780" /> I do not intend to delay the House, as I understand Senators are anxious to have a decision to-night, but the Taoiseach should not forget that Labour played its part in the building up of the nation and his last Bill should not deprive the Labour Party of a say in the country's future. Labour deserve better than that.</P>
    <P>I have said that the curse of the country has been promises made by people going forward at election time, promises which are afterwards broken. I am sure Senator Lahiffe coming from a rural area must realise that we have native government only for the Twenty-Six Counties.  He referred to the revision of the constituencies.  I wonder how many Deputies will be elected in future for Mayo or for Galway under the new system?  It is a sad reflection on all Governments that despite the fact that we have native government for portion of our country our population is still decreasing. Going back to schools in rural areas you will find in the national school where there were 120 on the roll book in my time, there are now but 18 or 19.  If the people continue to go at the present rate you will not have more than nine or ten there in the future.</P>
    <P>I ask: is it considered that a Government composed in the majority of city Deputies will be very worried about the tenant proprietors of Connacht or Clare?  These tenant proprietors are the people who were the backbone of the nation in every struggle, in the days of the Land League right down to the end of the civil war.  I do not want to mention the civil war but, unfortunately, we had a civil war.  Right down to the end of that war it was those people who sheltered the men on the run, whose sons went out and whose daughters helped and who themselves were in the thick of the campaign for Irish freedom.  They suffered many privations and did not grumble.</P>
    <P>When the economic war came, it was for many of them a desperate struggle, but they did not murmur even though some of them lost everything they possessed and were absolutely beggared.  They took the view that it was better to finish the fight <Col N="781" /> then rather than leave it to future generations to do so.  It is a tragedy that there is not now a word about the Border, or about Britain being planted in portion of our territory more solidly than ever before.</P>

      <P>When I was in the West of Ireland, in Mayo, the idea of the people was that the country as a whole should be free.  That idea should not be shelved for such a matter as considering the way to elect representatives.  That is my opinion and I am entitled to express it.  If the Taoiseach had invited into a conference representatives of all sections, particularly Deputies elected by Sinn Féin, as he would have a right to do, as any leader of a country has a right to try to bring such people along if he thinks they are too extreme, and endeavour to coax them into taking a proper view&mdash;as he said himself, &ldquo;bargain&rdquo; with them, in the sense of reaching an understanding with them &mdash;it would be of great benefit to the Irish people, certainly of greater benefit than to spend 17 days in the Dáil and six or seven in the Seanad amending the Constitution&mdash;something nobody has asked for and something which is going to divide our people still further.</P>
      <P>Another matter I am very happy about is the stand religious minorities have taken in this connection.  I am proud to say that, in the Dáil and here, although they are on different sides, they are alive to the interests of the community.  It is heartening to find that these religious minorities have been willing to work with the Irish people as a whole to build up this nation.  Who amongst us would not admire the outspoken and honest views expressed by Senator Stanford and Deputy Booth, even though these views were not in agreement?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is wrong to suppose that all the people who are prepared to serve this country are on the one side.  Men like Deputy Mulcahy and Deputy MacEoin did excellent work in the struggle <Col N="782" /> against Great Britain.  Men like them come from both sides of the House and surely they should all be brought together.  To suggest that all the brains are on one side is absolutely wrong.</P>
    <P>I would appeal to the Taoiseach, even at the eleventh hour, to withdraw this Bill and thus bring back the spirit we had in 1918-20.  If he did that, he would be doing a good day's work and he would go to the Park with the prayers and good wishes of many of the Irish people.  It would be a terrible tragedy that the last act he performed should be something to divide us further rather than unite us.</P>
    <P>The Minister for External Affairs says the system of P.R. was imposed on us by the British Government; yet with our eyes open we are adopting the present British system.  I would agree that if there was any change, it should be to single seat constituencies but that P.R. should be retained.  I do not believe in the system whereby a man can be elected with 5,001 votes, although 15,000 people vote against him.  The system of election to local councils is contrary to the sense of the word &ldquo;local&rdquo; because in rural areas, you may have portions of a constituency 40 miles apart and a person may be elected who is not a local man at all.  I believe, therefore, that for local elections, single member constituencies are desirable.  The councillor elected would not be elected a second time, if he did not work honestly and in the interests of the people.  The same applies to Deputies, but not on the same basis.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, may I say I am sorry such an amount of time is being wasted in reintroducing a British system of election as at one time we tried strenuously to brush everything British from the country?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Callaghan</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator McGuire made a lengthy and, I am sure, learned speech.  The only idea I gathered from it was that the people on his side of the House made a very good case and the people on this side of the House made no case.  There are, of course, two opinions about that and we shall leave it at that.  Senator Tunney also made a lengthy speech and I think the gist of it was an appeal to the <Col N="783" /> Taoiseach to withdraw the Bill.  I do not think that is a sensible point of view.  The people will decide the issue and it is as well to leave it to them.</P>
      <P>I am a representative of agriculture here and before I make any remarks about the Bill, I should like to say a few words about agriculture, of course, relating my remarks to the Bill.  It is admitted by everybody that this country, from the agricultural standpoint, is one of the lowest developed countries in Europe.  This can be said to be due to the unstable conditions we have experienced in the past 100 years or so.  We had the Famine in which we lost half of our people.  We had the Land War with all its horrors and the frustration that followed it.  Then, of course, we had our quarrel with Britain and our quarrel between ourselves.  All these things held up our agricultural development and anything we can do now to stabilise conditions ought to be done.</P>
      <P>I was in Holland in 1938 and at that time they had had 100 years of peace, complete freedom from war or upheaval of any kind.  At the time I speak of, they were the first agricultural country in Europe&mdash;almost in the world, I should say&mdash;and they gave credit for the high development of agriculture to the peaceful conditions they had enjoyed for 100 years.</P>
      <P>Since this Bill was introduced, I have discussed it with many people, some of them coalition supporters. The general view is that the straight vote and the single member constituency make for stable conditions and that P.R. makes for splinter Parties, that splinter Parties make for instability and that instability makes for upheavals, turmoil and bankruptcy. We have had 40 years of P.R.  Previous to that, I had 20 years' experience of the single seat and the straight vote and I have no hesitation in saying that the latter is far more desirable for this country now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are asked what is the urgency about the referendum.  A man building a house lays particular stress upon the foundations.  If they are not right, <Col N="784" /> the house is not right.  When we are building up a young State, as we are, the foundations are very important, too.  That is sufficient justification for changing the system of voting we have had.  Senator Kissane quoted an Irish proverb, the sense of which was that the day of the storm is not the day of the scollop.  That applies in the present case.  When the Government have decided that the change is necessary, they would be lacking in their duty if they did not put it to the people. At least, give the people the opportunity of making the change.</P>
    <P>It has been said that there are more urgent things.  Nothing could be more urgent than stability.  Do the people opposite expect us to believe that P.R. and the multi-seat constituency will give us more stable conditions than the straight vote and the single constituency?  Nobody in his senses would believe it.  The Taoiseach is accused of changing his mind.  There are only two classes of people who do not change their minds&mdash;fools and dead men.</P>
    <P>This matter appeared on the agenda for the annual meeting of the Fianna Fáil Party on many occasions.  Motions from many different areas have come up and there has been incessant demand for the change.  Senator L'Estrange said the Taoiseach is wrong about this matter, that he was wrong about everything he ever did. He did not mention the £5,000,000 land annuities the Taoiseach got for this country.  If he did mention it, I am sure he could find that was wrong, too.  When people descend to personal abuse it only shows they have no arguments.  Loyalty to a good leader has always been a characteristic of the Irish people, but in the eyes of the Opposition the loyalty of Fianna Fáil to their leader is the greatest crime in the annals of history.</P>
    <P>At the Fine Gael Árd Fheis, Deputy Costello was reported in the Press as saying that the proposal to abolish P.R. may, in the long run, lead to the decline of Fianna Fáil and the upsurge of Fine Gael, and Deputy MacEoin is reported to have expressed the same sentiments.  Nobody can foretell what the people will do with the Bill.  Why <Col N="785" /> not let the people decide?  If the Opposition is entitled to take the view that this is a political matter, surely we are entitled to take the view that it is a selfish matter with the Coalition and that they are acting without any consideration for the future welfare of the country?</P>
    <P>Somebody told us that there are 300 types of P.R.  We had a system in connection with the Seanad elections 15 or 20 years ago, and I remember a number 80 vote deciding the issue between two candidates.  That was surely a gamble.  The man who marked that &ldquo;80&rdquo; on his ballot did not know what he was doing, I am sure, and had no intention of electing the man he elected.  There are many minorities in this country, and if we are to have P.R. at all, why not have a system to make provision for all the minorities?</P>
    <P>We are told by Fine Gael that in the next election under the straight vote and the single member constituency, Fine Gael will get only 20 seats. We are also told that Labour will be wiped out.  In the same breath, we are told that if there were a general election to-morrow, Fianna Fáil would be wiped out.  Is it not an opportune time to let the matter go to the people from the Coalition point of view?  If the people would wipe out Fianna Fáil to-morrow, they will object to the Bill, too.</P>
    <P>In the other House, Deputy Sweetman said there were ructions at the Fianna Fáil Party meeting when the Bill was being discussed.  Senator Sheehy Skeffington took a completely opposite view in this House.  He said something to the effect that the Party members were afraid to express their views of had no views to express.  Of course, the simple answer to that is that many members of this House, on both sides of the House, may not have as much eloquence or book knowledge as the Senator has, but might have just as much common sense.</P>
    <P>I read an article in the <i>Irish Times</i> on Saturday 14th, written by &ldquo;Quidnune&rdquo;. I think it would be no harm to read it for the House.  It states:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The P.R. debate has not been <Col N="786" /> marked by the scintillation of very much parliamentary wit, but it did produce one neat shaft in the Senate the other day.  The Fianna Fáil speakers, I am told, had been furnished&mdash;presumably by their headquarters&mdash;with one bundle of notes which was passed from hand to hand.  When the first speaker had finished, he passed it to the second, who spoke from it and passed it to the third&mdash;all, of course, saying much the same thing.</P>
    <P>This process was watched for some time with keen interest by Senator Owen Sheehy Skeffington, and he commented on it when he got to his feet.  &lsquo;I was aware,&rsquo; he said, that Fianna Fáil were committed to the principle of the single transferable vote, but I had not realised they were committed to the single transferable speech'.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>A lot of ideas about P.R. has been gleaned from books.  It is said that statistics can be made to prove anything, and I think that ideas from books can be made to prove anything, too.  I knew a farmer who had very little practical knowledge but had a lot of books.  He was never able to make his farm pay; he never brought out the right answer at the end of the year. We have had 40 years of P.R.; why not 12 years of the straight vote?  That is all the experience we need.</P>
    <P>There was a tirade of personal abuse of the Taoiseach.  Decent people are tired of that kind of thing.  It only shows they have no arguments.  I think the Opposition should listen to their leader Deputy MacEoin and get it out of their heads that this Bill is intended to wipe them out.  Governments will come and Governments will go, as Governments have always come and gone; and people will get tired of Governments, just as a woman gets tired of a hat.  There are two points of view in the House; the obvious thing to do is to let the issue go to the people, and let the people decide. Forget the despondency and the gloom. Pessimism is bad medicine; when taken in large draughts, it is rank poison.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>I have given considerable thought to the question as to whether or not I should intervene in this debate.  I look upon the decision which this House is called upon to take as one of the gravest, if not the gravest, since the establishment of the State.  In such circumstances, I do not feel I can remain silent since such silence on my part would be unfair to those who sent me to this House.</P>
      <P>The proposal put before the Oireachtas by the Taoiseach to abolish P.R. came, one might say, out of the blue.  As has been repeatedly stated here, in the Dáil, and by many outside, no word of any kind was uttered about this proposal during the last election campaign.  Before there is another election, there will be a referendum as to whether or not the system of election to the Dáil should be abolished.  I believe this is an evil step to take and one that will produce sad results, if the people are induced into voting in favour of this proposal, for many a year to come.</P>
      <P>As far as I am concerned, I never base my judgment on any question just on what my neighbour says, or indeed my colleagues around me.  I have always tried to make up my own mind, collecting all the information available to me, exercising my own judgment in the situation in which I find myself.  If I were to believe what the Taoiseach says he believes, and what the people on that side of the House say they believe&mdash;I doubt if many of them wholeheartedly accept the proposal&mdash;I would support the proposal.  If I thought it would make for better government, or for a better way of getting a Government, I would be in favour of it.  Heaven knows, we want a better Government, and we want better government; but I doubt very much if any change in the system of election will give us that instrument.  In order to achieve that, one would want much more than a change in the method of election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The responsible, thoughtful people on the opposite side of the House know quite well that parliamentary government is almost at a discount in this country to-day.  They know, too, that politicians are being looked at <Col N="788" /> askance and that they are being blamed, perhaps rightly blamed, for many of the defects in the social and economic order.  I said &ldquo;perhaps rightly blamed&rdquo;.  The responsibility of leadership in any country at any time is a very great responsibility.  The difficulties confronting parliamentary leadership in this country to-day were never greater than they are now and the problems that Parliament has to resolve are so complex and so unsuitable to treatment that in order to resolve them one would need&mdash;this is obvious even to those who do not make &ldquo;a great pretence to book learning&rdquo;, as Senator O'Callaghan so graphically said&mdash;a coalescing of all the forces of goodwill to be found within the State.  What do we get? We ask for bread.  What do we get? Paper!</P>
    <P>I want to protest now against the attitude of mind and the arguments which have been made repeatedly here as to the failure of parliamentary systems in other countries based on so-called P.R.  Now, I have seen something of those countries and I regard it as colossal impertinence on the part of any Minister of State or any member of the Oireachtas to point the finger at a great, overflowing nation like Italy, with over 40,000,000 people, with its gigantic industries and mammoth production.  I object equally to people pointing the finger at Germany or France.  We who live in a tail of an island like ours, where the race is dying out and where the prospects for the future, if we are to judge by the attitude of our people so ready to leave their homeland, are darker than they ever were in the days of the British Government here ought to be careful in our choice of phraseology.</P>
    <P>We ought to be careful about uttering words like those used by the Minister for External Affairs in the other House: &ldquo;That is what brought France to its knees, and it would bring this country to its kness if it were in operation long enough.&rdquo;  If any of us read in a French paper that the Minister for External Affairs in France had uttered words like those in relation to this little island, we would be making representations to the Minister Plenipotentiary here to have a contradiction <Col N="789" /> made in his own country.  That kind of criticism is one into which we ought not to fall.  It is something we ought not to do because we have not at our disposal information to enable us to make a fair assessment of the political situation in France, or in any other country, <i>vis-a-vis</i> the parliamentary system of election.  That is a type of mental acrobatics we ought to avoid. If we criticise another country, let us first be satisfied that we ourselves are more progressive, more go-ahead, and with more to show the world for our efforts.  If we take that as our yardstick, we shall find ourselves with very little right to criticise.</P>
    <P>I was saying earlier that parliamentary leadership has great responsibilities. Changes of Taoiseach do not alter the situation.  The difficulties remain. Many of them are unfortunately of our own making.  It is quite true that with a considerable portion of our population, the Oireachtas does not rank high to-day.  The people have suffered too many disappointments.  Many families suffered a great deal&mdash;Senator Tunney told us what his own family went through&mdash;to bring liberty and freedom to our country.  To-day, we have liberty and freedom and it is because I feel that our liberty&mdash;the liberty that was bought so dearly&mdash;is being challenged by this Bill that I am opposed to it.  It is a bigger challenge to our liberty than anything else that Fianna Fáil have done since, they came into Parliament.  Senators may smile.  They may challenge the truth of my assertion, but that is how I feel about it. Sections of our people have liberty to-day to express themselves in a particular way; they will not enjoy that liberty if this legislation is passed.</P>

      <P>I was coming to this point.  The Taoiseach is a great traveller; indeed, I would say he is a great pilgrim.  I am sure he has knelt at the tombs of the Apostles.  He has kissed the ring of our late Holy Father and he has sent his felicitations to the present Holy Father.  So far as his colleagues on the opposite side of the House are concerned, he would be looked upon as the epitome of a great Christian leader, the type of man who has the capacity to mould and shape society, to establish an ideal social and economic Christian order.</P>
      <P>I do not think it will be disputed that students and teachers of sociology who have studied our conditions here have time and again pronounced against conditions as they are.  Under the leadership of the Taoiseach, we see home after home being broken up, and husbands leaving their homes, under Government dispensation, to seek work elsewhere.  One may say that relative to our population, if one were to count the disasters that have occurred through broken homes and husbands having to leave the country to seek employment, there were as many broken homes here as there are in Britain from other causes.  But let us leave that side of things and come to the other question with which I am gravely concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am convinced that no moral authority is given to the leader of this <Col N="791" /> State to do to-day what he is proposing to do under this legislation&mdash; no moral sanction whatever&mdash;and it would not be any harm&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;If we were to examine the matter from that angle. I have here a <i>pronunciamento</i> of the Taoiseach made at College Green.  He is reported in the <i>Irish Press</i> of 18th May, 1954:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Speaking on the social aspect of Fianna Fáil policy, Mr. de Valera said that all material benefits they had provided were intended for the good of the people and for the general welfare.  There was a social philosophy behind it all.  They recognised the rights of the individual and the family and that the State had no right to encroach upon them.  They also recognised that organised society and the State have their own rights which the individual, in turn, had no right to encroach upon.  They took the view that society and the State were intended for the advantage of the individual and not the individual for the advantage of the State.  The State had no soul as the individual had.  The individual's soul gave him his primary position in the universe. Thus his destiny was the ultimate thing that mattered.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to urge that the soul of the individual is the ultimate thing that matters.  God made man unto His own image and likeness.  He gave him free will.  The development of the human personality was the highest aim that God had for man in this life. He gave him, too, his responsibilities in society but He gave him his rights and the rights of man in society come first.  As the Taoiseach pointed out, society was made for man, not man for society.  What are we doing now? I say that if individuals feel that their human personality can be most satisfactorily and successfully developed in communion with their colleagues, that is a right which they are entitled to enjoy and the head of the State, no matter who he may be, or the State itself, cannot take that right away, so long as the individual is doing nothing <Col N="792" /> that is wrong in the moral sense, that is not in conformity with the Ten Commandments or in the secular or material order, contradictory or harmful or injurious to society itself.</P>
    <P>We will leave the moral issues to the responsibility of the individual. Let us ask ourselves&mdash;and I want to hear an answer to this from the Taoiseach&mdash;in what way is it injurious for groups of people who have a common interest to come together for the furtherance of their common interests, in defence of their common interests? I cannot see it.  That is the order and the political order which has existed up to the present.  Under the system of parliamentary election, it has been possible for groups of people with a common bond and a common interest to come together, to work together, to select their candidates, to put them before the country and to let the country adjudicate upon them.</P>
    <P>I do not know what is wrong about that.  The only thing that is wrong so far as the Government Party, the Taoiseach and his followers are concerned is that they say that that can create a condition of instability in government and they are afraid of instability in government.  They are afraid of it; it is dangerous.  I concede that if there is a permanent condition of instability that could be dangerous.  However, if that situation were created, the people would find a way of resolving the difficulty.  I am satisfied that the Taoiseach and the Government have no moral authority to take a step in fear of that day when it is not with us and to deny to citizens or groups of citizens the liberty which they are entitled to enjoy.</P>

      <P>All authority under God comes from the people and the people have the responsibility to exercise their authority in such a way as to avoid doing greater injustice by exercising it one way rather than another and if the leaders of the people try to convince them as to what their duties are their first obligation is to tell the truth and reveal all the facts as they are and then let the people answer on the truth.  That is terribly important. <Col N="793" /> I have heard most of the speeches here to-day and I should not like to have to take an oath on what was said.  I shall not put it any further than that.</P>
      <P>I said earlier that the followers of the Taoiseach regard him as a great Christian gentleman.  He is the person who should say the very thing that our Holy Father, Pope John XXIII, would say: &ldquo;People unite; people have peace.&rdquo;  There are many Labour representatives here behind us.  I do not know if anybody on the other side would have the audacity to say that they have not the right to have a labour organisation, the right to collect and congregate, to sit down at meetings and decide what they ought to do to further their own interests.  There are employers represented here&mdash;Senator McGuire and Senator Burke.  I do not know in what class Senator Hayes, Senator O'Donovan and I would be placed.</P>

      <P>We are not going to America or anywhere else, as far as I am concerned, at the moment; we are just trying to resolve this problem in our own way, if we get the opportunity; and I am quite certain, a Chathaoirligh, that you will see that that will be done.  Far from taking the attitude the Taoiseach has taken in this country, he ought to have been trying to see how Senator McGuire, Senator Murphy and other people who approach life and the material problems of life from different angles, could be brought closer together, since it is only by that close approach that our problems will be resolved here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="796" /> The Government Party have another way.  I am convinced it will not succeed and I will give some of the reasons why.  Let me take my own county, Cavan.  I have tried to bring this down to the realities of the situation as I see them, because while I have tremendous admiration for a number of Senators here who spoke&mdash; Senator Hayes, Senator Stanford, Senator Quinlan, Senator O'Brien and others&mdash;I have had a different type of experience.  I have had some of their experience; I have none of their learning, but I have had practical experience down the country which enables me to get an appreciation of the kind of picture which will be presented to us when this legislation is passed.  This is what I am afraid of about it.  Let me take my own county.</P>
    <P>In the last Dáil election there were 12,545 votes for the Government and there were 18,000 not for them, in Cavan.  In the county council election in the same county, there were 12,357 for them and 17,796 not for them.  We may take it that they have approximately 12,000 votes, though I do not think they could muster 12,000 to-day, because the population has fallen considerably and is falling continuously. I do not think they could muster 12,000 to-day, but if we take 12,000 as a possible Fianna Fáil vote in our county, we will have three constituencies on the basis of that population.  There will be 4,000 votes in each of the three for Fianna Fáil and 6,000 votes not for Fianna Fáil in each constituency.</P>

      <P>If Senator Mullins wants my comment on that&mdash;it is an interesting interjection for him at this stage&mdash;I am quite certain from what I know about how things have been conducted in County Cavan since 1932, that they will make sure the constituencies are divided in their way and before I have finished I will prove that to Senator Ó Maoláin.  My word can be taken on it, that there will be <Col N="797" /> no doubt about the way they will be divided.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>The point is that there will be three constituencies, with 4,000 votes in each constituency electing a Deputy and 6,000 votes against.  A minority Party is going to govern. Everybody will be pointing at the Deputy and saying: &ldquo;Look at him, look at him!&rdquo;  There is not a tremendous amount of respect for them to-day but, make no mistake about it, when a Deputy is elected by a minority of the people, to come up to the Oireachtas to make laws&mdash;and to make some unpopular laws&mdash;he will not grow more popular and not even the name &ldquo;de Valera&rdquo; is going to make such people popular.  That is what will happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What situation do you bring about then?  Suppose I am a defeated candidate for Fine Gael and I see a majority Government coming into power&mdash;a majority of Deputies elected on a minority of votes&mdash;do you think that I am going to sit waiting on the edge <Col N="798" /> of a constituency for another five years to see what the next elections will bring?  I have no intention of doing anything of the kind and I believe every defeated Deputy in the country will be the same.  You will have the whole field to yourselves and the Oireachtas to yourselves.  Is that what you want&mdash;that there will be no Opposition?  If anyone makes the mistake of thinking that, because you get a majority in that way in the Oireachtas, you are going to govern the country, I think the experience will be a tragic one.  That is what I dislike, that is what I fear and that is why I am speaking now, because I wish to say it in time.  I have said things in the past, both to my colleagues and perhaps to some of those over there and I would not be listened to.</P>
    <P>Now, what comes out of a situation like that?  Naturally, there will be growing up elements which will coalesce because they do not believe in some of the things the Government is doing.  At any rate, take the person who is there as a Deputy&mdash;he is not brilliant, he does not command a tremendous amount of respect or confidence, he may not be terribly accommodating or he may be the sort of person who must either have you in his pocket or under his heel.  The net result of the whole thing will be that parliamentary government in this country will fail.  We are to be asked to play our part in killing it now. That is why I say that it is better to speak in time about what I believe. Other people do not believe what I say.  They are entitled to their own view, but at least they have the opportunity of expressing it.</P>
    <P>This was published in the <i>Irish Times</i> the other day:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Sinn Féin to contest Northern Ireland seats in Westminster.  The Republican movement proposes to contest all 12 seats in Northern Ireland during the next British general election for the Westminster Parliament, the Sinn Féin publicity bureau states.  It adds that the candidates will go forward in spite of any opposition'.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="799" /> The statement continues:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Once again, as in 1955, the Republican movement appeals for a clear field, and it urges that no shade of Nationalist thought will confuse the issue at stake by creating a situation similar to that created in the 1956 by-election in mid-Ulster.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Can anybody anticipate you people creating such conditions down here when you have, and you will have, so successfully eliminated all opposition according to your lights?  You will have pronouncements like that coming forward, and if they come forward what will be the response?  You will be astonished at the sneaking regard other Constitutionalists will have for declarations like this when there is only one Party in power free to do what it likes.</P>
    <P>Senator Mullins put me a query a little while ago.  I am not speaking without knowledge.  I am quite satisfied that this proposed system will not be applied only to parliamentary elections.  It is going down through the whole gamut because it is essential for the success of the Fianna Fáil scheme that it will go down through the whole gamut.  You will apply it to elections to this House and to the elections for local authorities, and what will the situation be like then? We will divide up the areas for the local authorities and we will have the same situation prevailing in the local authorities&mdash;if it is possible for the present Government Party to make it &mdash;that it is intended will prevail in the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>The chairman of the county council and the majority of the county councillors will belong to the Fianna Fáil Party.  The county manager, the secretary of the county council, the county engineer, all the assistant engineers, the home assistance officers, every ganger and every worker on the roads will be completely under their thumb.  Some say that the manager will not but, with the Minister for Local Government belonging to the Party, what can he do?  Yes, that is what he will do. That is what the setup will be like. <Col N="800" /> Even as it is at the moment I do not know how much of this is common but, quite obviously from statements made here, it is already a practice.</P>
    <P>In my own county alone it is the general practice.  There are, to-day, 22 rate collectors in my county and 18 of these belong to the Fianna Fáil Party.  That is what you get under that scheme of things and I do not like it.  The last rate collectorship appointment that was made in my own county was made in my own district.  A young man, a bachelor, with 40 acres of land, was brought over from the borders of County Longford into an area in which he did not reside.  I said a young man, a bachelor, and he defeated, by one vote, a candidate who was born in the area, who lived in the area, a young decent farmer, working on 15 acres of land, who had seven children.</P>

      <P>I will say something more on this point.  This is of importance. It is the key to the whole thing. It is the attitude which will be adopted when you pursue this policy to maintain the supreme and unchallenged authority of your Party.  It is up to us now to say this because we will not have the chance later.  There may not be many of us in the Oireachtas when this is over and you can do just what is in your minds to do.  If this were only my voice and if I stood alone in this, well, you could challenge it as only my opinion but, earlier in the week, Senator Cole was applauded for opinions to which he gave expression here.  I have here a statement by Senator Cole, on this very issue in our county, when the chairman of the county council was being elected after the last local government election.</P>
      <P>This was Senator Cole's point of view then, perfectly justified, and he could stand over it.  He said, when the proposal for the election of chairman was under discussion:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;...that from what he might term the ingredients of the council it was obvious that the electorate had left it to the Independents to decide on the chair.  In that respect he would agree with Senator Baxter's proposal as regards the decision of the chair over four years.  The two Independent members of the council, who represented the minority, represented a much larger proportion of the ratepayers&mdash;or the rates &mdash;than might appear; but that was the way that the law worked.  People did not vote on the amount of rates they paid.  Over the last five years seven appointments had been made by the council&mdash;these are appointments of rate collectors&mdash;and not one of these appointments had gone to the minority.  The one Party had got all the appointments.  He supposed they were entitled to do that if that was politics; but to his mind it was not the politics he would like to see on the county council. They had asked for at least one of these positions and it had been <Col N="802" /> refused.  It was wrong and unjust. All qualifications being equal, in so far as candidates were concerned, he agreed that the member of the political Party should get the choice but, where all things were not equal it was wrong and unjust to pursu that policy.  He said it would be left more or less to the four Independent members to decide on who was going to occupy the chair.  He was sorry it was not to be a completely Independent chairman he was voting for.  Nevertheless he would support Mr. Patrick O'Reilly.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Mr. O'Reilly was the Fine Gael candidate.</P>

      <P>It is not my word alone you have for that, and it is not any wonder the people are afraid of that. I am going to carry that argument further; I do not say there are not many people in the ranks of Fianna Fáil who do not quarrel with this, but I know very well what goes on down in the local areas.  If the key man in a district wants something done, if he wants a rate collector appointed or something else done, the Deputy is put into the position that the Party machine tells him what to do and he knows very well that, if he does not keep it oiled, it will not work for him in turn.  The way he keeps it oiled is by this type of thing, by this type of appointment, and that is all wrong, but there will be more of it in the future, under the new system.  I dislike it for that reason.  I do not think our people will stand for it.  If they turn against it, they will be ruthless in the methods that they will adopt and the Government may have to be ruthless in their methods to maintain order.  Who wants that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When it comes to that type of constituency, what will the people get? I do not know.  I review my own county again.  I am long enough there and know the people on all sides well enough to be able to make a fair appraisal of their competence to serve.  I do not think you will get anything like as good a representative under the proposed new system as you <Col N="803" /> get under the old.  Fianna Fáil were not terribly successful under that system.  Perhaps they got the best at their command.  Perhaps there is not a lot of talent available to any Party.</P>
    <P>We have read about the treatment meted out to Mr. Montgomery Hyde. If the P.R. system were in operation in the Six Counties, Mr. Montgomery Hyde would not have to kowtow to the narrow, bigoted intolerant crowd who are going to push him out.  If he had a wider field, his wider mind would command enough support to get him a seat in the House of Parliament.  That is the great danger in this narrowing of constituencies.</P>
    <P>There are Deputies who are excellent Deputies but very bad parliamentarians. Such Deputies may be in the writing room and at the telephone doing everything they possibly can for their constituencies but how many Bills are they reading and trying to amend?  Will you get a better type of Deputy when the constituency is narrowed or will you get somebody whose brothers, cousins and aunts are available to him, who will man the machine and will have to be selected or else the Fianna Fáil Party will have the kind of thing they had in constituencies but of which we have not had so much because our people enjoy more liberty.</P>
    <P>All that I have heard from the Taoiseach about this Bill has been his objection to coalitions.  He does not like people attempting to coalesce. What is wrong, under Heaven, in people being encouraged to coalesce? Is it not the whole spirit of Christianity?  Who is the Taoiseach or anybody else to preach a doctrine or philosophy that is a contradiction of that?  Such contrary doctrine is wrong and will bring no good to the Party, the people or the nation that will enshrine it in its Constitution or adopt it in the solution of its problems.</P>
    <P>I like to be able to work with people.  I can disagree with them.  I can be almost as intemperate in my disagreement as some Deputies may think I am now but, at least, we have the liberty to exercise our free wills and to express our views.  I do not think <Col N="804" /> the big stick ought to be wielded. Coalitions that existed here broke up. There was fragmentation.  Was that such an awful tragedy?  I remember the break-up of the first Coalition Government.  I was very close to it.  I know that the real issue was the price of milk.  I was desperately concerned about it.  I knew the people who were pushing Deputy Dillon, the Minister for Agriculture as he then was, for an increase in the price of milk.  I knew it was folly and tried to advise them against it but they could not be advised and they pushed and the Government decided that they would not yield to this pressure group and they resigned.  According to the Taoiseach and his supporters, it was all wrong for the Government to yield up its responsibility and pass it over to the people in that case but it is all right to throw the referendum at the same people now. Why cannot we have some degree of consistency?  I have not attempted to pursue the inconsistencies as some of my colleagues, Senator L'Estrange and others, have done.  Unless there can be a new spirit in approaching the solution of our problems, this country will fail.</P>
    <P>You can have a strong Government. East Germany has a terribly strong Government.  What is happening there? By the hundred thousand, people are flying out of the East German Republic to the West.  Do you want something like that here?  Establish the authority as strong and as powerful and as majestic as you want it.  What will happen?  Many of the people associated with the civil war cleared out of the country in 1923, 1924 and 1925. They did not want to be here.  Some of the best people that we had left the country in those years, broken in spirit, disappointed and disillusioned with everything and everybody.  If the Taoiseach believes that people will sit on the brink, waiting for a change of tide, and seeing all sorts of injustices going on for five years, he is making a terrific mistake.  He will see, as a result of this, an exodus from this country of the high-spirited people who will not put up with that sort of intolerance and will term it tyranny. He will see leaving these shores people whose places cannot be filled.  That is <Col N="805" /> something on which he ought to ponder.</P>
    <P>It may very well be that the course of events may take an entirely different turn.  My own view is that the referendum will not be carried. Some Senators may ask, then, why we are preventing it from going to the people.  We are discharging our obligations here by saying what we think about it.  We are not expected to rush a Bill through the House without saying what is in our minds about it. That would be dishonest.  We are not the sort of &ldquo;yes-men&rdquo; that can be made to do that sort of thing.  I could not do it.  If I did not have the liberty and right to speak my mind, there would be no place here for me.</P>
    <P>It is conceivable that the Fianna Fáil Party may get the amendment of the Constitution carried by referendum, but I do not believe they will.  I know they will draw up a good deal of apparent enthusiasm in certain of their own ranks about it, but there are a great many of their own people, including members of county councils and so on, and Deputies, who do not like this one bit and it will be the most lukewarm enthusiasm they have ever experienced.</P>
    <P>Supposing they do carry the referendum and supposing it comes to a constituency in Cavan and I have to consider what to do in the given situation. Suppose I believe that, if the Government policy can be operated to the full, the liberty that will be left to me to voice my opinions will be very little indeed.  I can say, in that respect, that when I went on the Cavan County Council first there was a planned campaign to prevent my speaking, and whenever I rose to speak there was a clamour to keep me silent.  That went on for a while, but I was not as easily silenced as that.  Black and Tans and all the rest did not silence me, my mother, my father or my brothers or sisters and that campaign did not succeed.</P>
    <P>If we are confronted with the situation that liberty is so restricted that it might almost be dead, I am very likely to be tempted to work, aye, and to conspire&mdash;if the Taoiseach likes that word&mdash;with others with whom I may differ more than I differ with <Col N="806" /> Fianna Fáil in many respects but, because I live liberty most of all, I am ready to work with people who want to preserve liberty, let us use or misuse it any way we like.  The Government are very likely to find such a situation if they carry the referendum. From the point of view of the nation, the result may be worse than anything anticipated.  It may be the most terrible thing, something which the Balfours in other generations would not wish upon the Irish nation.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach's objection to coalitions is something I have often felt disposed to question.  I have the opportunity now of saying that when his Party came into Parliament in 1927, I was there.  I was invited by his present Minister for Health, on the 12th August, 1927, to go to interview Mr. de Valera.  I was asked, first, what I was going to do about this vote and then if I would go to see Mr. de Valera.  Lo and behold, what did I reply?  I said: &ldquo;Seán, what do you want Mr. de Valera to say to me that you cannot say to me?  I believe I would understand you and I do not think I would understand de Valera.&rdquo; That was in 1927 and I did not go.</P>
    <P>We talked there about the formation of the Coalition.  He gave me an idea of what shape it would take and said that I would have my place in it as Minister for Agriculture.  Then I asked: &ldquo;What will you do then?&rdquo;  He replied: &ldquo;We intend to send a delegation to England about the Oath.&rdquo;  I saw Tom Johnson, Willie Redmond and Paddy Baxter being invited to go to London about the Oath.  Whatever doubts or fears I had about it up to that, I was not taking any risk about that.</P>
    <P>It is quite true that, from anything said to me, there was no evidence that the Fianna Fáil Party were to be members of the Coalition but as I said, in effect, and as will be found in the Official Report of that debate: &ldquo;This thing of being the Government while not being of it, and so on, is something I do not like.&rdquo;  It was a quite legitimate thing for them to do.  Nobody disputed the legitimacy or the worthiness of it.  I did not dismiss it.  I parted from the present Minister for Health on the understanding that if I got a <Col N="807" /> telegram to go on the following Tuesday to see Mr. de Valera I would go.  I never got the telegram.  I presume they had the numbers so well counted that they thought they would carry it by one.  I thought they would.  I never anticipated that a gentleman would disappear.</P>
    <P>I think the Taoiseach is altogether wrong and that it is an entirely false approach to the problem of Government of this country to denounce coalitions, as he has been doing.  He does not know, even before he himself passes from the political scene, what may yet have to be done in order to govern in this country.</P>
    <P>I should like to put the Taoiseach this final question.  Is this the last amendment to the Constitution that might possibly arise from the passing of this amendment?  Is there anywhere in the back of the Taoiseach's mind the idea that if the people are kinder to him than I think they will be, and send him to the Park, there will be a further amendment to the Constitution that would put him, in relation to Irish affairs, in the position President Eisenhower occupies in relation to American affairs to-day so that he would be President, Taoiseach and everything else all rolled up into one?  Perhaps he will tell us that when he is concluding?</P>

    <Speaker pid="LouisWalsh" hpid="Mr. Louis Walsh Mr. Louis Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Louis Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Baxter <Col N="808" /> said there was not one word about the abolition of P.R. in the last election campaign.  One can scarcely say that many words have not been spoken about the abolition of P.R. and many words will be spoken before the matter is decided by the people. Having read most of what was said in the other House and listened to what has been said here on this Bill, it would appear to me that speakers had little difficulty in making up their minds and felt quite competent to speak at length on the systems of voting without the assistance of any commission of inquiry.  If some of those who claim to be Independent and unattached had any doubts, would it not be only right that they should adopt the democratic principles stated by Senator Connolly O'Brien and vote for the Second Stage of this Bill now that it has been accepted by those who are the direct representatives of the people?</P>
      <P>The long discussion which has already taken place and which got such wide publicity in the Press and on the radio should enable people to make up their minds.  I am sure the people will have many further opportunities of listening to arguments on this matter before the referendum takes place.</P>
      <P>As reported at column 302 of the Official Report of 4th February, 1959, Senator O'Brien stated:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;...I must say I was certainly greatly impressed by the case made by the Opposition in the Dáil.  The long debate there had an educational effect on at least one person.  I have no doubt it had an equal educational effect on a large number of voters.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I think, however, the electorate have already heard possibly too much on this matter and are now rather tired of the long drawn out debate that has taken place.  To illustrate my point, I should like to quote a paragraph from the <i>Derry People</i> of 14th February of this year.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The lack of public interest in the forthcoming national referendum on the retention or otherwise of the P.R. system of voting, was clearly demonstrated at Letterkenny on Saturday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="809" /> A lecture on the subject, scheduled for the local Devlin Hall, with an admission fee of 2/6, was left practically without audience, and had to be moved outdoor to the Market Square.  Speaker was distinguished former Minister for External Affairs, Mr. Seán MacBride, S.C., who still experienced a far-from-lively audience, only a handful bothering to pause and listen.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>After all, Deputies and quite a number in this House have been closely associated with elections and Government for many years.  A number of them have personal experience of both systems of election and I feel they can be regarded as experts in this matter.</P>
    <P>As reported at column 555 of the Official Report of 11th February, 1959, Senator L'Estrange said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;...if we adopt the straight vote system, will we have a situation in which the doors of Leinster House will be closed in future to a Jim Larkin, to a James Connolly or to any other legitimate representative of the 800,000 workers in this country?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Does the Senator really believe or seriously contend that such men could not be elected in any Dublin constituency when we consider that at the moment in the City of Belfast, where so many vote on a sectarian basis, four official Labour, one Independent Labour and one Republican Labour candidates have been elected while in the City of Dublin, under P.R., there is one Labour Deputy?</P>
    <P>Does anyone suggest, for instance, that the late Deputy Alfred Byrne could not win a single member constituency in this city if P.R. had been abolished?  If the strength of the trade unions is, as Senator L'Estrange says, 800,000, and if their candidates get that support, together with the support of their wives and sweethearts and their sisters and aunts, not alone could they elect a Government but it would be the strongest Government this country could possibly have.  But, of course, the fact is that a great number of these people belong to Fianna Fáil, and some of them belong to Fine Gael.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="810" /> The Senator also stated, as reported at column 581:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In the intervening years you had the People's Party, the National League, the Farmers' Party and the Centre Party, but we have had only three large Parties here for the past 36 years.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It would be interesting to know what happened these Parties and what happened Monetary Reform.  Perhaps it would be a matter for scientific study by Senator Quinlan and I am sure Senator L'Estrange and some other Senators on the opposite side would be able to assist the Senator in any research on that point.  May I suggest that if these Parties were masticated and fully digested by Fine Gael, with the intake of political calories which Fine Gael obtained as a result of taking over these small Parties, then that Party is still rather emaciated?</P>
    <P>The Senator claims that farmers should be represented in Parliament. Of course, they should be represented in Parliament.  As he stated in 1947, there were as good farmers in Fine Gael as there were in Clann na Talmhan&mdash;but possibly there are better farmers in Fianna Fáil.  He also stated that it will render more difficult the ending of Partition.  I should have liked the Senator to develop that point further.  If it is contended by those on the other side of the House that the Unionists obtain better representation by the straight vote, then surely they desire the system to continue.  Deep down in the heart of every member of this House must be the hope that the State will become stronger and more prosperous and that the improved economy will, in time, have an attraction for our fellow countrymen in the part of north-east Ulster where they are still opposed to the unity of this country. Surely this ambition is more likely to be achieved if we have here a Government with the strength, with the confidence and the time to put the policy and the programme which has previously been put before the people in a general election, into effect?  A reasonably strong Government, capable of doing what is best for the good of the people, with a united, critical and <Col N="811" /> strong Opposition, with a shadow Cabinet, and in a position to establish an alternative Government is how Parliament and democracy work best.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Brien at column 324 stated:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Seanad know that every time the Minister for Finance has been in this House since the election of 1957 I have made a very strong appeal to him to make use of his large majority and his long period of office to face up courageously to the pressing economic and financial problems with which this country is beset.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Does this imply that a fairly strong one-Party Government, which should run its full term of office, is an important prerequisite to a Government facing up courageously to the economic problems of this State?  Senator O'Brien considers that the referendum is distracting and disturbing the country. Can anyone imagine anything more distracting and disturbing than frequent general elections and too little continuity in a sound Government economic policy?  The Senator questions the propriety of plunging the country into a referendum which he states is unjustified unless there is grave dissatisfaction.  Surely the result of the 1957 Election showed a grave dissatisfaction with P.R. and the Coalition Government which it produced?  The securing by the Government of such an overall result under the present system demonstrated the feelings of the people.  If the people do not wish for the abolition of P.R., why are some members of the Opposition so pessimistic about the result?</P>
    <P>Owing to the multiplicity of Party groups in the last 20 years, there have been, in my opinion, too many elections. There have been too many elections since the State was set up.  I understand there have been 14 elections since the State was set up and in the past 20 years, there have been eight elections.  Goodness knows how many by-elections there have been in that time.  If we had, during the past 20 years, single member constituencies, then the areas involved in by-elections would have been ever so much fewer, with a consequent saving to the community. <Col N="812" /> It is possible that in the past 20 years we would have been saved the necessity of three general elections and the high cost and unsettling effect of these elections, if we had the direct vote during that time.  P.R. undoubtedly led to Government instability and brought about two fragile Coalition Governments which broke up, as forecast, long before their period of office expired.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Louis Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Possibly that was a misunderstanding.  Nevertheless, it is most difficult to get controversial legislation accepted by a coalition Cabinet and so decisions are delayed and put into abeyance.  If it were not for the fact that we have in this country two great national Parties brought about by the issues involved in the Treaty and the economic war, and if we had not had the 1937 Constitution, the successful Agreement of 1938, and the successful declaration of neutrality and the maintenance of that neutrality during the greatest and ghastliest war the world has ever known, changes of government probably would have been more frequent. There was no election, I think, between 1938 and 1943.  It is unlikely that there will be such a clash of great national issues in the years that lie ahead and there would be a greater tendency for smaller Parties to sprout up and some of their candidates to be elected if P.R. were to continue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A national Party, made up of the various interests in the community, is much more desirable than sectional interests and antagonisms between town and country, the clash of class warfare, the agriculturist versus the industrialist, the industrial labourer against the agricultural worker. Interest groups, if elected, may turn aside from consideration of legislation which is for the general good as not being their direct concern.  Smaller <Col N="813" /> constituencies, one-third or one-quarter of the present size, would be much more intimate and compact and would, I believe, throw up a better type of candidate, one who has gained the respect and esteem of the people of the area.</P>
    <P>Senator L'Estrange said if a candidate were worth his salt he would get 1,000 votes and surely if a candidate is outstanding in a community he will get 2,000 or 3,000 votes.  No Party, machine or Party bosses&mdash;about whom there has been much talk&mdash;could keep that person out.  There would be a greater incentive for candidates to offer themselves for election and, if elected, to prove worthy of the trust the people have placed in them and the reputation they have gained in their immediate areas.</P>
    <P>After all, the Sinn Féin Deputies were elected under the direct system, the old National Party were elected under the direct system, and did they not throw up some wonderfully fine Irishmen in those years?  In a single member constituency, Deputies will be responsible for the well-being of their own areas and there is a greater incentive to devote as much time as possible to the work of the areas.  At present, an active Deputy may have a passenger as a colleague but under the new system if a Deputy becomes lazy and neglects his duties he would be quickly found out and eliminated at the next election.  In that way, the standard of those elected should be of a pretty high order.</P>
    <P>Very often under P.R.  I feel we elect the second best and it is always possible to have pre-election bargaining in order to capture votes.  It was suggested that in a single member constituency Government Deputies would not ask parliamentary questions in case it would embarrass the Government.  My experience is that constituencies are more anxious for Government Deputies than Opposition Deputies and Government Deputies get far more work to do.  Government Deputies can be very effective in Party councils and on deputations as the Government would naturally be anxious to placate their Party members in order to retain the seat at election time.</P>
    <P>It is only natural that Deputies <Col N="814" /> elected under the system of P.R. should wish that system to continue on the principle that &ldquo;the devil you know is better than the devil you do not know&rdquo;, but members of Opposition Parties should feel that if there is to be any real future they should support this change.  I think some members of Fine Gael would like to support the change but they feel it is better political strategy to play up to the smaller groups whom they eventually hope to &ldquo;gobble up&rdquo;.  In the meantime they hope to capture their preference votes. Party politicians who violently and sincerely oppose the abolition of P.R. must have little confidence in the future of their own Parties.  As has been said, when the people turn against a Government in future the swing of the pendulum will be greater than under the present system.  The swing of the marginal vote will be accentuated.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party appear to be very despondent about their immediate prospects but I suggest that, with the revision of the constituencies, the increase in the urban vote and the decrease in the rural vote and with the increased decentralisation resulting in greater union strength, many urban areas should be able to return Labour Deputies in future elections.  There are now 22 three-member constituencies and even if the present system were to continue that number would be likely to increase this year on the revision of constituencies owing to the considerable decrease in rural population as disclosed in recent censuses.  In three-member constituencies seats are contested on a basis as near to the direct vote as to the P.R. method; therefore little change need be expected in these areas if there is a change-over to the new system.</P>
    <P>The purpose of a general election is primarily to produce a firmly-founded and popular Government sufficiently strong to decree a policy which has previously been put before the electorate at a general election.  I suggest the P.R. system may frequently have cut down parliamentary majorities below the margin of safety.  Let us not reach the stage of having crisis after crisis followed by chaos.  We may never again in our generation have an opportunity <Col N="815" /> of putting this vital question to the electorate for decision.</P>
    <P>In a congested or built-up area one does not wait until a fire has spread before a fire brigade is called, so we in this country cannot afford to wait until democracy is wiped out by dictatorship before trying to save Parliament.  In all countries with single member constituencies the economy is sound and the standard of living generally has steadily increased, especially among the lower income group.  Senator Burke has referred to the fact that, <i>per capita,</i> our income is only 55 as against 100 in Britain; possibly the system of election may have had something to do with the prosperity of countries like Canada, America, Britain, and so on. Senator Baxter has painted a rather black picture of the position of the country, but I suggest that part of that may be attributed to the system of P.R.  At any rate, I can say sincerely that for the greater good of the greater number of people in Ireland the abolition of P.R. and the introduction of the system of the straight vote is essential.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>Most members of the House will hardly blame me for having certain misgivings about plunging into the controversy which this Bill has aroused.  However, as one of the uncommitted members of the House on whom some members at least would appear to wish to place the main burden of responsibility either for the defeat or the enactment of this measure, I feel obliged to state the reasons why I must vote against it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator O'Brien, in the very early stages of this debate, made one of the most realistic contributions to the discussion of this Bill when he pointed out that the onus of proof of the necessity for its introduction rested squarely and very definitely on the Government.  I have deliberately waited to this late stage of the debate to intervene because I was anxious to hear as much as I could possibly hear of what the Government had to say in support of this measure.  I have listened to most of the Government spokesmen and, I might add, in very <Col N="816" /> great detail read the speech of the Taoiseach and of the members of the Government both in this House and in the other House to which I did not have the opportunity of listening.  In my humble but nevertheless considered opinion, no case whatever has been made by the Government for the radical change this Bill proposes.</P>
    <P>In defence of its decision to introduce the Bill the Government, as far as I can understand, gives only two cogent reasons: first, they say it will give us more stability&mdash;they mean stability of government&mdash;but &ldquo;stability&rdquo; is what they stress, whatever that vague term may mean or imply; secondly, it will give us stronger Governments&mdash;stronger Governments, I presume, than we have become accustomed to over the past 37 years.</P>
    <P>I shall not bore the House at this late stage by repeating the references made by so many speakers already in simple but very clear illustration of the indisputable fact that we have had more stability of government over the period of the past 37 or 38 years than any other country we can point to in Europe, or beyond it.  As for having stronger Governments, it is a repudiation of all the principles for which so many Irish men and women have sacrificed so much to suggest that at this stage of our development we need a mailed fist&mdash;or is it an iron heel&mdash;to enable us to govern ourselves in the future, at least as successfully and as satisfactorily as we have been doing for the greater part of 40 years past.</P>
    <P>I am not satisfied that the Government has answered, or answered with any effectiveness, the very serious charge of the Opposition that this Bill is deliberately, indeed cynically and almost callously designed, to perpetuate the predominance of single-Party influence in our political life as a nation.  That is the main charge that has been levelled from the Opposition benches and I, for one, have not heard that charge answered effectively.  If there is any substance in that charge&mdash; and I have not heard anything to refute it&mdash;then the motives which inspired this Bill do no credit either to the outlook of the Fianna Fáil Party to-day or <Col N="817" /> to the record of that Party in the past, credit which no serious-minded person will attempt to deny them.</P>
    <P>A number of Government speakers have suggested&mdash;and I have been concerned to note that, one after the other, they referred to it in the same strain of argument or lack of argument&mdash;that a vote against the enactment of this Bill in this House is a vote cast to deny the people the right to give their judgment on it in the proposed referendum. That is nonsense, if not deliberately dishonest argument.  Every member of this House knows as well as I do we cannot prevent this referendum from being held.  At best, or perhaps I should say at worst, all we can hope to do is to make sure that, by refusing to permit the free passage of this Bill through the House, the people will have a little more time and perhaps a fairer opportunity of considering its far-reaching implications before they are called out to give their final judgment on it.</P>
    <P>It has been rather lamely suggested that a demand for this Bill to be formulated was created by the unanimous adoption of a motion on the subject at the last Fianna Fáil Árd-Fheis. That is the only reason put forward in support of the suggestion that there is some demand for this Bill.  It has been stated&mdash;and I think it is quite indisputable&mdash;that the Government certainly got no mandate for this Bill from the people at the last election.  I should like to ask: do the Government seriously believe that the adoption&mdash; even a unanimous adoption&mdash;of a motion on this subject at the annual Árd-Fheis of their Party offers sufficient evidence of any demand among any representative section of the people for legislation of this kind?</P>

      <P>Do they suggest that the adoption of such a measure provides sufficient justification for the distraction and controversy which this Bill has aroused?  As an elected representative of trade union interests in this House, even at the cost of repeating something my colleague, <Col N="818" /> Senator Murphy, has already said, I propose to read again the brief text of two resolutions on this subject which have been unanimously adopted by the freely elected representative councils of the trade union movement in this country.  I feel that before this debate concludes, it is quite important that every member of the House should hear and understand quite clearly what the trade union movement, expressing itself through its own elected representatives, has to say in regard to this measure.  That is why I propose to read those resolutions again.</P>
      <P>The following resolution was adopted unanimously by the national executive of the Trade Union Congress:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Irish trade union movement comprising the largest and most representative group of democratic organisations in Ireland has a special concern and a historic responsibility in securing that the democratic system of government shall be maintained.  As P.R. is a system of election suitable to advanced democracies and as the system of the single seat constituencies diminishes the democratic authority of the electorate, restricts their freedom to select and change their public representatives in accordance with the requirements of a living and changing community and opens the door to domination by minority Governments, the National Executive of the Irish Trade Union Congress must regard the proposed abolition of P.R. as a retrograde step which the trade union movement must deprecate and oppose.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I do not think there is any equivocation about that statement, but in case it might be said that it still is not representative of the trade union movement as a whole, I should like to read a resolution which was proposed by the Congress of Irish Unions, which, on the date the resolution was passed, was speaking as a separate entity, but nevertheless with one voice.  The resolution stated:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Having considered the issues. <Col N="819" /> relevant to the proposal to amend the Constitution and discontinue the present method of electing members to Dáil Éireann by the P.R. system of voting, the Central Council of the Congress of Irish Unions (1) is of opinion that justification for such action has not been established; (2) urges Deputies, Senators and citizens not to support or vote for any system of election which may result in a person securing membership of Dáil Éireann in a single member constituency without having received a majority of the votes recorded in such constituency: (3) submits that such a method of election would not be in the best interests of the citizens of Ireland: would be in conflict with the sound democratic principle which is traditional to the trade union movement in Ireland, that is, that important issues should be decided by the majority vote of persons having the right to decide such an issue.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I should like the House to note particularly that, as I have already mentioned, at the time when those two resolutions were passed, they were passed by two separately elected executives acting as separate entities. It is rather significant that they spoke on this subject with one voice.  There may be further significance in the fact that they speak and act to-day as one.</P>
    <P>I have already said that I regard the introduction of this Bill as unnecessary.  I now want to say that I also believe it to be unwarranted. Every member of the House is entitled to question the propriety of the Government's introduction of such a measure, particularly at present.  In explanation of their failure to introduce any such proposal over the long period of years in which they held office, more than one Government spokesman has pleaded that in those years they had other things to do. That is the expression I heard used&mdash;&ldquo;other things to do.&rdquo;  Are we to take it that at present the Government have nothing better to do than to insist on what I believe is a quite unnecessary intrusion on the people's time and <Col N="820" /> attention at a time when we are faced with such very grave and serious problems as unemployment and emigration on the scale we have had, unfortunately, become accustomed to?</P>
    <P>In repudiation of some of the suggestions made that those of us criticising the measure are not expressing any representative public opinion, I should like to quote just one brief sentence from a public comment that appeared in one of our evening newspapers during the past week.  I quote from the <i>Evening Mail</i> of Wednesday, 11th February.  The leading article is headed &ldquo;A Crucial Problem&rdquo;.  It was a comment in turn on a comment which had appeared in a trade union journal of the same month which again drew attention to the fact that the total number of persons registered as unemployed in the Twenty-Six County area is over 80 per cent. and that during the past 12 months, some 60,000 people emigrated.  I do not propose to read the article in full, but I think it is very apt.  It concludes with this sentence:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Offensive as it may be to some people to say so, the emigration question is more important than the language or even the abolition of P.R.  It is a matter of the very life blood of the State.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That comment is not open to question for it follows, as surely as night follows day, that, if we are content to put up with emigration on its present scale, in a very short time we will have very few people left to worry about the language or, for that matter, to worry about unemployment.  The editorial says it is &ldquo;more important&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>As a responsible spokesman on behalf of the trade union movement, I submit it is more important than the abolition of P.R. and it is more urgent, in my opinion, that we should bend our energies to solving the problems that confront us rather than expend our time, a great deal of effort and a considerable amount of money on an issue such as this.  For those reasons, I shall vote against this Bill.  In reply to speakers on the Government Benches who have suggested that by voting against it we are, in some way, <Col N="821" /> denying the people a right, let me explain that I shall vote against, not in the futile hope of defeating the measure, but to make quite certain that the people will have a fair opportunity of considering the serious implications behind the Bill, a fairer opportunity than the Government apparently intended they should have.</P>

      <P>Any hope there was of having a sober and objective discussion on this measure was destroyed by the opening speech for the Opposition made by Senator Hayes.  I had hoped&mdash;foolishly, I suppose&mdash;that it might be possible to have a more objective debate in this House than that which took place in the Dáil and that we would not here traverse the same ground as that covered in the Dáil.  Having heard Professor Hayes, I realised my hopes were unfounded. I think I can summarise his speech by saying that, instead of dealing with the measure before the House, he used the measure to make a personal attack on the Taoiseach.  In doing so, he traversed a long period in the history of this country.  There was no need for Senator Hayes to traverse past history. But he even went so far as to suggest that an attempt was being made by the Taoiseach and the Fianna Fáil Party to pervert history.  I listened to the Senator's speech and I subsequently read it.</P>
      <P>It is my belief that the Senator and his colleagues are in the position of having taken a wrong stand in the past on major national issues.  Hence, they are prevented from taking a right stand now.  It is a philosophical principle that people who take a wrong stand on a major issue are compelled to take more wrong stands on subsequent major issues in support of their own perverted action in the first instance. That seems to me to be the principal reason why this debate has been conducted by the Opposition along the lines on which it has been conducted. This Bill is being used by Fine Gael in an attempt to justify their past and once more, they are taking a wrong stand.</P>

It was unworthy of him to suggest that the Taoiseach and the Fianna Fáil Party were trying to pervert history, because I am certain that he knew he was wrong in making that suggestion.  I believe that he feels and fears that the verdict of history will go against him and his colleagues and that is why he was so anxious to use every opportunity to pervert history himself.</P>

      <P>People are conscious that Fine Gael would like to see history distorted; that is the basis as I see it. People who took a wrong stand on one issue are now compelled to take a wrong stand on another issue.  Fine Gael took a wrong stand 21 years ago when the Constitution was introduced. I remember it very well indeed and I remember the lengths to which they went to mislead the people and to misrepresent the issue before the people. Every political trick was tried and every political rabbit was pulled out of the hat in the hope of preventing the enactment of the Constitution.</P>

      <P>The members of the Fine Gael Party spoke with as much <Col N="827" /> heat and vehemence and as much apparent sincerity as Senator Baxter did here to-night in trying to convince the public that the Constitution should not be enacted.  Every argument and every trick was tried.  I remember quite well all the misrepresentation: that it was proposed, under the Constitution, to set up a dictatorship in the Presidency.  I suggest that Fine Gael knew quite well that it was not intended to set up such a dictatorship. They knew it was not possible to do so, and now after 21 years of the working of the Constitution, they know there was no such intention and that it was not possible to put it forward as a sound argument.</P>
      <P>Another argument at that time was the question of the rights of women and many womenfolk I know were misled.  That was the intention&mdash;to mislead them.  I suggest that because they took a wrong stand then, they are taking a wrong stand now and using again all the arguments that can be trotted out, in the hope of preventing the people from exercising their rights to decide this issue calmly and objectively.  If they fail in that, I suppose every trick and every misrepresentation will be trotted out again.  It really only proves my argument that they are again taking a wrong stand and will go to any lengths to maintain that wrong stand.  This chain of events has been brought about because the Opposition took a wrong stand at the time.  Senator Hayes elected to go back to refer to 1921 and 1922.  That is why it has happened.  That is why they are taking the wrong stand.</P>

      <P>I am trying to reply to some of the arguments raised by Senators opposite and so long as I am doing so I think I am in order.  I could mention many instances to prove that thesis of mine in regard to this wrong stand, but I think I have mentioned quite enough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I listened to some of Senator Murphy's speech and I read it all.  It <Col N="828" /> is appalling to contemplate the defeatist outlook which seems to exist in the Labour Party.  If we are to judge from Senator Murphy's speech, the Labour Party is suffering from fear.  In the words of the Senator, the Labour Party fears that this measure, when enacted, this change of voting system, will annihilate the Labour Party.  Was ever such a lack of confidence expressed in this House?  It appears to me that there must be something seriously wrong with the Labour Party.  I began to examine and think why the Labour Party should be suffering from this fear.  It occurred to me then that the shock the Labour Party got at the last general election is the cause of this fear.  Apparently, their philosophy is that any change will not be for the better as far as they are concerned. What is the reason for it? There is, of course, a reason.  Is it not a fact that in this City of Dublin, where there is the greatest concentration of trade union members, the Labour Party won at the last general election only one seat?  I suggest that even that one seat would not have been won were it not for the fact that the candidate bore an honoured name in Labour circles.</P>
    <P>I can quite understand the Labour Party members suffering from fear, but, if they are, that fear is of their own making, and no change in the system will get them out of that difficulty.  It is not my function now to attack the Labour Party as such, but I feel that I am entitled to refer to Senator Murphy's speech and to criticise his outlook on those matters.  I feel that if the Labour Party did badly at the last election there is a very good reason for it.  It is due to the ordinary members of the trade unions of this country having lost faith and hope in the Labour Party.  Hence, a certain chain of events has taken place.</P>
    <P>Here is what happened, in my view. A large section of the people who would normally vote Labour voted for Fine Gael&mdash;and the leaders of Fine Gael know that.  A larger section who would normally vote for Labour, did not vote at all; and a larger section still, the largest section, voted for Fianna Fáil.  Those members of trade <Col N="829" /> unions had lost confidence in the Labour Party.  Why did they lose confidence in the Labour Party?  I suggest it was due to the outlook and method adopted by the Labour Party that the trade union members lost confidence in them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickFirmullaghOReilly" hpid="Mr. O'Reilly Mr. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>That is why the shift of vote took place.  It is agreed by most thinking people who examine objectively the shift that takes place in a particular election; and it is agreed by many people that that shift did take place.  Fine Gael lost substantially because of their policy.  They lost the conservative type of farmer and shopkeeper, because of the Coalition wrangling&mdash;those people stopped voting Fine Gael and voted Fianna Fáil. Again, Fine Gael gained from the Labour Party.  Again, it can be argued that Fianna Fáil lost to Sinn Féin and elsewhere, but again they gained from the Labour Party.  In my view, a greater shift took place than the overall figures would reveal.  The Labour Party are the people who really suffured, because if they lost on the roundabouts they did not gain on the swings.  That is why they, are suffering from fear now.  If they are to get out of this difficulty, might I say this to them: when the Labour Party stop adopting the policy or copying the policy or the antics of Ramsay MacDonald, there then can be some hope for them.  It is because of that MacDonaldonian outlook and behaviour that they have lost.</P>

    <Speaker pid="VictorCarton" hpid="Mr. Carton Mr. Carton">

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not here to educate the Senator.  It is my conviction that unless and until the Labour people in this country base their policy on the Connolly tradition there is no hope for them.  When Irish Labour has a national outlook and has due regard to all sections of the community, and is not a group of people with a narrow sectional interest, when it has a policy and outlook which is honest <Col N="830" /> with all the workers, I can see the Labour Party winning many seats under any free system of free election in this city and in this country.  In my view, until that outlook prevails there is no hope for the Labour Party. They would have failed at the last election under any known system of free elections.  I hope that Senator Murphy will digest those views of mine on that point.</P>

      <P>Some of the Independent Senators opposite were at great pains to profess their independence.  It occurred to me that the only way they seem able to express their independence is by voting against this measure, by voting against Fianna Fáil.  The only comment I feel disposed to make on that is that I think, if my recollection of history is correct, it was in regard to Poynings Law it was said, in the case for its introduction, that the Anglo-Normans had become more Irish than the Irish themselves.  I think if I suggest the Independent Senators on the opposite side have become more Fine Gael than the Fine Gael members themselves, it would be correct.</P>

      <P>All this adds up to one thing&mdash;that this debate was to be prolonged as long as possible.  Every argument that could be used was used in order to confuse the issue, and to try to prevent the people from deciding it. I suggest it would be better if the people were left to decide this matter in a calm atmosphere, and I suggest that all the pontifical drivel brought in was introduced simply to confuse the issue.  In my view that is a pity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course it can be argued by many people that it is because of the immediate past history of the opposition Parties, of Fine Gael and of Labour, and because they did feel rather guilty in this matter on account of their record in Coalition Governments, their view is that a straight vote system with the single seat constituency <Col N="832" /> does not help the growth of Parties, and neither does it help towards the development of Coalition Governments. That is one of the reasons they are so anxious to oppose this measure.  I am prepared to argue that many people in the Fine Gael Party in this House, in the Dáil, and throughout the country, feel that in the long run joining the Coalition Governments did not help the Fine Gael Party, though at the time it did appear to have a political advantage.</P>

      <P>By taking part in the Coalition Governments the Labour Party and the Fine Gael Party damaged themselves and damaged the nation.  Now they oppose this Bill on the grounds that it is an attempt to prevent the formation of Coalition Governments, and we have the sorry spectacle of responsible men coming in here extolling the virtues of weak government. Representatives of the Opposition have made that case, but apparently they object to Senators on this side drawing a parallel by quoting what happened in Italy, and by citing what has happened in France.  It has even been said that what the Minister for External Affairs said here was an insult to the French nation, but one can criticise a system of election and a system of government, showing its weaknesses, without making an attack on the French nation or on any particular member of a French Government. I think that should be clear to any thinking person.</P>
