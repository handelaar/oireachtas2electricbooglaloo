      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Last night I was trying to describe in a homely way what would happen in Ireland if this measure were passed.  I expressed the view that what happened in England and various other places has no great relation to what would happen here. Such practised politicians as the Taoiseach and others who have had experience over the same period are capable of assessing what the results will be here.  But the people on the Taoiseach's side have chosen, as Senator Mullins did last night, to concentrate, not on what they know will happen here, but on what happened elsewhere in different conditions and, indeed, in most cases, in a completely different set-up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I contend that the issue here has been confused by the creation 12 or 15 years ago of a great number of three seat constituencies.  When that happened, the really fair results which P.R. should give did not materialise. I want to pose the question that if a man secures over 100,000 votes&mdash;a normal number for a five seat constituency under P.R.&mdash;which may be triple the number of votes necessary to elect him, is he not entitled to the seat?  But, in fact, if you restrict the voting to a small constituency in which there is, perhaps, a valid poll of 9,000 in one election, that man may be defeated by the hack type of politician who attends all the funerals and does all the messenger boy operations. For instance, if a man of the calibre of Major-General Costello chose to enter politics on any political side or as an Independent, would anybody take the view that he should not be elected?  Or, if a man with the experience of Senator McGuire, who is managing director of a fine firm in Dublin, chose to stand for the Dáil, would anyone say that such a man, with his experience, education and ability, should not be a member of the Dáil and could not on any side of the House do good work for the Irish nation and his constituents?  Both those men should command a seat in <Col N="1013" /> Dáil Éireann if they wished it or had the time to devote to it.</P>
    <P>Would it not be true to say that in many constituencies with a valid poll of 9,000&mdash;which will be the sort of thing one can expect in a constituency representing 20,000&mdash;the local political boss would beat either of those two men hollow?  If the election were held in a constituency of over 100,000 persons, in other words, a five seat constituency, is it not a fact that without a shadow of doubt either of these two men would be elected to Dáil Éireann and would serve the country well? Why, then, do we exclude the people who should represent us and who have proved by their actions, life and ability that they are worthy to represent the people?  Why do we confine the selection always to the local politician?</P>
    <P>It is wise to give practical examples. The first thing is to take somebody who is a good legislator, well worthy of his seat in Dáil Éireann and who cannot, therefore, consider himself insulted when one discusses his normal practice and way of life.  All the Deputies from North County Dublin are known to me, with the exception of the Minister for Defence whom I met only once.  I think Deputy Rooney and Deputy P.J. Burke are excellent legislators and good members of Dáil Éireann.  I would not grudge either of them a place in Dáil Éireann even if the number of seats there was restricted to 50 or 60.  However, if this Bill goes through, North County Dublin will be divided into four or five constituencies.  A man of the very excellent habits and way of life of Deputy P.J. Burke could not be defeated in a particular area in that constituency.  Any man who attends every funeral in the constituency, any man who is reported in the <i>Evening Mail</i> as getting a bus shelter for the residents of Ballyfermot, for example, any man who is constantly in the news doing these small jobs, will be elected.</P>
    <P>I chose Deputy Burke because I think he is a good legislator.  My point is that a man who does all that work and all these things might not be a good legislator.  He might be a rotten <Col N="1014" /> legislator.  He might be prepared to do all these messenger boy jobs and attend all these funerals and be present at all public occasions, know everybody, meet everybody and see everybody just to be in Dáil Éireann and to draw his Dáil allowance.  The reason why I took Deputy P.J. Burke as an example is that he is a good legislator.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order. It is very insulting for any member of the Seanad to call any member of the other House a messenger boy.  I object to Senator Donegan saying that Deputy P.J. Burke went around as a messenger boy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Did I say that? Certainly, I did not mean it in that sense.  I did not intend that.  I had in mind his way of life.  I went out of my way not to offend him.  I wanted to point out how such a man can be elected to Dáil Éireann when, in fact, he might not be a good legislator.</P>
      <P>There is the question of the needle vote.  If there is a valid poll of 9,000 votes, in many constituencies a Party would know they would get 4,000 or 5,000 of those votes.  If the Party were sure of getting 5,000, assessing politics as most of us have to do, they would be elected.  Where they get 4,000 votes there is, as one would expect, a certain disappointment that just because they could not swing another 501 votes, the representative of that Party was not elected.  Does not that make for skullduggery and all sorts of local efforts to gain that odd 500 votes?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is very relevant to give examples of public boards where one vote will swing the day and when, three or four days before an important vote, it is known to all that a certain number of people would vote one way and a certain number of people would vote another way&mdash;because they had declared their intention of so doing&mdash; and that one member was holding the casting vote.  I have seen the greatest efforts made in such a situation, at times dishonest efforts, to sway that man to vote a particular way.  I have seen the other thing happen.  I have seen that member try to exert pressure <Col N="1015" /> on Parties on each side of the public board in order to get something for his vote.  I do not refer to money or anything like that.</P>
    <P>For instance, suppose in a particular case a village had the balance of power.  If the number of votes in a village was sufficient to have a member elected or to have two members elected and if the village in question had not a water supply or a sewerage scheme, does not one think that a local development association or a local development committee in that village would exert the greatest pressure and say, in effect: &ldquo;We will vote for the Party that will give us the amenity we require for our village?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There might be a village some miles away which was just as entitled to similar amenities as the first village but, because of the pressure that could be exerted by the first village, the Parties would vie with one another in their promises to give that first village or that particular set of persons whatever they require.</P>
    <P>Every Senator, without exception, is a member of a public board.  They all know what happens when the needle vote comes up.  It is either bought or sold&mdash;not with money but with allegiance, with things people want in the days to come.  I have seen it happen. Thank God, I was never a party to it because it is most unfair that such a situation should obtain in a small constituency.</P>
    <P>Here is another example.  I will not mention the public board.  A position was going for one year.  The central figure in this affair would have cut off his right hand before giving anything to anybody for a vote.  He is a man of the highest integrity and honesty. He is not of my Party.  I will not mention his name.  In this particular instance my office was rung up on the day before this vote was to take place. A gentleman said: &ldquo;If two other gentlemen&rdquo;&mdash;not I&mdash;&ldquo;will change their votes on this measure you can elect anybody you like to-morrow to this position.&rdquo;  I said that these gentlemen would not dream of changing <Col N="1016" /> their votes simply to gain a position for an individual.  The following day the vote took place.  The gentleman who rang me up voted in the way he was not expected to vote.  A month later two gentlemen changed their votes on a particular thing which cost, in a certain rateable area, £350 in the rates for the next 30 years&mdash;£9,000.  Can one imagine in a small constituency the pressure that would be exerted on a Party, on a candidate to do certain things and, if he did certain things, he would be voted for?  I submit that the analogy is perfect.  I have seen that happen.  It will happen in the small 9,000 valid poll constituencies.  It is unfair to place candidates in an invidious position like that.  I want to emphasise that the central figure in the matter I have referred to was a man of the greatest integrity and honesty and had nothing to do with it but, nevertheless, it was done.  It was not his fault if he found himself in the position for 12 months.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Great play has been made about England.  I do not want to labour the matter.  In passing, however, I should like to say that the single seat constituency there is entirely different from what is envisaged here. A person needs 30,000 votes to be elected there where here it would be possible to be elected with 5,000 votes. The opportunity for the candidate to make personal contact is obvious here but it would be completely impossible in England.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last night I dealt with the opportunity of a political Party to see to it that an opponent would not be elected by the simple expedient of putting up a &ldquo;man of straw&rdquo;.  Senator Mullins said that people could co-operate to ensure defeat of somebody they did not like.  In fact, what Deputy Mullins imagines could hurt his Party could not be done although it would be possible to see to it that a person was not elected by the simple expedient of putting up the right type of &ldquo;man of straw&rdquo; who would split the vote, if it <Col N="1017" /> was not a regimented vote such as that of Fianna Fáil, but what I would refer to as a fluid vote.</P>
    <P>The provision in the section whereby the constituencies are measured out is specific.  It says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Having due regard to geographical features and established administrative and territorial divisions and, subject to those considerations, in such manner that the population of each constituency, as ascertained at the last preceding census, shall, so far as is practicable, be the same throughout the country.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamOBuachalla" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator is now anticipating another section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry.  What I am doing is pointing out the town versus the country aspects and it is necessary to give the quotation but I will not labour it.  In that context I submit the single member constituency must react so that even a town of 5,000 must exert a very great effect on the result of any election and if we are to depart from the ordinary political arguments and insist on the town versus country aspects we will have done a very bad day's work.</P>
      <P>Great play has also been made on the fact that there was no opportunity to gerrymander but I submit that there is every opportunity in the single seat constituency to gerrymander and I do not imply that such an idea exists in the mind of anybody.  When the suggestion is made by certain members on the opposite side of the House that there is no opportunity to gerrymander, it is only fair to say that there is every opportunity.  The simple way would be to take the three seat constituency of Louth and to see how, if you were low enough to do so, you could gerrymander such a constituency. One could review the experience in that county and see that it is true that Cooley has a preponderance of Fianna Fáil votes, that Clogherhead has more Fianna Fáil votes than Fine Gael, that Togher has more Fine Gael votes than Fianna Fáil, that Reaghstown gave more votes to Fianna Fáil than usual at the last election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1018" /> These are the things that ordinary everyday politicians know.  It is their business to know them and, if that is the position, is not the opportunity there to gerrymander?  I do not say that anybody has the idea of doing so and I would never have raised the point but for the fact that it was raised on the opposite side by various Senators. If a person was in command of the division of a constituency there is not the slightest doubt that he could gerrymander to his heart's content.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would say that the section dealing with the single seat constituency is catastrophic.  The constituency is too small.  It will make for the sort of election which there was in days gone by when the constituency was bigger.  Why do we raise the &ldquo;ante&rdquo; in this poker game?  Would it not be far better that a man would have to be elected in a wider section of the populace and that a man should be elected on his legislative ability rather than on the basis of his personal contacts? Would it not be far better, if it were possible, to get the type of person who could legislate rather than the type of person who knows everybody in a certain area?</P>

      <P>Senator Donegan is like the character in Oscar Wilde's play who said: &ldquo;I can only understand what I am saying when I listen to myself attentively.&rdquo;  That quotation would aptly describe Senator Donegan's speech, which was liberally interspersed with the usual priggish notions which we hear expressed by people who are either afraid or ashamed to enter politics.  Senator Donegan being already an established politician in his own right, one is surprised to hear such sentiments from him.  He stands in the market place like the pharisee, striking his breast at intervals and saying.  &ldquo;Thanks be to God I am not like the other politicians&rdquo;. Senator Donegan asked us when was a vote so valuable.  I could tell Senator Donegan when a vote was valuable to them&mdash;when they brought in a man on a stretcher into this House to decide a vote.  Was that man's vote not valuable? We are all of us, I hope, politicians and we should not be ashamed of that fact.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;saying &ldquo;I am not like other politicians.&rdquo;  The one thing which I detest in politics is priggishness. A similar attitude was adopted by Senator Quinlan.  He came in representing vocationalism and, indeed, if his attitude in this House is a measure of the type of candidate we will get from the vocational organisations, then give me the old-fashioned politicians every time because when one sets out to be a politician one must stand over his utterances.  You cannot stand back from the common herd and look down upon them and say, &ldquo;I am not like the rest of them.  I am something different.  I am a new Messiah and I am going to preach a new clean gospel which I hope will be the means of converting those poor politicians.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Senator Quinlan set out last night to deprecate the politicians who took part in the affairs of the country for the past 37 years.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCarter" hpid="Mr. Carter Mr. Carter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carter</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not making a false statement.  The Senator, in effect, said <Col N="1020" /> that he held out no hope for the future if politics as practised in the past continue to be practised in future.  He also said that the incidence of emigration and unemployment was due to the incompetence of the politics and the politicians of the past.  I want to challenge him on that argument.</P>
      <P>Does the Senator think for one moment that we have not progressed in the past 37 years?  Will the Senator not agree that the more prosperous we become the more difficult will be our problems in relation to the two matters I mentioned?  Does not the Senator agree, for instance, that the more prosperous we become in the farming sector the more difficult will be our problems with regard to employment for agricultural workers?  Can he not see that migration and emigration are twin problems which beset Europe and the countries outside Europe at the present time?</P>
      <P>Will the Senator not realise that we are a young country starting from a new low with no experience of self-government? Further, will the Senator not agree that the men on both sides of this House who took part even in the civil war and who subsequently formed the Governments and Oppositions up to the present time are entitled to a certain amount of gratitude and, I would say, even charity from the younger politicians and especially from the politicians of our age?  It is not fair to get up in this House and say that they have made a mess of it to such an extent that they were, if you like, the direct cause of the twin evils which I mentioned.</P>
      <P>Senator Quinlan posed three questions to the Taoiseach.  Unfortunately, I have not the logic of the Taoiseach. If I had, I would be jostling him for leadership of the Fianna Fáil Party but, in my own way, I will attempt to answer Senator Quinlan's queries.  I think the query he put was this: Was it the fact that the Coalition Government was so constituted that militated against the Government taking a firm and decisive action at any stage?  He posed that query and I am open to correction if I am misquoting him.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCarter" hpid="Mr. Carter Mr. Carter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carter</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quoting the Senator from memory and, if I misquote him, I say I am open for correction.  I can give instances to the Senator where the fact that the former Government was so constituted prevented firm decisions being taken.  One of the instances was with regard to the Social Welfare Bill of 1950.  We were promised a comprehensive social Bill. Did we get it or did we not?  I leave it to the Senator to decide that question.</P>
      <P>Minorities are much lauded now on the opposite side.  I also remember a certain minority forcing the Government of the day to beat a hasty retreat over a certain decision which was taken with regard to a post office. It beat a retreat with its tail between its legs.  Can the Senator refute that?</P>
      <P>Here is a third instance, for good measure: Does the Senator remember in 1957, when the Government claimed they were going to deal with the incidents on the Border, that Deputy MacBride came home from America and withdrew his support from the Government owing to that decision? Did those events not militate against good government?  If the Senator is so impersonal in his outlook, perhaps he would give his opinion on that later on?</P>
      <P>We assert again that the system of election, whether it is the straight vote or P.R., does not matter to a political Party and that all the finicky arguments so assiduously advanced by Senator O'Quigley, Senator Quinlan and the rest of them fall down when you come to the ugly fact.  An ugly fact, as has been said, can almost always slay the most beautiful hypothesis and the ugly fact is that if you look at any record of the elections down through the years you will see that any Party who proposed a programme and put it before the people and who stood by that programme and worked to it during their term of office, let it be long or short, always won out in the end. Fianna Fáil did better than any other Party I know of under P.R.</P>

      <P>Exactly.  When seeking election, we were always concerned, first of all, with our policy and how it was presented to the people.  It seems to me that the Fine Gael Party can be described as the Party of no hope. They and their fellow travellers have all got on the band wagon of no hope or no return.  They seem to think that if the system of P.R. is changed in favour of the straight vote they have no future.  In thinking that, they tie up with this issue all those outside issues which are not at all applicable to us in our present circumstance.</P>
      <P>I am not at all clear, listening to the members of the Opposition, that the Fine Gael Party are of one mind in this matter.  There is a division running through the Party, from top to bottom, regarding the question we are discussing to-day.  There is a number of people, solid supporters, in the Fine Gael Party and in the country who believe that the straight vote system would give us relative stability.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Do the Senators opposite argue that a series of ramshackle Governments, lasting, on the average, for two years and seven months, is calculated to give the country stability?  Senator Quinlan seems to think that politics is a huge joke.  He seems to be of the opinion that it is advisable that Ministers should be away from their offices now and again to engage in electioneering in the country, and described it as the equivalent of a holiday.  I have some experience of politics and I can assure the Senator that politicians do not <Col N="1023" /> regard electioneering as a holiday and I can further assure the Senator that, when he takes it so flippantly, he has no idea of our political system, even though when he arrived back from the Cameroons he started to lecture us on what we should do in the political Parties here.</P>
    <P>Any record of the elections down the years will show that most of the small Parties disappeared under P.R. It has been argued that this change would mean the disappearance of the smaller Parties.  No one can deny the fact, for instance, that in 1923 the Farmers started off with 15 seats and to-day they have three seats in the Dáil.  Clann na Poblachta started out with ten seats in 1948 and to-day they have only one.  What happened in that case?  Was it the system of election we had then which was responsible for eliminating them or was it their policy or lack of policy?  Did P.R. not rid the country of small Parties?</P>

      <P>It is argued by the Opposition that the straight vote will rid the country of minorities.  It has been argued from every platform on which they have stood since this question was mooted that we were making this change to fasten Fianna Fáil on the country for the future.  It has been argued that Fine Gael would disappear as a political Party.  I want the people who are putting forward these arguments to support them with facts. We have had various examples given by politicians who seem to know all the answers and all the shady tactics but who say that they themselves would not become entangled in these tactics.  I wonder how they know so much about them if they are not entangled in them already.</P>
      <P>When we come to discuss an important matter like this we should bring sober judgment to it.  We have been dragged into the byways; we have been brought to the parish pump, to the Cameroons in Africa, around America and the world and back home, after the fashion of a modern sputnik.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1024" /> Quite a number of voluntary organisations have chimed in on this chant that Fine Gael will disappear.  We heard speeches here yesterday evening which were reminiscent of a funeral oration.  I could almost feel myself standing at the graveside presiding at the obsequies of the Fine Gael Party, hearing some of the Senators patting down the last sods on the grave and the hollow sound made by the stones before the dispersal.  What grounds has Senator Quinlan or any other Senator for these sentiments? I think it is merely sentiment.</P>
    <P>The people have the final say in this matter and we have no right in a discussion on this Bill to cloud the issue or to introduce extraneous matters unconnected with the Bill.  For want of a better argument, the Opposition have tried to put it across on every conceivable occasion that certain Parties will disappear if this change is brought about.  There is no substance in those arguments; they will not hold water.  The intentions of political Parties should not be taken into account in regard to this Bill because all political Parties have the same right as we have to put their views before the people.  If they put their policy before the people and if the policy is ratified, then there is nothing to prevent their putting it into effect.</P>
    <P>Suppose for a moment that the Opposition speakers were again successful and got another period in Government would they revert to P.R.?  I pose that question to the leaders of the Fine Gael Party.</P>
    <P>If the Fine Gael Party believe they have a future and if they believe that the future lies with our own people and not with the peoples of other lands or with any outsiders, there is nothing to prevent their fighting as hard to get a majority under the straight vote as we shall fight.  If Fine Gael and Labour want to coalesce in the morning, declaring a common policy before it happened, not after the election, they have a much better chance of getting a majority under the straight vote than we have.  Will the people opposite do that?</P>
    <P>There has been a number of speeches <Col N="1025" /> here calculated to cause mutiny amongst minorities.  These are people who would wish to make scapegoats of certain minorities and send them out into the desert to die.  Many of the politicians opposite would like to do that, if one is to judge by the way they bandied about the names of the various political organisations.  That is an old knack; it has been happening since the world began.  Political Parties in other countries have used the smaller Party as a scapegoat.  I should like to say that we have no minorities such as they have in the Cameroons, where they have minorities of class and creed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">

    <Speaker pid="FrankCarter" hpid="Mr. Carter Mr. Carter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carter</NameTxt>
      <P>I showed the Senator where they were done away with under P.R.  We did not do away with them but they did away with themselves. They can either do that or do otherwise under the straight vote and the Senator is intelligent enough to know that.  Yet he produces that facile argument in unison with his colleagues to try to tell the voters otherwise.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Quigley gave an example here of standards and he reduced this issue to a pint of porter.  He said one has to have standards, and instanced the standard pint.  But he was careful to note, when speaking of the Constitution, that he wanted some sort of vague instrument which could be used by ambitious politicians to suit their own purposes.  The Bill before the House seeks to amend the Constitution. Our Constitution cannot be used by any politician for any purpose, and certainly not without the consent of the people.  So, Senators should not make odious comparisons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator O'Quigley instanced the case of the 1922 Constitution.  I have nothing to say to the 1922 Constitution except this: When the Government found themselves in certain difficulties in 1927, they were unsure of their position under the Constitution.  As far as I remember, they had to have recourse to the opinion of a constitutional lawyer.  That would suggest to me that the older Constitution was <Col N="1026" /> much more vague than the present Constitution on the matter of elections and electoral systems.</P>
    <P>Senator Sheehy Skeffington always seems to be in the minority.  No matter what system of election you might have or what type of Constitution you might frame, it would not suit him. Certainly he would have to have something different and, in seeking something different, he would not be on common ground with the rest of us. Since I came into this House I have been trying to discover what Senator Sheehy Skeffington is really driving at. I am sure that the Senator is much better read than I am in history and philosophy but, if he studies the history of the United States, England and other countries which have had the straight vote down through the years, he will find that in the long run it has given much better results than P.R. has at any given time.  P.R. is creating difficulties for the Italian Government at present and is also creating difficulties in Israel.  Incidentally, the latter are trying to get rid of it.  I hope in their efforts they will not have as much trouble as we have had.</P>
    <P>All I wish to say in conclusion is that the people will have the final say in this matter.  I hope in their approach to it they will not be as clouded on this issue as the speakers opposite seem to be.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am surprised at the turn the speeches from the Government side have taken.  Almost every Government speaker who now comes to his feet thinks it his duty in loyalty to the Party to attack the Independents and to sneer at people because they happen to be university professors. There is no argument behind anything they say other than the fact that these independent people have supported Fine Gael, Labour and other organised Parties in trying to inform the people what they may lose if P.R. is taken from them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fianna Fáil were elected with the largest overall majority any Party has enjoyed here in recent times.  They were elected on an appeal to an economic issue.  They said they would <Col N="1027" /> solve unemployment.  They told each man's wife that they would put her husband back to work.  Now, instead of solving our economic problems, they introduce a Bill to amend the Constitution and remove P.R. from it. It is an affront to the intelligence of the Irish people to treat them in that way.  The only glib answer they have is: let the people decide.  The ordinary man or woman&mdash;particularly the woman whose husband has only one or two days' work in the week or maybe none&mdash;has not the time to read up the various systems and go into the pros and cons of P.R. and other forms of representation.  The slick catch-cry will be bandied about this House, at the crossroads and at the church gates of this country during the next three months: &ldquo;Let the people decide. Fine Gael and Labour want to stop the people from having the opportunity to decide.&rdquo;  We shall give the people the opportunity.  We shall see to it that they will know, to the best of their ability, what they are doing and what is behind this matter.</P>
    <P>I particularly resent the sort of speech made by Senator Carter.  He made almost a personal attack on Senator Quinlan because he happens to be a University Professor&mdash;not because he says things that Senator Carter does not like&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCarter" hpid="Mr. Carter Mr. Carter">

We will continue, no matter what form of attack is used against us, to put the facts before the people.</P>
      <P>I spent a considerable amount of time during the past month or two in reading about these matters when I could have been better employed in the vocation I have in the country in minding my own business rather than in reading up about forms of Government. I recall to mind what Alexander Pope said about forms of Government. He said that they are the things for which fools contest.  We are wasting the time of this nation when everybody knows, and when the men at the corner who have not jobs know, that our problems are economic rather than political or academic.  Our time is being wasted on this.  People who should be doing otherwise, who have the taste, maybe, and the experience and whatever little ability we have in doing our job, are not allowed to do it.  We are taken away from it.  We are the spearhead.</P>
      <P>I have a book here by a man who has had some experience of politics but whose taste is rather literary.  His name is Christopher Hollis, M.P., and the name of his book is <i>Can Parliament Survive</i>?  He wrote this book some years ago.  I bought it in September, 1949, before there was any talk about the question which we are now discussing in this House.  I want to quote briefly from that book because this is a problem that confronted him. He spent a considerable amount of time in wondering about what change should be made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Both the Taoiseach and his Party here can decide these things.  They must be decided without discussion. They must be decided without having a commission sitting to consider them. They must be decided within the halls of the Party.  What sort of super brains trust, what sort of Messianic mission is bestowed on that Party? <Col N="1029" /> They are adopting that doctrinaire approach to this matter.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been a great deal of sneering about the Cameroons. With the permission of the Chair, I will quote briefly what Christopher Hollis said in his book.  In the second paragraph of Chapter II, he says:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;We live in Britain under a Parliamentary Government, worked on a predominantly two-party system.  Since it exists, some Englishmen think of the two-party system as a self-evident truth&mdash;think that it somehow stands to reason that on every matter there should be two opinions and neither one nor three and that those who think alike on A, B and C must also, if they are honest men, think alike on D, E and F.  This is obviously hardly so.  A two-party system, <Col N="1030" /> whatever else we may think of it, is certainly an artificial oddity and it is worth while considering how it came to be and why and whether the benefits of it outweigh its evils and absurdities.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He said that when examining the system in 1948 and 1949, the system we are to be given, the system that the intellectual people in the British Parliament, who have the training to examine these things, say that maybe they would need to consider in regard to the running of their own Parliament. We are now being told that a system that the thinking members of the British Parliament are not satisfied with should be imposed on us.  Another second best will be handed to us&mdash;not something that will be a solution.  Mr. Hollis continues:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;If any of the philosophers have any lesson to teach us about constitutional history, there would appear to be a great deal more truth in the Platonic theory that constitutions move round in a cycle, each form taking its turn and giving place after a time to another, and indeed all forms of Government are so manifestly bad and some form of Government is so manifestly necessary, that it is not surprising that men should always be acutely conscious of the defects of the particular form from which they are suffering at the moment,...&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Maybe, in 100 years' time, he might have as good credentials as Edmund Burke.  In his day in Parliament, everybody went out because they did not want to listen to him.  Senators know that.

      <P>&ldquo;......should willingly change it for another, only to find that the new form has also its deficiencies.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Now we are to change from this system and we have not been told the deficiencies. No one has made a study of it. The people doing it have had no experience of working in the Parliaments in which this proposed system is operating.  They say to us, &ldquo;Let the people decide.  You are trying to stop the people from deciding.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not saying whether or not the people are capable of deciding.  What I said was&mdash;Senator Ryan was probably listening to me when I started&mdash;that we will give the people the fullest opportunity of judging the implications of this measure. We shall see to it here, at the crossroads and outside the Church doors that the people will be told all the arguments and will get all the publicity and all the information we can provide.  It is our duty.  The late Pope, in 1953, speaking on adult education, said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The right to vote, in particular, which gives to everyone an equal possibility of influencing public life, requires in the one who exercises it at least an elementary notion of political principles and their application within the national and international sphere of politics.'</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we are going to change our system we should give the people more than an elementary notion of what will happen or what the changes will be.  Apparently there are many people <Col N="1032" /> on the opposite side of the House who object to the fact that we are going to give them that opportunity.  I think of the centuries we spent looking for the opportunity to run our own affairs and I am saddened when I remember that most of this half century has been wasted in futile discussion.  We should be able to find the necessary common agreement.  But when we are beginning to get more agreement on economic affairs this diversion, this disturbing influence is thrown into the melting pot of Irish politics, to divide us.</P>
    <P>Anyone who studies politics knows that the nearer to equilibrium that you can bring the pendulum, the better, and that if you agitate the pendulum violently you will do harm. If you have a Conservative Government on one occasion and a Communist or Socialist Government on the next, you cannot survive.  There has been a lot of talk about Britain and America.  The reason why they were so successful with the two-Party Government was that there was no violent change when the Conservatives and the Liberals changed in Britain, and when the Republicans and the Democrats changed in America.  It is like changing a board of directors, working according to a memorandum and articles of association.  They are changed because they may be too old or ineffective, because they cease to have the drive, or cease to have the necessary qualities.  In a democracy they may fail to attract the people, who are the electorate.  That is the aim that we should have here but the aim of this Bill is to agitate the pendulum violently, to get extremes in Irish politics so that there will be a swing in the electorate, so that you will have, say, nationalisation at one time and denationalisation at another time.</P>
    <P>I was impressed when I heard Senator Quinlan saying that we had a philosophy of life which was held by all the people, that we were all Christians and that we should have a more common approach, rather than something that was going to divide us. I said on a previous occasion that the <Col N="1033" /> first decade of our opportunity was lost here.  I want to see us given another opportunity and that is why I am opposed to this Bill so vigorously. I believe it will drive a wedge in Irish life, that it will drive a wedge under the foundation stones of this State and shake the whole edifice.</P>
    <P>There has been a lot of talk about the fact that perhaps Fine Gael will be driven into the wilderness.  It is quite possible that Fine Gael will be driven into the wilderness for a time.  As a Party we are not as politically minded as our political opponents.  Most of the people in this Party seem to have been brought into politics one way or another through their vocations and they would prefer to be doing something else, as Dr. Johnson said when asked about matters of that kind.  We are not quite so good, as Senator Donegan said, for going to all the funerals; we have not got the taste for it.  We do not want to do it.  If anybody objects to what I am saying, there was a letter written by Commandant Brennan Whitmore&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The section is:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1034" /> Dáil Éireann shall be composed of members who represent constituencies, and one member only shall be returned for each constituency.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I have tried to keep as near to that section as I could but I found it necessary to answer a number of points which have been raised by Senators on the other side.  One of the things said yesterday, and again to-day, was that it must be left to the people to decide but this man whom I quote, from Monday's <i>Irish Independent</i>, W.R. Brennan Whitmore, attacks both Fine Gael and the Labour Party for their lack of political organisation. He says that the reason why Fianna Fáil are so successful is that they have good political organisation.  I shall not burden the House by reading the letter.  Will the matter be left to the electorate or will it be put across in a high powered canvass? Will the people be allowed to decide calmly on how they will change this Bill, or how they will elect these members to represent them in the single seat constituencies?  I doubt it.</P>
    <P>Another thing which ran through my mind when I heard these speeches and this recommendation for changing the Constitution is what old Oliver Cromwell said, namely, that nobody goes as far as the man who does not know where he is going.  In this Bill I fear that we are being driven a great deal further than we realise.  No single member can tell us what the benefits will be.  They tell us that we will get a better member but I wonder will the Party give us the better member. That is the danger which I see.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I want to say that the Government should devote a greater part of its time in going into the economic issues rather than bringing this into Irish political life as a solvent and a disturbance, as a waste of our time and a waste of our efforts.  As far as I am concerned, I must indict the Government with wasting our time when we could be better concerned with solving unemployment and the other matters on which we should work together regardless of Party.  But we are not allowed, because our co-operation is not sought and is not wanted.</P>

      <P>May I comment very briefly on what the Minister and Senator Mullins said about me yesterday?  First I should like to say, quite emphatically, that I agree with much of what they say.  I agree that the religious minority has no justification to fear political injustice and has no immediate reason to expect any ill-treatment in the future. I entirely agree with that.  The plain fact is that they have been generously and sympathetically treated. May I in self-defence say that I have said that continuously for over 20 years in places where it was not at all a popular thing to say, and that can be proved?  I have always told my co-religionists that they have been treated generously and are likely to be treated generously.  I agree with the Minister and Senator Mullins on that.</P>
      <P>But we are legislating here for the future&mdash;not for the past and not even for the present.  Everyone in this House knows that history is unpredictable. Who, in the spacious days of 1910 or even the early 1930's, could have imagined what was going to happen in the civilised countries of Italy and Germany?  But it did happen.  No matter how strong our confidence in the community of the majority in the Republic is, we cannot be certain of it to-morrow.  That is why I believe I would be failing in my duty to one-fourteenth of our population in the Republic&mdash;and, I emphasise this, almost a quarter of the population in the whole country&mdash; if I did not point out emphatically that a constitutional safeguard against even a remote possible danger of this kind would be removed by the change proposed in this Bill.</P>
      <P>That is the fact upon which I stand. It has not been refuted.  The Minister very reasonably wondered why, when I dislike the denominational approach to politics, I introduced it yesterday. The answer, I think, is clear to every thinking man.  Sometimes one greatly dislikes doing one's duty.  It can be an extremely unpleasant thing to do. I personally found it unpleasant to raise that matter yesterday but it had to be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1036" /> The fact is that several Protestants asked me straight, as they are entitled to ask me, what would be the effects of this change on them as a minority. I answered them in the terms in which I spoke to the Seanad yesterday, that it would have this particular effect, that they would need a much larger percentage of the electorate in any constituency than they need at present if they wanted to return some one as a Protestant for Protestants.  Let me say something very definitely here.  I said that with the greatest effort not to arouse any feelings of bigotry or fanaticism.  I made no attempt, and I will make no attempt, to beat any kind of Protestant drum and say that Protestants must, as Protestants, vote against this proposed change.  I believe that the Minister would be entitled to condemn that, as would every right-thinking person.</P>
    <P>I would be failing in my duty, when there is a clear mathematical state of affairs before us, if I did not make that clear to them and to this House.  What is more, though I do not care to incur the opprobrium of the Minister and Senator Mullins, I would very much prefer their opprobrium than to be told at the bar of history in 50 years' time that this was the consequence of that measure and that I said nothing about it and neither did any other of our representatives.</P>
    <P>In our small way in this House we are making history.  We are making good laws or bad laws.  Every one of us should speak with that in mind.  It is not just what people are saying to-day. It is what people will say in 20 or 30 years' time.  Sir, I bow my head when Senator Mullins and the Minister speak of things being disgraceful, but I would prefer to bow to it now than that I or my descendants should have to do it 50 years hence.  That is what could happen if we have a change such as could happen here.  It might be disgraceful for me not to point out the risk.</P>
    <P>Obviously, however, the Minister and Senator Mullins dislike what I have done.  They are entitled to that dislike but sometimes we simply must hurt.  I was surprised, however, when the Minister used the phrase &ldquo;a scrap <Col N="1037" /> of paper being no guarantee&rdquo;.  It is a curious phrase to use.  As well as I can remember, it was first used when the Germans invaded Belgium.  They had a treaty with the Belgians not to invade them.  They did invade them. The Kaiser said it was ridiculous; what did a piece of paper matter; he would invade them.  He invaded Belgium but the tide turned against him.  It aroused the moral indignation of the world, not simply because of the invasion but because of the specific contempt for treaty guarantees. I do not think the Minister meant that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not use the phrase. It was used by Senator Mullins but not in the sense the Senator is talking about.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Stanford</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg the Minister's pardon.  I withdraw that statement and I will deflect my remarks in the direction of Senator Mullins. I apologise to the Minister.  I was unavoidably absent during his speech.  I understood he used that phrase.  However, the fact remains that the minority at the moment have the goodwill of the majority.  I am happy to say we have it.  At the same time, why should we scrap this scrap of paper?  I welcome the generosity of the people who put it into the Constitution of 1922 and the Constitution of 1937.  Why should it be taken out now?</P>
      <P>Let me once again safeguard myself from misunderstanding.  I do not pretend to suggest that there is any intention on the part of the present Government to infringe upon the rights of the minority in this matter.  This is a consequential matter.  It is the result of a decision that has been taken on completely different grounds.  I have complete confidence in the present Government and previous Governments. They are not aiming legislation against the minority but it is a consequential effect which the religious minority should face up to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many of my co-religionists, as the Minister rightly suggests, would say: &ldquo;We do not want any special treatment. We are not interested in that; we will disregard it&rdquo;.  But they should know what the choice is and <Col N="1038" /> what its implications are.  That is what I have offered.  The Minister, from what I read of the report of his speech and from what I heard and from what Senator Mullins has said, did not try to refute my facts or figures.  They said it was unjust or wrong to raise the matter but I stand on the facts and figures I gave yesterday. It will be almost impossible for members of the religious minority, if they want to elect their own members by themselves, to voice their opinions in the Dáil, if this change is approved. If the Government supporters can refute my figures I will withdraw, but not otherwise.</P>
    <P>There is one other matter.  A curiously misleading phrase has been used by both sides of the House&mdash;I venture to employ that phrase in the geographical sense.  It is &ldquo;the straight vote&rdquo;.  It is a ludicrous phrase.  This proposed change is neither more straight nor more crooked than any other kind of voting.  Senator Quinlan suggested a rather drastic alternative&mdash;&ldquo;the illiterate vote&rdquo;.  That perhaps is a reflection on many people in our country.  It is not &ldquo;the illiterate vote&rdquo; but I do suggest it is the wasting vote, and I suggest it with very great emphasis for the following reasons.</P>
    <P>It is possible under the proposed system that 66 per cent. of the electorate will find their votes absolutely useless.  Does that encourage people to go and vote?  Does it encourage them to take an interest in the elections?  That is what we very much want in this country, more interest in these matters, but I do not think we shall get that.  The people will realise that it is possible for a candidate with 34 per cent. of the votes to be elected and nothing whatever will come of the other 66 per cent. We did press for the transferable vote which would ensure that the most that could be lost would be 50 per cent. but we did not get that.</P>
    <P>I shall not press this point but I suggest that anyone who uses the phrase &ldquo;the straight vote&rdquo; is using a misleading phrase and any person who prefers to use the phrase &ldquo;the wasting vote&rdquo; or &ldquo;the wasteful vote&rdquo; is using a clearly descriptive phrase.</P>

      <P>I am very glad that Senator Stanford has come into the House. I was sorry he was not here yesterday when I was dealing with his speech.  As he pointed out, under the system we have if any minority, identifiable as a minority, wants to be sure of getting a candidate returned it must have at least 16? per cent., that is in a five-member constituency, of which there are only a few.  In a four-member constituency they must have 20 per cent.&mdash;plus one, in all cases&mdash;and in a three-member constituency they must have 25 per cent. Of all the constituencies we have, in what constituency has the Protestant minority 16? per cent.?</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to hear that.  There is not a constituency in the Twenty-Six Counties in which Protestants have 16? per cent. or 25 <Col N="1040" /> per cent.  They could not be elected on their own as Protestants to speak merely for Protestants, and for purely selfish or exclusively Protestant interests. I put this challenge to the Senator in the debate in the Dáil, and to people who are of the same mind as he is, that if they wanted to make certain that tiny minorities were represented, they would have to change the system we have and make the country all one constituency.  That is not unusual under P.R.  It was operated in two or three places in Europe.  Senator Stanford and the others do not demand strict proportionality. They want to mouth a lot about minorities and scare people into voting against this measure not because of their religious convictions but because they have a prejudice against it, and because of their political immaturity.  They want to get people to vote against this on the plea that it will affect adversely religious minorities or some other type of minority that would be entitled to be represented as such.</P>
      <P>In the Twenty-Six Counties you have a non-Catholic minority of 7 per cent.  If that voting strength were distributed over the whole country it could not, under the present system, get a candidate returned without help, and in all cases I know of where candidates of the religious minorities were elected, they got help from their neighbours of a different religious persuasion.</P>
      <P>The one thing that this debate has brought out is that, in spite of all the chat that went on about minorities, all the Senators on that side of the House are agreed that they do not want minorities any smaller than are represented at present in the Dáil.  I put it up to them that if they wanted to protect a minority that had only one-150th of the votes in the country, they should really do something about it, but they turned their back on that.  They do not want any minority smaller than the present minorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can understand the Labour Party, Fine Gael, Clann na Talmhan and Clann na Poblachta that was, having that point of view.  As political Parties go they are very lazy.  They do not <Col N="1041" /> like thinking out new ideas or taking the trouble to convert sufficient people to vote for them.  They are lazy politicians.  They want to have little Parties that can coalesce and have a leader or two at the top who are inevitably given a seat or two in the Cabinet and a Ministry to run for a while.  They do not want to expand any further than they have.  They are doing nicely as it is.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinlan wanted a continuation of the present system and wanted Fianna Fáil never to coalesce, so that the alternative to Fianna Fáil would be inevitably a Coalition.  If Fianna Fáil had been prepared to coalesce with other Parties in the past we might have had, long before now, the situation that was reached in certain countries on the Continent and elsewhere whereby the representatives of the people were divided into a number of small and equal Parties and that there would be always a Coalition because no Party could ever have the opportunity of forming a Government on its own.  That is a delightful system for Parties that have really no belief in what they stand for, that have a policy of attack merely to attract sufficient votes to get sufficient seats to be able to demand a seat or two in the Cabinet, with no further responsibility than that.  Fianna Fáil have different ideas.  We go to the people to get their support for a policy we believe in.  If the people do not give us sufficient support for that policy we will not play the Coalition game as the various Coalition groups are prepared to play it.</P>
    <P>Senator Dr. Sheehy Skeffington denied yesterday that in this Second Reading speech he stood for minorities smaller than are possible to be elected under the present system.  I would call his attention to column 452, Volume 50, of the Official Report in which he said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;By the single transferable vote, in my contention, P.R. offers a system which ensures that political Parties and political ideas will be represented in Parliament, in this House and in the other House, in proportion to the voting strength <Col N="1042" /> they command among the electorate. Such a system is eminently just...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Does Senator Sheehy Skeffington deny that the ordinary clear meaning of that is that he is advocating a system of P.R. which ensures that political Parties and political ideas will be represented in the Dáil according to their voting strength among the electorate?</P>
    <Speaker pid="OwenSkeffington" hpid="Dr. Sheehy Skeffington Dr. Sheehy Skeffington">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>As I am asked the question, I went on in the following two paragraphs of the same speech to make it quite clear that our present system, which I accept, favours only the big Parties but that that slight disproportion was acceptable; I offered to quote percentage figures, though I said that I did not want to weary the House by quoting percentage figures, but offered to quote them, if anybody asked for them, to show that the two big Parties alone regularly and uniformly benefited disproportionately under this system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>What I am trying to find out is precisely and clearly what Senators have in mind about P.R. so that there will be no codding the people down the country that they were in favour of complete proportionality which would give the minorities of one-one hundred and fiftieth of the country the right to be certain that they could get a seat.  Senator Professor Stanford cannot go down the country and say that he was all out to get the 7 per cent minority a guarantee that in all circumstances they would be able to get elected as a minority interest. If that was what was in their minds I challenged them to put down a motion which would in all circumstances guarantee that anyone who had one vote out of every 150 could get a Dáil seat; but they did not do it.  They oppose the change to this straight vote system on the plea that it will adversely affect minorities, although the present proportional system which they want to hold on to does not guarantee a minority of less than 15? or 16? per cent. this right to be certain of a seat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Dr. Sheehy Skeffington went on a little further, and I will add to what I have already quoted.  Having said that a system which ensures that <Col N="1043" /> political Parties and political ideas will be represented in Parliament in proportion to the voting strength they command among the electorate would be eminently just&mdash;he did not, however, whether it was just or not, put in any amendment to secure that end &mdash;he went on:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;...to desire any other system, even for Party benefit, seems to me to desire to derive Party benefit from electoral injustice and disproportionate representation.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I want to make it clear that no one in the Seanad or the Dáil was so much in favour of minority representation that they were impelled to put down an amendment which would secure representation for the smallest minorities, and yet they will go around the country, as many of them will, saying that when Fianna Fáil passed this Bill through the Oireachtas, or asked the people to adopt it, they were doing so in order to crush minorities and to deprive them of their just rights.</P>
    <P>Senator Professor Quinlan was very anxious to know what various eminent gentlemen, statesmen, in other countries, thought about P.R.  I invited him to read the Dáil debates, when he would see quoted there by various members of Fianna Fáil the opinions of very eminent statesmen in Europe who saw their countries collapse because of P.R., but Senator Professor Quinlan did not seem to take that trouble.  He wants to get a commission employed to go into this whole business of P.R. and see what the commission would recommend.  I believe, as I said here before, that the best type of commission to inquire into this matter are the people of Ireland, who have had experience of politics and government over the last 30 or 40 years.</P>
    <P>I think Senator Hayes correctly described P.R. and its weaknesses. He said: &ldquo;Three seat constituencies are not as good from the point of view of representation and workability as the British single non-transferable vote constituency.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, that was on another subject altogether.  The Minister is quoting out of context, <Col N="1044" /> without giving the reference and without stating the subject under debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>The subject under debate was the Constituencies (Revision) Bill, 1947.  In the course of that Bill Senator Hayes said: &ldquo;Three seat constituencies are not as good from the point of view of representation and workability as the British single non-transferable vote constituency.&rdquo;</P>

    <P>There are others who had similar views to Senator Hayes's on this matter. We cannot call on the foreign statesmen who saw Germany and Italy collapse through the weaknesses of <Col N="1045" /> P.R., but we can call to witness people who had experience of Government here and who know the weaknesses of P.R.

      <P>At column 1345, Volume 67 of the Dáil Debates, Deputy Costello said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Under the system of the single transferable vote we are bound to have a large number of Parties returned.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>He went on:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;We always understood that the real defect under any system of P.R., and particularly the system of the single transferable vote, was that it led in circumstances where there are no big economic issues before the country, to a large number of small Parties being returned, making for instability in Government.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>He said that that was inherent in the system of P.R. and the single transferable vote.  I do not have to ask M. Robert Schumann what he thinks of P.R.  We have it on the authority of Deputy Costello, who has had experience of Government since 1922 on several occasions and who had the experience in recent years of running a Coalition, that P.R. leads to a multiplicity of Parties and that that, in turn, leads to instability in Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At that time, in 1947, there were others on the Fine Gael side who had experience of the Dáil and of Government whose ideas coincided with those <Col N="1046" /> of Deputy Costello and Senator Hayes. Mr. McGilligan said: &ldquo;It was always held with regard to P.R., which this country adopted, that we had adopted the worst possible system.&rdquo;  But Senator Hayes wants us to keep &ldquo;the worst possible system&rdquo;&mdash;the system which Deputy Costello indicates leads to a multiplicity of Parties&mdash;a large number of small Parties making for instability in Government.  I think Deputy Dillon exaggerated slightly when he turned his tongue on P.R., because he said: &ldquo;I think P.R. is a fraud and a cod and that it ought to be abolished.&rdquo;  But Senator Hayes wants it not to be abolished.  He wants to keep what Deputy Dillon described as &ldquo;a fraud and a cod and the brainchild of all the cranks in creation.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Having the authority of these gentlemen on this commission we are in the process of holding in the Seanad at present and having secured the evidence of what they really think about P.R. when they stagger into disclosing their real minds on the matter, let us go back to the men who ran the country up to 1927.  In 1927 an advertisement was issued by the Cumann na nGaedheal Party, in the course of which they said to the electors: &ldquo;Your fight in this election is a fight for Government.&rdquo;  The word &ldquo;Government&rdquo; was underlined.  They said there were only three possible types of Government. They went on to point out what they were&mdash;a Cumann na nGaedheal Government, a Republican Government or a Coalition Government.  They described what would happen under a Coalition Government.  They said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Coalition means bargaining for place and power between irresponsible minority groups.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>We are talking at the present time about the Cumann na nGaedheal advertisement in which Cumann na nGaedheal asked the people to vote for them in 1927.  They <Col N="1052" /> emphasised that a Coalition Government was inevitable if the people did not vote for or give their support to Cumann na nGaedheal.  They showed that a multiplicity of small Parties, which tended to be created under P.R., meant bargaining for place and power between irresponsible minority groups.</P>
      <P>The next point made by Cumann na nGaedheal, in their appeal to the people in 1927 to support them, was that a Coalition meant a weak Government with no stated policy.  The third was frequent changes of Government. The fourth was consequent depression in trade and industry and the fifth was no progress, but stability, security and credit in constant danger.</P>

      <P>Let us examine it.  Remember that they were wrong in the light of their own experience.  They said it would create bargaining for place and power between irresponsible minority groups.  Surely we saw that in 1948.  We had a number of minority groups who swore by bell, book and candle that they would not touch Fine Gael with a forty-foot pole.  They asked the people to elect them on the basis that they would not touch Fine Gael, would not coalesce with them.  When they were elected they immediately started to negotiate for joining up with Fine Gael.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I was challenged as to whether, in fact, P.R. turned out as badly an was anticipated by Cumann na nGaedheal in 1927, when this bargaining for place and power between irresponsible groups, in fact, occurred. I want to judge the irresponsibility of the groups who formed the Coalition by what they said to the electorate, whether they behaved as responsible people who had undertaken to serve the electorate in a certain way.  Deputy Blowick, who became a member of this Coalition, said on the 3rd of June, 1948, a few months before he became a Minister:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;When we went in there&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
      <P>that is into the Dáil</P>
      <P>&ldquo;&mdash;&mdash;as a Farmers' Party, the only real farmers' organisation at present in the Dáil, we had to overcome a nasty odour as three other previous Parties had joined with Fine Gael and many people thought it would only be a matter of time until we had lost our identity as Independents. I can tell you that the strict attitude of independence which was adopted at the beginning still stands, that there will be no merging with any Party.  We have no right to sell that independence.  We never asked your authority to do so and we are not asking you now for that authority.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Although he asked the authority to stand as an Independent, to repudiate any idea of Coalition, within a couple of months&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DominickMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>And they got a Ministry for the time being.  On the 1st October, 1947, the same gentleman said that while he remained the Leader of the <Col N="1054" /> Party, &ldquo;it would veer neither to the right nor to the left, and would continue to refuse to be drawn into coalition with Fine Gael, or any Party in the Dáil.&rdquo;  Is that definite enough?  They would refuse to be drawn into coalition, but they did bargain for place and power and they got into the coalition. The Labour Party spoke in the same manner about coalitions but they joined the coalition.  The national organiser of the Party, at Dún Laoghaire, said that &ldquo;Fianna Fáil would not get an overall majority and, in the eventuality, the Labour Party would not go into a coalition.&rdquo;  But they did. They bargained for place and power. It took place between these irresponsible minority groups and the various promises and policies that they put before the people were thrown into the waste-paper basket in order to get this place and power which was so much condemned by Cumann na nGaedheal.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>It was &ldquo;a weak Government and had no stated policy.&rdquo; There were completely contradictory policies placed before the people by the various groups that went to form this coalition.  You had the Empire Party that nailed the Union Jack to the mast, in Deputy Costello's election address, and you had the Clann na Poblachta Party that were completely opposite, but that coalition certainly had no stated policy before the election and the Lord only knew, from time to time, what was going to come out of the negotiations, let us call them that, which went on between them.  But we know some of the things which did come out.</P>
      <P>Another point in that Fine Gael advertisement was &ldquo;the consequent depression in trade and industry&rdquo; and there certainly was a consequent depression in trade and industry.  During the first coalition the area under tillage went down by 500,000 acres. They were so short of money for other things that in their first Budget they cut out the £94,000 set aside for mineral development and the £250,000 set aside for lime and fertilisers.</P>

I wonder what the policy of the inter-Party Government of 1948 has to do with the fact that: &ldquo;Dáil Éireann shall be composed of members who represent constituencies, and one member only shall be returned for each constituency&rdquo;? I do not see the relevance.</P>

      <P>We have heard grumblings from inside about what went on in the Coalition.  Ex-Deputy Larkin gave strong evidence in favour of the condemnation of Coalitions by Cumann na nGaedheal back in 1927. Deputy Larkin, in 1952, after the collapse of the first Coalition, said: &ldquo;We know that Fine Gael utilised every opportunity that came not only in the open light of day but in the dark of night.

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us come down to, perhaps, a more fundamental point on the subject of the debate and ask ourselves what exactly do we want from elections?  I think it is true that all Senators are now in agreement that we do not want complete proportionality. We do not want what Senator Sheehy Skeffington described as complete proportionality. We do not want a system which ensures that &ldquo;political Parties and ideas will be represented in Parliament in proportion to the voting strength they command among the electorate&rdquo;.  No one has suggested that we should have such a system.  They <Col N="1060" /> want something else but the one thing they do not want is that &ldquo;political Parties and political ideas would be represented in Parliament in proportion to the voting strength they command among the electorate&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>If we do not want complete proportionality according to the electoral strength among the people, what do we want from an electoral system?  I submit that what we want is what has been put forward by Fianna Fáil on many occasions and by very eminent statesmen from a great number of other countries, that is, a Government that can be changed peacefully, that can be held responsible by the people for its acts or inaction.</P>
      <P>In our opinion the best way of getting a Government that can be held responsible is the straight vote system. We believe, with Senator Hayes, with Cumann na nGaedheal of the old days, with Deputy Costello, that P.R. leads to a multiplicity of small Parties, that it creates all these difficulties that were so eloquently and accurately described by many people who had responsibility for Government here and in other countries.  We want the co-operation of the people in the referendum to get rid of that system and to adopt a system that has proved itself to be effective and worthwhile in countries that adopted it a couple of hundred years ago.</P>
      <P>We know from our history that those who wanted the Irish people to be a failure always wanted to divide them. In the old days when the method of operation was the sword they tried to get the Irish people to make war upon one another for the benefit of their suppressors.  In more modern days they tried systems of election.  P.R. was one of them.  We want to get rid of P.R. and to adopt a system which tends to promote unity rather than division among our people.</P>

What we want is a reasonable system of election that will give the people on the one hand, a stable Government, a Government that will be able to put through the policy that it has asked the people to support and, on the other hand, a stable Opposition that will be able to form an alternative Government.</P>
      <P>What objection have the people who are always preaching about unity to unity among small Parties?  For three years we were deafened in the Seanad and in the Dáil by talk about the wonderful thing that unity was between Fine Gael, Clann na Poblachta, Labour, Clann na Talmhan and whatever other clanns there were at that time.  If unity is such a good thing, why reject it before an election?  Why not go to the people and say: &ldquo;We cannot get Fianna Fáil to join us, but we can get all these other people who are prepared to sit down round a table, have an intellectual discussion and arrive at a common policy for our common needs&rdquo;?  Why is that not said before the election?  Why is it left until all the bargaining occurs or until all these groups are satisfied about the Ministries they are to run?</P>
      <P>We believe that, in spite of the difficulty that Fine Gael find in facing up to this solution of our political problem, that the people will insist on it, and that the referendum will go through by as big if not an even bigger majority than did the Constitution. The Constitution was opposed even more bitterly than this amendment.</P>

The reason Fine Gael slid down from 60 members in the Dáil to 30 was because they had contempt for the people's intelligence, and it was only when they were through their penance that the people let them up again to 40.  If they continue the way they are going they will have very much less than 40.  We are going to make certain that the people will understand exactly the issues involved, and I have every expectation that just as the people in the last election gave Fianna Fáil the greatest majority they ever gave any Party in order to get rid of the Coalition, they are going to vote &ldquo;yes&rdquo; in this referendum by the greatest possible majority so that that type of Coalition is not going to return in Ireland.</P>

      <P>I wonder what Senator Stanford thinks of the Minister's speech.  I am sure he must have a certain feeling of guilt, because it was apparently in reply to Senator Stanford that the Minister rose.  I thought that the Minister was going to give us some kind of thoughtful and reasoned reply to the speech of Senator Stanford, which has importance in view of the nature of his rerepresentation here.  I would have expected the Minister to make an effort to meet that speech which was reasonably and lucidly made.  There may have been flaws in Senator Stanford's <Col N="1063" /> arguments.  None of us is perfect and all of us may make mistakes when we speak.  At any rate the Minister got up and said that he hoped that Senator Stanford would not go away.  The Minister's tall figure almost threatened Senator Stanford, and I thought that Senator Stanford was going to get a desperate dressing-down and that we would hear a great deal about minorities and be shown how absurdly illogical and unfounded all Senator Stanford's arguments were.  Alas and alack, it was poor Senator Michael Hayes who came in for all the abuse and there was hardly a word about Senator Stanford.</P>
      <P>Whether Senator Stanford rejoices in that or not I do not know, but I was very interested in the Minister's attitude.  The Minister is obsessed by Fine Gael.  He cannot get away from it.  He can make no speech without drawing in Fine Gael and it is apparently Fine Gael and Senator Hayes that are really on his mind.  His whole attitude to this very genuine problem is absurd, and he gives me the feeling of being very glad that I am not any small minority in this country subject to the Minister.  We in Fine Gael have had to face the Minister in a great many ways and we have defeated him before, more than once.</P>

He has shown to-day not only an insulting attitude but also an attitude of intolerance, of truculence, and of menace to the people who have spoken against him.  He simply refused to discuss this question of P.R.  After all, what is it all about?  Here we have a system which has been working for the last 40 years, recommended to us by the present Government in 1937 in the most unmistakable language after having had experience of quite a number of elections.  We are proposing to destroy that and to adopt the British system with the single non-transferable vote in small constituencies but, strange as it may seem, whatever the <Col N="1064" /> Minister appeared to be talking about he never said a word about that.  That is the matter being discussed now.</P>
      <P>The Minister's organisation have rooted out all kinds of quotations which the Minister persistently distorts. Every quotation the Minister gives he gives partially and then he slips on to another matter, but he is not going to get away with that here, naturally enough, because none of us was born yesterday.

      <P>They thought that they would smash the Treaty in 1922 by a Coalition, but it did not work out that way.  They were in favour of a Coalition also in 1927.  I do not think that Coalitions are relevant, but the Minister was reading a lot into the advertisement and making a very mean attempt to pin it on to me.  I had nothing to do with it, any more than the Minister, and I am sure he had nothing to do with it.  There has been no reference to the kind of coalition that the Minister and his leader wanted to make when they came into the Dáil in 1927.  The proposal was to have a Government composed&mdash;it is interesting to remember this now&mdash;of the smaller Parties in the Dáil, a Government in which Fianna Fáil would not take any part, and from which the Cumann na nGaedheal Party would be shut out, so that you would have a Government in the Dáil supported by Fianna Fáil, <Col N="1066" /> who would not be in it, and the two main Parties would be excluded.  Could any coalition, even at the Minister's worst and lowest form of argument, be more foolish than that?  That is the kind of coalition they wanted.  It was after the election they made all kinds of bargainings and promises. The story is well known.</P>
      <P>I am not sure what the appropriate word is, although I am pretty good at words&mdash;whether it was my fortune or my misfortune to thwart that particular plan, and the Minister has not forgotten it.  When Fianna Fáil came into Dáil Éireann in 1927 a vote of no confidence was put down.  There was a division and because a particular man did not vote as he had promised to vote there was a tie. Because I voted against that vote of no confidence, as, of course, the Ceann Comhairle was entitled to do and was correct in doing, the Minister has never forgiven me.  He wants to make out that I am a blackmailer, that I am given to making bargains, and this, that and the other.  This is the kind of thing that he was trying to do in 1927.  I am the person who was the instrument, perhaps the instrument of Providence, that prevented him from getting in, and kept him out of office for five years.</P>
      <P>I am not saying now that the Minister was kicked out.  I do not use that kind of language.  But he was defeated in a division.  Many men in this place were defeated in elections and I do not think that the word &ldquo;kicked out&rdquo; is very appropriate, but I could say that the Minister was kicked out of Government in 1948 and that is what is wrong with him.  But I am not saying that.  I am saying that he was put constitutionally out of Government.  Now he is trying in this particular section of the Bill to ensure that so long as he lives it cannot happen again.  That is the whole story.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the points made is: why cannot the people in the different Parties combine before an election? But why should a Labour man or a Fine Gael man not have a right to go for election if he likes?  Why should he have to make a bargain with anybody else?  Why is the P.R. system <Col N="1067" /> not allowed to operate as it is?  The P.R. system does give minorities of any respectable size a good chance.  It is useless for the Minister to repeat his old point that, unless you extend something to its fullest limit, you should not be in favour of it.  It is like a fellow eating no breakfast at all unless he can get a six-course breakfast.  As Senator Sheehy Skeffington and other Senators have said, whatever we think about the present system, it is better than any other system proposed.  That is why we are against this Bill and why we are going to vote against this referendum.  The present system is not perfect.  Various criticisms have been made at various times.  Unlike the Minister, I have reflected something on our parliamentary system, and I know something about it.  I am one of the people who preserved Parliament against the Minister, both when he was outside it and when he was in it.  He did his best from both sides.</P>

      <P>Fianna Fáil are trying to destroy the whole basis of proper parliamentary government. They do not want to hear anybody talk except themselves.  The Taoiseach makes up his mind on this and, as a man said to me a long time ago: &ldquo;Away leis agus más away, away leó go léir ina dhiaidh&rdquo;&mdash;away go all the boys after him, rooting out the files, pulling out all kinds of arguments and quotations to support the Chief.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a story in Irish about an old woman on a frosty night.  She <Col N="1068" /> went into town.  There was a great frost and all the dogs were barking. She bent down to pick up a stone, but the stones were frozen together. She said: &ldquo;Is bocht an scéal é, madraí scaoilte agus clocha ceangailte&rdquo;&mdash;'tis a poor case, stones tied and dogs loose.  That is what they want, but Fine Gael will not give it to them.  The Minister should cultivate a sense of humour.  The whole purpose of this business is to devise a scheme whereby a Party that gets first past the post gets a big majority of seats&mdash;a majority of seats entirely out of harmony with, and out of proportion to the votes they get in the country.</P>
    <P>The Minister has given no consideration to the problem.  He has no knowledge of it.  He has displayed colossal ignorance of France.  I notice he did not mention France here at all and I think I know the reason. There are two reasons in this House. The Minister does not know anything about Europe and he displayed a like ignorance of the Constitution of the United States.  He tried to divert the whole debate into the wrong channel. The Minister has made no inquiries of any kind relating to the facts.  The Minister has not got a grasp of anything at all except the coat tails of his leader.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OwenSkeffington" hpid="Dr. Sheehy Skeffington Dr. Sheehy Skeffington">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make three points arising out of the Minister's recent intervention.  First of all, I should like to suggest in relation to his quotation of the 1927 Cumann na nGaedheal advertisement on P.R. and the wickedness that might ensue from it, that in my opinion the views contained in that advertisement of Cumann na nGaedheal at that time were wrong.  But I also suggest that in now taking the same view as Cumann na nGaedheal did then, Fianna Fáil are equally wrong.  I am not prepared to accept the view that because Fianna Fáil have now adopted the view that Cumann na nGaedheal then had, it has suddenly become right.  I think it is still wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second point is that I should like to make it quite clear that, personally, in my support of P.R. as a just system, I am no more in favour <Col N="1069" /> of absolute P.R. than the Minister, in supporting the single seat constituency system, as giving strong Government, is in favour of an absolutely single Party Parliament.</P>
    <P>The third point I want to make is to put this question as briefly as I can to the Minister.  The Minister gave us figures of percentages that Protestants and other minorities would need in order to get representation in various sizes of constituencies.  He quoted percentages and figures.  Would he agree that, on his own figures, on his quotas and percentages, Protestants or any other minorities have less chance of being elected, as such, in five seat constituencies than in seven seat constituencies, and less chance again in three seat constituencies than in five seat constituencies and, consequently, even less chance in one seat constituencies than under the present system?  In other words, by changing the present system, I would suggest, and I should like to hear the Minister's answer to that specific question, their chances of being elected as such are perceptibly diminished by transforming all the constituencies into single seat constituencies in accordance with this very sub-section, which we are now supposed to be discussing.</P>

On the last occasion, when the Committee Stage was fixed for to-day, in deference to the wishes of Senator Hayes and others, the hope was expressed that there would be a reasonable, workmanlike handling of the Committee Stage and that it would not be unduly delayed.  If everybody is to make two speeches on the Committee Stage, I should like to know when does Senator Hayes or the Leader of the Labour Party expect we shall carry out the understanding I got here on the last occasion?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already spoken on the Committee Stage but like the Minister for External Affairs I would like to speak on the section. The Minister in his latest intervention again raises the question of making the whole country into one constituency. The Minister knows very well that nobody wants such a ridiculous system.  I have already pointed out that in the 1922 Constitution all that we were bound to do was to have elections on the principle of P.R. and it was left open to the Oireachtas by electoral law to determine what form of P.R. we should have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister repeated this evening that P.R. was imposed on us by the British and was therefore inserted into the 1922 Constitution but, not satisfied with that, the present Government when they introduced the Constitution of 1937 went further than the British and tied us to one form of P.R., the form of the single transferable vote. When the Minister quotes from speeches of Deputies Costello, McGilligan <Col N="1071" /> and Dillon he does not tell the whole story.  What they said in those speeches was that the system of P.R. that operated here was not perhaps the best system and that it should not be written into the Constitution as the particular form of P.R. that we should employ here.</P>
    <P>The Minister knows, if he has studied the problem, that there are forms of P.R. that can be adopted to achieve the end which the Government allege they want to achieve by this amendment to the Constitution. The Minister has been challenged upon certain figures by Senator Stanford and I trust that Senator Stanford will produce figures which will place beyond yea or nay the theories advanced by him in relation to the religious minority in this country. But the Minister comes along and speaks of P.R. being employed in two or three countries in Europe on the basis of using the whole country as one constituency.  I would like the Minister to name these countries because I do not know of any country in Europe employing the whole country as a single constituency unless the Minister is talking about the pocket States of Andorra or Liechtenstein or San Morena.  If he wants to compare these with this country the proper basis for comparison would be urban or parish councils because that is what elections in these countries amount to.</P>
    <P>There is only one country in the world, as far as I know, which employs the whole country as a single constituency for the purpose of election on the basis of P.R., and that is Uruguay; but I would point out to the Minister that that is not in relation to the representative assembly.  It is in relation to the Government that the whole country is used as a single constituency. It is provided by the Constitution of Uruguay, which was ratified by the people in 1951, that the Chamber of Representatives should consist of 99 members, elected by the people.  It goes on to provide that they should be elected to represent departments and that there should be not less than two representatives for each department.  For the purpose of electing <Col N="1072" /> a Government, there is a different procedure used from that used at the present time in this country or Britain or the United States of America.  It is provided by the Constitution of Uruguay that the executive authority of the State shall be exercised by the National Council of Government.  The National Council of Government is to consist of nine members&mdash;and here we have the whole country employed as a constituency&mdash;elected directly by the people, together with a double number of alternates for a period of four years, in accordance with the rules of suffrage set forth in Section 3 of the Constitution. The Republic is to be considered as a single electoral district.  When the National Council of Government is elected, it is provided that the Party receiving the most votes shall have six councillors and three council seats shall go to the Party with the next highest votes.  That is not the whole picture because it is the National Council of Government in Uruguay which appoints the Ministers of State and it is provided that the Presidency of the Council is to rotate annually. That is an entirely different system from the one we have.  If the Minister wants to talk about countries being turned into a single constituency for P.R., he might inform the House of the country he has in mind, instead of dealing with it in the skimpy fashion he has used in this debate.</P>
    <P>The Minister has unearthed all that could be said against our particular form of P.R. by certain Deputies of the Fine Gael Party.  He also gave us the benefit of an advertisement published by Cumann na nGaedheal in 1927; but the Minister's industry has not gone to the length of giving us quotations from various Ministers in the Fianna Fáil Government, from Fianna Fáil T.D.s and Senators and other leading members of the Fianna Fáil Party which show that all of those Ministers and T.D.s in Fianna Fáil&mdash; with the exception of the Taoiseach and the Minister for Health 12 years ago&mdash;had no doubts about the value of P.R. as a system of election for Ireland.</P>
    <P>With the exception of the Taoiseach and the Minister for Health on one <Col N="1073" /> occasion, there was no word from Fianna Fáil criticising P.R. as a method of election&mdash;not a single word. We have had nothing but adulation and admiration for it in the 1937 Constitution, and I agree with that.  I have a great admiration for the Constitution, for the manner in which it sets forth and regulates how the Government of the country is to be conducted and for the guarantees of personal rights which it contains.  It is intended now to make inroads upon that Constitution.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach, in opening the Second Stage debate here, referred to a conversation he had with the King of Italy some time before the war. The King of Italy, mark you, is quoted in support of the case against P.R. This is what the King of Italy had to say, according to the Taoiseach, as reported in Volume 50, column 256 of the Seanad Debates:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The present system,&rdquo; said the King, &ldquo;is better than the system we had.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That, mark you, was before the war; and &ldquo;the present system&rdquo; of which the King of Italy spoke was a system which led to the World War, which was such a scourge to humanity.  It is that view which is brought into this House now and quoted in support of the case against P.R.  In other words, dictatorship, according to the Taoiseach, the dictatorship which led to the formation of the Axis Powers, was better than the weaknesses of P.R.&mdash; and a world war, apparently, is better than the weaknesses of P.R.  That certainly is a new line of argument and, indeed, an interesting sidelight upon the views of the Taoiseach in relation to parliamentary democracy &mdash;parliamentary democracy in the Italy of Mussolini, of unhappy memory.</P>
    <P>The Minister for External Affairs, on the Second Reading of the Bill, was in a mood for asking questions of both Fine Gael and Labour.  He posed a question here which he wished to have answered by Fine Gael and Labour, as to whether, in the event of the amendment to the Constitution being adopted, that amendment would, at some future time, be repealed by <Col N="1074" /> both of those Parties.  I would like now to ask the Minister a simple and straightforward question, but before doing so I want to lay the base on which I think the question ought to be asked.  The Constitution is the Constitution of the people and it expresses the will of the people as to the form of Government they have; and one section of the Constitution is just as important as any other section in expressing the will of the people.  It is no thanks to the Government, as has been pointed out, that this amendment will be by way of referendum. That is what the people have decided they want.  In our particular Constitution, as in parliamentary democracy generally, the Government is responsible to Dáil Éireann.  The Constitution provides that &ldquo;the Government shall meet and act as a collective authority, and shall be collectively responsible for the Departments of State administered by the members of the Government.&rdquo;  Those are the provisions of the Constitution and they have as much weight and significance as any other provisions.</P>
    <P>I would like to ask the Minister for External Affairs how&mdash;in the situation which Fianna Fáil hope this amendment will produce, where the Government of the day will have an overwhelming majority of the seats&mdash;the Government can be made answerable to Dáil Éireann with a diminished Opposition.  I would like the Minister to explain how the Government can be made answerable to Dáil Éireann when it comes to examining, say, Estimates for the Departments of State.  At the present time, on the Vote on Account, on the Estimates and at Budget time, the Government are made answerable for the administration of Government Departments and for their Financial and economic policy.  But it requires a lot of time, thought and work, and quite a number of people to pool their energies, in order to make the Government answerable to it.</P>
    <P>I want also to ask the Minister, through the Chair, how he expects, under the new dispensation as he would have it, the parliamentary question will work.  The parliamentary question has always been regarded in <Col N="1075" /> Britain and in this country as one of the great safeguards of democracy.  Its very existence prevents abuses arising and, when abuses do arise, it enables these to be investigated in the full light of debate and discussion in Parliament.</P>
    <P>We had cases in this country, under our own Constitution, of inquiries into certain practices that were going on. We had a railway tribunal inquiry, a Locke Distillery inquiry, a Monaghan Bacon Curing Company inquiry, and others.  I am not concerned with the results of these inquiries.  The fact is that, once there was a semblance that things were not right, it was in the public interest that these matters should be probed in Parliament.  I am wondering how that will happen if we have not sufficient Deputies in the Opposition to deal with matters of these kinds.  If they are to deal with matters of that kind, they will not have any time for legislation, Estimates, and so on.</P>
    <P>If the Minister for External Affairs is interested in the preservation of our parliamentary democracy, I should like him to give us his opinion of how it will function under the new system that would be involved if this amendment of the Constitution is enacted. Even at this stage, we have the Taoiseach preparing the way for a further change.  He said, in reply to the debate on the Second Stage, that if the new system does not work the Constitution can be changed.  I want to know what will happen if P.R. has failed and if the straight vote system, as it is called, fails.  What will we have then?  What change is in the mind of the Taoiseach?  What will be possible then?</P>
    <P>Will we have somebody coming back from the Irish equivalent of Colombey Les Deux Églises&mdash;another General de Gaulle returning from retirement to take over the dictatorship which the king of Italy so much admired and which the present Taoiseach quotes in support of the case against P.R.  Is that the system the Taoiseach has in mind?</P>
    <P>Machiavelli, in <i>The Prince</i>, says that one change prepares the way for another change.  I wonder what will be <Col N="1076" /> the next change from the present change?  We are getting away from P.R., from fair play to the people.  We are getting now a system of two-Party Government.  That is what the amendment seeks to achieve.  Having had two-Party Government, will the next step be one-Party Government such as they have in Russia and in the other Communist dominated countries?  Is that where we are going?  We have one change preparing the way for another.  Has the Taoiseach accepted the Fabian philosophy of the inevitability of gradualness by consolidating the particular type of P.R. that we have in the 1937 Constitution which has caused him to introduce this amendment which in time will lead to another?</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach comes along and says that the present system is a bad system and that now we should adopt the two-Party system.  The Taoiseach seems to be of opinion that that system may not work and that we can always change the Constitution.  As reported at column 880, Volume 50, of the Official Report, the Taoiseach said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We are not freezing this, as somebody said, into the Constitution. The Constitution can be amended.  If at any time it was considered that there was a bette system than the straight vote, and we have succeeded in getting the straight vote into use, the people would have a far better chance of changing back than they would ever have of changing from the present system to the straight vote system, because in the one case the vested interests would be so numerous and so powerful that we would never have in the Dáil an opportunity of getting an overall majority.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is clear from that quotation that the Taoiseach has some doubts again in his mind, as he had in 1937 when he put P.R. in the Constitution, about this particular change.</P>
    <P>Of course, my view of the purpose of this section is that it is purely an alibi for the Government's failure to make progress by asking the country <Col N="1077" /> to give them another chance, that if they have another system of election, all will be well.  I do not believe, and I do not believe anybody in the country believes, that the election of the same kind of people with the same kind of outlook will, by a different system of election, produce any better results. There is an old saying in Ireland that you cannot make a silk purse out of a sow's ear.  It does not matter what kind of system of election you have if the quality of the people who will be returned is the same.  You will not have any greater progress under a system which gives the Government an overall majority than you will have under the present system.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinlan asked the Minister a question and the Minister shied away from it this afternoon.  He asked the Minister what schemes of national importance the Government failed to put through by reason of the existence of the system of P.R.  The Minister changed that question in some particular way and did not deal with the matter at all.</P>
    <P>Senator Ó Maoláin dealt at great length with the British elections from early in the 1900's down to the present time.  We all got these particulars and know how they work.  I had always thought that what suited Britain did not suit this country and for very good reasons&mdash;that the type of economy in Britain is entirely different from our economy.  Here, we are predominantly an agricultural community.  In Britain the community is predominantly industrial. There, you have large areas of population.  Here, we have very few areas with large populations.  There you have a lot of workers in the cities. Apart altogether from that, you have a different kind of tradition there with the Crown and hereditary aristocracy and a tradition of great wealth among industrialists and the aristocracy.  You have nothing like that in this country.</P>
    <P>There is a statement on record by a very prominent person, whose name I shall not mention, that this country is one of the most egalitarian countries in Europe, not excluding Soviet Russia. It cannot be said that Britain is a very egalitarian country.  At the same time, it is thought fit to suggest that a system <Col N="1078" /> of election that suits Britain suits this country.</P>
    <P>I would point out to the Minister and to the House that the system in Britain that gives violent changes from right to left does not at all suit this country.  We have made great efforts, through recent legislation and through bodies such as Coras Tráchtála and the visits of different Ministers to the U.S.A., to attract foreign capital here.  They do not want any foreign capital in Britain.  At some periods, I understand, they were suffering from over-investment.  We are suffering from under-investment.</P>
    <P>Now it is proposed, because the people have forgotten the bitterness of the civil war, to divide the people along different lines into right and left.  Does anybody think that, in that situation, you will have American industrialists or Dutch or Swedish industrialists, or anybody else, coming into the country to invest their money, knowing that at some stage you may have in Government, if the forecasts of the Fianna Fáil members are right, a leftish kind of Government that would be disposed to nationalise industry and thereby ruin the investment which foreign investors had made in this country?  Is that the way in which we will attract foreign capital into the country?  I do not think it is.  It does not, apparently, make any difference to the Government what the consequences of this election will be, provided they get their own way.</P>
    <P>In that context it reminds me very much&mdash;since so much history has been quoted&mdash;of Diarmuid MacMorrough who was the cause of all our trouble. Because he could not get his way with the High King and with O'Rourke of Breffni he went to England and brought over the British, in order to vent his spleen and secure his own position.  The Government now want to secure their own position and to vent their spleen on the electorate who, in 1948 and 1951, decided they did not want Fianna Fáil.  Because of that we are now to amend the Constitution to entrench the Fianna Fáil Party in office if at all possible.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach is of the opinion that <Col N="1079" /> it is the Government that counts most, that it is the mainspring of action.  He has stated that at column 871, Volume 50, of the Official Reports. That is not what the people have said in the Constitution.  The Constitution was enacted by the people and they have not said that the Government counts most.  They said that the Government shall be responsible to Dáil Éireann and the Government has not got the last say in every matter.  It is not the Government that is entitled to declare war.  It is provided in the Constitution, in Article 28, Section 3, that:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;War shall not be declared and the State shall not participate in any war save with the consent of Dáil Éireann.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The people did not think that the Government counts most there, that it was the be all and the end all and the mainspring of action.  The people in their Constitution said that that was a reserved function for the Dáil.  We have a situation in this country where people have certain views about one of our great national problems.  This particular amendment to the Constitution, if it were adopted, would facilitate a minority in gaining a majority of seats in Dáil Éireann and that seems to be the mentality of some of those who are in what, at the moment, is a very small minority.  But we propose to facilitate that small minority, in certain circumstances, to employ this particular section of the Constitution for the purpose of declaring war.</P>
    <P>I wonder if the Taoiseach and the Government have considered that aspect of the matter.  It could become a very serious problem at some future date.  Remember, it may not be in ten years' time, but it might be in 20 or 30 years' time.  That is the kind of situation which we are providing for and which we are facilitating.</P>
    <P>We had Senator Mullins quoting Mr. Ernest Blythe in the <i>National Observer</i> on P.R.  I am happy to say that the <i>National Observer</i> is not in the same position as the paper with which Senator Mullins would be most familiar.  It is not a controlled paper. <Col N="1080" /> There is freedom of expression in it and for the expression of a different point of view and it would never happen in the <i>Irish Press</i>, or any of its associated newspapers, that you would have such a strong dissenting view welcomed for the purpose of creating informed public opinion upon such an important subject as this.</P>
    <P>Senator Mullins also objects to quotations from Pope Pius XII and from the present Pope.  But I recall that on a very solemn occasion when we met here recently Senator Mullins, in spite of the solemnity of the occasion, could not refrain from quoting what the late Holy Father had to say in relation to our Constitution and I could not but think that that was done for a particular purpose.  It ill becomes Senator Mullins to object to quotations from the Pope, or any other person, in relation to the Constitution.</P>
    <P>Finally, I want to say that having got rid, to a great extent, of the bitterness engendered by the civil war, P.R. has had this effect, that where you had a number of Parties with several candidates going up in a particular constituency, the very fact that the number two, three, four and five votes would be useful to different Parties meant that there was less bitterness in elections than there would be in a straight fight.  Under the system of P.R. Parties do not want to offend too much, if they can avoid it, the personal feelings of the other candidates and their supporters.  That is because, if they do, they will alienate the support of their opponents and they will lose the preference votes.  That has an integrating effect in constituencies and prevents the development of that personal spleen which is something we can all do without.  It is a form of election that lends itself to the promotion of charity amongst people who have different or opposing political views.</P>
    <P>Apparently, however, that is not what is wanted.  What is wanted, apparently, is that people, having got over the bitterness of the civil war, should now be divided into right and left.  That seems to me to be a very deplorable, unstatesmanlike and unworthy <Col N="1081" /> attitude for a Government to adopt.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what it is intended to create.  We are told we have too many Parties.  We are supposed to have Parties now divided, not on the basis of a political breach&mdash;the Taoiseach says that no longer exists&mdash; but we are to have them divided on the only other issues which exist, economic and social issues.  If that is the case, it seems to me to involve a division of right and left, and the very words right and left have been used by the Taoiseach, but then the Taoiseach in his customary manner says: &ldquo;Of course, I am only using these in order to indicate that there will be some kind of difference.&rdquo;  But apparently that is what was at the back of the Taoiseach's mind.  As a result of the system of P.R. in any constituency, there are people who are unwilling to offend their opponents because of the fact that to do so would alienate preference votes which might come to them and which might be useful to them.  That is something which promotes a certain order, harmony, goodwill and a feeling of good fellowship among candidates.  But that will not be the atmosphere which will prevail in the future under this new system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We had from members of the Fianna Fáil Party what I can only describe as a hypocritical solicitude for the interests of the Labour Party.  In the Dáil the Minister for Industry and Commerce said he regarded the Fine Gael Party as a surplus Party and he was not shedding any crocodile tears for that Party.  The reason, of course, was that he felt Fine Gael constituted the greatest threat to Fianna Fáil.  We have had, as I said, a great deal of hypocritical solicitude for the Labour <Col N="1082" /> Party.  That is merely an attempt to comfort the Labour Party, but it will not deceive them.</P>
    <P>We had the Minister for External Affairs giving us quotations from the speeches of Deputy Costello, Deputy McGilligan and Deputy Dillon on the question of P.R.  The Minister was unable to produce any quotations from himself or any of his colleagues in the Government condemning P.R. since it was written into the Constitution in 1937.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of that and I have no intention of repeating myself, but I do want to repeat, and with emphasis, what the Taoiseach had to say about P.R. in 1937.  At column 1343 of Volume 67 of the Official Report he had this to say:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The system we have we know; the people know it.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>We are told now that the new system is a simple system.  There is no need for simplicity when the people have a system they know, and know very well.  He goes on:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;On the whole it has worked out pretty well.  I think that we have a good deal to be thankful for in this country; we have to be very grateful that we have had the system of P.R. here.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Having had a system of P.R. for a longer period now one would imagine we should be even more grateful but, instead of that, we want to pitch P.R. out of the Constitution altogether.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It gives a certain amount of stability.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I entirely agree it can give stability, and there are more kinds of stability in a country than mere stability of government.  In Britain one does not find all that stability despite the fact that they have the straight vote system.  Under the Labour Government in 1950-51 you had the Minister of Health resigning from the Government on the very small issue of the <Col N="1083" /> payment of 1/- for prescriptions under the Health Act.  That created certain difficulties for the Labour Government. You had Lord Salisbury resigning over the question of the treatment of Cyprus and Mr. Thorneycroft, Chancellor of the Exchequer, resigned over the Budget of 1950.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is related in this way: we have been told that the single member constituency and the non-transferable vote gives stability of Government.  I am pointing out that where you have people resigning from Government there can be no suggestion of stability.  The Prime Minister admitted when Mr. Thorneycroft resigned that there were difficulties.  They were able to get over their difficulties. Earlier than that, you had Dr. Dalton resigning as Chancellor of the Exchequer.  Therefore, you do not necessarily have stability of Government with the straight vote and the single member constituency.  What would happen to-morrow morning if it were known that the Minister for Finance, Dr. Ryan, had resigned because the Government wanted to incorporate something in the Budget with which he did not agree?  Would it not give rise to a first-class Government crisis?  Everybody would think the Government was at an end.  At any rate, at one time the Taoiseach was of the opinion that P.R. gives a certain amount of stability.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of that and I have no intention of repeating myself.  With every respect, I have not repeated myself in these quotations. The Taoiseach further said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;. . . on the system of the single transferable vote you have fair representation of Parties.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>These are the points we are trying to make in the course of this debate in support of P.R.  We want fair representation of Parties and not the ridiculous kind of system the Minister for External Affairs has suggested under which 1/50th of the votes could command representation.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I understood when I was in opposition that this whole principle of P.R. was being threatened, and I was rather anxious here that we would ensure in the Constitution a reasonable basis for P.R.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>There, we must part company with the Taoiseach.  He did not provide us with a reasonable basis for P.R. inasmuch as he tied us to a particular system.  But I am quite prepared to vote for the system we have&mdash;the system we know!  We know the amount of protection it gives us.  I am prepared to vote for maintaining it as against adopting a system that has never been tried out here under native Government.</P>
      <P>At column 1353 of the same volume the Taoiseach had this to say about P.R.:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I think we get, probably in this country more than in any other country, better balanced results from the system we have.  If you take the countries where P.R. exists you get better balanced results than you get in other countries.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Apparently history has changed and you never did get better balanced results in the countries which had P.R. as against the countries which did not have it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This reminds me of a book written by the late George Orwell, <i>1894</i> in which he forecast that the Communist would rewrite history in the <Col N="1085" /> light of subsequent events in order to correct any mistakes that had been made.  We had that recently in Soviet Russia.  In a publication similar to the <i>Encyclopaedia Britannica</i> published in Russia Stalin was given many pages, all devoted to praising him for his work for the Soviet Republic.  After his death, when he was denounced by Khrushchev at the Twentieth Congress, they set about rewriting Stalin's biography.  In 1937 P.R. had been abolished in Italy. Mussolini was in power.  P.R. had been abolished in Germany.  Hitler was in power.  We have the Taoiseach agreeing apparently now that Fascist Italy was far better off than Italy under P.R.  I do not think any sane person could agree that it was better to have Mussolini and World War II rather than the kind of Government there would have been in Italy had P.R. continued there.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>In what I can only describe as a rather astounding performance, the Minister for External Affairs this evening said that the Party to which I belong, Fine Gael, have never been very receptive of new ideas. I hope he did not mean to infer that what is now being done is something new, because I think the general impression given to the House from the Fianna Fáil Benches is that we are taking a step backwards and that what we are doing is really retrograde.  It is an old system of election which we are going back to and we are leaving behind us a system of election of which we have been proud for the past 40 years.  We shall all be very sorry if this change is made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The section we are discussing deals with reducing the size of the constituencies to afford representation by one elected candidate, and discharging the transferable vote to use the non-transferable vote.  I wonder will that system produce a better Deputy in Dáil Éireann?  Senator Lenihan said he thought under the new system we would get better types into Parliament. I do not think we will.  You will get better electioneers, men who are able to catch votes more effectively.  As everyone in this House knows, the best public representative is not the man <Col N="1086" /> who is the best vote-catcher.  Vote-catching is a completely separate department but we have known all our lives that many men who are expert at it are completely tongue-tied and useless when they come to discuss legislation in this or the other House.</P>
    <P>What is more, the people who are better than average&mdash;I have to go outside our own Parliament because it would be invidious to quote names here&mdash;men like Mr. Nicholson of Bournemouth and Mr. Montogomery Hyde in the North of Ireland&mdash;are men whom it is very unusual to find elected under the straight vote system. They always tend to be in the minority in their thinking and they are not any the less valuable for that.</P>
    <P>As was said earlier this evening by one of the Government Senators, Senator Sheehy Skeffington has always been in a minority.  In many ways, that was a very considerable tribute to Senator Sheehy Skeffington because, very often, such men are the salt of the society they live in.</P>
    <P>One thing you are doing, when you confine the constituencies to one man and essentially to one Party candidate, is taking a choice from the electorate and, in taking that choice, you are taking something valuable, something which was making a contribution to the quality of the Oireachtas.  You will provide the docile T.D., the docile man, the man who comes to heel, and these are not the most useful men to have in Parliament; but that, apparently, is what you want.  You want a Party of docile men, a big Party with a very small group opposing them.  You will not, of course, maintain the balance because eventually the pendulum will swing and when it swings the Party taking over will take over with a big group of docile men behind it.  You are closing the door on the thoughtful man, on the slightly intransigent person, who does not belong to any Party but makes every Party produce in the end the best Government.</P>
    <P>We have been talking a lot about minorities.  The Government must admit that the minorities must do better under the old system, but it is just funny to think that a member of, <Col N="1087" /> say, a religious minority could get himself adopted by one of the large Parties in any of the constituencies where there is only one seat.  It is cynical to talk about it.  Even inside the Party itself, there is a kind of mental minority that you are going to discard and lose.  It may not matter next year, or the year after, or even the year after, but it will make a difference in 20 years' time.  You are establishing forever the power of the Party.  Do Senators think that is a good thing to do?  I disagree.</P>
    <P>As I said on the Second Reading, I do not know what is wrong with the idea of Government by agreement, why different groups cannot agree to govern and adjust their points of view. You want to stop that.  You want to do in public life what you cannot do in your private life.  The result, of course, in the long run, will be what you have pretty well got now.  As I said before, you can change the results of a game temporarily by changing the rules, but it is only a temporary gain and eventually you will lose.  The Irish people will stand for it for a short time, perhaps for one or two elections, but after a short time you will find that you have taken an extremely dangerous step.</P>
    <P>I am afraid I must say the whole thing is just a temporary solution for what I can only call imminent Fianna Fáil difficulties.  If you make promises and fail to keep them, you do not want to face the electorate on the basis where they can punish you most effectively.  It is a cynical diversion and it will not cure anything in this country.  It will solve none of our problems and it will be spoken of very contemptuously by the man who walks up the gangway of the emigrant ship.</P>
    <P>A humorous periodical is published in Dublin and, in this month's number, I see a cartoon of the Taoiseach imitating Rowan Hamilton writing on the wall: &ldquo;Fianna Fáil - P.R. = Fianna Fáil +.&rdquo;  I agree there is a great deal of truth in that.  You are just naked and unashamed about what you are trying to do and I would have much more respect for the Taoiseach and the Government if they did not try to <Col N="1088" /> justify it as sound national policy, which it is not.  It is a temporary advantage for Fianna Fáil but not for Ireland.</P>
    <P>An American Minister some years ago had the same kind of idea.  He thought what was good for General Motors was good for America.  He was discarded, and Fianna Fáil will be discarded eventually, and discarded much more effectively because they have made the pendulum take too wide a swing.  They are reducing the standard deliberately and they will pay for it because they are deliberately trying to suit their Party's imminent position. They should not be pious about it and, above all, they should not say that we are trying to stop people from expressing their views because we must have a referendum and Fianna Fáil should not try to make a virtue out of that.</P>

Now is not the time for me to do that as I, at least, want to be in order in spite of other Senators not making very much effort in that direction.  The fact of the matter is that this part of Ireland is largely an agricultural country.  We have not here the concentration of industrial workers that there is in, Britain so that, therefore, there is not the same scope for an industrial Labour Party as there is in Britain. Senator Mullins, however, suggested that we should be more socialist and he implied that if we were more socialist in our viewpoint we could expect greater support from the ordinary electors.</P>
      <P>I do not know whether I can convince Senator Mullins that the Labour Party is a democratic Party, and if he likes to come in to play his part in shaping the policy of the Labour Party to a more socialist angle&mdash;if that is what he wishes&mdash;he is welcome to come into the Party to do that.  I now understand why he likes to wear a red tie, and it suits him as well as it suits the Minister here.  The fact of the matter is that the Labour Party believes in justice and it believes in its own right to be dealt with justly. Neither the Taoiseach, the Minister, nor indeed any spokesman from Fianna Fáil, has accepted the point that I made on Second Reading, namely, that no majority have a right to do a wrong to a minority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have a Constitution as a whole, adopted by the people, and an integral part of it is the P.R. system of election, but now it is proposed to tear that out and, in doing in so, it is proposed to do an injustice to a minority.  Senator Stanford has spoken about religious minorities and I am talking about a political minority because, whether we like it or not, we in the Labour Party are a political minority at the moment.  We are the third political Party in this country and, if the majority of the people approved of this change in the Constitution, that would be doing a wrong to a minority.  They would be depriving the Labour Party and the industrial <Col N="1091" /> arm of the trade union movement of representation in Dáil Éireann.</P>
    <P>It is useless brushing that aside.  That is the fact of the matter and Senator Quinlan pinpointed it last night when he showed what would happen in Cork City under this new system of election, if it were approved by the people. Indeed, I have intimate knowledge of that.  I know that my trade union have never been without representation in Dáil Éireann in the sense that one of our members has always been a Deputy in the Dáil.  He has not represented our trade union in that sense, but he has been there to assist our trade union in legislation affecting our members.  Since the earliest years of the Dáil Deputy Bill Davin was there, a member of my union, and for a time he was joined by Deputy Martin O'Sullivan.  Now those two people, having contributed their share to building up the State, have passed on and Deputy Seán Casey is there but, under the new system, the Labour Party cannot expect to have any representative in Dáil Éireann.  I say that is an injustice to a minority and, no matter what majority approves of it, it is still an injustice.</P>
    <P>In regard to the type of representative we might expect, let us look at the figures of the last election.  I have referred to Cork City, and Senator Quinlan has shown that in Cork City at the moment there are three Fianna Fáil Deputies, one Fine Gael and one Labour Deputy and that, with the introduction of the single member constituency in that particular area, we can expect, if the votes are left as they are, that instead of three Fianna Fáil and two Opposition Deputies we would have five Fianna Fáil Deputies.</P>
    <P>I have been looking at the position in Dublin City.  In Dublin City at the moment there are 12 Deputies representing Fianna Fáil, seven representing Fine Gael and five others, including Labour and Independents.  I have taken out the first preferences that have been cast for Fianna Fáil in the various Dublin City constituencies and I find that out of a total of 173,000-odd first preferences Fianna Fáil had nearly 76,000.  In other words, about 44 per <Col N="1092" /> cent. of the first preferences went to Fianna Fáil.  But if Dublin City were carved up into single member constituencies it is very probable that, instead of 12 Fianna Fáil and 12 others, you would have 24 Fianna Fáil Deputies from Dublin City.  That is the position on the assumption that votes are left as they are, that the Fianna Fáil vote will stay largely as it is.  Even though it is a minority vote in Dublin City, less than the aggregate vote for Fine Gael, Labour and Independents, it would secure all the seats.</P>
    <P>We all have experience of how political loyalties are based in this country.  If a family took one side in the civil war, pro-or anti-Treaty, the tendency is to stay with that particular viewpoint and to support the political Party that took a particular side at that time.  I know there are exceptions.  I know you will find that perhaps one son or daughter in a family will take a different viewpoint apart from the family tradition.  I find that usually such people who so depart are even more extreme on the other side than the people who took a decision when there was a split on the Treaty.  That is the basis of our political organisation in this country, unfortunately.</P>
    <P>We had some hope that we would depart from that sort of loyalty, that political division, as we progressed and as year followed year but, if we will have this new system of election with two Parties, Fianna Fáil and another Party, possibly Fine Gael at the moment, with those two Parties, the basis will largely be the old basis of the civil war&mdash;anti-Treaty or pro-Treaty. That is unfortunate.</P>
    <P>Senator Barry made the very relevant point that this can be very dangerous. I am sure Fianna Fáil have totted up the figures.  They are not doing this blindfold.  They know that if they can hold on to the Fianna Fáil vote which, I think, they can, largely because of the family tradition of anti-Treaty, as it is, they can expect to have an overwhelming majority in Dáil Éireann under this new system.  But if there was a swing, what would you find?  You would have a complete swing and you would have a Dáil <Col N="1093" /> elected then with an overwhelming majority of a Party which had a very small number in the previous Dáil. In other words, you would have a body of inexperienced Deputies going into Dáil Éireann and a number of Ministers inexperienced in parliamentary affairs taking over ministerial responsibilities.  I do not think that is a good way of conducting Parliament.</P>
    <P>I oppose the section because, as I say, it attempts to do an injustice to a minority.  It is no answer for Fianna Fáil speakers to say that Labour can get representation with Fine Gael or enter into bargains with Fine Gael. We are entitled to our own viewpoint. Whether you agree with it or not, we still are so entitled, but what will the position be if the people are misguided enough by Fianna Fáil and their propaganda to change the present system of election and to wipe out Labour representation in Dáil Éireann?  What will be the reaction of the organised trade union movement which at the moment has a political arm?  I should certainly like it to be more effective and I hope it will be more effective but, as it is, there is a political arm of the trade union movement.</P>
    <P>What will the trade union movement do if that political arm is cut off?  They will have to look elsewhere. How will they react?  We have had no experience in this country of what is known as the political strike. The only sort of action we have had by groups of workers on political affairs was in regard to the national struggle where, in my own vocation, it was a question of transporting the armed forces of the Crown and where the people of the railway said they would not drive the engines; where it was a question of importing arms and, again, when the organised workers took action in support of the prisoners on hunger strike in Mountjoy.  That is the only experience, away back in the past, of what I would call the political strike but if you take away the political arm, the political representation of the trade union movement in Dáil Éireann, inevitably they will have to look for some other weapon.  I would hate to see that happen.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1094" /> Indeed, some of my colleagues argue&mdash;and I think rightly&mdash;that such a development would probably give a stronger weapon to the trade unions than seeking representation in Dáil Éireann.  In other words, when the trade unions want to advocate some general improvement for their members, some legislation of assistance to their members or for the underprivileged people in the community, instead of having the Labour Party advance that policy or speak about it and advocate it in Dáil Éireann, the trade unions would use industrial action; that there would be nationwide strikes maybe of one day or two days, the sort of strike that has happened in other countries and which I certainly would not like to see happen here.  I warn the House, not in any threatening fashion at all, that it is inevitable, if you take away political representation of the trade union movement, the Labour movement in Dáil Éireann, they will have to seek other weapons.</P>

      <P>I am sorry Senator Lenihan was not listening.  I do not think that would be a good thing.  It would be very bad for this country and for democracy but I think, with our present basis of political Parties, that if you intervene and take away P.R., if you have the single seat constituency and if you have Deputies elected on a minority vote, as they will be, then you are, in effect, destroying democracy in this country.</P>
      <P>I mentioned Dublin City.  I showed the House the figures in the various Dublin constituencies.  Fianna Fáil have less than 44 per cent. of the first preferences in the various Dublin City constituencies but if you divide those into single member constituencies then in all those constituencies, even though Fianna Fáil are still a minority, they can expect to get their candidates in because Fine Gael will put up a candidate, Labour will put up a candidate and, perhaps, the Independents and Sinn Féin because the Opposition will be divided into various sectors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1095" /> We might be asked why do we not make a bargain.  I have answered that.  We will not do that.  We are an independent political Party and will not merge with Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael or with anybody else.  Before it is too late, can Fianna Fáil think again about this matter?  It may give them a great deal of power in the next Dáil. It may choke them with power but it certainly will be very bad for democracy and the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise again because some of my remarks have been very much misconstrued.  As well as that, several Senators, including Senator Lenihan, have asked for greater amplification of some of the points I have made.  The first point I want to get quite clear is that neither I nor any of the university Senators have at any time deprecated political Parties. We approve wholeheartedly of them. I am delighted to see young men of any walk of life going into the political Parties and I only hope they go into all the Parties.  However, we feel we have a different rôle to play, in that, due to being in the university, we are placed in a position of independence where we are expected to speak our minds and if we are worthy of the university tradition we shall speak our minds without fear or favour.  That is the hallmark of a university.  It is the reason why in all totalitarian States the first organ to be brought under the control of the Government is the university. Independent thought and action must be squashed until the thought that is appropriate to the ruling Party can come forth.  That is what has happened in Russia, in Hungary and all over the world.</P>
      <P>Much of the ill-directed criticism that is made here has the same mentality behind it, the mentality that does not understand the necessity for clear and impartial judgment.  I shall present facts and it is up to other Senators to contradict them by facts if they can.  We can and do make mistakes, but we shall strive to be worthy of our tradition and of the university we represent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the spirit in which my colleagues and I have considered this <Col N="1096" /> Bill.  We resent ill-founded criticism to the effect that because we take a different line from that of the Government we have become more Fine Gael than Fine Gael themselves.  We shall criticise Fine Gael in the same way as we criticise this Government, and I hope they will take it in a better spirit than it has been taken by the Government side.</P>
    <P>The overall judgment of a Government must be made on the basis of how it caters for its population, whether we have three seat or one seat constituencies, whether we have a single Party Government or a Coalition Government.  I am sorry and loath to say that, judged by these standards, we have to hang our heads as a result of our period of self-government.  It is true we have done a good deal but it is nothing like what we had hoped to do or what we could have done had we pulled together.</P>
    <P>While I do not wish to get into any political controversy, one simple fact that has been overlooked in condemning Coalition Governments and condemning the 1948 Government is that Mr. MacBride did everything possible to get a National Government formed at that period, a Government that would grapple with our unemployment, emigration and other major problems. Does anybody tell me that if a National Government had been formed it could have left a worse record behind it than we have to-day with 200,000 people gone in the five years from 1950 to 1955, and with the number increasing?  Surely that in itself is an absolute confession of failure and brings out the necessity for re-thinking by our Party and the necessity for common action.  As Irishmen we all have a stake in this country and we should be determined to make something of the country.  The inter-Party Government of the period to which I referred gave us some of the most valuable members we ever had. We all acknowledge the excellent work of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy Lemass&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>We do, as university representatives, but we also <Col N="1097" /> acknowledge the excellent work done by the former Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Dillon, and by Mr. MacBride. During that period I was proud of the brilliance and of the behaviour of Mr. MacBride as our distinguished Minister for External Affairs.  I would make bold to say that he has been our best Minister for External Affairs and the proof of it is the many times since he left office he has been asked back to serve on commissions in other countries.  I have also been proud to listen to the splendid, Christian approach of Deputy Cosgrave in his period of office as Minister for External Affairs.  I heard him speak at the inter-Parliamentary Union at which he made the finest Christian speech that was ever made in that assembly.</P>
      <P>In this debate I do not wish to deal with the happenings associated with our present foreign ministry, but I hope to take that up at great length on the Central Fund Bill at the end of this month.  Those events are a slur on our national name.  I could have hung my head in shame all during my stay in America in September and October. That is something on which a referendum could be held and on which the people would give you an answer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, the section in the Bill dealing with multi-seat constituencies <Col N="1098" /> as against single seat constituencies and its effect in representing the views of the population as a whole. We have the figures from the British general election in 1945 and I appeal to everybody to analyse these figures. In the 1945 election in England 487 people out of every 1,000 voted Labour, that is, slightly under half, and they got five out of every eight seats. They got a total of 393 seats.  There is no objection to that.  Five years afterwards Labour got 463 out of every 1,000 votes, losing 24 votes out of every 1,000 or two in every 100; yet their number of seats dropped from 393 to 315.  But listen to what is coming. A year afterwards they went to the electorate, gaining 23 votes in every 1,000, which brought them back almost to their 1945 position with 486 votes out of every 1,000.  In 1945, they had 487 votes in every 1,000, a difference of one vote per 1,000.  Yet, in 1945 they got 393 seats, and in 1951 they got 304 seats and were defeated.  Can anybody call that an honest system or a simple system?  Can anybody suggest for one moment it is fair that the same vote which put in an overwhelming Labour Government in 1945, should put them in Opposition in 1951?  Surely that is not a fair system. You cannot describe it as a simple system.  In fact, you might call it a crooked system, if you called it anything, because there is such distortion of the views of the electorate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1931, the coalition Parties in England, the Liberals and Conservatives, for 14,500,000 votes got 554 seats, and the Labour Party Opposition, for half that number of votes, for 7,000,000 votes, got 61 seats.  It took almost five times as many votes to elect a Labour member to the House as it took to elect a Government member.  Is that the type of distortion we want?  If it is, why not pick out the names of Deputies from the sweepstakes drum in Ballsbridge? Yet the Taoiseach said, and I quote again, &ldquo;It is a simple method.&rdquo;  Yes, it is a simple method in that you only have to put down an &ldquo;X&rdquo;.  It does not matter whether you are literate or illiterate, you can make an &ldquo;X&rdquo;. But he says it is a straightforward <Col N="1099" /> system.  Straightforward, where there is even a greater lottery than there is in the sweepstake, where for the same vote in one election you get 393 seats and in the next you get 304.  Remember, that is the Frankenstein monster brought into Irish political life by this change from the multiple member constituency to the single member constituency. Senators may think it is bad in England, but it is nothing compared to what it can be here if ever the misfortune happens that this Bill is passed.  Here we do not have those tied seats that they have in England.  It was the tied seats that were given to the few Labour representatives in 1931.  Is it any wonder we say here, with your system of divide and conquer, that if the voting were the same as at the last election, there would be at least 120 Fianna Fáil Deputies returned and less than 20 Opposition Deputies?</P>
    <P>Where are you going with such a system?  Remember, it could work against you the time after just as well as it can work for you the next time. Certainly, that is the very antithesis of stability.  Remember, in 1931, in England, the country was tidied up, like the Taoiseach wishes, into neat divisions.  On the one hand was the Conservative and Liberal Coalition, and on the other the Labour Party. So, the electors were faced with only two names in each constituency.  Yet you see the appalling result: four and a half times or five times as many votes were required to elect a Labour man as to elect a member of the Coalition.  Is that what you want here?  Do you want to ask the Irish people to introduce a system by which you can get a Fianna Fáil Deputy elected for one-fifth of the votes it takes any other Deputy to get elected?</P>
    <P>I think it is about time we were getting some little bit of understanding of the Six-County system.  We should call this straight vote what it is: it is the Belfast system we are introducing here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us see how <Col N="1100" /> the Belfast system works.  According to a Government spokesman, Senator Ryan, 60 per cent. of the people in Northern Ireland are Unionists, and Senator Ryan accuses us of distorting the facts when we give the results of the last election there: 39 members out of 52 for the Unionists&mdash;75 per cent. of the total seats&mdash;and a handful, 13, for the Opposition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>What about the P.R. figures?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall come to that.  In other words, it takes at least twice as many votes to elect a member of the Opposition in Belfast as it does to elect a member of the Unionist Party.  I say at least twice because, of that 60 per cent. of Unionists, some of them are supporting Opposition candidates&mdash;they are supporting the Unionist Labour candidates.  So I ask in all sincerity&mdash;this is another straight question for a straight answer from the Minister for External Affairs&mdash;do you endorse this system in Northern Ireland, by which twice as many votes are required to elect a Nationalist or a Labour member as are required to elect a Unionist; or do you say it is unfair to our people across the Border?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, to come to Senator Lenihan's little L. and H. debating point, where he says you cannot compare, because the change over took place in 1929.  I think the Taoiseach should send his congratulations, at least posthumously, to Lord Craigavon as the first man who got away from this frightful P.R. system and learned how to control minorities.  Take the figures for the 1925 general election in Northern Ireland, as given in Professor Hogan's book.  The Unionist Party, including the Independent Unionists&mdash;and they really should not be lumped together with the Unionist Party because under the straight vote they are enemies of the Unionist Party proper, as are Sinn Féin&mdash;but, conceding that, in 1925, we get 33 members elected for the Unionists out of 52, that is about 65 per cent.  In the following election in 1929, under the Belfast voting system, we get 37 between Unionists and Independent Unionists.  So, they <Col N="1101" /> went up from 33 to 37.  You say that is immaterial.  What are four seats in 52, or, referring to our Parliament here, what is a mere ten seats?  We have seen Parties glorying in election success here with far less than a gain of ten seats.  In fact, Fianna Fáil have not oscillated much more than ten seats during their period.  Anyway, the Unionists' share went up by four in 1932, about 12 per cent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">

      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>The figures are right here before me and Senator Lenihan will get his chance.  Those figures, you might say in a rough generalisation, did not appear to make much difference at that period, a few seats, three or four.  But see the record of the Unionist Party ever since!  It went from 34 seats to 39 in 1938 and to-day it is 39.  Here is a straight question and I want a straight answer to it: Does the Minister for External Affairs think that this continued support for the Unionist Party, this growth from 33 seats up to 39 and staying steadily at 39, is a tribute to the excellence of the Government that the Unionist Party have given to the Six Counties in that 30 years?</P>

Nowhere else in the world has there been a Government remaining in undisputed power since 1922, in other words 37 years of undisputed power, and yet our political Parties and Ministers wax eloquent on the failings, faults, injustices and the gerrymandering and everything else associated with that Government.  You cannot have it both ways.  You cannot approve of the system and say the results are right and proper and at the same time say that the North has the worst Government in the world and the most unfair Government for the past 30 years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>No, Sir, not for one moment.  If we concede that, we might as well forget about Partition. I was just coming to these facts which would make the Senator's question altogether unnecessary.  If we had P.R. in the Six Counties, just as in every other country we would have the rise of a Labour Party which would have as one of its essential ingredients opposition to the existing Government, the Unionists.  After a few years they would begin to trade&mdash;I shall not use the word &ldquo;trade&rdquo;&mdash;they would begin to exchange No. 2 and 3 preferences with the various other Nationalist Parties because at least the Nationalists would prefer to give No. 2 votes to the Labour Unionist Opposition than to the Unionist Party in power.  I take it nobody disputes that point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We take also the business of creating a multiplicity of small Parties. Actually, the Belfast vote has done that because once a man deviates from the Party he has either to go into exterior darkness or he has to go up as an Independent.  What have we to-day? We have as many as four different Labour candidates contesting seats in some of the Northern constituencies in past elections.  These are as much <Col N="1103" /> enemies of one another on election platforms as they are of the Unionists proper.  If they had P.R. there, while those people would differ from one another just as National Labour and the Labour Party differed here in the 1940's, still they would be Labour first, just as I hope all of us here are Irish first.  They would be Labour first, and would pass their No. 2 or No. 3 votes to other members of the Labour Party, and so breaches would be healed and there would be no great loss in the overall effectiveness of the votes.  These would combine; they would have increased their strength and eventually the day would be reached&mdash;in fact I think it would have been reached by now, but for the war &mdash;where the stage would be set for an inter-Party Government to displace the Unionist Government in Belfast. In that inter-Party Government the Nationalists would be offered a part and they would take their place in it.</P>

      <P>Of course they would not be able to carry out their complete programme.  They would have to work out an agreed programme with Unionist Labour.  They would get down to the business of running the Government and after three, or four, or five years of that in the North the ordinary, decent working members, the non-Catholic members who dread this &ldquo;Catholic monster&rdquo;, would see that after all &ldquo;these Nationalists&rdquo;, &ldquo;these Catholics&rdquo; are not such bad fellows and that they are able to co-operate just as Labour and Fine Gael co-operated here to their undying credit.  That would create a new feeling, a feeling that co-operation with Catholics was possible.  Remember that is the main barrier to ending Partition, this feeling of distrust that Protestants have of co-operating with Catholics.  It can only be broken, first of all, within the Six Counties itself and the straight vote or, as we should call it, the Belfast vote has seen to it that that is not possible either at local or national levels.</P>

      <P>So much for Northern Ireland.  We now come to a matter that was treated as a huge joke, the referendum in the British Cameroons.  In fact, one member thought I was talking of the system of Government there.  That just shows the attention that is given to the debates and it shows the closed type of mind that hears in what is said only what it wishes to accept.  I was simply citing, to the credit of the high standard set by our representative, Mr. Kennedy, his address to a committee of the United Nations where he insisted that you should not confront the people of the British Cameroons with the question: Do you want black or white?, as our people are being confronted&mdash;</P>

    <P>Our representative insisted it was not sufficient to ask these people: Do you want to join with one country or stay as you are?  They worked out four possibilities, including eventual independence as one.  I have listed those before and I do not need to give them again.  He insisted, and quite rightly so, that the people <Col N="1105" /> should be asked to select which one of those four was the most suitable to them, by being asked: &ldquo;Which one do you approve of best?&rdquo;  They would have to use three or four figures &mdash;1, 2, 3, 4 to record their approval. Would it not be a grand thing, could you not say you were consulting the people, if you broke up this trick question into four parts, that is to say, if you put down: &ldquo;Do you approve of the multi-membered constituency or do you not?&rdquo;  And again: &ldquo;Do you approve that the constituencies be reduced still further, that no constituency should have more than three seats?&rdquo;  And again: &ldquo;Do you think we should introduce the single seat constituency but with the transferable vote?&rdquo;  And finally: &ldquo;Do you think we should introduce the single seat constituency with the non-transferable vote&mdash;the Belfast system?&rdquo;  If you wish to be fair to the people, you would have given them that choice, but you are not, you are just giving them this trick question: &ldquo;Do you approve of one system as an alternative to the other?&rdquo;</P>

      <P>The most valuable case which has been made against the proposed change, the most valuable contributions in that regard, have come from the Government side of the House, including those of the Minister for External Affairs.  They <Col N="1106" /> are the most quotable, on the question of the commission, showing how they just do not want to give the facts to the people, showing how cynical has been the charge against us here that we are preventing the people from having their choice, that we are standing in the way of the people.  We are not; we are demanding that, first of all, the people have full and adequate information which they can respect as being impartial.  Secondly, we are asking that the referendum be put to to the people in an intelligent and simple form.  We are &ldquo;simple minded people&rdquo; here, if we quote the Taoiseach; &ldquo;the simple method appeals to us&rdquo; in a direct question. Nothing could be more indicative of the whole project than the direct question which has been formulated for our people.</P>

      <P>As an indication I gave the contribution of Deputy Norton in his six-year period, which is recognised as a sound and valuable contribution by all of us.  Deputy Norton in that period earned the respect of all people who value this country.  It was a courageous, intelligent and fine effort to take on and carry on an alternative Government. It would have been far better at that period had the suggestion of Mr. MacBride been listened to and had we got a National Government which would have tackled our grave problems of unemployment and emigration and which would have put everybody to work to solve those problems. That I think was the glorious opportunity missed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I put many questions.  I put some to the Minister for External Affairs, but he does not seem to have got them very well, so I had better repeat them. You had a strong majority between 1933 and 1938; you commanded a solid majority in Dáil Éireann; also, having abolished the Seanad, you had no opposition there, either.  Therefore, would you tell us what measures you were prevented from carrying out during that period by the fact that you did not have another 50 seats, measures which would have been beneficial to the country from that on? Again, in the 1939-44 period, when you had, in effect, almost a Coalition, where you had the loyal support of all the Opposition Parties during that period, where we recognised that we were all in a fairly perilous situation with the war round our shores, when we began to feel at last that we were Irishmen all, and when political recrimination died down in that period, tell us what provision you made in <Col N="1108" /> that period for the years after the war?</P>
    <P>Where was your emphasis on education? Where was your emphasis on getting the unemployed to work? Where was your emphasis on planning or building for the future?  Where were the commissions sitting down to think and to plan for the future?  Even England, in her war-torn condition, saw that there was a future over the horizon and she got on with her planning, despite the fact that the bombs were raining down on London.  What were you prevented from doing in that period?</P>
    <P>I come now to what I regard as the most critical period of all our existence, between 1945 and 1948, the period when we definitely missed our opportunity.  In that period you had one of the largest majorities you ever had.  Any more seats in the Dáil would not have been of any use to you.  During that period I believe that our whole future was lost.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">

Had you kept the squeeze on at that period, no more a squeeze than they had in England at the period, had you got some&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>The worst feature of all this proposed change is that by means of the single seat constituency, you force Parties to preelection pacts in every constituency and county.  That, surely, is a type of bargaining that we should not introduce or debase our Irish political life with.  As there are so few differences in policy, I do not see why we should resort to that.  I do not see why we cannot have at least a minimum of three seats in which case any good man is certain of being returned.</P>
      <P>The Government should show their sincerity to the electors by making honest arguments to the electors and not simply trotting out, as the Minister is trotting out again and again, silly ideas, such as &ldquo;why not increase the size of the constituency so as to include all minorities, or why not have one constituency for the whole country&rdquo;?</P>
      <P>It is not we who propose to change the system; it is the Government.  We are accepting the present system as it is.  At least, we regard it as a workable system and one that has worked well.  I personally&mdash;and I speak for my fellow-members in the universities &mdash;would welcome very sincerely a commission to examine our present system, to examine it dispassionately and carefully and to return its findings to the Houses of the Oireachtas from which they could be passed on to the Irish people in a properly-framed Referendum Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are many features of our Irish Government that we could, with profit, investigate and see if we could change for the better.  For instance, there is the total lack of committee work.  I remember four years ago, when we were on the Agricultural Institute business, we created almost a <Col N="1110" /> sensation by looking for the agricultural committees of the two main political Parties at the time.

    </Speaker>
    <P>What did we find here?  I went to the Library and looked up how many members of the Jewish community there are in this country.  According to the 1951 census, the figure is 3,930. There is one in about 800 of our population.  Therefore, on the basis of fair play and on the Minister's minority approach, they should be entitled to one in 800.  What do we find?  Actually, they have got one <Col N="1111" /> member out of 147.  In other words, they have six times their proportionate representation here, just as they have it under the Balfour system.</P>

      <P>I must concede the title to the Senator seeing that he has been able to lecture all of us university professors on our duties and how we should present a fair and impartial case, according to his legalistic mind, which only sees one side at a time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To pass from that point, if Senator Lenihan is worried that it might be undemocratic to fill by-elections during <Col N="1113" /> the period then he might compensate for that by reducing the life of the Government from five years to four, or to three years, or whatever term he thinks fit.</P>

      <P>In other words, the thing is not just black or white. There are not just the existing system and the system which the Taoiseach has found, on looking into his heart. These are not the only two systems. There are 300 variations of P.R. alone and we have worked out an Irish variation of it, one that has given us the utmost stability and sense of fair play between all Parties in its 37 years' existence.  Yet it is proposed to give us a system that we have denounced again and again.</P>
      <P>Senator Lenihan was rather worried. He could not take my figures that in the last election Fianna Fáil would have got at least 120 seats in the Dáil.  He quoted a number of figures from West Cork and from East Cork.  They were rather impressive figures.  He said, for instance, that West Cork had only something like 9,300 votes out of a total of 26,000. In other words, the Opposition had 17,000, and he threw up his hands in horror and said: &ldquo;How could Fianna Fáil possibly get a seat there?&rdquo;  He conveniently ignored what is regarded as being a principle in this Bill, the fact that the votes are to be non-transferable. He conveniently ignored that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us have a look at West Cork and see what happened.  Fianna Fáil had 9,300 votes, Fine Gael had 5,800 votes, Labour had 6,400 and the farmers 4,600, so we have got to get back to pre-election pacts.  But the Irish people will not stand for pre-election pacts.  They have not stood for pre-election pacts in Cork.  Neither have the people in England stood for them except for a short period during the Conservative-Liberal coalition. Unless we want to corrupt political life and force these political pacts on the people we have to take the figures as they are and presume these Parties <Col N="1114" /> will contest and, on that basis, with less than one-third of the votes in West Cork, Fianna Fáil could very easily get the full three seats there.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no such thing as an anti-Fianna Fáil candidate. Again, in East Cork, in that period, there was more or less the same situation.  In other words, this golden, Roman rule&mdash;divide and conquer&mdash;has now come back to Ireland and the instrument is to be the non-transferable vote.  The one-seat is not by any means as democratic as the three seat, but the non-transferable vote is the measure of justice that has been inflicted upon the people in this Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">

      <P>No.  Senator Dowdall was rather worried about the future of Deputy Casey whom she and the Minister for Education regard as one of the outstanding young Deputies to come out of Cork in recent years. Where can he get a seat, on the figures of the last election?  Fianna Fáil had 21,000, Fine Gael 11,000, Labour 6,000, and Sinn Féin 5,000.  Where can you carve out the piece of Cork that will ensure a seat for Deputy Casey unless you insist that we must have all these pre-election pacts?  If you insist on pre-election pacts do not act the hypocrite or the Pharisee and say that you are cleaning up political life when you are bringing corruption down to the lowest level.  After doing that, and splitting the people, you suggest calmly that the person elected on this split will represent all the people of that constituency.  Did anybody hear such a fairy tale in all his life?</P>

      <P>Now we shall look at a slight discrepancy.  I was rather amused when I heard every virtue is to be associated with the Belfast system of voting.  We will have absolute stability; we will have an Opposition that is ready to take over at any period; we will have absolute loyalty, attention and detail to the working of the constituencies and, above all, we will have a considerable increase in the stature and ability of the candidates. All of these fairy tales are being told to this House.  I read in the Seanad Debates, at column 883, where the Taoiseach says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Under the single member constituency system, it is quite obvious that an individual who is anxious to serve his particular community, and serve the nation, who is known to his particular community, and respected by it, will have a far better chance of being elected, as against any machine, than he would have under the present system.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>There is no doubt whatsoever about that.  That is the Q.E.D. at the end of it.  There is a golden rule in lecturing: if you are trying to prove something and you cannot, you just simply flourish your hand and say: &ldquo;It is obvious that&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; That covers everything.  That seems to be the Taoiseach's view as to what the single member constituency will do.</P>
      <P>We have here a recent publication by Dr. Ross.  He is an acknowledged specialist in this subject.  His reputation is not for us to question since he is an acknowledged expert in his sphere.  He has written many books on parliamentary representation.  His latest major work, <i>Elections and Electors</i>, has brought him an international reputation.  He is a man of standing.  What has he to say about how this system works in England? Remember, we are glorifying it now.</P>

      <P>Again, I say that no number of pseudo-<i>ex cathedra</i> statements by the Taoiseach will convince anyone of the contrary.  There is no doubt whatever about that.  There is no use in the Taoiseach saying there is no doubt about his argument.  I am prepared to give the argument advanced by Mr. Ross at least equal credence.  He has lived under the British system.</P>
      <P>There is certainly a case to be made. Let us ask independent, neutral people what they think.  Let us ask them what is the power and the basis of the Party machine in England?  Let us ask them why it is the Party machine there makes its selections a year or more before the actual elections?  Let us ask them why they squeeze out independent-minded men?  I have mentioned Hyde and Warnock, and this recent affair in Bournemouth.  That is the kind of thing that happens under the single-seat non-transferable vote system of election.  People with independent minds are simply not wanted.</P>
      <P>Another point that must be considered in this context is the fact that we are surprised at the awful savages who got control of the machine in Germany.  They were inhuman.  They were beasts.  No one could say other than that they were scarcely human. Their rise is very easily explained.  The same thing has happened in Russia. The same thing has happened in Hungary. The question is: how do all these bad men come to the top?  The answer is a simple one.  As the standard of political life deteriorates the good element in the population takes the attitude: &ldquo;We will have nothing to do with these.  They are bad.  Politics are bad; they are rotten.  We will not be contaminated by them.&rdquo; They move out and a worse element moves in, and as things get worse still, more and more people get fed up with the Party machine.  They move out, and finally we are left with the Hitlers, the Mussolinis, the Castros and others. These are the men the powerful Party machine throws to the top.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>To sum up&mdash;we believe replacing the multi-seat constituencies by the single seat constituencies is the wrong approach.  It is making our Constitution the football of Party politics.  Before any such approach is made, we should have had an impartial investigation by a commission which would have taken evidence from people, including the man most quoted here, Professor Hogan.  I see the Government Party have dropped his name in the last few debates since they read his conclusions, and perhaps Senator Mullins would be good enough to place page two of the <i>Sunday Press</i> at the disposal of Professor Hogan to give his views to the general public before this referendum is held.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>One must apply to the Taoiseach for that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, then, we can apply to the Taoiseach, but if you <Col N="1126" /> have such respect for Professor Hogan, as I and every one of his colleagues have, you must know he is a man of the soundest views, a man of the highest integrity, and he is aghast at the present proposals.  Any election has to provide two things.  It has to provide a Government and it has to provide representation.  A Government is provided once you get some clear majority, whether it is for a single Party or a coalition of Parties, a majority that will enable it to carry on and do the work.  That is the first requirement.</P>
      <P>The second requirement is that there should be proper representation in Parliament.  The single seat constituency will do the first; it certainly will give us strong Government, almost as strong Government as they have in Belfast, and perhaps nearly as strong as the British gave us here during their period of rule, but strong Government does not necessarily provide stability. Under that system we will have this violent swing from one side to another, and violent swing always throws up a dictatorship, whether it is dictatorship of the right or dictatorship of the left.  We are being asked to change from a system which is acknowledged to be the most stable political system in the world, a system well suited to our needs.  The single Party system will not give us the representation we need.  It will mean that Parties will go in and out of office and, when a Government changes, most of the leading members of that Government will go out.  Under the three seat constituency, that is not so.  Normally a Minister of an outgoing Government, if he has done a reasonably good job, is almost certain of re-election, and it may rightly be held that an ex-Minister in the Dáil is almost as valuable as a Minister in office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the foundation upon which democracy is built, and we are going to sacrifice all that.  We will get into these wild swings, this instability, this lack of representation and everything else, all for the sake that the Party Whips need not worry about a couple of their members being in hospital. They will always have 30 extra members to call upon.  Surely that is not <Col N="1127" /> what a Government is for?  In fact, a Government with a majority of five or ten, provided it does not have to face the hazards of by-elections and the unfair hazards introduced by them, should go its full term.</P>

      <P>I was amused by some speakers who spoke about my references to the elections in 1933, 1938 and 1944, when I said they created no more disturbance than if the Ministers concerned had been out ill for a fortnight, or had taken a fortnight's holidays.  That is what you have during an election campaign.  The Ministers are away from their offices quite a lot, but that is the only change. The civil servants carry on and many believe they could carry on far better without the Ministers.  Whether that is correct or not is another question.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>The civil servants carry on and when the same Minister returns to his office he has not to begin and learn the job from the start, as if he were a member of a new team coming in.  Such elections should not be classed as elections.  It is puerile to class those with the tremendous political upheavals in England where the Conservatives are followed by Labour, where there is a whole policy of nationalisation practised for four or five years, and then the Conservatives come back in office again, trying to unscramble all that.  That is not stability and is that what you want here?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we come to judge other countries we have to insist that the only standard by which we can judge them is the standard of their performances. The population of Western Europe, since 1945, has increased 13 per cent. while ours has decreased.  Who has been successful&mdash;the Governments of Western Europe or ourselves?  They have recovered from the effects of a major war while we sat here and had little or no war damage to make good. The countries of Western Europe are crushed by the heavy burden of taxation caused by the armaments race. <Col N="1128" /> They very often live in fear, with Russia across their frontiers, and they have to devote a large proportion of their incomes to national defence. Here, we have no such commitments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order. Has the Central Fund Bill already come to the Seanad from the Dáil?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yet, we have criticised those Governments.  They are only Coalition Governments whereas we have had, over most of that period, single Party, large majority Governments.  Compare our results with theirs, and personally I would settle any time for the achievements of the Coalition Governments of Denmark, of Holland and of Sweden, than any Belfast system of election.</P>
      <P>In fact I do not see that the North has made such comparable progress, under the Belfast system of election, that we should hold it up as an example.  Coalitions are natural in those countries.  The very divisions of their peoples order them. Labour, Conservatives, Liberals, Radicals, and all these people, are able to come together and do a workmanlike job. They have kept unemployment at a low level.  They have expanded production and they have set standards about which we here are all the time preaching.  How many times do we hear about what they do in Denmark and in Holland, but now the Minister thinks we should preach a crusade to those people to tell them they are living in sin&mdash;perhaps not living in sin&mdash;but are on the verge of a volcano, that they should get back from the edge, use the Belfast system of voting, and endeavour to put straitjackets on their political Parties to make them into two main groups.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister forgets the trouble that Signor Fanfanni has in Italy, with his wings, to the left and to the right, and I presume that when the day of a united Ireland comes, as please God it will, the intention of the present Government would be that it should have its Unionist wing too&mdash;it should be everything to all men and we should still get back to a two Party system.  But, whatever way we <Col N="1129" /> approach the solving of the Partition problem, we will not have just two Parties in Ireland after Partition is ended.  We will have at least three or four Parties, and, please God, we will work together and work out the salvation of the country to the best of our ability.</P>
    <P>Therefore, all this criticism of Coalition Governments is, I suggest, very ill-founded.  It is as if government should be an end in itself, and that the majority a Taoiseach carried would be the only test to be applied to his strength.  For two years we have had the strongest Government we ever had in this country, but what has been done?  For two years we have been waiting for a farm apprenticeship scheme and where is it?  It is not even mentioned in the White Paper.</P>

I never heard such nonsense&mdash; I am sorry to use that word&mdash;brought into this debate by a senior Minister. I can only brand as nonsense the suggestion that the straight vote or the Belfast vote was the only thing we needed to have here to have the same as the American system and that the Belfast vote would work here in exactly the same way for stability as the Belfast vote works in America.</P>

      <P>I think Senator O'Quigley did an excellent job earlier to-night.  The point I want to make is this: If you want the American system here, that is all right.  Give us the Belfast vote but give us a Senate that has real power and where one-third is elected each two years.  Give us a House of Representatives elected every <Col N="1131" /> two years.  Give us a President elected independently by the people and a President, above all, who can draw his Cabinet from the country as a whole.</P>

      <P>I can stand up at any time and deal with unfounded interruptions.  Two most depressing things struck me very forcibly in this debate.  One&mdash;I am sorry to confess &mdash;is the very illogical arguments put forward, especially by the Minister for External Affairs.  His speeches, as printed, are the greatest case that can be made for retaining the present system.  The other point is that I am deeply worried by the attitude of the rising young men in Fianna Fáil who hope to be Ministers in a few years time.  I hope they will realise that politics is not a game.</P>

      <P>It is a serious occupation.  The spirit of divide and conquer will never get us anywhere in this country.  As a small nation, with a population of 3,000,000 people, fewer than you have got in the City of New York, our job is to pull together. There may be a hard road ahead.  There may be hardships ahead. We may have to tighten our belts.  We may have to take less to build for the future, but if we work together and share the sacrifices&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and if we get over the idea that we need a bully and a dictatorship to do the job and if we get back to our Irish heritage, we can make this country the place which those who went before us hoped it would be.</P>

      <P>I should like to say that I have been examining the possibilities of how best to expedite the consideration of this Bill and the remaining business which we have on the Order Paper and other important business which is coming from the Dáil.  I should like to submit the following proposal with that end in view &mdash;that we meet on Tuesday next, 10th March, at 3 p.m. to deal with important business as distinct from the Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill; that on Wednesday we resume consideration of that Bill and make every endeavour to put the question on sub-section (1º) at 6 p.m. and the question on sub-section (2º) at 10 p.m., and that on Thursday we resume consideration of the Bill and complete the Committee Stage on Thursday night.</P>
      <P>I might add that the Central Fund Bill will be completed in the Dáil next week, and will be sent to the House for consideration and must be passed before Easter.  It is, therefore, proposed that we meet the following week, on the 18th March, the day after St. Patrick's Day, to deal with the Central Fund Bill and, when completed, to adjourn for Easter.  I should like to have the views of the Leader of the Opposition on that.</P>

      <P>That is a very desirable programme as far as I am concerned.  I consulted some people about it.  We would be prepared to do our best to carry it out.  The Central Fund Bill must be passed before the 31st March and, having regard to the way in which the dates now run, unless we meet in Holy Week or in Easter Week, we could not possibly do that unless we completed the Central Fund Bill on the 19th March or the 20th March at the latest.  We will do our best to carry out the suggestion and meet on Tuesday next to consider the Bills on the Order Paper other than this particular Amendment of the Constitution Bill and to take up that Bill on Wednesday and have the division, if we can manage it at all, as suggested by Senator Mullins.</P>
      <P>The Seanad adjourned at 10 p.m. until 3 p.m. on Tuesday, 10th March, 1959.</P>
