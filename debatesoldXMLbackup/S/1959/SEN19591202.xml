    <Title>Staff of the Houses of the Oireachtas Bill, 1959&mdash;Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Minister for Finance (Dr. Ryan) James Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>As Senators will have observed from the explanatory memorandum which was circulated with the text of the Bill, it has been intended for some considerable time past to enact special legislation dealing with the position of the staff of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The purpose of this Bill is to give effect to that intention.  My general approach to the issue of legislating for the staff of the Houses of the Oireachtas has been to maintain the <i>status quo.</i>  With one or two exceptions to which I shall refer, the Bill seeks to give statutory authority to long-standing practice.</P>
      <P>Part II of the Bill recognises the special position of the Chairman of the two Houses in relation to appointment of the Clerks and Clerks-Assistant, the Superintendent and the Captain of the Guard.  Part III applies the Civil Service Commissioners Act, 1956, to positions on the joint staff; the main purpose of this is to secure that initial recruitment to the joint staff will continue to be effected through the Civil Service Commission.  This system has worked well in the past and I am sure the House would not wish to change it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill lays down a new procedure for appointment of a Clerk-Clerk-Assistant <Col N="1128" /> in the event of failure of the Chairman of the House concerned and the Minister for Finance to reach agreement as to the person to be recommended for the appointment. In such event, the Taoiseach is empowered to nominate the person to be appointed but must obtain the concurrence of the House concerned before making the appointment.</P>
    <P>Under existing practice, the librarian and assistant librarian are officers of the Houses.  I see no real necessity for continuing this practice as these positions can ordinarily be filled by recruitment from members of the joint staff of the Houses or, if necessary, by special recruitment by the Civil Service Commissioners.  The Bill, accordingly, does not place the librarian and assistant librarian in the officer category and these positions will thus fall to be dealt with in the same way as other positions in the joint staff.</P>
    <P>Finally, I should perhaps mention two additional provisions in the text of the Bill, as passed by Dáil Éireann, which are not dealt with in the explanatory memorandum.  I introduced a new section giving the Chairman of Seanad Éireann power to suspend members of the joint staff guilty of grave misconduct while employed on duties directly related to the business of the Seanad.  I also introduced a subsection to extend to certain other members of the staff superannuation benefits related to those provided in the Bill for the Superintendent and the Captain of the Guard.</P>
    <P>I think it is unnecessary to go into any further detail at the present stage. Any further points of detail can be dealt with in Committee.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOQuigley" hpid="Mr. O'Quigley Mr. O'Quigley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill, I think, is one which should find favour with the House, as the Minister indicated. The Minister has said that the general approach to the Bill was to maintain the <i>status quo</i> and I think that has been fairly well done in the Bill.  I also think that from the point of view of the Seanad the Bill maintains the status of this House of the Oireachtas. This day week we discussed a motion relating to the status of this House of the Oireachtas and the results of that <Col N="1129" /> debate were satisfactory from the point of view of the House.  As a member of this House, I am certainly glad to note that in relation to its own staff and general regulations applicable to staff, this Bill does not in any way derogate from the status of the Seanad as one of the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>Apart from these general remarks, there are only a few matters with which I should like to deal at this stage. They are matters more properly relating to the Committee Stage.  I do not know whether it is intended to give the Committee Stage or not today but I feel that I ought to refer to them at this stage so that the Minister may have advance notice of the points I wish to raise.</P>
      <P>The first point, which is, indeed, the main point, relates to Section 2 of the Bill.  The Minister indicated that the librarian and assistant librarian, if and when this Bill comes into operation, will cease to be officers of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  In that connection, I want to refer to the definitions contained in Section 2.  It says: &ldquo;&lsquo;member of the Staff of the Houses of the Oireachtas&rsquo; includes an officer of the Houses of the Oireachtas.&rdquo;  That embraces the Clerk or Clerk-Assistant of Dáil Éireann or Seanad Éireann, or the Superintendent of the Houses of the Oireachtas or the Captain of the Guard.</P>
      <P>I want to relate these definitions to Section 10 which provides:</P>
      <P>Every person who at the date of the passing of this Act holds the position of member of the staff of the Houses of the Oireachtas shall continue to hold that position and be deemed to have been appointed thereto under this Act.</P>
      <P>It seems that once you define members of the staff of the Houses of the Oireachtas as including an officer of the Houses of the Oireachtas and then define who the officers are, you must make some reference in the definition section, if Section 10 is to have effect, to provide for those persons who will cease, on the coming into operation of this Act, to be officers of the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It does not seem that Section 10 <Col N="1130" /> meets the situation.  At present, the librarian and assistant-librarian are not members of the staff of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  They are declared by the definition section of the Civil Service Regulation Act, 1956, specifically to be officers of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  It seems therefore that a member of the staff of the Houses of the Oireachtas would have to be re-defined as including an officer of the Houses of the Oireachtas or a person who, after the passing of this Act, will cease to be an officer of the Houses of the Oireachtas or, alternatively, a former officer of the Houses of the Oireachtas who is serving on the date of the passing of this Act.  It may be that I am wrong in my interpretation of the effect of the definition on Section 10.  Perhaps the Minister might like to deal with it.</P>
    <P>Another matter of minor importance occurs to me in relation to Section 21 in which &ldquo;the appropriate authority&rdquo; is defined as the Chairman of Dáil Éireann and he is given power to suspend members of the joint staff.  The Chairman of Seanad Éireann may also suspend members of the staff connected with the business relating to Seanad Éireann.  The Chairman of Dáil Éireann has power to nominate under the Regulation Act, 1956, a person who may exercise the power of suspension but it does not seem that the Chairman of Seanad Éireann has a like power under the new Bill.  It might well be that it would be more appropriate from an administrative point of view that the Chairman of Seanad Éireann should have the power to nominate somebody to exercise the power of suspension if the Chairman of Seanad Éireann and, indeed, the Leas-Chathaoirleach, happened both to be away at the same time.  It might be desirable from an administrative point of view that such power should be vested in the Chairman of Seanad Éireann.</P>
    <P>There are some other small points that I shall deal with on Committee Stage.  I merely mention these points at this stage so that the Minister will have an opportunity of dealing with them in his reply.  Apart from that, the Bill is to be welcomed for establishing with certainty the relationship between <Col N="1131" /> the staff and Dáil and Seanad Éireann, the bodies they so ably serve.</P>

      <P>This welcome Bill gives us an opportunity of expressing what I think we should all like to express, namely, our appreciation of the quality of the work done by the staff of the Oireachtas, especially in the office of the Clerk of the Seanad. Competence and efficiency we are entitled to demand, and we have always had it.  Constant courtesy, patience and understanding no one is entitled to demand and no one is entitled to exact, but we receive it in very full measure.  So I take this opportunity of expressing my appreciation of this, and I am sure that in doing so I am expressing the appreciation of the House.</P>

      <P>Section 2 deals with definitions.  Candidly, I do not understand what members constitute the &ldquo;joint staff&rdquo; and what members constitute the &ldquo;staff&rdquo;.  To me, the definitions are most ambiguous.  A member of the joint staff of the Houses of the Oireachtas does not include an officer.  Then the next article says that a member of the staff of the Houses of the Oireachtas includes an officer of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  I should like an indication as to what members constitute the &ldquo;joint staff&rdquo; or the &ldquo;staff&rdquo;, or what is the difference? I found considerable difficulty in interpreting the Bill on account of the occasional reference to &ldquo;joint staff&rdquo; and on another occasion to &ldquo;staff&rdquo; and then to &ldquo;officers&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I do not wish to comment any further on the substance of the Bill. I presume it is intended to straighten out snags between the Civil Service and the Houses of the Oireachtas.  I would simply draw that difficulty of mine to the attention of the Minister. I found it very difficult because in neither of the definitions is an explanation given as to what members constitute either the &ldquo;joint staff&rdquo; or the &ldquo;staff&rdquo;.  How wide a membership does it embrace?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryDavidson" hpid="Miss Davidson Miss Davidson">
      <NameTxt>Miss Davidson</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to follow up what has been said in the Dáil by asking that the special consideration rightly given to two officers of the staff of the Houses of the Oireachtas under Section 28 of this Bill, to enable them to receive reasonable retirement pensions and gratuities, should be extended to all members of the staff where these men at retirement age would, unless the Bill is amended, receive pensions falling far short of the full amount.</P>
      <P>Some of those due shortly to retire would, under the Bill as it stands, be forced to retire on very inadequate pensions.  Some of these men have given service in the Army and in other branches of the national service for which they can claim no credit for pension purposes; others of them have served on the Oireachtas staff since 1922 but because they were not established for some years, cannot claim full credit for that service.  They will find that on reaching 65 they must face the future on a pittance amounting, in some cases, to 25/ a week with perhaps a gratuity of between £50 and £80.  Such payments, in to-day's circumstances, are useless: they only increase the number of our citizens eking out an existence under the subsistence level.  We are, in fact, making more poverty.</P>
      <P>A payment of 25/- weekly cannot be considered as just or reasonable and it is humiliating to contemplate that if we leave this Bill as it is, we are condemning these most respectable men, after years of useful service, to seek public assistance in order to live.  It is certain that some addition will have to be provided and, in the long run, the community will have to pay for that addition either through the local authorities or otherwise, but it is clear that we shall have to pay, and it would be much better if the Minister would make the necessary alterations in the Bill now and enable these men to keep their self-respect and their dignity by receiving fair treatment direct from the State they have served, rather than that they should have to apply for public assistance and all that involves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to have <Col N="1133" /> another try at giving justice to these men by giving them credit for all their service, whether established or not, or by adding years beyond the six mentioned, to enable the men to receive full pensions.</P>
    <P>As I have said already, the country will have to pay by one means or another and I would ask the Minister to be generous to its old retainers on the staff of the Houses of the Oireachtas. The cost to the Exchequer cannot be so very much as only a limited number of the older men are concerned and it is not an expense that will increase as the years go by.  The Minister should consider more the dignity of Parliament and the staff which serves it rather than the small cost which, whether we give it gracefully or not, will eventually have to be met from public funds.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the first point raised by Senator O'Quigley, I must say that I am not a lawyer and I shall have to consult the parliamentary draftsman.  So far as I can see, it appears to be all right, but I shall make sure of that.</P>
      <P>The second point he raised deals with the fact that the Ceann Comhairle has power to appoint a person to carry on in the control of the staff in his absence, and that the Cathaoirleach has not got the same power.  That is true.  The principle underlying the control of staff here is that the Ceann Comhairle has control of the staff, generally speaking.  He is quite free to delegate some power, say, to the Clerk of the Seanad.  There would be nothing wrong in that.  As the Bill stands, I think it is all right in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We had to be very careful.  That was one of the points that gave us a great deal of trouble in drafting this Bill.  In the long run, you cannot have satisfaction, dealing with staff, unless one person is responsible.  At the same time, we had to have regard to the fact that there are two Houses involved and that the Chairman of each House has his own responsibilities and that the Chairman of each House should have full responsibility, at any rate, so far as his staff is concerned in the <Col N="1134" /> sittings of that House.  I think we have covered those points as well as we could in all the circumstances.</P>
    <P>I do not think the point raised by Senator Ó Donnabháin should cause very much trouble.  It is not very difficult to see what the definition means.  These are six officers, and they are named.  The Clerk and Clerk Assistant of the Dáil and the Seanad, the Superintendent and the Captain of the Guard are the officers.  All the rest of the people employed here are the &ldquo;joint staff&rdquo;.  If you take the joint staff and the officers, these are called the &ldquo;staff&rdquo;.  It may be a little confusing but that is how the definition goes.</P>
    <P>The point raised by Senator Miss Davidson gave rise to a great deal of discussion in the other House.  I should perhaps say a few words about its history to show the Seanad how the present position evolved.  There are two posts in Leinster House which have had to be filled from the beginning, the posts of Superintendent and Captain of the Guard.  There is no doubt that a certain type of person is required to fill these posts.  First of all, they must have some sense of discipline and must be able to command respect from the staff under them.  They must be people of great discretion and tact. So far, we have been filling these posts with men from the Army or the Garda and in all cases I think they were men who took part in the fight for independence.  I think Senators will agree that it is not likely that those who took part in the fight for independence will fill these posts again. Age will prevent them from doing so. It is most likely that in future we shall have, as they have in most other countries, men who have retired from the army or the police, who have all these other qualities I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>In future, therefore, they will be provided for fairly well financially from the Forces in which they served and whatever is allowed to them in the posts here.  In the past, the fact that these men could hold these positions only for a comparatively short period meant that they got small pensions. In bringing in this Bill, I felt the occupants of these posts should be <Col N="1135" /> dealt with specially by giving them about two-thirds of the full pension and that increased their terms of occupancy of these posts by about six years.  That was not an extravagant proposal, but members of the other House felt that other people should be treated at least as well and made that case, but as I have pointed out on more than one occasion, I approached the matter in a different way.</P>
    <P>I approached it by saying that we had men here who were in a different position from that of most people working in this establishment.  They had been in the fight for independence and had lost a good many years and therefore, their pensions, on retiring, would be small.  That was countered by saying that it could be argued that we should take in anybody who had military service in the war for independence. I think the answer to that is that these two posts are posts which will always be filled by men who have some sort of military or police training. There is no reason why a clerical officer or a reporter should have army or police training and, therefore, there is a difference in that respect.</P>
    <P>When we came down and got closer to the position, I agreed and said: &ldquo;All right; I agree to bring everybody up to 26 years' service, the same as those two men.&rdquo;  It was argued against me that we should do more than that, and that was the position when this Bill went through the Dáil.  We brought every member of the staff to the level of 26 years, whether he had that service or not&mdash;that is those serving at the moment.  It will mean that nobody now serving will get a smaller pension than two-thirds of what he would have got if he served his full time.</P>
    <P>I cannot possibly agree with Senator Miss Davidson that we should provide a full pension for everybody.  After all, we are taking, as it were, these officers away from the Civil Service so far as they have been in practice, though maybe not actually members of the Civil Service and I do not think we should give them very big concessions which could not be claimed by the Civil Service generally.  Anyway, I do not think it would be fair or reasonable to expect <Col N="1136" /> that people who have served only for a number of years should get the full pension as compared with those who served the full 40 years.  I feel we have done as much as could reasonably be expected in giving the concession, which we introduced in the Dáil, bringing those who would have less than two-thirds of the pension up to that level.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. J. Lynch)</NameTxt>
      <P>This is, I think, a measure which calls for little by way of explanation.  It has only one purpose, that is, to adjust the salaries of judges and justices in the light of the increase which has taken place in the cost of living since these salaries were fixed six years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since 1953, when the present salaries were determined, the increase in the cost of living has been about 15 per cent.  In 1957, the judges and justices made representations that their salaries should be increased, and while these representations were under consideration, it was also suggested on behalf of the lower-paid members of the Judiciary that they should, for a variety of reasons, be treated more favourably than their higher paid colleagues. Having considered these representations, and having regard to the <Col N="1137" /> fact that persons in the public service and in outside employment have received two pay increases since 1953, the Government decided that an increase was justified on grounds of cost of living, and that a reasonable adjustment in all the circumstances would be to provide a flat increase of 10 per cent. in all judicial salaries.</P>
    <P>It was felt that the relationship between the various branches of the Judiciary, as determined in 1953, should not be disturbed at this juncture and on that basis a flat percentage increase has been adopted.  In sponsoring a 10 per cent. increase in salary in the light of a 15 per cent. increase in the cost of living, the Government feel that they are according fair treatment not only to the Judiciary but also to the taxpayer and maintaining in matters of remuneration that policy of restraint which is so important in the circumstances of our country.  I am conscious of the fact that there has been greater delay than usual in reaching a decision on the request made two years ago by the Judiciary for an increase in pay.  It would, in my view, be unfair if the members of the Judiciary were to receive no compensation at all for this prolonged delay. The adoption, as provided in the Bill, of 1st January, 1959, as the effective date for the salary increases represents a reasonable compromise which is fair to the various interests concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister was very modest in his statement about this Bill.  I do not think, on the whole, that any reasonable person could object to the main proposal in the Bill, if one just took it as a proposal.  It is a ten per cent. increase to meet a 15 per cent. increase in cost of living.  Since the members of the Judiciary have to pay income tax on their salaries, one asks oneself why could there not have been an increase of 15 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would join issue with the Minister in a matter of theoretical economics when he says that the relationship established in 1953 is not being disturbed at this juncture.  It <Col N="1138" /> is being disturbed, because a ten per cent. increase to a person who is closer to the subsistence level bears a great deal more harshly on him than a ten per cent. increase to a person a good deal above the subsistence level.</P>
    <P>I should like, however, to say a few words on this question in a general way.  We all know that salaried people have not maintained their position in this community.  This is particularly true of the justices, the judges of the Circuit Court, the High Court and the Supreme Court.  To go back to the old distribution of powers between Legislature, Judiciary and Executive, the only part of the salaried people in the complete organisation of the State who have maintained their position to a reasonable degree is the managerial part of the Executive.  Their salaries, generally speaking, are about twice the 1938 level.  The ordinary justices who are at the bottom of this scale, men who had £1,000 in 1938, are now at £1,750 a year and when they get this increase, they will have £1,795 a year. This is to meet an increase in the cost of living which, to put it at its lowest, is 150 per cent.  In not giving a larger percentage increase to the lower paid group, the Bill departs from the custom of the age in which we live.  If one looks back at the 1947 increase, it ranged from 15 per cent for the judges of the Supreme Court to 30 per cent for the district justices, and in 1953, the Supreme Court and High Court Judges got a flat rate increase of £250 and the Circuit Judges and justices of the District Court got £450.  That, I think, was a fair recognition of the position of the people who were being pinched most harshly.</P>
    <P>Let us look at what a district justice would require to have today.  I am speaking particularly of the district justice in the country district where he is, we must admit, more of a figure than a justice is in the city.  He would require to have a salary of £2,500 to equal his 1938 salary, so that on this new increase, there is a reduction of about 35 per cent in his real income, which takes no account of three factors: first, the 20 per cent increase in the standard of living generally in the <Col N="1139" /> community as a whole since 1938; secondly, the impact of income tax on the justices; and, finally, all the increases in their jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>If we go to the next group, the Circuit Court judges, I might perhaps in their case make the point about the managerial part of the Executive. Prior to the War of 1939-45, the salary of the Circuit Court judge was £1,700 a year, the same amount, by deliberate choice, as the salary of a Minister and of each of the five people whom one might call the Big Five of the Civil Service who have the highest salary&mdash;the Secretary of the Department of Finance, the Secretary of the Department of Industry and Commerce and the Chairman of the Revenue Commissioners are three of them.</P>
    <P>Everybody will, of course, recognise that the Ministers of State are the people who have fared worse by far than any others in this group.  I have never been able to understand why that is the case, and I might go back to the words of <i>1066 and all That</i> and say it is a bad thing.</P>
    <P>Circuit judges under this Bill will have £2,835 a year.  That compares with the salary of about £3,300 a year for the men at the head of the Civil Service.  This, of course, merely illustrates the growing power and influence in our community of the managerial class as against the power and influence of the politicians and the Judiciary.  I am not prepared to pass judgment on this subject absolutely, but I think that if you get a status which has been arrived at through a considerable period of time, there is no reason why it should be upset by a decline in the value of money.  I do not think a decline in the value of money itself is sufficient reason for upsetting the relative positions of people in the community, and the relative positions of people are to a considerable extent determined by their relative positions financially.</P>
    <P>In the past, there was a custom of regarding people in superior positions as being <i>ipso facto</i> people of superior capacity.  The tendency has arisen, with the greater earning capacity among the ordinary competent person <Col N="1140" /> at any technical business, that nowadays there is more regard purely for the financial status of people, and on that account, particularly where we have people who have to sit in the public eye every week, it is not a good idea to down-grade them not alone relatively to the rest of the community but absolutely.  Therefore, I regret that the Government did not give an increase of 15 per cent. in this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeOBrien" hpid="Professor O'Brien Professor O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill, of course, so far as it goes and I would agree with Senator O'Donovan that it does not go far enough.  The judges of all grades have not had their remuneration increased as much as other types of legal officials.  I have some figures showing increases granted since 1944 to certain holders of legal positions. The Secretary of a Department, the Revenue Solicitor, the Chief State Solicitor and the First Assistant to the Attorney General have been increased by 82.8 per cent.  The Assistant Secretary, the Special Commissioners of Income Tax, the Finance solicitor, Land Commissioner solicitor, the Taxing Masters and the Second Legal Assistant to the Attorney General have had increases of 79.7 per cent., whereas the principal justice has received an increase of only 67.5 per cent., the Dublin Metropolitan justices and Cork City justice an increase of 71 per cent., and the other justices an increase of 75 per cent.  In other words, the Judiciary generally have not been increased to the same extent as other legal functionaries.</P>

    <P>This is only the second increase which the judges have received since 1938 and it represents a flat increase on 1953 of 10 per cent.  Even assuming that the salaries were right in 1953, the cost of living has risen by more than ten per cent. since then and therefore they are wrong now.  If there is any attempt made to adjust the general standard of living, the changes in regard to the judges have not increased their salaries in relation to the general increases.  The salaries of all other types of official can be changed by Departmental resolution <Col N="1141" /> but changes in judges' salaries can take place only by an Act of the Oireachtas.  Therefore, if the cost of living rises and continues to rise, the present salaries laid down in this Bill will be frozen, whereas the salaries of other types of official can be raised, not automatically as some of them are, with very little difficulty in business houses, banks and universities. The remuneration of judges is determined by statute.  Therefore, if the cost of living continues to rise &mdash;the general opinion is that it will&mdash; in future years, the salaries laid down in this Bill will become quite inappropriate.</P>
    <P>If the 10 per cent. rise is not sufficient to put judges' salaries right since 1953, it is still less right in regard to 1938.  The remuneration of judges since 1938 has definitely not increased in relation to the rise in the cost of living.  The Judiciary generally have fallen behind in their standard of living.</P>
    <P>I should like to say something about the people in the lower scales in this Bill, namely, the district justices.  Even assuming for a moment that the 10 per cent. is appropriate for the judges in general, it seems to me quite inappropriate for district justices.  As Senator O'Donovan said, the principle of progression, that better-off people should contribute more to the State, is fully accepted in relation to taxation. I suggest that the same principle should be accepted in relation to remuneration by the State, that if the higher officials receive 10 per cent. the lower officials should receive more than 10 per cent.  That is the same principle as applies in regard to income tax.  If the principle of progression is accepted with regard to payments to the State, it should equally be accepted in regard to payments by the State.</P>
    <P>The hardship in relation to the cost of living is felt much more by people with lower incomes than people with higher incomes.  It is the widely-felt opinion among the members of the legal profession&mdash;it has been felt for a very long time&mdash;that from the beginning in this State district justices have been under-paid.  The level of district justices' salaries has always been too <Col N="1142" /> low.  If that is so, then they are suffering not only absolutely but relatively because their remuneration has not been increased as it should have been in relation to the cost of living or in relation to the more highly paid members of the Judiciary.</P>
    <P>The payment which people receive must be related not only to the cost of living but also to the work they do. By that criterion, the work of the district justices has increased much more in recent years than that of other types of judge.  More and more jurisdiction has been delegated to district justices.  I am informed that at the moment in this country 90 per cent. of the criminal cases and 60 per cent. of the civil cases are decided by district justices.  In other words, not only has their standard of living failed to grow with the rise in the cost of living but the amount of work which they have to do has grown.  Therefore, the amount they receive in real terms in relation to the amount of effort put forward has been seriously reduced.</P>
    <P>It is admitted by everybody&mdash;I need not enlarge upon it&mdash;that judges of all grades must be paid sufficient incomes to put them above all suspicion of not being independent.  It has always been agreed in all civilised countries that the Judiciary must be beyond all temptation of any sort of corruption. Not only must that principle be admitted, not only must justice be done, as has frequently been said, but it must appear to be done.  Not only must our judges receive sufficient to put them beyond temptation but they must also receive sufficient income to make it obvious to the population that they are sufficiently independent to be above anything in the nature of approach by way of corruption.</P>
    <P>That will be accepted by everybody, I am sure.  I think it applies particularly to district justices, not because they are in the lower income scale, not because they are not as well paid as High Court judges but because they are the judicial officials most seen by the people.  The average inhabitant of this country does not ever see a High Court judge on the Bench but the district justices operate all over the country every day in local courts. <Col N="1143" /> They are really the only members of the Judiciary who are familiar to the general public.  Therefore, it is exceedingly important that they should be in a position of dignity.  Unfortunately, however much one may struggle against it, the dignity with which people can live is related to money incomes.  I suggest that the incomes accorded to the district justices in this Bill are not sufficient with the present cost of living to enable them to live in such a way that they will receive the respect of the population as a whole.</P>
    <P>All judges are in an extremely important position.  The law of the country depends upon their integrity, independence and ability.  They should be paid proportionately to their responsibilities. Anybody who has any experience of life in this country knows that the sums provided in this Bill for district justices, especially in relation to married men who have children to be educated, do not permit of the standard of living which is desirable.</P>
    <P>The question of judges' salaries and of judges generally, their appointment, their behaviour and remuneration, is of such great importance that it must be lifted right out of the sphere of party politics.  Therefore, I would ask the Minister, before proceeding with this Bill, to appoint a Select Committee of the Houses of the Oireachtas to consider the whole question of the remuneration of the judges.  A Committee of that kind could consider matters other than mere salaries.  It could consider the question of pension rights and, above all, pensions for dependents.</P>
    <P>The present position of pensions for dependants in relation to the Judiciary is very unsatisfactory.  There is practically no provision made for the dependants of judges who die in office or while they are receiving a pension. A Select Committee of that kind could also investigate the possibility of the reorganisation of districts in which the district justice&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I simply request the Minister to appoint a Select Committee to investigate this whole question of salaries, pensions and the work done by district justices before putting this Bill through.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cole</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill to a great extent except that I should like rather to support the latter part of what Senator O'Brien said with regard to the district justices.  With regard to the Supreme Court, the High Court and possibly the Circuit Court judges, I am satisfied with the terms of the Bill.</P>
      <P>With regard to district justices and the lower salaried members of the Judiciary, I think we might do something more for them.  When one considers present day salaries in other professions, what the same ability would earn in commercial posts or in the Civil Service, we must admit that possibly the district justices are under-paid. We have in this country, on the whole, a very good service from district justices.  To a certain extent, they must, on their appointment, become men apart. Perhaps in that sense it is a lonely life.  They are not in a position to come out into the market place and canvass or ask for support.  We respect them on that account.  We must bear in mind that they are the lowest paid, by a fair amount, in the Judiciary. Their expenses and their costs and the position they have to maintain are nearly as great as those of any other member of the Judiciary.</P>
      <P>We have often heard of barristers or solicitors who could not afford to accept the post of district justice.  That is a sorry state of affairs in that one of the best or most suitable men may be lost to the profession and to the dignity of the Bench because he cannot afford to accept what to him may be a very great honour but a great sacrifice in his financial affairs.  It is a great pity that that should happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the Bench, we want ability and an honourable outlook as well as integrity.  If we do not offer a sufficient salary, I feel we shall not get the men <Col N="1145" /> we want to accept the position.  A very suitable man for the post of district justice might have to weigh very carefully his duty towards his family and his other commitments and then decide that he could not afford to accept the position.  It would be interesting to know the real position. Members of the House would never know if such positions have been offered by the Government to men who are not able to accept them.  I feel there are such cases.  Possibly there are men who, to the knowledge of the Government, would not accept such a position.  It is rather a pity that these men are lost to the Bench and to the Judiciary.</P>
    <P>There is only one point I could possibly make against the Bill and that is the expense involved.  Many Deputies consider that this is not a time to increase expenses and salaries.  In that respect, I am not particularly impressed by the argument that it is the £6, £10 or £12 a week man to whom we should look first.  I feel the answer to that is that if we had not men on the Bench maybe earning a large salary, if we had not men of integrity in those positions, the man with £10 a week might nowadays be accepting far less and his life might be a different matter altogether.</P>
    <P>As regards the financial side, I would draw attention to what the Taoiseach said in the Dáil, as reported in the Official Report, Volume 177, No. 4, Column 565:&mdash;</P>
    <P>I think it is also fair and reasonable to mention in this connection that the Government is proposing to reduce the number of judges of the Circuit Court and justices of the District Court and in fact the over-all cost of these services to the community will be less than it has been notwithstanding the increase in the remuneration which we are proposing here by reason of these reductions in the number of judges and justices, which incidentally will mean that, to some extent, the judges of the Circuit Court and the justices of the District Court will have more work to do.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1146" /> We are increasing the salaries of district justices by 10 per cent. but we are reducing the number.  We are giving them more work to do.  I am concerned only with district justices at the moment.  I would ask the Minister to accept a recommendation that they be given a 20 per cent. or at least a 15 per cent. increase.</P>

      <P>I hope the Minister will not jump in front of me.  This country has been very fortunate in its lawyers, in its Judiciary and in its police force. The very nature of the appointment of the Judiciary means that they are prohibited from organising pressures of any kind.  If they have a grievance, it should be redressed.  People should speak for them if it is felt they have a case to make.  I feel they have.  The very nature of their appointment prevents them from doing things other professional and occupational people can do.  If contracts made with the Judiciary 35 years ago were good and right, then it is proper that this change, which represents only 80 per cent. of the contract, should now be acknowledged by all of us as good and right and I think we should support it.</P>
      <P>Most members of this House are engaged in commercial affairs.  Executives of certain eminence are now receiving rewards commensurate in real money with the rewards obtainable in 1938 or 1939.  In other professional groups, the rewards being obtained are satisfactory.  I need only mention the word &ldquo;doctor&rdquo; and the word &ldquo;engineer.&rdquo;  Those on public bodies will know what I am talking about.  Their rewards now are more nearly commensurate with real rewards as compared with 1938 and 1939 than are the rewards of the Judiciary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If young men who go into law decide to export themselves and go, for instance, to the British services anywhere in the world, the ultimate reward will be much greater than what they will get in this country.  Therefore this Bill should be supported.  I do not even approve of grading the <Col N="1147" /> increases.  Taxation will take charge of that.  The House should approve of this proposal.  The Government should be told they have been courageous and just in bringing forward this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan2" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to add my support to the plea made on behalf of the district justices.  I believe that the ten per cent. increase which the justices have got merely brings them to the borderline of adequacy in relation to their incomes.  The Minister should, as soon as possible, bring their salaries up in relation to other members of the Judiciary.  I know it may not be possible to do anything on this occasion, but if not now, it should be borne in mind to be done at a not too distant date.</P>
      <P>Since the increase in the jurisdiction of the district courts in 1953, the district justices have been dealing with far more important types of cases.  The jurisdiction has gone up something like 100 per cent. in some branches, and far more in other branches, so that they are dealing with more important types of cases.  Greater responsibility has been placed upon them and in addition to that, because the jurisdiction has gone up, they have a far greater volume of work to do than they had up to then.</P>
      <P>Consequently, I think there is a case for reconsidering their position because of the greater responsibility which they now have.  I believe their salaries should go up in relation to the salaries of Circuit Court judges and High Court judges.  I ask the Minister to bear it in mind to take an early opportunity of increasing their salary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOQuigley" hpid="Mr. O'Quigley Mr. O'Quigley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel that as a nominee of the Labour panel, I ought to speak on this Bill.  One of the qualifications for nomination by the Labour panel is experience of labour, organised and unorganised.  The persons concerned in this Bill would, I think, fall into the category of unorganised labour because they do not have trade associations or trade unions which could put their case before those responsible for their remuneration, or before the public. Consequently, as a nominee of the Labour panel, with some experience of <Col N="1148" /> unorganised labour, I think I should speak in favour of this Bill.</P>
      <P>In doing so, however, I want to make the point that I think the Government have gone about doing a right thing in a wrong way.  It is perfectly clear that a case exists for increasing the remuneration of the judges of the District, Circuit, High and Supreme Courts.  The proper way to have done that is by way of the Select Committee which has been advocated by a number of Senators and was advocated also in the Dáil.  Some consideration should be given to the best means of disposing of whatever money is available to the Government, having regard to the justice of the claims made upon the public Exchequer by the members of the Judiciary, for the benefit of the people concerned.  I am not at all sure that if the judges themselves had the allocation of this money, they might not have allocated it in a way which would be more beneficial to themselves, as heads of families, and to their dependants.</P>
      <P>I find increasingly the necessity of having by me a copy of the Constitution. Because I have not got a copy with me, I have to depend on my recollection now.  I find that every piece of legislation we are enacting in some way or another calls for measuring up to the provisions of the Constitution because the Constitution is the instrument which determines what should be in legislation and how far the Legislature may go.  I have a recollection that it is provided in the Constitution that judges may not hold any other office of emolument or remuneration under the particular judicial appointment.  That, in itself, is one of the reasons why the salaries of judges, which at first sight appear to be relatively large, are the size they are&mdash;because they are constitutionally prohibited, if my recollection is correct, from having any other source of income, unlike other members of the community.  For that reason, their salaries are pitched somewhat higher than are the salaries of other authorities of the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another reason why their salaries must be of a substantial nature is <Col N="1149" /> that referred to by Senator O'Brien. The Constitution provides that the Judiciary shall be independent in the exercise of their functions.  &ldquo;Independent&rdquo; means independence not only of the mind and integrity but that they must be free from and above temptation.  Consequently, their salaries must be of a fairly high order to remove them completely, so far as can reasonably be done, from anything suggestive of corruption or from any taint of corruption.</P>
    <P>I have also a recollection that the Constitution provides that the salaries of judges shall not be reduced during the term of their appointment.  Unfortunately, the Constitution does not provide that the salaries of judges shall not be reduced by the effect of taxation or by an increase in the cost of living.  The intention of the Constitution is that salaries, once fixed, shall remain and I think that as implementing the spirit of the Constitution that the salaries of judges should remain at a certain high level, it is proper that their salaries should keep step with the decline in the value of money or increase in the cost of living, whichever way you look at it. For these reasons, therefore, having regard to these constitutional provisions alone, we must all support the small increase accorded to the Judiciary in this Bill.</P>
    <P>It is proper also to refer to the fact that once a person is appointed a judge, his life assumes a completely different pattern.  He cannot go to places he used to go to.  If he is fond of a pint in a public house and went there as a practising member of the Bar, as a senior or junior counsel, he cannot go there any more.  It does not suit his position and consequently he will have to pay at least the extra penny in a lounge.  That is an indication of the change in his status that arises by reason of his being raised to the exalted position of independence which a judge must occupy, if he is to discharge his duties properly.</P>
    <P>There is a variety of expenses of every kind which his new office calls for.  If a Minister of another State is visiting and paying a courtesy call <Col N="1150" /> upon the Minister for Justice or the Minister for Industry and Commerce, and the Minister or the Government wish to entertain him, I understand the position to be that such entertainment is provided for out of public funds.  There are quite a number of people who come to this country who desire to meet their opposite numbers in the legal profession but the fact is that these expenses fall to be discharged by the judges out of their own pockets.  There is no Vote, as far as I am aware&mdash;I have not got much experience in these matters&mdash;from which they can be reimbursed for expenses of that kind and that is a necessary part of the functions of people who hold a particular high office, that they shall meet people from other countries and do justice to the particular arm of Government which they represent.</P>
    <P>We should never forget that the Judiciary is one of the three arms of Government set up by the Constitution. Indeed, the country has been well served by the Judiciary in preserving the people from undue incursions by the Legislature and the Executive. There is another reason why the salaries of the Judiciary in general should be increased.  Members of the Judiciary, like everybody else, feel the impact of rising costs and if this House is to say that the cost of living may have risen but that judges are sufficiently well paid, the Judiciary may be inclined to adopt a less interested attitude towards the community generally than they have adopted in the past.</P>
    <P>In that regard, I should like to refer to a function which judges discharge outside the requirements of their office and which greatly benefits the members of the community.  One of the <i>desiderata</i> in establishing any commission to inquire into any matter is to have it headed by a member of the Judiciary or the Hierarchy.  That, to the way of thinking of Irish people, is an indication that the functions of that commission will be discharged impartially and thoroughly.  In recent years, we have had quite a number of commissions and public committees established and you will find that on most of these the chairman has been one or other of the members of the <Col N="1151" /> Judiciary, from the Supreme Court down to the Circuit Court.</P>
    <P>At the present time, the Income Tax Commission is headed by a judge of the Supreme Court and he formerly served on the Commission of Inquiry into Industrial Taxation.  The Television Commission, which was set up and discharged its business in record time, was headed by a High Court judge.  A commission to inquire into Workmen's Compensation has been sitting for a considerable time and is headed by a judge of the Circuit Court.  The Seanad electoral system was reviewed by a commission which was also presided over by a judge, or a former judge, of the Circuit Court.  We had the Rents Tribunal which likewise was headed by a judge of the Circuit Court and we had the very difficult and prolonged task assigned to a judge of the Supreme Court as Chairman of the Prices Advisory Body.  Likewise, at the present time, the chairmanship of the Censorship Board is held by a judge of the High Court and the Master of the High Court headed the Liquor Commission.  That is a fair indication of the sense of public service which the Judiciary have and which their terms of appointment do not require them to discharge.</P>
    <P>I should have said that for service on all of these commissions, and particularly service in a body such as the Prices Advisory Body, which involves a considerable amount of work over an indefinite and long period, no remuneration is payable or is ever paid to people who act as chairmen of these bodies.  It would be a very bad thing for the country if the Judiciary were to feel that the Government did not appreciate them to the extent of giving them reasonable increases in remuneration when it is demonstrated that the cost of living has risen substantially and has affected them adversely.</P>
    <P>I welcome this Bill for the opportunity it has given both the Minister for Industry and Commerce, and the Minister for Justice in the Dáil, of recognising that when the cost of living rises, it should be met by appropriate compensation.  The principle of a full <Col N="1152" /> ten per cent. which avoids the scaling down which goes on in other types of salary remuneration for which the Government are responsible is to be welcomed as a recognition by the Government of the principle that the cost of living affects people with higher salaries as much as those with lower salaries.</P>
    <P>I can never forget, in this connection, the statement made by the former Taoiseach, Mr. de Valera, in 1952, when he referred to the salaried classes as being that section of the community which was ground between the upper and nether millstones and by taxation. That section receives no benefits from the State and has to provide everything that is required by themselves as private families.  They receive no subvention from the State in the form of social or health services and the recognition accorded in this Bill of the fact that people on relatively high scales of salary are entitled to fairly adequate compensation for the increase in the cost of living will be warmly greeted by many members of the salaried classes in the community.</P>
    <P>When dealing with salaries, there appear to be two aspects of the position which call for attention.  The first is the basic salary, the salary which should be paid having regard to the kind of job which is required to be done.  If a certain salary is fixed for it, I regard that type of approach as the approach of paying the rate for the job.  That salary having been fixed, the standards having been fixed, and the rate for the job having been determined, it requires thereafter that the value of the salary should be maintained and that increases in the cost of living should be matched by appropriate and corresponding increases in the standard salary which has been fixed.</P>
    <P>It is in this connection, and on that basis, that I should like to support the case made for the district justices. Since the passage of the Courts of Justice Act, 1953, as Senator Ryan remarked, their jurisdiction has been greatly increased.  Their civil jurisdiction has been increased from £10 to £50 and that brings a considerably greater number of cases into the district courts than before.  On the <Col N="1153" /> criminal side, their jurisdiction has been greatly enlarged.  In addition, legislation is being enacted every month which imposes new duties on the district court, creates new offences and requires district justices to exercise more jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>We have on the Order Paper today the Apprenticeship Bill, which creates a substantial number of new offences which are dealt with by the District Court and thereafter, on appeal, to the Circuit Court.  The mass of welfare legislation we have, which is extremely complicated, all falls to be dealt with, in the first instance, by the District Court.  That legislation, particularly where it is amended from time to time, is extremely complex, and it is the justices of the District Court who are called upon to decide upon the construction of some of the most difficult pieces of legislation that would perhaps be referred to the High Court. It might perhaps take days of argument to decide whether one particular section would be applicable, and that would have to be determined by the District Justice, very often without the aid even of the proper authorities or of an adequate supply of statutes.</P>
    <P>On that account, on account of their increased jurisdiction, it seems to me that there does exist a case for increasing their basic salaries, quite apart altogether from the 10 per cent. or the 15 per cent. that might have been given to them under this Bill, and that the Minister for Justice should even at this stage reconsider whether in the light of the argument made here, a case does exist for increasing the basic salary of the district justices.</P>
    <P>It also seems to me that more than any other section of the Judiciary the salaries should be increased by way of a risk allowance.  Anyone who has ever been around the District Courts will readily agree with me that the places where district justices are called upon to exercise their judicial functions are a real risk to health and sometimes to life.  I have been told of a District Court being conducted in circumstances which would be more reminiscent of the kind of places where necessarily the Sinn Féin Courts had to <Col N="1154" /> function in times past.  That was all very well in the days when there was no Vote out of which funds could be provided for establishing proper courts for the Sinn Féin judges.</P>
    <P>It is not being colourful, or an exaggeration, to describe as barns and lofts, because they are literally barns and lofts, certain places where justices have to preside, and they are an absolute disgrace to the State.  In weather like this, they constitute a real risk to the health of the district justices, and on that heading alone justices require special consideration under this Bill, because these buildings are deteriorating all the time.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I would urge upon the Minister for Industry and Commerce, who is here today, to reconsider, whereas it has been established that under this Bill the increases will be retrospective to 1st January this year, that a Select Committee should be appointed to go into the remuneration. I cannot understand why, if it was decided to be right and proper on the occasion of the last increase in 1953 to have a Select Committee, it was not also considered right and proper to have one on this occasion. I rather fear that the reason a Select Committee was not appointed was that an irresistible case for increases bigger than have been granted by this Bill would have been made out.  If that were the reason, it would be deplorable that even at this stage justice should not be done to those who are daily called upon themselves to administer justice.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>I must confess that when I see a Bill like this asking for a ten per cent increase in the salaries of judges right down from the Supreme Court, the figure that crosses my mind is that of £71 10s. per annum on which old age pensioners are asked to live.  It is inevitable that we in this House, who are frequently told by the Government that not another penny can be afforded for this or that welfare, or for pensions or the unemployed, should recall this when we are asked to consider the terms of the present rather slovenly Bill.  I shall justify that adjective in a moment.  We are told, in <Col N="1155" /> effect, that the money just is not there, when we ask for it for the old age pensioners, but apparently money at least to some extent can be found for people with salaries of over £4,000 a year.  That is inevitably at the back of my mind as I speak on this Bill.</P>
      <P>I should like to say by way of general preamble that one might defend the view that in our society, as at present constituted, perhaps doctors and lawyers are paid too much, and nurses and teachers too little.  When we read, for instance, that barristers earning fees of £5,000 or £6,000 a year make &ldquo;a big sacrifice&rdquo; when they go on the Bench, I am inclined to ask what is the corollary to that, what is the conclusion we should derive from it.  Is it that we should increase the salaries of judges and Ministers, or that we should reduce the amounts of lawyers' fees in general?  I should like to suggest in this general preamble that in terms of real service to the community many of the court activities of barristers, who may or may not decide to &ldquo;make the sacrifice&rdquo; of becoming judges, are in proportion to the fees attached to the brief.</P>
      <P>After all, a sacrifice is made, too, by other members of the community&mdash; by nurses, teachers, university professors and lecturers who decide to remain in this country, and even by lecturers or university professors who decide to teach rather in Trinity College than in the National University, because the salary scale is lower in Trinity.  Therefore, when we talk in terms of sacrifices on the part of the legal profession we should also see those sacrifices in proportion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill asks us to increase judges' salaries&mdash;all of them, lock, stock and barrel&mdash;by ten per cent.  I referred to this as a slovenly Bill, a Bill with only two sections into which no thought whatsoever has been put.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce is here today to defend the brief of the Minister for Justice and therefore what I say does not refer to the Minister before us; I feel that it is applicable to the Department which drafted this Bill, which in a single clause says: &ldquo;Let us give them all ten per cent. and be done with it&rdquo;.  It <Col N="1156" /> is exactly the Bill we would have if there had been no investigation of the case, no thought given to the matter, no attention accorded it by the Government. The Government might in that case be justified in saying: &ldquo;Let them have ten per cent. now, and that will keep their mouths shut for the present till we have time to look into the matter.&rdquo;  But the Government have had plenty of time.  They have had years.</P>
    <P>The Minister himself made a kind of apology today for the delay in dealing with this matter, but I think it is not good enough.  They have been asked for years to do this.  All the facts about the necessity for differentiation and so on have been put before them, and they introduce this Bill with the principle of differentiation in favour of the lower paid judges entirely set aside.  There is no evidence in this Bill of a grasp of the basic situation in relation to these judges.  There is no evidence of a grasp of the conditions under which the work is done and there is no evidence of realisation of the amount of work done by some levels&mdash;lower levels in fact, and of the disparity that there is in the amount required to be done by the others.  There is no account taken either of the increased jurisdiction of district courts.  Yet, as has been said by other Senators, the district justices' chance of promotion is restricted entirely to two courts.</P>
    <P>Again, there is no indication that a comparison has been made with conditions across the Border, much less with conditions across the Irish sea. The Government's conclusion is that we should just, in a single introductory clause, throw them all 10 per cent. When the Government introduce Bills here to increase pensions&mdash;we will be considering one soon&mdash;they have a whole long, cumbrous mechanism to ensure that one little section will get 6 per cent. and another little section 4 per cent.  When they have a pension which amounts to more than £100 then that shall be reduced and so on.  They have a cumbrous Bill very carefully differentiating the grade of necessity of pensioners some of whom we know have pensions of less than £100 a year, but when it is a <Col N="1157" /> question of people in receipt of quite a bit of money all the Government can do is throw every one of them 10 per cent., irrespective of present salary.</P>
    <P>It was said in the Dáil that any comparison with the North or Britain is quite unfair.  I should like to make a comparison, and then establish the fact that it might be considered at least as partly relevant in this case. I should like to point to figures for stipendiary magistrates in the North of Ireland under the Six County Government. In 1948, the Belfast magistrate was on a salary scale of £1,100 rising to £1,400 maximum.  In other districts, the resident magistrate&mdash;the equivalent of our district justice&mdash;was in 1948 on the basis of £1,000 rising to £1,100.</P>
    <P>By 1952, the figures for these two magistrates, Belfast and other districts, were&mdash;£1,200 in Belfast rising to £1,600 and in other districts, £1,200 rising to £1,600.  In 1957, the figures for Belfast were £2,550 and in other districts, £2,500.  By 1959, the figures for Belfast were £2,850 and in other districts, £2,800.  In both these cases, there was an additional £300.  It was consolidated, I understand, in 1959. It had been paid originally by the Belfast Corporation.  So by 1959 the Belfast magistrate is getting £3,050 a year.  I think also, if I am correctly informed, that the jurisdiction of those magistrates is considerably less than the jurisdiction accorded to our magistrates in Dublin.</P>
    <P>Yet the northern figure is £3,050. We will be told that they are backed by great wealth in the United Kingdom, and that we are a poor little nation which cannot afford to treat our people on the same scale.  I would suggest that in certain things we maintain much the same standard.  In regard to high powered American cars, they are much the same on the Streets of Dublin as on the streets of Belfast.  We should not fight shy of the comparison with the North, but should be prepared to look at the figures, even though we are not able to accord absolute parity.</P>
    <P>If the Government introduce a Bill which has one clause in regard to ten per cent., and if, as they imply, they know so little about the problem and <Col N="1158" /> the necessity for differentiating between the judges, surely the Government were in honour bound to appoint a Select Committee and reach agreement, as was done on a previous occasion? My view is that a Select Committee was required and, therefore, I shall vote against the Bill.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I would urge the Seanad to throw out the Bill for the purpose of getting the Government to set up a Select Committee and go into the whole matter which they should have gone into long ago.  From 1957 the matter, they say, has been &ldquo;considered&rdquo; In point of fact they have been sitting on it doing nothing.  A Select Committee could have been appointed straight away.  A Select Committee was required.  I think the Seanad should refer this Bill back and ask the Government to bring in a defensible Bill, taking into account all the realities of the judiciary situation. The Government have delayed since 1957, since then judges were compelled to go with wig in hand, so to speak, to the Government and ask for an increase in salary.  The Government delay has been responsible for the fact that some people feel it is now too late to have a Select Committee.  I would say, as Senator O'Quigley said, that increases, if any, were decided upon, could be back-dated.  It would be far better to get a good decision than rush this Bill now, and throw them all the ten per cent which at certain levels is unjust, from the community point of view.</P>
    <P>The Minister's phrase in apologising for this was that he was sorry there had been a &ldquo;greater delay than usual.&rdquo; That was his phrase and I noted it down.  There was usually a long delay, but this delay was greater than usual.  I agree with the Minister.  I think it is something for which the Government should atone by setting up a Select Committee.</P>
    <P>As has been said by several Senators, since 1924, the judges have only received two increases in salary.  I think that is something that in fairness to them should be said in public.  They received two increases&mdash;one in 1947 and one in 1953.  I should like it to be noted what the nature of these increases was.  In 1947, the Chief Justice of the <Col N="1159" /> Supreme Court got an increase of 15 per cent.; High Court judges got an increase of 20 per cent; Circuit Court judges got an increase of 25 per cent. and District Court justices got 30 per cent.</P>
    <P>The principle of differentiation in increase was observed pretty rigorously in 1947 by the Fianna Fáil Government, the Government of the Party at present in power.  In 1953, when I understand a Select Committee was, in fact, set up, the increases were more simply done.  They were done again by a Fianna Fáil Government in 1953. Then the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court and the High Court judges all got an increase of £250, but the Circuit and District Court judges got £450&mdash; a percentage figure of something like 37½.  Again, the principle of differentiation was observed.  I think, in view of the argument which Deputy McGilligan put forward in the Dáil, it ought to be noted that while the judges got only two increases since 1924, both of these were given by the Fianna Fáil Governments. Fine Gael or the inter-Party Government did not give them a token brass farthing.  Therefore, it is somewhat disingenuous when an official spokesman of the Fine Gael Party says this kind of thing in the Dáil.  I quote Deputy McGilligan at col. 547 of Vol. 177 of the Official Report.  He says:</P>
    <P>Because of the very high positions these people occupy it was the view of myself and my colleagues in Government at the time that an improvement in their situation was required.  The atmosphere in those days, of course, was entirely different because we had deliberately embarked on a policy of trying to level up salaries.  Salaries had been pegged under Standstill Order, and by means of other devices, and held at a particular point.</P>
    <P>They intended to do something.  At col. 548 he said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>The last group which needed attention then was that composed of the members of the judiciary and certain others whom it was my intention to put on equality with all the others. <Col N="1160" /> Because of the defeat of the Government in 1951, that was impossible, but in those days it certainly was the intention to recast judicial salaries. That would have been done in 1951 if Fate had provided us with the power to do it.</P>
    <P>Fate did provide them with the power to do it, and only withdrew it after three years.  Therefore, it is a little disingenuous of Deputy McGilligan to blame Fate alone.  It may be responsible for quite a lot, but not for that piece of dilatoriness on the part of the then Government.  In talking about this and attacking the present Govern-for its attitude, we ought to remember that the previous Government, and both Coalition Governments, did nothing at all in this regard.</P>
    <P>Now I should like to examine the present situation.  I should like to make a certain prefatory remark on this point, because it is slightly invidious to talk about the salaries of judges, for the reason that the judges are few in number.  Their names are known to all. They have no right to get up and speak for themselves.  A large number of the judges are personally known to many of the Senators.  When one is speaking about such a small body of people, one is bound to feel a certain awkwardness about doing so.  I feel, nevertheless, that one must speak and speak freely and speak the truth, as one sees it.</P>
    <P>I was encouraged to do so by Senator O'Quigley in his reference to the Republican Courts.  Suddenly I remembered that I am the son of a judge, because my mother was a judge in the Republican Courts.  You will notice that it was possible for a woman to be a judge in an Irish court, so long as no salary attached to the position.  It becomes impossible, of course, once a salary is attached to it.  I feel therefore that in speaking on this I can speak partly, as it were, from within.</P>
    <P>The first thing I should like to say &mdash;and I think it cannot be stressed too much&mdash;is that the judicial standard in this country is extremely high.  It is the sort of thing one takes for granted. It is the sort of thing one ought to be able to take for granted in any democratic <Col N="1161" /> State.  Perhaps it would be a mistake to take it too much for granted, and to imagine that we can knock the judges about a bit, and introduce rather contemptuous legislation in their regard.</P>
    <P>It should be stated categorically and firmly that the judicial standard is high in Ireland, that the decisions of our courts are most respect-worthy, fairly arrived at, and soundly based on law, and are in short very impressive. One could think of minor exceptions, where the standard was not quite the same&mdash;the Tilson case, the Corcoran case and the MacSwiney case&mdash;but in almost all those cases you had minority opinions on the Bench also, and the standards of the Judiciary were consequently, by and large, nearly always upheld.</P>
    <P>By and large, then, we can be proud of our Judiciary.  That extends from the highest courts right down to the courts which do the majority of the work&mdash;because that is the position. The majority of the work is done in the District Courts.  As was said in the Dáil, District Courts do between 80 and 90 per cent. of the criminal work and something like 60 per cent. of the civil work.  The figures were not denied.  If that is so, these are extremely important figures.  They show that extremely hard work occurs in the District Courts, particularly in the Metropolis.  Occasionally, it is true, we also get peculiar decisions in District Courts.  Occasionally we get odd and slightly non-judicial pronouncements from District Justices, but they are exceptional.  The rule is that these judges also are fair, judicial and sometimes exceedingly courageous in dispensing justice under the law in the District Court.</P>
    <P>Occasionally, as I say, an odd district justice does flout the authority of the law or of the Government, but that is highly unusual.  And if he flouts the authority of the Government, he is thrown out.  If he merely flouts the authority of the law, of course, the principle of the &ldquo;inviolable independence of the Judiciary&rdquo; is invoked, and nothing is done.  However, both of these are exceptional cases.  We can <Col N="1162" /> say therefore of our district justices in general that they are men of learning, independence and courage.  We should recall the pressures put upon them. Other Senators have referred to physical pressures in the courts.  Other pressures, too, are put upon them.  For one thing, they are very much in the public eye.  Anything they say is noted down.  When one thinks of that, one has to pay tribute also to the independence and courage of many of them.</P>
    <P>Now, it is absolutely necessary to attract men of independence, learning and courage to this profession, and not merely to attract them but to hold them.  The Government are not setting about doing that in a very good way if they say they can give only 10 per cent. to district justices.  I am afraid it is evident that unless they scale down the increases to the other judges they will in practice be degrading the district justices in the public eye, as was suggested by other Senators, and I believe that to be a very bad principle.</P>
    <P>Another principle that is invoked very frequently by the Department of Industry and Commerce and by its Minister&mdash;perhaps it is happy that he should be here today&mdash;and also, indeed, by the Taoiseach, his predecessor as Minister for Industry and Commerce, is the principle of increased productivity for increased wages and salaries.  I did not notice any attempt on the part of the Minister to show that there was in the Supreme Court an increased pressure of work and an increased &ldquo;productivity&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In relation to work done, there is no question but that, since 1953, with the very wide extension of the jurisdiction of the District Court, there has been very considerably increased productivity in the judicial decisions of the District Courts but not in any other court.  If that principle is valid for workers, trade unionists, employers, and so on, if it is a principle that is practically sacred within the walls of the Department of Industry and Commerce, why should it not be applied to the Courts?  Why is no reference made to it?  Why is no reference made <Col N="1163" /> to the fact that so much dependence is put by the community on the work done by the District Court?  And that being so, why is that not recognised at least by some differential figure when it comes to increasing salaries?</P>
    <P>It has already been said that the jurisdiction of the District Court has very widely been extended since 1953. The figures I have quoted to the effect that nearly 90 per cent. of all criminal work is done there, and 60 per cent. of the civil work, are pretty startling figures which have not been denied.  On the basis, therefore, of work involved, and the work done, in particular in Dublin and Cork District Courts, a far stronger case could be made for the District Courts than for the Upper Courts.  At this juncture I think they should also be praised for their expedition. These Courts are expeditious. We read in the papers about a case that hits the headlines.  A great number of columns are given to it.  No column space is given to the vast majority of the cases that go through these courts expeditiously but fairly.  There are many cases to which no reference is made.  They are the day-to-day cases conducted in our District Courts throughout the country.  Only a small number hit the headlines, but the work done is of capital importance to the community.</P>
    <P>The amount of judicial work done in the District Courts is very great indeed.  Nor does the amount to be got through result in any immensely long delay.  To anyone familiar with the processes of law that take place in France, as I am, it can be said that our courts do their work most expeditiously. In France, some cases drag on for years.  We would become very impatient if certain cases here took such a considerable length of time. We would say that they were dragging on for too long.  We must recognise that the majority of our district justices work with extreme expedition, and that, I suppose, is one of the marks of an able judge.  These men are then, by and large, a body of very able judges.</P>
    <P>On the question of jurisdiction and its extension, it would seem to me, as has been suggested earlier, <Col N="1164" /> that the Minister ought really to say something in justification of this many-stepped ladder of courts that we have in this country.  The Bill refers to the different kinds of judges, Supreme Court judges, High Court judges, District Court judges, and so on.  At least a glance should be given to this apparent multiplicity and the question ought to be considered by the Government, in view of the increased jurisdiction granted to the District Court justices and the kind of work they are now asked to do, and proving themselves quite capable of doing, as to whether Circuit Courts are necessary at all, and if so, for what?  In fact, I would suggest that the Government ought to come here and say to us: &ldquo;We intend, in fact, at some fairly nearly date, to consider redesigning the whole judicial system, with even perhaps fewer but more mobile district justices in the remoter areas&rdquo; and with perhaps those High Court judges referred to in Section 1 sitting not only in Dublin and occasionally in Cork, but regularly at other centres.</P>

      <P>I am just trying at least to make it appear relevant, arising out of the Government suggestion that the amount of money available is very small, and that some of it is now being granted to Circuit Court judges whose eventual disappearance might now be considered by the Government, thereby bringing about a saving in money which could be distributed under a Bill such as this to the other justices.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OwenSkeffington" hpid="Dr. Sheehy Skeffington Dr. Sheehy Skeffington">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, sir.  I shall refrain consequently from proceeding to hang myself.  I should like to suggest nevertheless that the Government should consider that it might be a fair thing to introduce a Bill&mdash; I am relating this particularly to salaries&mdash;with powers they would take elsewhere in order to pay fewer judges <Col N="1165" /> better.  That is the slogan that might well suit the situation here in Ireland: fewer judges better paid.  It is not a question, of course, of sacking judges, but of allowing vacancies not to be filled, as occurs in other walks of life when redundancies take place.</P>
      <P>That brings me to another point of capital importance with regard to the salaries of judges in the district courts. It is a point I referred to at the outset &mdash;the question of the potential promotion. I think the salaries of the district court judges should contain some compensation for the fact that their possibilities of promotion are severely limited, and that the salary, in other words, is for a type of judge who is officially deemed to be different from the type of judge sitting on other benches.</P>
      <P>In the Circuit Court, the High Court and the Supreme Court, one can hope for promotion&mdash;and even aspire to becoming President of the Supreme Court&mdash;but in the District Court, once you reach the top there, you cannot proceed to any other court.  I am claiming that there should be a recognition of that fact contained in the salaries. Unless the district justices have been to the Bar, they cannot advance to the circuit court.  It is all nonsense, of course.  After ten years of practice as solicitors, many of them know more law, and have a far wider experience of the application of the law in practice, and of humanity's reaction to it than any young barrister of equal standing.  In fact, attending a legal consultation&mdash;my legal colleagues here will forgive me for saying so&mdash;the layman is not infrequently struck by the amount of time that is taken up while the solicitor carefully explains the law to counsel.  In fact, many a barrister has nine-tenths of his work already done for him by the solicitor before he rises in court.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OwenSkeffington" hpid="Dr. Sheehy Skeffington Dr. Sheehy Skeffington">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>I rather think not&mdash;but this is my point: solicitors can aspire only to become district court judges whereas a barrister can aspire to sitting on any bench.  The <Col N="1166" /> solicitor can never get beyond the district court as a judge, unless he has been called to the Bar.  This present absurd promotion-barrier, I suggest, should be compensated for, or else removed by new legislation which it would be out of order to refer to at this point.  In the suggested increase in salaries, we must recognise this practical differential as between the district court justices and the other judges. Now, no differential at all is recognised in this Bill.  We ought to recognise in the salary increases we are asking for, that the lack of promotion possibilities makes the posts of district justices considerably less attractive.  They are considerably less attractive by reason of that fact, and there should be some salary compensation for that if recruitment is to continue on a sound basis. It ought to be possible for the younger of our district justices to aspire in due course to being considered for seats on the benches of the highest courts in the land.</P>
      <P>The origin of this barrier is the British system, the caste system, if you like, which was referred to by Senator O'Quigley as the &ldquo;unorganised labour&rdquo; of the Bar Library.  I suggest that caste system is a silly relic of the British system, and that it is bad even in Britain to-day.  There are different factors in it there, it is true; there are the big commercial briefs, big money, big practice, big responsibility, experience&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I think we should recognise that we have this system, whereby we say to the district justices: &ldquo;You shall have no promotion out of your Court.&rdquo;  The Circuit Court judge can go to the High Court and the High Court judge can go to the Supreme <Col N="1167" /> Court but the district justice cannot be promoted, unless, of course, he has been to the Bar Library, and been called to the Bar.</P>

      <P>The perpetuation of the caste system is unjustifiable; yet it is enshrined in this Bill, by a failure to have any differentiation in the suggested increase in respect of the judges of the lower courts, as has indeed been up to now recognised, because in fact this Bill is a notable departure in this respect.  It does no more than perpetuate the system, and I suggest by doing it in this way, without recognition of the stronger claims of the judges of the lower courts, it is implicitly degrading a section of our judges, and that section is the section which is carrying, increasingly, the major portion of the judicial work of the country.  In thus failing to discriminate, this Bill is breaking with precedent, in trying to apply the 10 per cent. all round to every category.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should now like to have a closer look at what the implications of this 10 per cent. are.  The 10 per cent. increase will mean in relation to certain judges an increase of quite a considerable amount.  The figures are worth quoting and putting on the record. In relation to the Chief Justice the 10 per cent. increase will represent £485 a year, bringing the salary to £5,335; for the Supreme Court Judge the increase will be £370, bringing the salary to £4,070; the High Court Judges will receive an increase of £325, making their salary £3,575; the Circuit Court Judges will receive an increase of £257, bringing their salaries to £2,835; the <Col N="1168" /> Principal Justices of the District Court will receive an increase of £201, bringing their salaries to £2,211.  The Cork and Dublin justices will receive an increase of £188 a year, which will bring their salary up to £2,068, while the country and rural justices get an increase of £175 to bring their remuneration up to £1,925.  That is the practical effect of this 10 per cent. increase all round.</P>
    <P>Now, that will mean in fact that in regard to the first figure&mdash;the President of the Supreme Court&mdash;he will get an increase of £485, which is more than the salary of a Senator, as a Senator, and is a not inconsiderable sum of money.  That is a point to which reference might be made in this House.  I think that at the higher level the increase is quite unjustifiable, but the district justice who is in receipt of the lowest salary will get £175 which seems to me to be against all justice.  I feel that at the back of the mind of the Government, if you can refer to the subconscious mind of a Government, there is an awareness of this fact and possibly even a sense of guilt.</P>
    <P>I should like to quote the Taoiseach on this.  Speaking at Column 560 of Volume 177 he said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;...to induce us to fail to meet what seems to us to be a necessary obligation&mdash;to adjust these salaries in accordance with the changes in money values which have taken place since the scales were fixed&mdash; then it would be a very serious dereliction of duty on our part and, in my view, would demonstrate our unfitness to hold office as members of the Government.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Those are very strong words, but in fact they are being spoken in defence of a measure which tries to compensate for a 15 per cent. rise in the cost of living by a 10 per cent. increase in salary.  That is condemned, out of the Taoiseach's own mouth, as a grave dereliction of duty, because what he says he is trying to do is to adjust these salaries in accordance with the changes in money values which have taken place and to fail to do that would be a very serious dereliction and would brand him as being unfit for <Col N="1169" /> Government.  I suggest in relation to some of these lower scales that such figures are not justifiable.  I should like to hear the Minister make a real differentiation, but he does not make it on this Bill, nor does he even do what the Taoiseach says it is his duty to do: compensate for changes in money values.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to keep the House unduly, but I think it is necessary and justifiable to make a comparison between the district justices and comparable payments in the higher grades of the Civil Service.  I think it is relevant to recall that the higher grades of the Civil Service, including legal positions, since 1944, have had nine increases in salaries.  Remember that since 1924 the judges had only two increases. There were nine different increases for the higher Civil Servants, none of which, incidentally, had to come before this House.  I should like to quote some figures, and the first figures I shall quote refer to the Chief State Solicitor, the First Assistant to the Attorney General and the Revenue Solicitor.  In 1944, such a higher civil servant was getting £1,449; in 1945, he was getting £1,522; in 1946, he was getting £1,561; in 1947, he was getting £1,775; in 1948, he was getting £1,880; in 1951, he was getting £2,324; in 1952, he was getting £2,416; and in 1955, he was getting £2,589.  In 1958, he was getting £2,647. That represents an increase, over those years from 1944 to 1959, of 82.8 per cent.</P>
    <P>Similarly, in a slightly lower grade, the Finance solicitor and the Taxing Master were getting, in 1944, £1,249 and by 1958, £2,243, which is an increase of 79 per cent.  Now, if we look at the position of the district justices, we see that on the lowest scale in 1944, they were getting £1,000 a year.  In 1947, that rose to £1,300 and in 1953 to £1,750 which was a rise in the same period of only 75 per cent. as opposed to 79.7 per cent. for the Taxing Master and Finance solicitor and 82.8 per cent. for the Revenue solicitor, the First Assistant to the Attorney General and the Chief State Solicitor.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, the principal district justice who had been getting £1,200 a <Col N="1170" /> year in 1944 rose to £1,560 in 1947 and at present is being paid, since 1953, £2,010, which is an increase of only 67.5 per cent.  Those percentage increases show quite clearly that the equivalent grades in the Civil Service have benefited by a greater percentage increase than their legal equivalent on the Bench of the District Courts.  I do not suggest at all that the increases to the Civil Service were unjustified&mdash;I am quite sure they were justified&mdash;but it seems to me to be unjust to have this differentiation, and to have the district justices lagging behind.</P>
    <P>I might also mention this fact: that the statutory period for practising as a solicitor which is necessary to qualify for the post of Taxing Master or County Registrar is eight years, whereas in 1953 the period for solicitors wanting to be appointed as district justices was increased from six years to ten years.  So that, to aspire to become a district justice, you must practise for ten years, but to qualify for the position of Taxing Master or County Registrar, you must practise for a period of eight years. Yet the differentiation in salary is all in the other direction.  How does this come about?  Why have there been nine increases for the upper grades of the Civil Service and only two for district justices?  Why is the scale more generous in one case than in the other, when the qualifications required are, if anything, greater for the district justice than in any of those other cases?</P>
    <P>Is it simply because the upper grades of the Civil Service are nearer to the Minister's ear?  Or is there some more praiseworthy and reputable reason? Is it that the Minister can see the position of these people, the civil servants, in and around him and realises their needs, but does not see the work of the district justices?  Yet, the district justices have more responsibility than the higher grades of the Civil Service and they do their work right out before the public, in the public eye.  An appeal lies against their opinion, and that opinion must be stated in public, and the appeal, if any, heard in public.  That is not <Col N="1171" /> the case with civil servants, and I make the point consequently that the degree of responsibility of the Judiciary is higher than that of the equivalent grade in the Civil Service.</P>
    <P>Therefore, in my submission, this Bill is a hastily-conceived Bill, an ill-conceived Bill thrown together with no thought to the real position of the different work and responsibility placed on the shoulders of different sections of the Judiciary.  The slightly contemptuous section which says: &ldquo;Give them all 10 per cent. and if they do not like it, they can do the other thing,&rdquo; seems to me to be unworthy of respect.  By applying the same percentage to the district justices as we are applying to the Supreme Court judges and the High Court judges, we are simply asking the lower ranks to tighten whatever is the judiciary equivalent of a belt, but allowing unnecessarily large increases to the best-paid judges.  The feeling, I am afraid, is that the Government have consoled themselves on this Bill with the thought that the upper ranks of the judiciary will be pleased and they are the ones they are most likely to meet and from whom they are most likely to hear.</P>
    <P>I suggest that this Bill should ask for proportionally greater increases for the district court justices on three quite defensible grounds: (i) the promotion-barrier in that level of the judiciary; (ii) the widely increased jurisdiction since 1953, which has resulted perhaps in an even wider spreading of work to be undertaken by them than was originally anticipated by the framers of the 1953 Bill; and (iii) the fact that increases to comparable ranks in the Civil Service have been at a consistently higher percentage level than those for district justices.  I believe that in the upper brackets of the Judiciary, it would be legitimate to give no increase at all at this juncture, or if it is felt necessary to award something, that as the judges often award a farthing damages, we might perhaps similarly award a farthing increase in the salaries of the upper court judges.</P>
    <P>One final point of difference is that <Col N="1172" /> the judges in the upper courts have a servant who is paid by the State, and the district justices who shoulder, as I may say again, such a very considerable amount of the judicial work of this country, have nothing comparable with that.  And yet we are asked to give the same percentage increase to all alike.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGuire</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to say very much because I think everything has been said on this Bill that could be said and, in fact, everything I intended to put has been put.  The ground has been very well and fully covered and my object in getting up is merely to add my voice to what seems to be the unanimous voice of all the Senators who have spoken.  Even the voice of Senator Sheehy Skeffington seems to be in favour of granting an increase, even if it is only one farthing, to the judges at the top, but considerably more to the justices at what we might call the bottom.</P>
      <P>I think it has been clearly shown in this debate so far that everybody is in agreement with the proposal to increase the salaries of the judges and the other members of the Judiciary.  It has been pointed out that although there were six rounds of wage increases&mdash;we are in the middle of the seventh at present&mdash;and nine increases to the civil servants, there have been only two to the Judiciary.  It does seem that they are in an awkward position in that they have to await an Act of Parliament to give them an increase, whereas other people do not have to wait.</P>
      <P>We have the position that people in certain categories of society are getting increases every year quite automatically and without the increased production which should be given to correspond with the increase.  One district justice who was speaking to me pointed out that while we were in the middle of the seventh round of wage increases, there was no sign of any extra production and that therefore the people would suffer from the fact that money would be devalued still further in the present year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On only two occasions have the Judiciary been considered for extra remuneration and the situation has <Col N="1173" /> been mounting up against them inexorably all the time.  Senator O'Quigley said that he represented the unorganised workers in this, the Judiciary, and I was sorry that Senator Murphy had not spoken as he would have represented the organised workers and I, being nominated by the F.U.E., would represent the employers.  I must say from experience that I see a better case before me to-day than unfortunately I have to see year after year in other walks of our life.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I should like to add my voice to the appeal made to the Government to do one of two things at this late hour.  Everybody asked that this whole matter should be referred to a Select Committee and it seems that that would be the right thing to do. Being realists, and knowing that when a Bill reaches this stage in this House we have very little chance of making any impression on it, perhaps all we can do, as we have not got any power to increase taxation or add to what is being taken from the Exchequer, is to ask the Government even at this late stage either to set up such a committee or to change the percentage which is being given to the district justices.  If they did that, it would meet with general approval.</P>
    <P>Anybody listening to-day cannot fail to see the strong case for taking that action with regard to district justices. As regards other members of the Judiciary, I think the 10 per cent. is at least justifiable and should be paid, but the Select Committee would go into the finer points.</P>
    <P>If nothing is done, I think the time will not have been wasted to-day if what has been said on this Bill is taken note of for future reference.  Two things would emerge from this debate. One is the fact that an examination of the justices' remuneration is not being carried out often enough.  There should be an examination at much more frequent intervals than in the past.  It is manifestly wrong that there should have been only two examinations of the situation over that period when there were dramatic changes in other spheres of our national life.  The second point is that, as I hope, when proposals are being brought in on the <Col N="1174" /> next occasion, the Select Committee will have been set up and the machinery which worked in 1953 will be operated.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamStanford" hpid="Professor Stanford Professor Stanford">
      <NameTxt>Professor Stanford</NameTxt>
      <P>A strong case, and indeed, to my mind, an overwhelmingly strong case, has been made for reconsidering this Bill.  I am in favour of the general increase to judges, but, to go further, we have heard nine sound reasons why a special distinction should be made in the case of the district justices. Unless those reasons can be reasonably answered, I can see no justification for going further with this Bill. Very briefly, I am going to look at those nine reasons in the hope that we shall have some reply to them.</P>
      <P>The first is that the cost of living has gone up 15 per cent. and this is only a 10 per cent. increase; the second is that the amount of work imposed on district justices in particular has been greatly increased; the third is that since judges in general should be financially in a position to be above any temptation of corruption, district justices, being particularly in the public eye, as Senator O'Quigley pointed out, should especially be considered in that respect; the fourth, as Senator Cole pointed out, is that lawyers are generally well paid and it is grossly unfair that a man with a sense of public responsibility who desires to serve his country as a judge should lose a very great deal of money by accepting office as a district justice, which is what in fact happens when any competent solicitor now takes the job.</P>
      <P>The fifth reason, as Senator O'Quigley has very properly pointed out, is that these judges are precluded from accepting other posts of emolument. Many of us who talk about our salaries forget, or conveniently succeed in forgetting, that there are other little perquisites that raise them. That is not so in the case of judges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The sixth reason, as Senator Sheehy Skeffington has pointed out, is that in comparison with salaries in Northern Ireland, these salaries are inadequate; the seventh is that there was a previous differentiation between the <Col N="1175" /> salaries of district justices and the salaries of other judges.  If it was fair on two previous occasions, why is it not fair now?</P>
    <P>The eighth reason, as was pointed out by Senator Sheehy Skeffington, is that district justices are generally precluded from promotion, a most serious disability, and surely their salary scales should take that into account; and the ninth is that in comparison with higher civil servants, their scale is lower considering the qualifications necessary for their office.</P>
    <P>I have not heard a satisfactory answer to any of those arguments.  I should say that Senator Ryan, the only person who spoke on the Government side, is in favour in general of the principle we are putting forward but says: &ldquo;on some later occasion&rdquo;.  That will not do.  It really will not do, Sir, because there will not be a later occasion for a great length of time, I am pretty sure, if this Bill goes through.  If we have a promise here and now that we shall have an early reconsideration, well and good.  But I see no likelihood of another opportunity soon.</P>
    <P>I now simply put it to the Minister: can these arguments be answered?  If they cannot be satisfactorily answered, there is no justice in this Bill for district justices.  As Senator McGuire has just said, what is really needed is either an amendment of the Bill or even at this late hour the appointment of a Select Committee to reconsider it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I sympathise with the Government in having to introduce this Bill at this stage because it is something long overdue and yet the Government could scarcely have been forced to introduce it at a more inappropriate time when the suggestion of what, on the surface, may appear large increases may be used to stir up wrong feelings against the Government.  It will raise the question of wages going up and it will be asked: &ldquo;Why not concede the seventh or eighth round of increases?&rdquo;  I can see the Government's difficulty in this. Of course, it is due solely to the fact <Col N="1176" /> that the cost of living has increased by 15 per cent. since the last increase was given to judges and the present 10 per cent. increase means that the standards of the Judiciary will still remain depressed compared with the standards of some other sections of the community.</P>
      <P>We accept that our difficulty at present, as was pointed out by the Taoiseach in one of his speeches, is not so much to fight over the national cake and its distribution, but rather to get together and work might and main to make that national cake bigger so that we shall all have more to share around.  In that sharing around, if we are to preserve the goodwill of all sections, it must be evident to all that justice is being done to all sections concerned.</P>
      <P>There are two items involved.  First of all, there is the question of dealing with inflation and secondly, the sharing out of the increased productivity year after year.  Even though we are not by any means going as fast as we should like, still our productivity has increased considerably and now we have the question of sharing that out with justice.  At the very outset, I think it will be accepted by all that those at the top should really get a lower percentage in the sharing out than those at the bottom.  We all recognise that though those at the top may find it difficult to make ends meet, as it were, those at the bottom, where it is a question of subsistence, are those who are in real need.  Consequently, as a matter of justice, I think every section in the community will agree that a great deal of the increases produced by the increased national cake should go to bringing up the lower paid sections of the community, many of whom to-day are on subsistence level, including in that, of course, the farming community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What we want is a national plan for sharing out.  In that sharing out, I would submit that the Civil Service is the barometer.  The Civil Service have all the facts and figures and are in a position to implement Government policy as to how much must be conceded to the groups.  Once the decision has been taken to concede a certain <Col N="1177" /> amount in justice to civil servants, then the Government should pass on that same concession to the other groups with which they are concerned, one of which is the judges as envisaged in this Bill.  It is wrong that such a Bill as this should have to come before us every time an increase is given.  It should be automatic.  Immediately an increase is granted to civil servants in different ranges of salary, an appropriate Bill for the Judiciary should pass automatically through the House. That is only justice.</P>
    <P>It should be just the same for the other groups with which the Government are concerned, the teachers and so on.  Why should these lag behind Civil Service increases?  Why should they have to make representations to get something that has already been met and conceded?  Why waste time? We should simply, once a decision has been taken, pass it on to all others concerned and let each section see fairly what part it is getting, what its rights are and what is its position in the national advance.</P>
    <P>The question of inflation, that is, the decrease in the purchasing power since 1953, is a more difficult one to deal with.  It does appear when it is a question of inflation that this increase is greater than in fact it is. If it had been given, as it should have been, in the form of a couple of per cent. in 1954-1955, and another couple in the following year, it would be recognised as being just right and appropriate.</P>
    <P>The Minister and the Government should reconsider this issue afresh and try to win the goodwill of the professional classes, because unfortunately it must be said that this Government and the preceding Government have been steadily worsening their relations with the professional classes.  If the Government feel that productivity and the initiative which is the real prerequisite of expansion are the primary needs, they should seek to hold their goodwill, not by pouring out money to them but by dispensing justice to all groups and, above all, by avoiding this splitting that is growing to-day, as a result of which there is emerging a kind of super class called the management <Col N="1178" /> class who feel that for their own authority and prestige, if they cannot get more for themselves, they must depress the technical staffs under them.</P>
    <P>Again, though it does not fall very strictly within the ambit of this Bill, the district justices, perhaps besides the engineering profession is a sorely depressed one.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I shall just make my general case that what has been said for the district justices applies to many others.  I hope that the down-grading we have experienced of the professional classes will not continue, or at least that the relative down-grading as between one and another will not continue.  It is all right if all the classes come down together, but you must preserve the professional standing of the various groups.  That is professional prestige, and that is what matters, not that you get £200 a year more but that the district justice is able to live as well as other classes, the managers, and that they will always keep step.</P>
      <P>A great deal has been made in this debate of the fact that the increases are necessary for the prestige of the Judiciary.  I agree entirely with that, but there is one item still more important than money, that is, public standing, and if we value the prestige of the Judiciary, we will very soon lift the appointment of Judges out of politics. It is degrading to a district justice that he should have had to go on the soapbox when he wanted to move up, and that people should be able to say that now that he has got there, he does not need to do it again.  We know that he has to sever his connection with politics when he gets there, but the fact that he had to take part in politics beforehand does cause damage.  It causes far more damage even than having his real salary depressed by 10 or even five per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another item that could very well be gone into in the Select Committee asked for by practically all the speakers this afternoon is the feeling that there are many things besides salary <Col N="1179" /> involved, because the Taoiseach stated in the Dáil that the District Court areas were being reorganised so that fewer district justices could carry out the work more expeditiously.  This is bound up in the question of productivity, and you cannot appeal for greater productivity from the farmers and the labourers alone without showing that all other sections are pulling their weight, as I believe they are.</P>
    <P>It is to be regretted that the Bill departs from the principle of differentiation, the principle that if those at the top are coming down, those at the bottom must go up.  That applies at all ranges of salary.  We do not expect to see the same range of increase at £4,000 a year as at £2,000, and a very bad example is set in this matter by the Bill.  I admit that, in justice, to compensate for inflation, the Government had no option but to make the 10 per cent. award to the Chief Justice and the Supreme Court, but in justice also they should hold to the principle of differentiation, and do somewhat more for the district justices.  I do not know what the difference should be&mdash; whether it should be five per cent at the top increasing to 15 per cent. at the bottom&mdash;but I think that in 1947 and 1953, we were more realistic and our action was more in keeping with our general national approach on this topic, when on one occasion there was a flat increase of £250 and on the other, increases tapering from 15 per cent at the top to 30 per cent at the bottom.  It is a real pity that this was not done in the present instance.</P>
    <P>I renew my appeal that future increases granted to the Civil Service should be passed on expeditiously to the Judiciary, who are debarred by the fact that a statute has to be created every time an increase is given to them. One of the fears of that body at present is that if they get these increases now, they must wait nine or ten years for another, and in that time inflation may, and probably will, have gone much further than today and real values will be depressed 15 or 20 per cent.  It would do a lot to allay their fears if the Minister could give them an assurance that these increases will be passed on as a routine matter.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1180" /> I welcome the Bill for what it gives and because at least it acknowledges an obligation that was long overdue, and I sympathise with the Government in having to introduce it at such an inappropriate time, but I feel that such measures should be unnecessary in the future and should become more routine.  I appeal, in conclusion, to the Minister to let us have a Select Committee appointed at least before the next Bill comes in to inquire not alone into this aspect of the judicial system but many other aspects that call for attention.</P>

I am glad to note the section recognises that appointments to the post of Clerk or Clerk-Assistant of Dáil Éireann are normally from the staff of the Oireachtas.  I think it is probably a necessary step as they would normally be expected to be the persons best qualified for appointment.</P>
      <P>In regard to paragraph (b) of subsection (2), in view of the fact that ordinarily one would expect that the Clerk or Clerk-Assistant would be drawn from the staff of the Oireachtas. I wonder what conditions the Minister has in mind where a person would not be suitable for appointment to either of these posts?

      <P>Each of the following officers, namely, the Clerk of Dáil Éireann and the Clerk-Assistant of Dáil Éireann shall be appointed by the Taoiseach on the recommendation of the Chairman of Dáil Éireann and the Minister.</P>
      <P>That was the law up to this.  You could appoint anybody; you were not confined to the Civil Service or anywhere else.  It was the staff who asked me to put in this amendment&mdash;I do not think it strengthens their position very much, to tell the truth&mdash; and I said: &ldquo;All right.&rdquo;  In other words, if any member of the staff is fit for the position, we shall appoint him but if not, we shall go outside. That is all the section lays down and I think it is only as it should be. Senators will realise that if there is a person fitted for the position on the staff, he should get the appointment.</P>

In reply, the Minister said it was a matter which had caused some difficulty.  I understood him to say that the position had been got over in this way that there was nothing to prevent the Chairman of Dáil Éireann from nominating, for instance, the Clerk of Seanad Éireann to exercise the delegated power of suspension. <Col N="1183" /> I think that probably will be satisfactory enough.

I said that if it were felt that the Clerk of Seanad Éireann should have certain powers, there was nothing to prevent the Ceann Comhairle from giving these powers to him.  I am quite sure the Ceann Comhairle will be reasonable. If he agrees it is necessary that this should be done, I am sure it will be done.  The Seanad should understand that in a Bill of this kind when you are giving a man power, he uses his discretion.  You cannot very well interfere with him in that way.</P>

      <P>This section deals with a case where a member of the staff has been suspended for grave misconduct warranting disciplinary action.  Power is given in the section to the Chairman of Seanad Éireann to direct or sanction that remuneration which has been stopped from the suspended officer during the period of suspension may be paid in whole or in part to the suspended officer.  I think the point I have in mind arises on other sections of the Bill as well.</P>
      <P>When the Civil Service Regulation Act was going through this House in 1956, certain undertakings were given by the then Minister for Finance to the effect that where the power of suspension or dismissal was exercised, the officer affected would be entitled to get his staff association to make representations in writing on his behalf to the appropriate authority.  My concern is that since we are segregating the staff of the Houses of the Oireachtas from the Civil Service and the Government, the undertakings then given by the Minister for Finance in relation to the Civil Service and the Government will apply equally in relation to civil servants of the State who were members of the staff of the Oireachtas. My concern is in relation to the rights of the civil servant's appropriate staff association to make representations on his behalf where he has been called to account for misconduct or where his dismissal is threatened.  I should be glad of an assurance in that regard.  I take it that that is so.  I take it that the civil servant's staff association would still have the right to make these representations in writing on his behalf to the appropriate authority?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  The undertaking was given, I understand, with regard to dismissal and it has been adhered to.  Senators will understand that it could not possibly be given in regard to a suspension.  A suspension sometimes has to be carried out very suddenly. If the Chairman finds a member of the staff here guilty of gross misconduct, disobedience, and so on, he has to suspend him on the <Col N="1185" /> spot.  He cannot wait for the staff association to make any intervention on his behalf but, before he is dismissed, certainly the staff association would be heard.  There is no doubt about that.  Dismissal takes a long time, as Senators are probably aware, and before that decision is taken, the staff association would be heard on the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>I am opposed to this Bill and to the increases because I believe the time is not now opportune. This Bill comes at a very inappropriate time, at a time when, as we all know, we have a falling population, high emigration and unemployment, and a huge balance of payments problem, with a consequent urgent need for stability and lower prices if we are to achieve greater exports&mdash;which we all hope for&mdash;and pay our way.  There is very little justification for increases ranging from £175 per annum to £485 per annum.  I believe that will interfere with the stability which we need at the present time, and with the stability at which, in my opinion, we had arrived.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it will be agreed by everybody that the granting of these increases will spur every other section <Col N="1186" /> of the community to demand increases immediately.  If we in this House are prepared to grant increases, and sanction increases, amounting to £10 per week to people who already have over £95 per week, how can the Government or any of us fail to answer the demands of the old age pensioners, the widows and orphans and other sections of the community?  We all realise that 70 per cent of the workers in this country have less than £10 per week and 50 per cent of the workers have less than £6 per week.  It should be the duty of any Government to govern in the interests of the greatest number of people in the community. I do not believe it is right that we should have one law for the rich and another law for the poor because the cost of living affects all people equally. If we believe an increase of 2/6 per week is enough to cover the increase in the cost of living for the old age pensioners and that 10/- per week is enough for other sections of the community, if we give the increases proposed in this Bill we cannot claim that we are being just to the lower paid categories.  God be with the days when we were told in this country that no man was worth more, or should be paid more, than £1,000 per year.</P>
    <P>Senators have spoken here to-day of the setting up of a Select Committee to go into this question.  We all know that, in 1953, a Select Committee of Dáil Éireann, representative of the Government and the Opposition, considered a memorandum submitted by the judges of the Supreme Court, the High Court and the Circuit Court. There were submissions by the district justices on their claim for an increase in salary.  It might be no harm to say, in passing, that the only time they can be got together is when there is a discussion of an increase in their own salaries.  They can never be got together to discuss uniformity in sentences, the Probation Act, or the crime wave.</P>
    <P>As a result of the recommendations of that Select Committee, the Government of the day decided to increase substantially the salaries of all members of the Judiciary.  They got an increase in salary ranging from £250 per annum to £450 per annum.  That was in 1953.  I should like to point out to <Col N="1187" /> the Minister that the memorandum submitted by the judges of the Supreme Court and the High Court stated:</P>
    <P>We wish to make it plain that we do not claim any right to have our salaries increased from time to time on account of any temporary increase in the cost of living, whether reckoned by reference to the index figure or otherwise.</P>
    <P>That statement was made in the memorandum submitted by those learned and responsible gentlemen.  Surely if they made a statement like that in support of their claims in 1953, it is not unreasonable to ask why they are looking for this increase and why it is being made retrospective to 1st January, 1959.  It is being made retrospective for these people who are reasonably well off but when the increase was given in the Budget to the old age pensioners of 2/6 per week&mdash; 1/80th of what one gentleman is getting in this case&mdash;it could not be paid and they had to wait for four months, until September, to get the increase.</P>
    <P>Senator Sheehy Skeffington referred to the fact that Fine Gael or the inter-Party Government did not give a brass farthing and claimed that one of the increases was given in 1947 and the other in 1953.  It might be no harm to point out that there was a change of Government in 1948 and another in 1953.  The judges pointed out themselves in 1953 that they did not want an increase every time the cost of living increased.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe that in our effort to secure a bright to-morrow with more prosperity in this country and to even the slices of cake to everybody, there is very little use appealing to employers and employees to make a real contribution and fight against inflation by moderating wage increase demands in Ireland when the Government themselves are not prepared to set the lead.  The Government should practise what they have been preaching over the past few years.  Nobody can deny that in granting an increase of £175 per annum to 33 district justices and up to £485 per annum to the Chief Justice, the Government are not showing any restraint themselves and are giving a bad example to the people to whom they appeal.</P>
      <P>They themselves are throwing discretion to the wind and are kindling the inflationary fires which if the blaze starts could have dire consequences for the people and for the whole economy of the country.  We have heard a lot to-day about the allowances being paid to these gentlemen. Judging by what some Senator said, one would think they were not getting any subsistence allowances or travelling expenses.  Looking through the list, however, I find that one district justice got over £1,113 and fifteen of them had over £400 in the year 1958-59 in travelling expenses and subsistence allowances alone.  That should have gone a long way to cushion them against the increase in the cost of living.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It might be no harm to state that when the last increase in travelling expenses and subsistence allowances was given to the judges in November, 1957, it was back-dated to June, 1956. Neither the Seanad nor anybody else was informed of the Order when it was made.  We can be told that there was no necessity for the Government to publish the order, but on the same <Col N="1189" /> date, the officers of the Garda Síochána received increased allowances in a similar Ministerial Order and this was published and made available in the Library and in the Stationery Office. Why the secrecy in regard to the Judiciary?  They are entitled to the same treatment as any other section, but if they get any increase, the elected representatives of the people are entitled to know about it.</P>
    <P>Everybody will agree that we are asked to take a very important step in this Bill.  According to what we have been told by many, the cost of living is supposed to have been stationary for the past year.  We know that our exports are falling&mdash;they are down by £10 million.  The national income is falling, and we all admit that the income of the farmers, the principal producers, is falling considerably. It is they who will have to bear the brunt of these increases.  Other sections can pass increases on to somebody else, but the farmers cannot pass them on to anybody.  We are giving these gentlemen additions to their salaries of £175 to £485.  One thing we should remember is that once they get these increases, under the Constitution, these salaries cannot be lowered while each individual judge is in office.  Even if the cost of living were to drop in the immediate future&mdash; and turkeys are 3/- a lb. less than they were at this time last year, to give one example&mdash;they will still get the increases in salary we vote to-day.</P>
    <P>I have referred to inflation, and it is my firm conviction that the granting of these increases will lead to repercussions of a type out of all proportion to the value of the money involved.  It is the duty of this or any other Government to hold the scales as evenly as possible between all sections of the community.  That is not being done in this Bill.  So far as the well-off sections of the community are concerned, the sky seems to be the limit.  Those people are getting a 10 per cent. increase.  We are told that the cost of living has increased by 15 per cent. We agree with that but still we give one man 10/- or 12/- a week to cover the increase and another man £485 a year.  In my opinion, that is wrong.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1190" /> The State is honouring its obligations to this section of the community reasonably well in the salaries which are paid.</P>
    <P>There is no use in comparing salaries or wages here with Northern Ireland or Great Britain.  One is a mighty Empire which can afford to pay high wages, but in agricultural countries, you cannot attain the same standard of living or hope to pay the same high wages.  We are providing them with reasonable remuneration in accordance with the resources of our State.  The Taoiseach has only £3,000 a year and his burdens and responsibilities are much greater than those of any judges.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer briefly to some of the things stated by Senator O'Brien, Senator O'Quigley, Senator Stanford and others who said that judges must be above temptation and that the salary should be high enough to keep them above corruption.  In the Dáil on October 29th, the Taoiseach said in Volume 177 at column 560:</P>
    <P>I am sure all members of the House accept that the independence of the Judiciary is something which we should try to preserve.  It is certainly something that all democratic Governments strive to uphold, and they try to express that aim in the levels of the remuneration fixed for judges.</P>
    <P>He also said:</P>
    <P>It means putting them into a position in which they will be, as far as possible, immune from improper influence of any kind, and it is no exaggeration to say, in my view, that an adequate and, indeed, a generous basis of remuneration for judges is the basis of their indedependence. It has always been so regarded here.  It is indeed, so regarded everywhere.</P>
    <P>I should like to know what is the real reason for this.  Is it because the cost of living has increased by 15 per cent. or is it that we should give them a salary that will make them independent? Is it, as the Minister states, to meet an increase of 15 per cent. in the <Col N="1191" /> cost of living or, as the Taoiseach states, to make them as far as possible immune from improper influences of any kind?  Those are outrageous statements.  They seem to exhibit a mentality childlike in its innocence and in its ignorance of human nature. You cannot purchase integrity.  A man is either honest or he is dishonest. Giving him money will not make any man honest.  People who accept bribes do so because they are men of low character.  Generally they are rich because it is the rich who have the power and influence to whom bribes are addressed.  Bribes are seldom addressed to the poor working person.  At the same time, we expect and we get integrity from the ordinary people of the country, from the majority of Irishmen, from the chambermaid and from the road worker, without having to buy them.  It is wrong to say that we should have to buy the Judiciary.  It is wrong that anyone should say that we have to give them a salary to make them immune from any improper influences of any kind.  I should like to know, reading what the Minister stated the other day, whether we are to accept the proposition that judges and district justices are a section of the community who must be paid to stay honest.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach was not content with what he already had stated but he continued (at Column 566, Vol. 177):</P>
    <P>I would like to think that there was no feeling of disgruntlement among the members of the Judiciary. I hope they will regard this Bill as an indication of the Government's acceptance of their claim and a reasonable attempt to meet them. I am quite certain that the vast majority of thoughtful opinion among our people will give an affirmative answer to that question and will, indeed, support the changes in Judicial salaries for which the Bill provides.  I would regard that, and shall regard it as a very small price to pay for the preservation of the independence and the status of the Judiciary.</P>
    <P>Does that mean that we must pay a price for their independence and for <Col N="1192" /> their integrity?  The Taoiseach, in the words I have just quoted implied that in order to maintain the independence of the Judiciary, it is imperative that they should be paid at a particularly high level:</P>
    <P>I regard it as a very small price to pay for the preservation of the independence and the status of the Judiciary.</P>
    <P>I do not accept that point of view myself because I think there is some basic morality in everybody, in every one of us, which determines our interpretation of what is right and what is wrong.</P>

This Bill deals with only a small and relatively privileged section of the community and leaves the problem of the weaker and more helpless section economically and financially untouched.  Any increase given at the present time should be related to the country's economy and to the taxpayers' and the producers' ability to pay.  I listened to speakers to-day like Senator Sheehy Skeffington, who talked about the Judiciary, and said that their standard was extremely high.  I always say what I think and believe.  I believe that the vast majority of the Judiciary are independent men of integrity, but I am sorry to say that there is a small minority who are not.</P>

      <P>It would appear to me that the last speaker seemed to think it good political strategy or expedient to oppose measures which propose to rectify injustices to those concerned.  To my mind at any rate, the case put up by Senator L'Estrange has not any merit: that men who cannot defend themselves properly should be required to carry on at a considerably lower salary according to present monetary values.  It is wrong to pander to people who are not informed of all the relevant facts and who are unable to view matters in their proper perspective.  The actual fact is the statement made by Deputy McGilligan in the Dáil at column 551, Volume 177:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I think £13,000 or £14,000 would meet all the increases.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>If one considers the fact that income tax and surtax will take approximately £4,000, that would make the total increase about £10,000.  Also the Taoiseach states that it is proposed to reduce the number of district justices by five or six and of Circuit Court judges by one; therefore, the amount which will be saved will be considerably more than the increase now being sought in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This House accepts the fact that the Judiciary are the custodians or the trustees of the fundamental rights of even the humblest citizen of this State.  They interpret the law as enacted by this Parliament, decree and enforce these laws, and accordingly it is only right, despite what Senator L'Estrange says, that we should attract men of integrity and ability, men who are accepted in their profession, men who are respected by their colleagues and by the public at large.  There has been reference to the fact that some of these men were politicians before they were appointed onto the Bench.  I do not think that that is anything of which they should be ashamed.  Men who have experience of public life as members of the Oireachtas, or even as Ministers of the Government, who have been dealing with men and with their problems, have, as I am aware, some of them, made excellent judges. <Col N="1194" /> I think the experience which they have gained is a great asset to such men.</P>
    <P>Senator Sheehy Skeffington referred to the fact that he was a son of a member of the Judiciary and I, too, claim that.  I should remind the House that in 1924 the Cumann na nGaedheal Government gave a salary of £1,000 to district justices and, as Senator O'Donovan has pointed out, the value of that salary to-day is from £2,500 to £3,000, so that obviously district justices are not being paid anything like the salary they were paid pre-war. At that time, there were two district justices for County Donegal.  It is now proposed that one district justice should cover the whole county.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LouisWalsh" hpid="Mr. Louis Walsh Mr. Louis Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Louis Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The mountains, unfortunately, are still there.  In spite of the facetious remark of Senator L'Estrange, the mountains are still where they were.  At any rate, this House has opportunities each year, when the Appropriation Bill comes before it, to criticise the salaries of the Civil Service.</P>
      <P>I should like to refer the House to the fact that in the Department of Finance, apart from the Secretary, Assistant Secretary and Deputy Assistant Secretary, there are eleven Principal Officers.  According to the Estimates, the salaries of these Principal Officers is £21,647.  If one divides that sum by eleven, one finds that the average salary for each is £1,967.  That means that these men are being paid a higher salary than it is now proposed to pay district justices in the country under the proposed 10 per cent.  I do not think, therefore, anyone would suggest that the proposal, so far as these men are concerned, is in any way exorbitant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Sheehy Skeffington began his remarks by referring to the fact that the old age pensioners are being paid £71 10s.  It is no harm to remind the House that that involves this State in an expenditure of well over £11 million per year and that every shilling represents a considerable number of <Col N="1195" /> hundreds of thousands of pounds.  He stated that the reason they were not paid any more was that the money was not there.  That was true.  As I have suggested, the proposals involved in this Bill do not mean one penny of cost to the Exchequer if the proposed reduction in the number of district justices and certain Circuit Court judges takes place.</P>
    <P>Some reference was made to the salary of the Chief Justice but when one considers the fact that income tax is approximately 7/- in the £ and that the men who are being paid such a salary have to pay surtax, the actual amount they will receive will possibly be half the amount proposed under this increase.  For these reasons, I consider that the proposal is most reasonable.  I agree that at some time in the future the Government should consider a further increase in the salaries of the lower paid members of the Judiciary, namely, the district justices, as Senator Ryan has already suggested, if the cost of living increases further.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very pleased that a measure of this sort comes before the Oireachtas rather than that the remuneration of the members of the Judiciary should be dealt with by some arbitration board or the like.  In fact, it would be very much better for this country if the whole question of the remuneration to be paid to all State servants could be discussed in both Houses of Parliament.</P>
      <P>The burden of the remarks made by Senator L'Estrange, a man elected in the agricultural interests, was that all salaries, remuneration or whatever you call it, must be related to the amount of money available.  In Ireland, we are inclined to set up all sorts of arbitration boards which seem to take no real cognisance of the fact that our income per head and our exertions produce only from 55 per cent. to 60 per cent. of the <i>per capita</i> income available for distribution in the island of Britain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Odious comparisons are made showing us how badly justices and others are paid in relation to what is paid in the North and in Britain.  The fact is <Col N="1196" /> that we have found ourselves in large measure, principally by the operation of arbitration boards, and so on, a high cost economy and a high tax economy.  Much of the salaries which judges enjoy is being taken back from them to help to pay the other State servants.</P>
    <P>Earlier this evening, I felt I could support the claim made for district justices.  District justices in the country enjoy a salary of only £1,760 a year.  It is not a figure commensurate with their responsibilities, their status and so forth in the community. Senator L'Estrange mentioned that some district justices were drawing, in respect of travelling expenses, sums as high as £1,000 a year.  That made me more convinced than ever of the impossibility of dealing with a measure of this sort in this House or in the other House without having the assistance of a Select Committee.</P>
    <P>I should like to appeal to the Minister to consider, even at this hour, the request made by many Deputies in the Dáil and by Senators here to set up a Select Committee.  I do not want to have a Bill such as this brought before us dealing with the matter in a sort of <i>ad hoc</i> manner by giving everybody 10 per cent. regardless of whether he requires 10 per cent. or not.  I do not think that substantial justice is even approached in the Bill by giving some people over £500 a year and by giving the majority of the district justices something less than £200 a year.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to say any more on this measure because it would be an understatement to say that it was adequately discussed.  It was overdiscussed. There is nothing further one could possibly say on the matter except to reiterate and emphasise the fact that the complexities involved in doing any form of real justice to the people who have to pay the piper and also to the people who will be in receipt of the salaries cannot be solved except by a Select Committee.  The bringing of this measure before us, asking us to vote for a 10 per cent. increase in remuneration for all the district justices, is not facing the facts in a manner that will bring a real solution. <Col N="1197" /> It is not a responsible way of dealing with the problem, considering the state of the economy at the moment and also the problem of giving a fair measure of justice to the members of the Judiciary in relation to the amount of money available.</P>

      <P>For a long time, all the speakers in this debate seemed to be unorganised workers of the Law Library.  We heard many people chant the same hymn.  Two barristers from this side of the House, Senator Ryan and Senator Cole, gave their views and expressed general approval of the Bill.  We also had constitutional lawyers.  Senator O'Quigley from the other side of the House chanted the same tune.  I began to wonder if something was wrong with this Bill.  I glanced through it.  I saw it gave a 10 per cent. increase to the judges.  I was not very much interested.  I did not think the Bill would occasion a long debate.  I thought most of us would make up our minds on the principle involved and would either agree or disagree.  It did not occur to me that it would involve a long debate.  Until now, I thought it would be an agreed measure.</P>
      <P>I listened to the arguments of the gentlemen I have mentioned, together with the arguments of Senator Stanford and Senator Sheehy Skeffington. Since many others have offered criticism of the Bill, I suppose I may retain the right to do likewise.  I may find myself in agreement with the Bill but for quite different reasons from those advanced by all these other gentlemen I have mentioned. Here is why I agree with the Bill and why I rose to speak at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am one of those who believe that if we had less litigation, our country would be happier.  If fewer people went to the District Courts when there is barely an issue to be decided, I believe our community would be happier, mentally and financially.  In so far as this Bill may tend to make legal processes more costly, it has something to commend it.  It is a new angle.  I realise the necessary <Col N="1198" /> function of the Judiciary.  They perform very important work.  The men who serve as judges have given service and proved themselves eminent in their profession.  That is why they find themselves on the Bench.</P>
    <P>When I was sitting on the benches opposite, I heard a very able man who is now a judge make a case which I regarded as brilliant.  Even if that man took part in politics, even if he came here and argued in this House, I do not think his capacity to be a good judge was impaired just because he took part in political activity.  He was doing his duty as a citizen, as he saw it.  He was entitled, as a freeman, to take part in politics.  He was doing his duty.  I know he gave good service in many directions and I know he is a very eminent judge.</P>
    <P>It is a pity we have remarks about people on soap-boxes.  Senator L'Estrange talked about buying honesty and integrity.  One of the reasons&mdash;if this argument can reach Senator L'Estrange&mdash;for paying judges high salaries is to instil in our people the confidence that, because our judges are well paid, they are above suspicion.  It is important that our people should feel that our judges are above suspicion and, in so far as the salary paid to them will ensure that in the minds of our people, it is a good thing.  It would be disastrous if our people began to speculate about their integrity and question it.  They would then lose confidence in justice.  They would begin to wonder if the courts really tried to achieve the principle of justice.  Senator L'Estrange seems to consider the salaries paid to our Judiciary excessive.  It is no credit to him to suggest that their honesty has to be purchased for money.  That is not the intention.</P>

      <P>Senator L'Estrange is misrepresenting what the Taoiseach said.  I am putting my interpretation on what he said and in my view it is the correct interpretation.  No matter <Col N="1199" /> what Government appoint a judge, no matter what political Party the judge may have given service to, for any man to suggest that they are incapable of achieving the principle of justice without being bought to do so is something which I personally dislike as an outlook and it is not that I am so fond of judges as a class.</P>
      <P>In so far as this Bill may tend to make legal processes more costly, it is good.  The less litigation we have in this country, the better for our people. Sometimes very petty issues are brought to the District Court.  The district justice has to listen to a lot of talk on a trifling issue and sometimes there may even be no issue to be decided.  I have often wondered, if we had to reduce the number of district justices, how we would deal, for instance, with cases such as the prosecution of a person for riding a bicycle at night without a light.  That sort of thing occupies quite an amount of the time of the District Court.  The district justice, a man with legal training, must sit and listen to the arguments and pronounce judgment on the case.  Such cases can prove to be a waste of public time and money.</P>

I had to listen to much material of that nature from Senators such as Senator Sheehy Skeffington.  I am not in any way, however, questioning the ruling of the Chair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It appears to me that one of the merits of this measure is that it will not ultimately involve any extra cost if it is intended to have a reduction in the number of district justices.  That is a matter which is relevant to the Bill. I cannot see how that can be done if all the trivial cases that should not, in <Col N="1200" /> my view, appear in court at all, still continue to appear in the courts.  That tendency is growing year by year, and unless we are to have eight hours sittings in the district courts day after day, I cannot see how we are to arrive at a position where we can reduce the number of district justices.</P>
    <P>I respectfully suggest that that argument is relevant to the Bill since it is intended to have a reduction in the number of district justices.  I would welcome that reduction because it would tend to make the process of going to court more inconvenient for people.  If there were fewer courthouses, and if people had to go some distance, it might prevent them from going to court and taking an oath, which is a very serious matter.</P>

Any speech in this House or anywhere else which tries to destroy that confidence is wrong. When there are issues to be decided which have regard to real matters, it is important that the people should have confidence in the courts and should have confidence that our courts are trying to carry out the principles of justice.  Any statement by anybody anywhere which tends to destroy that confidence, or undermine it, is very bad indeed.

      <P>There is a little avenue of escape by reason of the fact that a Select Committee may be set up to deal with an issue like this. I can never understand the thinking of people who argue along those lines. When a matter is a function of the Government, it should be the function <Col N="1202" /> of the Government.  Is it to be the practice in this country that when certain awkward issues arise, such as salaries for judges, with no political kudos to be gained, even if the claim is just having regard to comparable employment, to set up a Select Committee? It may be expedient politically to set up some arbitration board and, in other words, to alienate the rights of Parliament and Government, but my view is that when a matter is a function of the Government, the Government should decide it and not alienate their responsibility and their power.  No Government have the right to delegate their functions in these issues, awkward as they may sometimes be.</P>
      <P>I do not believe the people who argue that select committees or arbitration boards should be set up, have thought very deeply about it or they would realise that once you start in that direction, you will ultimately have the members of such groups or boards or committees deciding issues that are properly the function of the Government.  If democracy is to be preserved, it surely cannot be preserved by delegating powers and functions and duties which the Government should discharge.  It is a very wrong thing for a Government to decide to shelve awkward questions by setting up a committee, unless it is a fact-finding committee set up to examine a situation and make a report.  In that case, the Government would still be free to decide the issues involved.  Once a Government come to the stage of having to accept the recommendations of such a body, that Government have given away the powers which properly belong to them.  I feel if we were to start on that road, we would ultimately find that Parliamentary democracy was completely unworkable.</P>

      <P>Some half-hour ago, Senator McGuire said that all that could be said about the Bill had been said, but he reckoned without Senator O'Reilly and myself.  As the House will know, there is at present a round of wage and salary claims in progress <Col N="1203" /> in the State, and the grounds for adjusting income, wages and salaries are generally based on the increase in the cost of living and a claim to share in the benefits of increased productivity. As a representative of organised workers, I welcome the fact that the Government recognise that a change in the cost of living justifies, and indeed requires, increases in salaries.  I hope that the Government in dealing with their other less well-paid servants, will accept and give effect to the same principle.</P>
      <P>I must confess, however, that I am rather puzzled by the spokesman from the front bench of the Fine Gael Party, because, as I understood the position, that Party are opposed to any adjustments in salaries or wages at the present time.  I am sorry, that because of a meeting of a committee, I missed Senator McGuire's speech.  I understand that as a spokesman for employers, he welcomed this Bill and expressed the opinion that, in fact, it did not go far enough.  I understand he also referred to some judge's statement to him that there had been no increase in productivity in this country.  Perhaps that is where he got that wrong information on that subject.</P>
      <P>I referred to the attitude of the principal spokesman of Fine Gael. They are entitled to their attitude, but, as I said already, I must confess I am puzzled, because in a letter to the <i>Irish Times</i> on 9th October, their position was made clear by Senator Barry.  That letter was in connection with Deputies' allowances and in it the Senator said that the Fine Gael Parliamentary Party felt &ldquo;that the time was not opportune for any headline for increasing any rewards, salaries, wages or allowances in Ireland.&rdquo;  At that time they were talking about allowances which in fact had not been adjusted since 1947.  Here in the Seanad I notice they are supporting this Bill and indeed expressing regret that there is not a bigger adjustment in salaries which were previously adjusted in 1953.</P>

      <P>At that time, the Fine Gael Party were talking about Deputies' allowances which, as I said, had not been adjusted since 1947, and they were opposed, and I believe are still opposed, to any adjustment in those allowances, whereas here they support a plea for an increase in the salaries of judges.  They are entitled to their viewpoint but I must confess I am a little puzzled.</P>
      <P>As a representative of organised labour, I cannot oppose the principle that salaries or allowances, including Deputies' allowances, should be adjusted because of a change in the value of money, but, like Senator Sheehy Skeffington, I feel that the Government are starting at the wrong end of the scale.  I should be much happier, as I think most Senators would be, if we were dealing with a Bill proposing increases in allowances for old age pensioners, widows and orphans and other people dependent on social welfare benefits, and I should be especially happy if those increases were retrospective to 1st January.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, we are not dealing with that.  We are dealing with increases in the salaries of judges. There has been a change in the value of money since last there were adjustments and I do not think that point can be evaded.  If it is right, as the Government have accepted that it is right, to adjust salaries or allowances because of the change in the cost of living, then we have to agree with the principle embodied in this Bill.  I do think that the Minister might favourably consider the plea which came from all sides that the matter should be referred to a Select Committee.  There seems to be a doubt as to whether the increase is being properly applied or whether it might not be of more benefit if there were different adjustments at varying levels.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should hope that if it were <Col N="1205" /> agreed to send this matter to a Select Committee, consideration would also be given to the method of the appointment of justices.  That has been mentioned from various sides of the House and in spite of what has been said I do not think there is any quarrel with or any opposition to the fact that legal people do take part in politics.  I think they have a perfect right and a duty to take part in politics but what I am unhappy about is that with all Governments, it seems to be the practice to appoint justices and judges on no other criterion than the service they have rendered to their own political Party.  That has been the practice with various Governments.</P>

      <P>I did not expect this Second Reading debate to last so long but I was glad it did develop in the way it did, up to a point.  I refer to what I thought was at least a making up of their minds by the members of the Fine Gael Party.  Unfortunately, I was not able to be present in the Dáil during the course of the debate there but while I was waiting here, I have been perusing the debates in the Dáil and I have been trying to understand, from the speeches made by members of the Fine Gael front bench, what their attitude really was to the Bill.  I must admit I have not been able to get any consensus of opinion from it. All I know is, so far as the Dáil is concerned, that the Government side <Col N="1206" /> of the House had to file through the Division Lobby at almost every step and stage of the Bill.</P>
      <P>I was taken rather by surprise when I heard the majority of the Fine Gael Party not only supporting the principle of the Bill but suggesting that even greater salary increases should be given and suggesting that a 15 per cent. increase should be given and that perhaps more might be given in the case of district justices. However, Senator L'Estrange seems to have thrown a spanner into these works, with the result that again I find myself unable to garner what is the real attitude of the Fine Gael Party to the Bill.  It might be suggested that the voting in the Dáil was against the refusal of the Government to set up a Select Committee, but in so far as I have been able to read through the speeches made in the Dáil, almost every one of the members of the Fine Gael front bench seemed to oppose the Bill for a different reason.</P>
      <P>Deputy McGilligan said that it was a Bill that ought to be passed, and passed quickly, on the basis on which it was presented to the House and that there was no necessity to set up a Select Committee.  Another front bench Deputy suggested that there was no justification for an increase of £10 a week in the salaries of certain members of the Judiciary, and yet another member based his case on the question of submission of the whole case to a Select Committee.</P>
      <P>That might give Senator Sheehy Skeffington some illustration of the difficulty the Government found themselves in in preparing this Bill and presenting it to the Oireachtas.  As has been said, it was in 1953 that the previous Bill increasing the salaries of the Judiciary came before the Oireachtas, and then again it was a Fianna Fáil Government which had to put the Bill forward and make themselves a cockshot as they felt they had a duty to do on both occasions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The manner in which the Bill was debated in the Dáil indicated that it required some degree of courage to present the Bill even in the state in <Col N="1207" /> which it was presented before the Dáil, having regard to the manner in which it was being criticised not only in the Dáil but through the country.  The fact was that the Government felt that the increase was justified, having regard to the increase in the cost of living.  I should like to point out to Senator Murphy at this stage that the cost of living which was being taken into account was not an increase in the past 12 months but an increase since 1953, when these salaries were last adjusted, so that his contention that on that basis the Government should increase the salaries of all its servants completely falls to the ground.  He knows&mdash;and I am sure he is a student of these statistics&mdash;that the cost of living has not increased at all in the past 12 months.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DominickMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Claims are not based on the change in the past 12 months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I know very well what the present claims were based on, and it is not on the basis of any increase in the past 12 months.  I do not know of any trade union which has attempted to justify such a case, either before the Labour Court or in preliminary negotiations with employers. There is no basis whatever for the argument he puts forward to-day that there should be a similar increase in the salaries of State servants.</P>
      <P>I should like to remind Senator Murphy and all other Senators that since the emergency there have been no fewer than six rounds of increases. I shall not comment on whether the increase now being granted can be described as a seventh round or not, but during that time every section of the community, with some notable exceptions such as the Judiciary and Deputies and Ministers, partook of those increases.  Therefore, on that basis it is only justice that some increases should be given.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many comparisons were made with the relative increases given to civil servants and to district justices.  The cases that have been made&mdash;and there is a surprising uniformity in the manner in which they have been presented&mdash;were <Col N="1208" /> based on the increases given to civil servants from the year 1944 onwards. and on a comparison with the increases being given in this Bill to district justices. It is only fair, however, that the increases should be based on the initial year 1924, because in the years 1924 to 1929 when it was proved that there was a reduction in the cost of living, the salaries of civil servants were correspondingly reduced, whereas under the Constitution there was no reduction whatever in the salaries of the Judiciary.</P>
    <P>There was, further, during the war years, the operation of the stabilisation order, and it was only at the end of the war that the increases which were due as a result of the increase in the cost of living during the war again began to be reflected in the civil servants' pay packets.  If we take a district justice who was in receipt of £1,000 a year in 1924 and compare with that what he will now get under this Bill, the increase will be £925.  His counterpart in the Civil Service with a similar salary of £1,000 in 1924 now gets something between £1,820 and £1,850.  There might be limited increases in respect of certain bonuses which I am not taking into account here, but on these figures there has been a fairly close relationship between the increases given to the civil servants and to the district justices.</P>
    <P>The suggestion that a Select Committee should be appointed was made on the other side of the House and also in the Dáil.  I should like to remind the Seanad that a Select Committee was set up in 1953 and in fact I myself was chairman, and all the considerations as to the relativity of the responsibility and the relativity of the amount of work were taken into account on that occasion, and there was also taken into account that, in 1951, the Courts of Justice Act had been passed which increased the jurisdiction of the District Court.  I shall refer to that again later, but in general, it is not the tradition or practice to examine too often the relationship between such Government servants and their responsibilities.  The relationship of salary to responsibility was established then, and the increase now being given is due to the cost of living increase since 1953.  I am suggesting <Col N="1209" /> that the relationship is not being disturbed on this occasion.</P>
    <P>I have just said that the increase in the jurisdiction in the District Court was taken into account in 1953. Senator Sheehy Skeffington seemed to suggest that the increase in jurisdiction came after the Select Committee had reported in 1953, but that was not the case.  The increase was effected by the 1951 Act and was taken into account by the Select Committee in 1953.  I should like to mention in connection with these increases in jurisdiction that up till then the jurisdiction of the District Court in tort was £10 and in contract £25.</P>
    <P>It was suggested to the then Government that, by reason of the fall in money values there was a corresponding fall in the amount of civil business coming before the District Courts.  In fact, one could hardly envisage an action in tort in which the damages could be less than £10 at the present time.  If someone falls off a bicycle or runs into a motor car with a bicycle, the damage to the motor car or to the bicycle would certainly exceed £10.  Similarly, in contract, if an arrangement between people for the purchase of commodities falls down through alleged breach of contract, it is seldom that a claim comes before the District Court for such a breach rather than finding its way into the Circuit Court because invariably the plaintiff claims more than £25 and therefore more than the maximum jurisdiction of the District Court.  Therefore, there was a falling off in the business of District Courts and raising their jurisdiction to £50 restored the <i>status quo</i> as far as the volume of civil business in the District Court was concerned. There was, it is true, a change in the criminal jurisdiction but again that was taken into account by the 1953 Select Committee.</P>
    <P>I was surprised to hear Senator Murphy advocating a Select Committee. He might throw his mind back to 1953 when certain members of his Party were nominated and refused to take part in it.  Accordingly they left themselves completely free to criticise the agreed recommendations, the unanimous recommendations, of <Col N="1210" /> that Committee and they did not spare the Government, I can assure Senator Murphy, when its recommendations came before the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not blaming Senator Murphy for that, but I have no confidence in the desire of Labour to take part in such a Select Committee, if it were set up and, not having taking part, using their opportunity in the Dáil to criticise whatever the Select Committee would recommend.</P>
      <P>I was going to say, if the House had not adjourned before I made my speech in reply that I would have welcomed the tea break so that I could order my thoughts, but Senator Stanford very neatly arranged them for me in his nine points.  Since he did pose them, I shall answer them in the order in which he did so and in doing so I think I shall be able to take up some of the other points made by other members of the House.  He related his points entirely, I think, to the increase to which he said district justices were entitled over and above other members of the Judiciary.</P>
      <P>His first point was the cost of living. It is, as I said in my opening statement, correct that the cost of living did increase over the period by 15 per cent.  The increase provided here represents only a 10 per cent. increase in salary but the answer to that is that while recognising the justice of the Judiciary's claim, we must as far as we can exercise restraint.  That restraint is taken into account by the fact that the salaries are not increased by 15 per cent.  I think that is the only answer I can give&mdash;and it is a reasonable answer&mdash; to the point he made in that connection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>His second point was the increased work a district justice does.  I think I have already answered that inasmuch as that increase is taken into account <Col N="1211" /> in the report of the Select Committee whose recommendations were adopted by the Dáil and Seanad in 1953.  On that occasion, district justices received an increase of £450 as against £250 for the judges of the High Court and the Supreme Court.</P>
    <P>The third point was that justices should be above temptation.  I do not think I need try to defend the integrity of our Judiciary because I think it is well established not only here but throughout the country and I completely ignore the unfounded allegations made by Senator L'Estrange in this connection.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>They are not unfounded, but you can ignore them, if you like.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The only attempt I ever heard to attack the integrity of judges was made here by Senator L'Estrange and coming from that source, I think I am entitled to ignore it.  It is generally agreed, even if Senator L'Estrange does not agree, that our district justices and indeed all members of our Judiciary are above suspicion and that their integrity and independence are beyond question. Nevertheless, it is our duty to maintain them in such a position.  The test, I think, is to ensure that we shall get men of proper calibre, having accepted that nothing against their integrity is involved. There is, of course, and always will be, a complement of people anxious to take appointments on the Bench, whether at District Court or Supreme Court level.  The fact that we have more applicants than there are vacancies does not perhaps establish that we are remunerating them sufficiently.  Nevertheless, the fact that we can get among those who apply men of sufficient capacity and ability to perform their functions in the highest possible manner and in the best possible tradition establishes, I think, that we need not have recourse to the ordinary law of supply and demand in this connection.  There is a supply and the supply happily is of sufficiently high calibre to take these positions.  At the salaries they are paid, we can get men in whom we can have sufficient confidence.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>What about the man who was removed from office?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The man who was removed from office was removed for different reasons altogether and his resignation did not reflect in any way on his integrity.</P>
      <P>The fourth point made by the Senator was that lawyers are well paid and therefore may not be anxious to take up appointments on the District Court bench, where they are so much in the public eye and where their decisions are not only open to comment by the public but are open to appeal to a higher Court where they may be reversed and where possibly the quality of the work may be questioned. Lawyers are well paid if they are doing enough business.</P>
      <P>Somebody suggested that it is wrong to deny a person who is a successful barrister or solicitor and who wants to serve his country on the Bench an opportunity of doing so because the salary is small, compared with the amount he can earn if he never went on the Bench.  It is true that if a District justiceship were offered to those in active practice, among 75 per cent., you would get no takers because they are doing well enough or because they would not like the life on the Bench. As far as the High Court or Supreme Court is concerned, it is not unknown that many people earning high incomes would not be interested in an appointment. However, that is happily a matter of choice and if a person feels that his income will be reduced by going on the Bench, he is under no obligation to accept an appointment.  Invariably people do not accept an appointment unless they look forward to the security an appointment on the Bench offers. That is a point that should be taken into account, too: there is security and entitlement to pension which is not the case where a practising barrister or solicitor is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fifth point made by the Senator was that judges are precluded from accepting other posts of emolument.  I think that applies to more than judges and justices.  Most people in the public service are precluded also from taking up other posts.  Comparison with the North of Ireland was the sixth point made by the Senator, as far as district <Col N="1213" /> justices are concerned.  This applies also to judges of the High Court and the Supreme Court and in many other cases to persons in other public employment.</P>
    <P>The seventh point he mentioned was the previous differentiation between district justices and others.  I take it he means the differentiation that existed following the report of the Select Committee in 1953.  This differentiation is being continued because &mdash;and I repeat it&mdash;the 10 per cent. increase is concerned only with the increase in the cost of living.</P>
    <P>The eighth point was that district justices are precluded from promotion. That has always been the case.  I shall not go into the merits of it.  I think it is reasonably well accepted that a district justice who has taken up that position usually expects to find himself in it for the rest of his life, unless he resigns.  The principle involved is that a district justice, by reason of making decisions which might be construed as favourable to the Administration for the time being, might expect as a result to get promotion. I think that would be a wrong principle.  I am not suggesting it would happen.  Nevertheless, as they say in ordinary references to justice, justice must not only be done but must appear to be done.  Therefore, it must not appear that district justices, by making decisions or carrying on their courts in a manner that might be presumed to please the Government of the day, might as a result expect promotion. It is better to preserve their complete independence in this fashion.  The last point he made, a comparison with higher civil servants, I have dealt with already.</P>
    <P>I should like just to take up a few other points made by Senators in general.  As far as pension schemes are concerned, this is a matter to which the Minister for Justice himself and, I think, the Taoiseach made reference in the Dáil.  I think the Minister said that he would welcome proposals from the Judiciary themselves as to what they thought in this respect.  It is well known that the members of the Judiciary are concerned about pensions.  Whether, as a result of the proposals that they might make the Minister would be able <Col N="1214" /> to introduce a scheme or whether it would be necessary in this instance to appoint a Select Committee will be a matter for the Minister when the proposals have been formulated.</P>
    <P>The points I have already made answer some of the arguments made by Senator Sheehy Skeffington when he referred to the disparity in the amount of work required to be done and that no account of the vastly increased jurisdiction was taken in making this flat 10 per cent.increase.  I have said already that that was taken into account in 1953, but as far as the disparity in the amount of work was concerned, I do not know whether he was referring to the amount of work done in the district courts compared with the amount of work done in the circuit courts or whether he was referring to the disparity in the amount of work done by district justices <i>inter se.</i>  If it were the latter, I think nobody can contend that we could devise a scheme to remunerate district justices in accordance with the amount of work they do.  In the first instance, it varies from day to day.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamStanford" hpid="Professor Stanford Professor Stanford">
      <NameTxt>Professor Stanford</NameTxt>
      <P>As a matter of fact, I am quite sure that he was referring to the fact that over 90 per cent. of the criminal cases and 60 per cent. of the civil cases in general were dealt with in the district court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator was not referring to the disparity in the work of justices <i>inter se.</i>  I have already dealt with the amount of work done in the district court compared with that done in the circuit court because I believe that the change in jurisdiction was made largely to get back to the district court much of the civil work that had been done before the change in the value of money up to 1951.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think these were in general the main points made.  Having regard to the fact that the Select Committee reported as recently as 1953, I do not think a case has been made out for the establishment of a Select Committee in this instance.  The increase that has been given is not so divergent as between the district justices and the principal justice when income tax is deducted.  Take the case of a married judge without children.  The net increase <Col N="1215" /> for the Principal Justice would be £219 and for provincial district justices, £125.  The fact that a district justice is often appointed at a younger age than a principal justice would possibly imply that the district justice would have children in respect of whom he could make income tax claims.  Therefore, his net increase in salary would probably be much higher than the £125 mentioned here.</P>
    <P>These, as far as I can remember and as far as I have made notes, cover what the Senators said either in praise or criticism of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
    <P>Agreed to take remaining Stages to-day.</P>
    <P>Bill considered in Committee.</P>
    <P Just="Center">SECTION 1.</P>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That Section I stand part of the Bill&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOQuigley" hpid="Mr. O'Quigley Mr. O'Quigley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>I think this is a section upon which I can deal with some remarks made by Senator Sheehy Skeffington on Second Stage.  Senator Sheehy Skeffington made one remark about the disingenuousness of Deputy McGilligan who indicated that the Government in 1957 were contemplating an increase for the Judiciary and that Fate determined otherwise.  The Senator seemed to suggest that what Deputy McGilligan was saying was, in fact, not true.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position, of course, is this.  The first inter-Party Government came into office in 1948 and in the year before that, judicial salaries were increased. They were in office until 1951.  They came back into office again in 1954 and what happened, as probably Senator Sheehy Skeffington would not know or be in a position to know was as described by Deputy McGilligan that there was in 1956, 1957 and 1958 a case <i>sub judice</i> in the High Court and afterwards an appeal in the Supreme Court, the effect of which, if it went a particular way would have meant a substantial increase in the remuneration of the Judiciary.  That was the reason nothing was done by the Government between 1954 and <Col N="1216" /> 1957.  That case was not determined until after 1957.  Therefore, what Deputy McGilligan says&mdash;that this matter was under consideration&mdash;is the fact of the matter.  It was under such consideration and could not be dealt with until the case had been decided by the Supreme Court.  It so happened that the judges decided against their own interests, which indicates a very high level of integrity indeed. The Minister seemed to make great play with certain differences.  I must confess I did not quite follow what line he was trying to establish about differences in Fine Gael in their attitude towards this Bill.</P>

There are various ways in which a Select Committee can conduct its business but it seems to me that memoranda addressed to a Select Committee are not the best way of arguing a particular point of view.</P>
      <P>If my information is correct, the members of the Judiciary in 1953 were not afforded an opportunity of making oral representations to the Select Committee as they were rather disposed to do.  If indeed a Select Committee were established in relation to this Bill or in the future, it would be my view that an opportunity should be afforded to them and having made their case and having been heard and adjudicated on there would be no grievance on the part of anyone.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. J. Lynch)</NameTxt>
      <P>The object of this Bill is to extend for another year to 31st December, 1960, the provisions of the Rent Restrictions Act, 1946. As Senators know, this Act has been extended for a number of years past and I think there will be general agreement that, pending revision of the law of rent control, the Act should be extended for another period. I think there is general agreement that the Acts cannot be allowed to lapse pending the enactment of fresh legislation.</P>
      <P>It is almost certain that the Act will not be in force up to the end of 1960 because there is in preparation in the Department of Justice an amending Bill to the provisions of the 1946 Act which is almost completed.  The extension of the Act of 1946 and the subsequent Acts is contained in Section 1.  The provisions of Section 2 follow the precedent of previous Bills of this kind and enable a landlord who puts premises into a reasonable state of repair during 1960 to obtain the same lawful addition to the rent as he could obtain for such repairs if he did them now.  That provision is consistent with similar provisions contained in the existing Acts.</P>
      <P>It is likely that the comprehensive Bill amending the 1946 Act and the subsequent Acts will be introduced in the coming session and enacted certainly before the House rises for the Summer Recess.</P>

      <P>As the Minister says, this Bill is necessary to continue the system of rent restriction in operation up to the present time which is similar to previous Continuance Acts and pending the introduction of the comprehensive scheme of legislation based on the Conroy Report a Bill of this kind must be passed.  The Bill is purely mechanical and intended to prolong the life of the existing Acts and all that remains for us indeed is to hope that <Col N="1224" /> the new comprehensive Bill will be speedily introduced and to express the further hope&mdash;which may turn out to be one that will be defeated in the nature of things&mdash;that the new Bill will be a great deal clearer and more intelligible than the legislation which it will replace.</P>

      <P>I am glad to hear that the Minister proposes to introduce a new Bill in place of the Continuance Bills that have been coming before us for so many years and that some of the recommendations of the Conroy Report are to be given legislative effect.  I should like to ask that sufficient time be given for the various people interested in this measure to examine it, and that the Bill will be circulated as soon as possible so that we shall not have to wait until we are almost at the Summer vacation when both Houses of the Oireachtas will be asked to deal with this measure.  Rents and rent restriction and control is a most complex body of legislation and the affected parties, of whom there will be many, would have to have the opportunity of examining it and its full implications. The Minister, being a lawyer himself. will appreciate the difficulty of construing much of the legislation dealing with the matter.</P>

      <P>As Senator O'Quigley says, this Bill is based to an extent at any rate, on the report of the Conroy Commission.  It may be that in certain respects it may depart from the recommendations made in that report but I feel sure that it is a Bill of such import that the Minister for Justice, when he introduces it, will have regard to the suggestion made by the Senator that people likely to be affected by its provisions should have an opportunity of studying it very fully.  As the Senator knows, these people already had the opportunity of appearing before and giving evidence to the Conroy Commission, but to the extent they feel that their views were not expressed properly, or not adequately expressed in the Bill when it appears, I imagine the Minister will give adequate time between introducing the Bill and the Second Reading to ensure that that examination can be carried out.</P>

      <P>I notice that &ldquo;trade&rdquo; is defined as meaning any industry, occupation or business, and also includes any distinct branch of a trade, but does not include agriculture, horticulture and so on.  I should like to ask the Minister whether I am right in thinking that fishing, for instance, would be included in the definition of trade as it stands ?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator has put a question to me which is not in my brief, but, in general, the activities <Col N="1226" /> related to agriculture are not within the terms of the Bill.  Fisheries, so far as the administrative aspects are concerned, relate to agriculture but I do not think there could be an apprenticeship scheme in relation to fishery activities.  There would have to be an apprenticeship committee appointed. Fishing is rather a loosely-knit type of industry and it is only those industries which are well defined and are capable of having an apprenticeship scheme, that we feel would be proper to bring within the terms of the Bill.  However, I am not saying now that fisheries can be absolutely excluded.  There may be aspects in which they can be brought in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOQuigley" hpid="Mr. O'Quigley Mr. O'Quigley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason I rose to mention this point is that in cases dealing with industries, you are excluding agriculture.  In nearly all these cases, you lump fishing in with agriculture, although it is not strictly part of agriculture but partakes of the same kind of character as agriculture.  I thought in view of the desire to improve the fishing industry and the energetic steps taken in that regard, particularly by the previous Minister for Lands, now Minister for Transport and Power, and the likelihood of the continuance of that policy, that fishing would be included in trade.  In view of the freezing of fish, and all the other developments which are taking place at present with a view to making fish more readily available, there are certain aspects of the fishing industry which might be the subject of apprenticeship.</P>

      <P>I should have thought, in relation to certain trawlers to which the former Minister for Lands referred, that that is the kind of thing apprenticeship might apply to, that the art of manning trawlers was something that had to be acquired.

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it is necessary.  As the Senator knows, An Chomhairle will be set up and in so far as there are certain activities which they feel require a proper apprenticeship scheme, they may designate these schemes.  Fish processing which the Senator has in mind is, to an extent, in its infancy in this country.  It may well be that apprenticeship schemes will become necessary for the different activities in that industry.  There is on board ship the necessity for training certain types of engineers&mdash;perhaps the type of training might be suitable only to fishing &mdash;and the Comhairle might have regard to designating that particular aspect of the fishing trade in general. Therefore, I do not think there is any necessity for him to postpone the consideration of the Bill in any way because the Comhairle will be set up with the necessary powers to designate what trade will be affected, if they feel it is necessary.</P>

Apart altogether from Parliamentary draftsmanship, as I said on the Second Stage, the chairman will occupy a position of some delicacy and he must have the absolute confidence of both sides. If at any stage it appears that he has lost the confidence of one or both sides, it would be necessary that he should hold office no longer.  I am not suggesting that if a period were actually mentioned in the Bill, he could not be removed before that, but having regard to the advice from the draftsman, in the circumstances it would be better not to put in any specific period.</P>

      <P>Senator Quinlan has raised the point I wanted to raise in connection with the chairman.  The Comhairle is to consist of a chairman and 13 ordinary members.  The chairman is to be known as the Director of Apprenticeship and to be a wholetime member of the Comhairle.  It seems to me, therefore, that he will be in a position analogous to that of the chief executive officer of a vocational educational committee except in this respect, that whereas the chief executive officer is merely the executive of the committee, in the case of the Comhairle here, he is also the chairman.</P>
      <P>It does not seem to me to be a good thing, from the point of view of functioning of the Comhairle, that the person who is its chief executive should, at the same time, be the person who has to hold the balance between both sides of the Comhairle and who, as the Minister has stated, as one of his qualifications must have the confidence of both sides.  I may be wrong in the way I see this Comhairle working, but it seems to me that certain proposals will have come up before the chairman in his executive capacity and naturally he will have formed a conclusion one way or the other in relation to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Say a district apprenticeship committee has certain rules coming up which the chairman does not think are the type of rules the Comhairle should approve of, and he forms the conclusion that the rules should be disallowed.  At that point it may well be that the workers' representatives on the Comhairle might think the rules first class, but it will fall upon the executive officer, who will be the chairman of the meeting, and whose function should be to hold an even balance and to conduct the discussion impartially, to point out the deficiencies, which in the eyes of one side, would be not deficiencies but merits. <Col N="1230" /> It seems to me to be extremely bad that the chairman is to be the executive officer.</P>
    <P>In relation to the Institute of Agriculture, there is a director who is the chief executive, but he is a different person from the chairman of the Institute.  That seems to me to be a much better arrangement.  I would ask the Minister, if he has any second thoughts on the matter as a result of what I have said, to reconsider this modified position so that administrative difficulties will not arise and the whole functioning of the Comhairle will not be impaired as a result of this arrangement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>On the same point, it has occurred to me also that everything hinges on the chairman's vote.  The balance is so delicate, with five employers' representatives and five trade union representatives, that in all cases the final vote and the ultimate decision will depend on the vote of the chairman.  The matter is so delicate that if the representatives of the educational bodies are not asked to vote in case it might impair their good relations with the other two sides&mdash;the reasons given on the Second Reading&mdash;or their power to advise on the educational side, surely that consideration applies with greater force to the chairman who will have to exercise all this tact?  Instead of putting the onus of deciding all things on the chairman, the vote could be given to the three educational members; if it were, there could be less grounds for either side accusing the chairman of acting without impartiality.</P>

      <P>Senator O'Quigley has a point which, at first sight, appears to be well taken but I should like to remind the Senator of Section 14:</P>
      <P>The Minister, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, may appoint such officers and servants as he thinks necessary to assist An Chomhairle in the performance of its functions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If, in practice, it would appear to be necessary to have an executive officer <Col N="1231" /> as a separate entity from the chairman of the Comhairle, there is within that section power to make that appointment.</P>
    <P>Secondly&mdash;and this is in answer to points made by Senator O'Quigley and Senator Quinlan&mdash;this measure is largely, almost entirely, an agreed measure, agreed between the joint committees set up to represent employers and employees.  They went through the Bill very minutely after the Second Reading in the Dáil and it was on the basis of their recommendations that any amendments were brought before the Dáil.  This section is one which received very close examination.  I take it therefore that they agreed also regarding the functions of the chairman, but they agreed particularly on the question whether or not the educational members should have the right to vote.  They agreed that only the employers' and the workers' representatives should have the right to vote because they were directly concerned in working out apprenticeship schemes. They thought however that the educational representatives' function should be limited to an advisory one except on certain occasions where an educational representative might find himself acting as chairman when he would have the casting vote, that is, in an apprenticeship committee as distinct from An Chomhairle.  I think it would be better to leave an agreed matter alone.</P>

      <P>I should like to make a remark here and there on the Committee Stage to let the Seanad see how these sections were arrived at from the point of view of the committee.  The significant feature of this is that in the case of employers, they merely nominate certain people to the Minister and make a panel from which he appoints, whereas the trade unions insist that their nominees should in fact <Col N="1233" /> be appointed.  In other words, they go straight on, with the assent of the Minister, but without any choice.  That is the same in the next section.</P>

Having made the appointment as outlined by Senator McGuire and conformed with subsections (2) and (3), it seems rather strange that according to subsection (7) the Minister may at the same time remove an ordinary member of the Comhairle from office.

      <P>It sets out:</P>
      <P>The Minister shall, after consultation with the Minister for Education, appoint three persons whom he considers to be representative of educational interests to be the educational members of An Chomhairle.</P>
      <P>Is it the Minister who will get a recommendation from the Minister for Education as to the three persons or is the Minister obliged to appoint the three persons whom the Minister for Education thinks should be appointed?

      <P>This wording follows the practice.  It requires only that the Minister must consult the Minister for Education before making the appointments. I think it is clear that the Minister for Industry and Commerce is the Minister who actually makes the appointments.  It is required by statute that he should have consultations with the Minister for Education and naturally he would have regard to the recommendations of the Minister for Education and perhaps, in effect, he would appoint the three members whom the Minister for Education recommends.  I think it is quite clear <Col N="1234" /> and the Senator will see ample precedent for the wording here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Somebody must have power to remove members from office, if they are not fulfilling their functions. It is hardly likely that the trade union group who would nominate a member would remove a person.  They may not be in a position to know whether he is adequately fulfilling his function.  The Minister would be in a position to know.  If he removes a trade union member from office, the trade union will have to nominate somebody in his place. Therefore, the Minister must have good reason for removing him if he is to depend on the cooperation of the trade unions to nominate a member in the place of a person who is removed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1235" /> In the case of the employers' representative, the employers would have to nominate a group of people from whom the Minister might select. In the case of removing an employers' representative, he must rely on the goodwill and cooperation of the employers in order to recommend somebody to replace the removed person.  Therefore, he will not, in effect, remove anybody lightly.  He can remove him only if he feels he is not fulfilling the function for which he was nominated.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would it not be well to insert a proviso that the Minister &ldquo;may with the consent of the nominated body&rdquo;?  Surely a removal should not be carried out without first acquainting the trade union or the employers' body that the member was not fulfilling his function and that the Minister proposed to remove him?  Otherwise, you would have a serious impasse.  You might find that the man who was removed was renominated by the organisation concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>On the contrary, I suggest that the impasse would be more likely to arise in the contrary position.  If the Minister found a member of the Comhairle not doing his job properly and if he wanted to remove him and failed to get the consent of the body which nominated him, there would be great difficulty. It would be a threat to the continued working of the Comhairle or the committee, as the case may be.  I think I need only repeat that it is hardly likely that the Minister will remove anybody lightly.  He will have to depend on the organisation which he represents to nominate his successor.  If he removes him lightly, it may be that the organisation might not nominate such a person.  The impasse is more likely to arise in the contrary case to the one which the Senator is putting forward.</P>

If an unfortunate Minister, whoever he might be, had to get the permission of the nominating body which sent the person there, if there was collusion, he would not be removed. You must vest in the Minister proper power to remove from office a person who is acting obstreperously or in an undesirable manner.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I want a little information. As we all know, some young people will have to emigrate.  It is very desirable that when emigrating, they should have some training.  One of the best forms of training young men and women leaving Ireland could have is apprenticeship to some trade. If the Comhairle restricts the number of entrants to a trade, then, when the Irish emigrate, they will still be hewers of wood and drawers of water. They would do honour to themselves and their country if most of them leaving Ireland had a trade rather than <Col N="1239" /> that they should go just as casual labourers or other sorts of workers. I hope a liberal interpretation will be given by the Comhairle to this section.</P>
      <P>If there is a surplus of trained people, some will emigrate.  They may emigrate only for a while.  If they work in other countries and come back again as craftsmen, they are bringing back their experience and some of the craft of other countries.  They would be better tradesmen and better craft-workers on coming back to Ireland because they would have seen and benefited by the techniques, in other countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DominickMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>The idea is to train apprentices for trades in this country and not simply to train a surplus of apprentices which would in fact depress the labour market in the particular trade.  It is quite all right to talk about sending people out of the country better equipped than they would otherwise be, but that is a matter for education, perhaps in vocational schools, rather than one governing the recruitment and training of apprentices in a trade, as envisaged in this Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in agreement with Senator Burke.  Why should we condemn our people to be hewers of wood and drawers of water?  A limiting effect on the number of apprenticeships below the practical figure there can be within the trade here is bad.  One of the great flaws in trade unionism in this and in every country is that once a fellow is in and has a card, he does not give a hoot about the fellow outside who has not one.  I suppose that remark will draw an attack on me.  I believe that that is the trouble.  I find the same thing in relation to people in corporation and county council houses.  Once they are inside, then, in relation to rent, and so on, they do not care about the unfortunate fellow outside.  A limiting factor like that is bad.  If we can train more apprentices, then, even if they have to emigrate, as Senator Burke wisely said, there is always the chance they may come back later.  A limiting factor is bad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to endorse <Col N="1240" /> what Senator Burke has said. I think it is possible to combine the two points of view.  Our governing factor should not be the limiting of our facilities for training apprentices, even if some must emigrate.  I appreciate Senator Murphy's concern about the depressing effect a surplus number of trained persons would have on the market.  You might even go so far to meet that viewpoint as to designate a certain number of apprentices to work at home.  The others would get the training and qualify in the examinations but it would be made clear to them that they are not qualified to enter the home labour market.  At least they would know what they were doing.  They would get a training to equip them to do something better than they would normally do when they emigrate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>There is too much apprehension on the part of Labour in respect of this matter.  Senator Murphy said they might get training in the vocational school.  A boy who goes to Britain or America and receives training in a vocational school there and then comes back here will not be admitted to the trade union unless he has gone through the type of apprenticeship which is now recognised by the trade unions.</P>
      <P>With regard to a surplus of skilled persons and educated people, just take the medical profession as an example.  We train more doctors each year than we need.  When they go to Britain they get experience. They are the men appointed by the Local Appointments Commissioners to the jobs of county physicians, county surgeons, and all the other important medical posts, because of their experience abroad.</P>

      <P>The I.M.A. give permission so that more doctors are trained than are immediately required for our home needs.  That is the point.  When those who emigrate return, we receive the benefit of their experience abroad.  If our tradesmen <Col N="1241" /> have to work in New York or Melbourne or London and come back after maybe years of improvement and experience, do they not bring something with them to our economy? Is that not more education?  Do they not bring new ideas and new help to the craft?  Do they not add lustre to their vocation and their craft?  I think they do.  The Minister would be well-advised&mdash;I am sure he has powers under the Act and so has this Comhairle&mdash;to see that this will be interpreted wisely and to the benefit of Ireland.  In relation to many things in this connection here in Ireland there is, I might say, for the want of a better phrase, an intellectual restriction.</P>

      <P>The effect of this Bill is to rationalise that position and under this Bill apprenticeship will be directed in such a way&mdash;I am sure we can rely on the people who will be directing this Act to see that a reasonable number of apprentices will be allowed into the different trades&mdash;as to have regard to the justified apprehensions of the trade unions in the matter.</P>

      <P>The terms and conditions of the employment of tradesmen are rather different from those of doctors, engineers and members of the professions who, with age, acquire more qualifications, and are more sought after.  Unfortunately, the position of tradesmen is that once they get on a bit and become a little slow, they tend to be dropped for younger men. If we are to have a situation in which many of them are surplus, definitely the trade unions may fear the position that the older people will be unable to secure employment.  That is the experience at present.  Carpenters, as <Col N="1242" /> they grow older, are not employed. They have longer periods of disemployment and eventually have to emigrate to England.  That is the tendency but young doctors who leave the country come back with more experience, and better qualified.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the section which enables An Chomhairle to declare a trade to be a designated trade in any area in the State and the area may then be divided up.  They may decide that the area forms one apprenticeship district or they may divide it into several apprenticeship districts and constitute several apprenticeship committees for each of those districts.  It specifies the powers which An Chomhairle has in relation to the constitution of those committees.  I want to refer to subparagraph (i) of subsection (3) which provides:</P>
      <P>that a member shall be disqualified from holding office and shall cease to hold office if he is adjudged bankrupt or makes a composition or arrangement with creditors, or is sentenced by a court of competent jurisdiction to suffer imprisonment or penal servitude or ceases to be ordinarily resident in the State,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wonder whether if you have, say, in some cases three apprenticeship committees in a district&mdash;supposing you had an apprenticeship district embracing Connemara, Donegal and Limerick&mdash; and you had a member of an apprenticeship district committee serving on the committee for that area, if he happens to be a trade union member or a business man and has to travel from that area to the district of Wexford <Col N="1243" /> or Kerry, he &ldquo;ceases to be ordinarily resident in the State&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that if that man were resident down in Kerry, he would know very little of what was going on in Donegal or Sligo.  I think if a member of a district apprenticeship committee ceases to be resident within the district, he should be dropped and an equally good man found to replace him.  An Chomhairle should have power to make that provision rather than say &ldquo;ceases to be ordinarily resident in the State&rdquo;. I think that would be desirable.</P>
    <P>As I read the Bill, it seems fairly clear from Section 21 that An Chomhairle may revoke or amend orders made under that section.  Could the Minister say if an apprenticeship district committee wishes to change the rules in relation to a particular trade in its district, it has, under the Bill, the power to revoke, alter or amend rules? It does not seem to me that it is given that specific power and if it is not&mdash; and it may be very necessary for it to have that power to amend, revoke or alter&mdash;it should be given to it.  Would the Minister say if provision was made in that regard apart from subparagraphs (s) and (r) which do not seem to give specific power to amend rules?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>On Senator O'Quigley's first point, I do not think we can be as restrictive as he suggests, so far as the residence qualification is concerned.  If a member happens to leave a district, he may be a particularly valuable member and perhaps the committee would not want to lose him.  I do not think because he moves from Kerry to Meath or from Wexford to Galway that he should <i>ipso facto</i> cease to be a member, but if the committee decides, he should be removed, or rather, if it is decided that he should be removed, An Chomhairle have the power to remove a member.  If they feel that the residence outside the district for which committee he is a member is such disqualification, or such deterrent, to his performing adequately his functions, then An Chomhairle have power to remove him from office.  The committee has the power to amend its rules.  There is no question about that.</P>

      <P>There is another point I want to refer to on this section. The apprenticeship committees probably are a great deal more important than An Chomhairle in practice, and provision is made in a later section of the Bill for the keeping of registers by the district apprenticeship committees. There is no power invested in those committees to hold property and presumably they have office accommodation. I wonder whether it is necessary or whether some facility will be provided by An Chomhairle on behalf of the district committees because it is perfectly clear from the other section that there must be a special headquarters readily available to people who want to consult with the committee or who are entitled to inspect the register which will be kept by the committee in its district.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>I must confess that I find sub-section (3) quite extraordinary. This is the section which permits the apprenticeship committee to modify arrangements in regard to a particular apprentice with his consent, if he is over 18, but if he is not over 18, then &ldquo;in relation to a person... who has not attained the age of 18 years, means the individual having the legal custody of the person.&rdquo;  It then goes on to define what is meant by a parent and it is the most peculiar definition of parent I have ever seen.</P>
      <P>Sub-section (3) says: &ldquo;In subsection (2) of this section &lsquo;parent&rsquo; in relation to a person employed by way of apprenticeship who has not attained the age of 18 years, means the individual having the legal custody of the person.&rdquo;  I do not understand what is meant by &ldquo;the individual having the legal custody of the person.&rdquo; Indeed, I consulted a colleague more learned than myself today as to what was meant by that phrase but he could not tell me what, in this particular context, is meant by &ldquo;the legal custody.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The subsection continues&mdash;&ldquo;and where, owing to the absence of the individual&rdquo;&mdash;and it does not explain &ldquo;absence&rdquo; or whether it is outside the State or not.  If an apprentice's father is living in England and the lad is working in Dublin, who has the legal custody?  Does &ldquo;absence&rdquo; mean in this context absence from the State or merely absence relative to the father or the parent?  Certainly there is no definition of the word.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The subsection continues &ldquo;or for any other reason, the person is not living with or in the actual custody of that individual, includes the individual with whom the person is <Col N="1246" /> living or in whose actual custody the person is.&rdquo;  Well, it may well be that the legal custody would be with one person and the actual custody, of say a child of 14 or 15, might be with an aunt or uncle, or some such person. It seems to be quite improper that the rights of the parent in relation to the child should appear to be minimised or derogated in this section by saying the aunt, who has the actual custody, is entitled to decide what is to happen in relation to the apprentice. The subsection astounds me as a piece of legislation having regard to parents' rights to mind their children.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>This section provides that an apprenticeship committee  <Col N="1247" /> can determine the number of persons to be taken into a particular employment by way of apprenticeship in a trade in a particular area where the committee is of the opinion that insufficient have been taken in by way of apprenticeship, and where it is satisfied that a person who carries on a trade in a district has facilities for training people by way of apprenticeship and is, without reasonable cause failing to take persons into his employment by way of apprenticeship, they can serve notice on that person and require him to take a certain number of people into apprenticeship. That, of course, when you take the view that everything should be regulated nicely and neatly is a perfectly logical section but I submit that this kind of section is a gross invasion of the rights of the individual and I very much doubt its propriety.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is such a thing as freedom of action and people, in accordance with that freedom, frequently do things which are not in the public interest and which are not socially desirable, but they still have under our system of government, and our democratic Constitution, the right to exercise these rights which they have, in a way which may not conform with the social concepts of different sections of the community.  The fact is that they have got them and to my mind, while I am in entire agreement with the idea of regulating apprenticeship, fixing standards of wages and qualifications, granting diplomas and indeed in general raising the life of the people in trades, we must never forget that once we begin making invasions of the people's rights in one direction, we shall then come along and in another direction make a further invasion.  We shall have Ministers getting up and saying that this is common form; that we have something analogous to it in previous legislation.  In time we shall find that respect for the individual ceases and becomes a thing of the past.  I do not see how it can be enacted by the Oireachtas that an apprenticeship committee, which is not responsible to Parliament and not subject to review <Col N="1248" /> by the courts, can oblige, under a penalty, an individual of this State to do something which at the present time he is not obliged to do, and which I think, under the Constitution he cannot be obliged to do.</P>
    <P>If a man has facilities for training apprentices and he is not taking on apprentices for good or bad reasons, whether he is acting socially or unsocially, as long as he is within the criminal laws, I do not see how he can be compelled.  An apprenticeship committee can act with no supervision by Parliament, not even to the extent of placing regulations on the Table of the House so that they can be kept for 21 days&mdash;not even that nominal safeguard. It cannot be right to require persons in these circumstances to carry out such regulations.</P>
    <P>This is a most serious invasion of the rights of individuals and certainly I am opposed to this provision.  Mark you this: it would be different if there were some recourse to the courts, if the apprenticeship committee could say: &ldquo;Under these rules a certain man is obliged to do something&rdquo; and then get a court order.  The courts are there to preserve the rights of the individual, to preserve the rights of man and man, man and the State, man and local government, man and the apprentice.</P>

It may be &ldquo;socially undesirable&rdquo; but this is giving a very undesirable, a very anti-social, power to the committee and mark you, it is not even subject to review by An Chomhairle or any other body.

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGuire</NameTxt>
      <P>The only explanation which could, I think, be given as to why this was agreed to by the committee is that it is a corollary to the insistence that the trade unions on their part should not interfere with the number of apprentices agreed to by An Chomhairle.  In other words, it is only reasonable that employers, unless they can give a reasonable excuse, should accept them.  It is a <i>quid pro quo.</i></P>

      <P>The words in subparagraph (b) should allay any fears entertained by Senator O'Quigley or Senator Quinlan.  It states that:</P>
      <P>a person who carries on the trade in the district has the facilities for training persons by way of apprenticeship in the trade and in the district and is, without reasonable cause, failing to take persons into his employment</P>
      <P>is guilty of an offence.  He then has recourse to the courts to establish whether he is acting with reasonable cause.  That brings him to the points made by Senators O'Quigley and Quinlan that an obligation might be placed on him.  If he can establish to the court that he has good and sufficient cause which the court considers reasonable, the court will not place an obligation on him by imposing a penalty.  If a penalty is not imposed it is proof that the court considers he has given reasonable cause and he need not take an apprentice.  The safeguards are there already.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOQuigley" hpid="Mr. O'Quigley Mr. O'Quigley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>I thoroughly and completely disagree.  &ldquo;Reasonable cause&rdquo; is what to the committee appears reasonable.  If it appears to the committee that a person is without reasonable cause, they may by notice require him to take into his employment a specified number of persons. I would refer to subsection (7) of Section 62:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where a person upon whom a notice under <i>subsection</i> (2) of section 38 or <i>subsection</i> (2) of <i>section</i> 58 of this Act is served fails or <Col N="1250" /> neglects to comply with the requirements of the notice, he shall be guilty of an offence.</P>
    <P>The requirements of the notice are merely &ldquo;You shall take in three apprentices.&rdquo;  That is all the apprenticeship committee has to establish. &ldquo;We served notice under Section 38 of the Act requiring Mr. X. to take three apprentices into his employment. He has failed to do so and therefore he shall be guilty of an offence.&rdquo;  The question of the reasonableness of his refusal or whether he has the proper facilities is not within the jurisdiction of the court.  They cannot be entertained by the court at all.  The committee says the notice was served and once it is proved that it was served, the person is guilty of an offence.  I think that is most outrageous.</P>
    <P>May I add that the fact that this is the product of two parties does not affect these facts?  It is a question of the rights of people who are not members of the Federated Union of Employers. This section can apply to a garage owner in Achill who may have facilities but may not want to take the trouble of retaining apprentices to deal with tourists who come with their cars.  He may have facilities and because he has &ldquo;no reasonable cause&rdquo; he is brought before the district court in Achill and fined £20 for doing what he considered best.  I am taking a purely hypothetical case.  I think this provision is outrageous.</P>

      <P>In the Dáil, Deputy Cosgrave made a point on Section 4 as to whether or not the Commission could hold an inquiry into matters such as container traffic.  As reported at column 965 of the Official Report of 11th November, 1959, the Minister replied: &ldquo;As the Deputy will see, the section as it reads applies to the use of &lsquo;particular materials or particular methods for manufacturing or construction purposes&rsquo;.&rdquo;  That is quite correct.  On Section 2 (2), if the supply and distribution of goods are taken into account, I wonder whether or not it is possible for the Minister to have an inquiry instituted into (1) the container traffic mentioned by Deputy Cosgrave in the Dáil and (2) into the position of the dockers who are paid to travel with cattle but who do not travel?  The importance of this I would point out by quoting Paragraph 75 of the Report on the Export of Livestock and Meat by the Advisory Committee on the Marketing of Agricultural Produce, which states:</P>
      <P>The German importers were extremely critical of the practice whereby shipping companies engaged in the shipping of cattle from Dublin to Germany are required to pay men at Dublin Port for attending to the cattle on the sea journey to Germany although in fact the men never travel on the boats with the cattle.  The payments to these men who perform no services represent about 12/6d. or 15/- per beast and they are, of course, reflected in the freight rates and so in the prices paid here for the cattle.</P>
      <P>I submit that in that instance there is a restrictive trade practice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wonder whether, even though the Minister assured Deputy Cosgrave it <Col N="1255" /> could not be taken into account on Section 4, that matter could be taken into account on subsection (2) of this section.  Deputy Cosgrave mentioned container traffic.  I know something about the importation of machinery from Britain.  I imported some myself two years ago.  The manufacturers of this machinery positively refuse to allow it to be sent here except in containers, because similar machinery sent here some time previously had been dropped at the quayside and was irreparably damaged. Very wisely, they insisted that these goods would remain in containers from the time they left their premises until they reached the premises of the purchaser.</P>
    <P>The eventual outcome of all this was that because this machinery, within the container, weighed seven tons, it had to go, not to any Louth port, which would have been most convenient and most economical, but to Rosslare.  Lorries had to be sent to Rosslare.  The machinery had to be loaded on those lorries in Rosslare and brought up to county Louth by road.  Those are two obvious restrictive trade practices which, if they cannot be met under the section, I suggest can be met under the Bill.  I should like to hear what the Minister thinks about container traffic and dry land dockers, as I think they are termed.</P>

      <P>The section means what it says.  As I said in the Dáil in reply to Deputy Cosgrave, it relates to an operation such as the refusal at one time of carpenters to handle steel windows.  That does not apply now.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is referring to Section 4.  I am accepting his explanation to Deputy Cosgrave. I asked if the two very restrictive trade practices&mdash;he mentioned one and I mentioned the other&mdash;could possibly be dealt with under subsection (2) of this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer is no.  It is not intended that it should, either.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that the words &ldquo;supply or distribution of the goods concerned&rdquo;<Col N="1256" /> should take in those restrictive trade practices, even though in one case they happen outside the country or only for a moment as the boat leaves with cattle on it?  In the other case, goods going out of the country or coming into the country have to go through a particular port of exit or entry because container traffic will not be handled at other ports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the original Act, Section 7, in particular, the Commission is not empowered to inquire into such a matter as container traffic.  The purpose of this section is to permit the Commission to inquire into a particular aspect of trade in order to avoid the necessity of embracing the entire activities within that trade.  If they find something ought to be inquired into, one particular aspect, this enables them to obviate the necessity to take into account the entire activities of that trade.  It does not purport to extend the definition of the original section to cover activities such as container traffic.  The question of container traffic is actually being investigated at the moment.  It is not the intention that this Bill should have anything to do with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not think this Bill should provide the power so that in future it can see to it that investigations are carried out? Would he not agree that it is a flaw in the Bill not to have that power?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I raised this matter on the Second Stage also.  One of the greatest restrictive trade practices and one of the greatest impediments to the growth of our economy is the fact that container traffic is not allowed to be handled.  Will the Minister give an assurance that the matter will be dealt with quickly if it cannot be dealt with on this measure which deals with restrictive practices?  We have to compete against a subsidised agricultural economy in Britain.  We ought to be able to have the most efficient system of transporting our goods the ingenuity of man can devise so that we can use the best and most modern methods of conveying our goods.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister and the <Col N="1257" /> Government deliberately seem to be determined not to take the power here to investigate container traffic and dry land dockers.  I feel that a moral responsibility devolves on them at least to take that power so that investigations under this Bill can be carried out in the future, even if it is not the intention of the Government to do anything now, and so that they can investigate at least these two very restrictive trade practices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The refusal to handle container traffic by the dockers comes within trade union practice.  It is not the intention that activities of trade unions should be investigated by the Fair Trade Commission.  I want to assure the Seanad that I am very well aware that the refusal of dockers, particularly in Dublin Port, to handle container traffic has a serious effect on our economy.  I think the Seanad and everybody know that the matter is under very active consideration, that the employers and the workers concerned are in negotiation on it.  It is my desire to see a speedy conclusion to these negotiations.  I hope this can be arranged.  These matters are very delicate.  It is very difficult for a Minister who might know what stage is being reached, or about to be reached, or what stage it is hoped will be reached, to mention it in public.  I want to assure the Senator that that is receiving the close consideration of the members of the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>These matters are under active consideration by the unions.  I know that the Minister's finesse and his whole make-up is such that he would not say anything that would prejudice such negotiations.  If the restrictive trade practices of businessmen and trade unions are not investigated&mdash;and they are a most necessary facet of this Bill&mdash;the Bill is a completely milk and water Bill.  If the Bill does not give power to investigate the restrictive trade practices of the trade unions, it is, as I say, a milk and water Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCarter" hpid="Mr. Carter Mr. Carter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carter</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister is <Col N="1258" /> quite right.  After all, he is considering the matter and it is not merely a matter for him alone but for the whole Government.  It is a very big question which involves not merely the trade unions but the shipping companies as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want restrictive trade practices to be operated by anyone in the community.  There should be the same law for the workers as for the employers.  It seems to be commonsense that if we are to get anywhere in the business sense and market our produce properly, we cannot have our costs of working so high that no one can afford to live.  We should do it in the right way.  I should like an assurance from the Minister that he will introduce a Restrictive Practices Bill in this regard as he has told us it is intended to introduce a comprehensive Rents Bill.  We have got no assurance that this matter is to be dealt with.  I am told that during the past 12 months restrictive trade practices added £12 to the cost of every motor car. With regard to the export of turkeys, the National Farmers' Association wanted to be allowed to send turkeys out in containers to avoid their being mishandled by others.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I think we ought to be realistic about what this Bill hopes to achieve.  If the Fair Trade Commission investigates a set of circumstances and recommends the making of an Order, the Minister may make an Order affecting the supply and distribution of goods.  If he makes an Order requiring the trade unions to act in a certain way, we must examine the question to see to what extent the Minister's Order can be made effective. It is all very fine to suggest here that the Minister ought to take certain powers but a Minister can take only powers he knows he can exercise.  If he takes powers that might paralyse the country, he might be doing far worse than if he left matters as they were.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fact is that these matters are not being left as they are.  The matter in question should be resolved and can only be resolved to complete satisfaction by negotiations between those concerned, the shipping companies and the dockers employed on the quays. <Col N="1259" /> Unless it can be resolved in that way, I do not see any other way by which it can be overcome, with any reasonable hope of making the solution effective. Negotiations are proceeding and it is hoped that they will be brought to a conclusion at an early date.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Minister's hopes in that regard will come true. Let us pre-suppose they do not.  These restrictive trade practices are costing farmers 15/- a head on their cattle exports and there is this trouble about turkeys in containers.</P>
      <P>If the Fair Trade Commission investigated the matter and produced a report, it would be accepted by the majority of the Irish people.  That would expose the situation and show the rights and the wrongs of it.  Is the Minister aware that two of these dry land dockers were in a public house not long ago and when they heard on the weather forecast that there was fog somewhere out over the sea, they said: &ldquo;Give us two more half-ones; we are on overtime&rdquo;?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said it would not be practicable to enforce a section such as Senator Donegan and I suggest but it is a pity that it is practicable to enforce a section with regard to the employers.  If the people charged with the responsibility feel that they can enforce a section with regard to only one group of the community, would it not be fair to say: &ldquo;We shall not bring in any legislation to force employers to do anything because we have not the power to force the employees to comply with the law with regard to restrictive practices&rdquo;? It is very unfair to employers if they say they cannot enforce the law on employees.  It is very unfair to limit the restrictive trade practices to one group because they cannot limit them in respect of every citizen.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is usual to discuss what is in a Bill and we are now discussing what is not in this Bill.  I do not think Senator Donegan and Senator Burke know the whole situation.  I was reluctant to interfere.  This matter is under investigation at the moment and I think it is the desire of the <Col N="1260" /> trade union movement generally that an equitable solution should be arrived at.  It is not so easy as Senator Burke seems to imagine.  If he knew a little more, he would know that the introduction of container traffic in Dublin would suit some firms and would not suit others, and that is probably the underlying difficulty which has complicated the issue.  I hope a solution will be found in the course of these discussions.</P>

      <P>This is the section which provides that where a grant is made by the company for the training of workers for any commercial or industrial enterprise, the amount of the grant shall not exceed the actual amount of wages paid to such workers during the period of their training, together with, in the case of workers trained outside the State, the amount of their travelling and subsistence expenses.  It occurs to me that in this context &ldquo;wages&rdquo; has a particular connotation.  It generally applies to employees of a particular class.  It may be that not alone workers in what we call the factory class, but technicians in the salary class, would require to be trained in new techniques and that it is intended that such people on salaries would also be so entitled, and the company could make grants for the payment of their training, whether inside or outside <Col N="1261" /> the State.  I wonder if I am right in that, that these grants are intended to be applicable to technicians and salaried workers as well as wage-earning classes?  If I am, it seems a pity that &ldquo;wages&rdquo; is not extended to include salaries.</P>
