      <P>The business to be taken is Item No. 1, Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1958.  I wonder could we get an indication as to the possibility of terminating the debate this evening?  I should like to suggest that the Taoiseach be allowed to get in to conclude not later than 5 p.m. if that would be agreeable to the House.</P>

      <P>I should be very glad, indeed, to co-operate in that regard, so that if at all possible, the Taoiseach should get in not later than 5 o'clock.  I do not know how long the Taoiseach will require but I should agree with his getting in at that hour.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickFirmullaghOReilly" hpid="Mr. O'Reilly Mr. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to draw the attention of the Chair to a statement I made last night in which I referred to a long quotation by Senator O'Donovan which I incorrectly attributed to Professor Hogan.  Because <Col N="836" /> of the nature of the quotation, it would not be fair to Professor Hogan that it should go on record that it was a quotation from a work of his.  On getting time to consider the matter, I found that the quotation was from a work of Mr. Cruise O'Brien.  When dealing with that matter, I stated that it hardly related to the measure before the House and I was inclined to argue that the quotation was just a further attempt to misrepresent the leadership of Charles Stewart Parnell, since it dealt with the conduct of the Irish Party.  It proposed, in effect, to establish the position that the running of that Party was really a sort of dictatorship, that the members of the Party did not seem to have any voice. I felt that it was a continuation of the campaign that has been carried on down the years in the hope of reducing the stature of Parnell.  I argued that, in spite of all that misrepresentation, the stature of Parnell had grown in the minds and hearts of the Irish people and will continue to grow and that no effort by those who carried on that campaign will prevent that growth.</P>
      <P>It was rather a sore point with me. I have personal reasons for dealing with this matter because a member of my family suffered misrepresentation in that movement.  That is why I felt disposed to deal with it.  I make this correction so as to ensure that it will go on record that it was not from a book by Professor Hogan but from a work by Mr. Cruise O'Brien that the quotation was taken.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickFirmullaghOReilly" hpid="Mr. O'Reilly Mr. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the book I am dealing with, not the political outlook of the father of the writer.  That is a separate matter having nothing to do with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was arguing last night that the fears expressed by members of the Opposition in regard to this measure are founded on the weaknesses that exist within their respective Parties. I tried to prove and I believe successfully that certain Parties, because of their actions, would fare badly and will continue to fare badly under any <Col N="837" /> known system of free elections.  I specifically referred to the Labour Party.  I tried to show that at the last general election a terrific shift of votes took place.  I tried to show that while some Parties lost on the roundabouts they made up for it on the swings but that the people who lost on the roundabouts and who did not make up for it on the swings are the Labour Party.  I dealt fairly fully with all that. I argued that until there is a Labour Party with a national outlook and firmly based on the working men and women of this country the Party will not make progress within this country. I believe there is a necessity for that sort of Party.</P>
    <P>It is a pity the working people are represented by a Party such as the present Labour Party in this country. Until we have a Labour Party based on national traditions&mdash;as I said last night, in the Connolly tradition&mdash; Labour will not get the major support of members of trade unions and of unorganised workers.  So long as the Labour Party seem to be big business, the executives of trade unions seeming to be no different from company directors, I do not see much hope for the Labour Party in the matter of getting the support of the members of trade unions and of unorganised workers.  That is why Fine Gael gained so much at the last election from the Labour Party. Fianna Fáil also gained a large amount.  Unfortunately, a larger section, still, of people who would normally vote Labour did not vote at all and that is a tragedy.  It cannot be asserted that the system of election was responsible for that position. Under any system of free elections, that sort of thing would happen.</P>
    <P>I have commented on some of the speeches by Senators on the opposite side of the House.  I listened last evening to Senator Baxter.  He appeared to me to be lecturing this side of the House from a theological standpoint. He suggested there was no moral sanction for this Bill.  I do not want to go too deeply into this matter.  I myself might even correctly be labelled an amateur theologian and the same might also be said of some other <Col N="838" /> people in this House.  This is not a laughing matter.  It is a serious matter. I suggest that Senator Baxter spoke quite seriously and should be referred to quite seriously.</P>
    <P>I once heard a very eminent Churchman and very able theologian remark that while there may be laymen who are amateur Thomists it is a dangerous situation as a little learning is a very dangerous thing and amateur theologians have often been responsible for quite dangerous controversies.  He even said that that sort of thing sometimes starts new religions.  However, I realise that it was not in that sense that Senator Baxter saw fit to give us what appeared to me to be a lecture in theology.  I hope he will not take my remarks badly because they are not intended to be offensive.</P>
    <P>So many points have been raised in this debate that it would be impossible to deal with all of them.  I would not even try to refer to all the arguments and statements that have been made. Some of the speeches from the opposite side of the House have been unduly long.  Some of them were quite good and contained good points but the speeches were too long.  Reading through the debate, one has to wade through so much material in order to get at the points&mdash;some, possibly, good points&mdash;that the value of the speeches is destroyed through their being too long.  Many of the speeches would have been much more effective if they had been briefer and more to the point.</P>
    <P>Some people argue that this measure is a deliberate effort to confuse the people.  It is suggested that the time the Government are devoting to this measure could be devoted to much better effect towards an effort to solve our rising emigration figures and our unemployment problem.  It is suggested that this measure is an effort to divert the minds of the public from our economic ills.  I have here a copy of the <i>National Observer</i> for February, 1959. I do not know whether or not I should suggest that this paper is an organ of Fine Gael thought.  Some people say it is but I cannot say definitely whether it is or not.  Be that as it may, an article appears in that paper under <Col N="839" /> the heading: &ldquo;Emigration Down.&rdquo;  It continues:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Significantly, one hopes, is the sharp decline in emigration which appears to have taken place last year.  While accurate figures of emigration are not available on a year to year basis, there are various indicators available and they point unmistakably in the same direction &mdash;downwards.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Members of this House get a weekly summary of the unemployment figures. They, too, show a downward trend. We must be thankful that they do not reach the unfortunate high level which the unemployment figures reached in the latter months of office of the last Coalition Government.  We must be thankful for that because rising figures of emigration and unemployment are no credit to the country no matter what Government may be in office.  It is a pity that tragic figures of emigration and unemployment should be bandied about in our Parliament.  At times, one must wonder if we really want these figures and get an unholy delight in drawing attention to the unhappy plight of so many people in the hope of punishing our opposite numbers by drawing attention to the size of the figures.  That would indeed be an unfortunate position.  It is wrong, I think, to argue now that emigration is increasing and that the unemployment figures are rising.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is any foundation whatever for the argument advanced by some people that this measure is a diversion to distract public attention from matters like emigration and unemployment.  Another argument which was advanced was that there is no demand for this measure.  It appears to me that the people who use that argument know quite well that that is not so.  So far as we are organised politically, it cannot be denied that the Fianna Fáil organisation is the biggest political organisation in the country.  It has more supporters than any other single Party at the moment, or any combination of Parties, including Independents. Despite what members of the Opposition might like to say, the Fianna Fáil <Col N="840" /> organisation is a free organisation and people in it can be outspoken, so outspoken in fact, that it is often quite possible for members of the Opposition to quote members of Fianna Fáil, in something which they think would be damaging.  It has even been done in this debate; Senator L'Estrange so quoted.  Members of Fianna Fáil are quite free to make statements from their own particular viewpoints and the organisation enjoys absolute freedom in this regard.  Members of Fianna Fáil spoke at the Árd Fheis and indicated to the Government that in the view of Fianna Fáil it would be a good thing to have the system of election changed.</P>
    <P>As I say, the Opposition oppose that, not because of the merits or demerits of the proposal, but because, as I said last night, they have taken the wrong stand on national issues so often and they continue to do so because they are living true to form; people who take a wrong stand on an issue are compelled because of public witness to continue to do so.  One would think that Fine Gael or Cumann na nGaedheal never thought of changing this system of P.R. because of the danger to stability and the danger to ordered government.  I have here a letter which was published in the <i>Irish Times</i> on 24th November, 1958, over the name Frank MacDermot, with an address at 1 Rue de Franqueville, Paris, November 19, 1958.  Frank MacDermot is the man I take to be a former vice-president of Fine Gael.  If I am wrong in that I stand to be corrected.</P>
    <P>In the course of this letter he says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Sir,&mdash;I have before me a printed summary of Fine Gael policy adopted and distributed in November, 1933, shortly after the foundation of the Party.  One item therein reads thus:&mdash;</P>
    <P>and this is a quotation in the letter from the policy of Fine Gael.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The abolition of the present P.R. system so as to secure more effective democratic control of national policy and to establish closer personal relationship between parliamentary representatives and <Col N="841" /> their constituents.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He then goes on to deal with another matter.  I am prepared to argue that when Frank MacDermot wrote that letter and quoted the policy programme of Fine Gael as it was when he was a vice-president that&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1943" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a good while ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFirmullaghOReilly" hpid="Mr. O'Reilly Mr. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>That proves that Fine Gael did entertain, in their serious moments, this question and went as far as preparing to put it as a policy plan in their programme.  Fine Gael was not then in government and there was little that they could do about it.  I suppose they decided not to go any further with it, since they did not have the responsibility, but it does prove that Fine Gael did decide to change the system of election for the very obvious reasons we are now arguing it should be changed.</P>
      <P>In view of that, it is hard to understand the arguments against this measure and particularly hard to understand the suggestion that there is no moral sanction for it.  If Fine Gael had introduced this measure, it would hardly be argued by the same people that there was no moral sanction for this measure.  It is a pity that we do not take a more objective approach when dealing with a measure like this in this House.  I do agree that the members of the Opposition, from their point of view, could make a good case for an alternative to the present system, could suggest an alternative system and let the majority decide. That, in my view, is the line that a sensible and practical Opposition should take, but they did not take it. One other point of which I thought I should comment was in regard to Senator Stanford.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Carton</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickFirmullaghOReilly" hpid="Mr. O'Reilly Mr. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>I was quoting from a letter&mdash;I made that clear&mdash;published in the <i>Irish Times.</i>  Senator Stanford appeared to me to base his speech on the fact that he would like to see the emphasis on Parliament and people rather than on Party and Government. I realise, and I readily agree, that in issues concerning the private individual Senator Stanford has always been quite ready in this House to take a stand for the individual against the State but I suggest to him that there is a limit to which one can go in that direction.</P>
      <P>I suggest that if you put individual liberty on so high a pedestal the statue is out of proportion to its surroundings. If it is too high it will not be possible to see the statue of human liberty.  So that while I agree the Senator may have always taken that line in the House, in this matter I am prepared to argue that the State also has its responsibilities.  It has been said by that great administrator Thomas Drummond that property has its duties as well as its rights; it could equally well be said that the State has rights as well as responsibilities and if the State does not ensure that the foundations on which its institutions are built are sound, democracy as we know it could topple.</P>
      <P>I am sure the Senator will readily agree that other democracies from the dawn of history, even from the time of ancient Greece down to the present day, have collapsed because the foundations of the institutions of the State were not sound.  That is the argument. I hope we have learned the lesson of history in that regard.  That is the principal argument in favour of the Bill. The State has a duty to ensure that its own institutions are solidly founded so that they can stand the shocks and blasts that may lie ahead.  If they do not, the State as we know it could collapse, as many States in our time have collapsed, because of weaknesses in the structure of the institutions of the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Quinlan went to some length trying to prove&mdash;of course unsuccessfully&mdash;that it was not P.R. that was <Col N="843" /> responsible for the collapse of democracy in Germany and the rise to power of Hitler.  I am prepared to say to Senator Stanford that there is a wide area between extreme liberty&mdash;which is licence&mdash;and extreme authority&mdash; which is tyranny.  In that area between the two extremes is what we call order or democracy.  I say to Senator Stanford we can overrate the idea of the rights of the individual in relation to the State and in doing that we could bring about a situation here similar to those which developed in the past in other countries.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamStanford" hpid="Professor Stanford Professor Stanford">
      <NameTxt>Professor Stanford</NameTxt>
      <P>May I remind the Senator that I am speaking on behalf of Parliament and people, not on behalf of individuals?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFirmullaghOReilly" hpid="Mr. O'Reilly Mr. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>I quite realise that and I do not wish in any way to misrepresent what Senator Stanford said, but I am putting this argument through the Chair to Senator Stanford.  I could quote at length from what has happened in France, but I shall simply say this in conclusion.  It has been suggested that the Fianna Fáil Party members are muzzled.  I can go so far as to say that when this matter was discussed by the members of the Fianna Fáil Party, I spoke on the issue and I am prepared again to state here what I said within the ranks of the Party.  I said I agreed with the abolition of P.R. because I take some interest in affairs in France and last May I listened to news bulletin after news bulletin to hear what was happening there.  I was convinced that the barricades would again go up in Paris and I did not wish to see that. I saw all the ingredients of civil war there and I am prepared to argue now that were it not for the great personality of Charles De Gaulle it would have happened.  I may be wrong in that, but that is my opinion and that was the one thing that convinced me of the dangers of an unstable electoral system of P.R.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I made that argument in the ranks of the Fianna Fáil Party and I am making it here again.  That convinced me of the necessity for the change. Suppose a similar situation arose here over the next ten or 15 or 20 years, <Col N="844" /> we have no guarantee that we will have a De Gaulle to take us out of our difficulties.  If we continue to retain P.R. and if our people seek representation on vocational lines&mdash; and there are tendencies in that direction&mdash;here is what could easily happen. We have heard talk about the North but this nation of ours is comprised of all minorities from a vocational point of view.  For instance, I am elected on the agricultural panel and is it not true that the interests of certain sections of the farming community are diametrically opposed?  I quite realise that the people who send milk to creameries and rear pigs have an interest in having barley prices as low as possible and people who grow grain want the highest possible prices for barley.  Is it not quite obvious if we are to develop organisations seeking political power on vocational lines you will have one farmers' Party representing milk and pig producers and another farmers' Party acting in the interests of the grain growers, and so on?</P>
    <P>The same thing applies to business and commercial life.  Suppose an organisation like R.G.D.A.T.A. decides to seek political representation here the position would be reached&mdash;and I argue that any majority from a vocational point of view is composed of minority groups&mdash;then under P.R. you would have a huge number of small Parties and stable government or government of any sort would become impossible. It is out of that sort of situation that dictators have sprung in other countries.  I suggest that ultimately either chaos or dictatorship would be the result here if that did happen.</P>
    <P>I could go on along these lines for quite a long time but I do not want to go any further into this question of a parallel to France.  It may be and it has been argued that they did not have P.R. in France but that is not so.  P.R. can be achieved in many ways and once you have a group of people with the right in a second ballot to transfer their vote to a second candidate&mdash;if that is not P.R.  I do not know what P.R. means.</P>
    <P>Behind the necessity for the change is the lesson we have learned in the <Col N="845" /> past.  Coalition Governments on the Continent have led to disaster and they led to minor disaster here.  We had two Coalitions and I am prepared to say that while the members of the Government concerned might mean well from their point of view, the fact remains that both Coalitions broke up not because they were defeated in Dáil Éireann but because of internal weaknesses.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1943" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>We had no civil war just the same.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFirmullaghOReilly" hpid="Mr. O'Reilly Mr. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>When matters of a serious or unpopular nature arose the Parties broke up.  That happened the first Coalition and the second Coalition Government.  It was the chief architect of the Coalition, Mr. MacBride, who was responsible for pulling the cornerstone out of the Coalition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I observe that there has been a coalition to-day between Senator Ó Maoláin and myself about the conclusion of this debate, and I am afraid the Senator is pulling the cornerstone from under that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFirmullaghOReilly" hpid="Mr. O'Reilly Mr. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not responsible for any coalition that may exist between the two Senators.  I can hardly credit that Senator Ó Maoláin and Senator Hayes would enter into a coalition.  If they did I imagine the matter in which they coalesced is not a very serious one.  In conclusion, I believe Coalition Governments are founded on bargaining and keep themselves in power by bargaining.  Coalition Governments leave office only when there is nothing left to bargain with.  That was the position when the last Coalition was in office.  The financial structure of this country was in such jeopardy that our county councils could not borrow money for housing.</P>

      <P>No county council is refused money from the Local Loans <Col N="846" /> Fund.  I do not like to remind the House of these things but that is the result of Coalition Governments.  Not only is it bad for the country but it is also bad for the Parties.  I believe that, with the one-Party system, with single member constituencies and the non-transferable vote, all our vocational minorities will seek representation in Parliament through one Party or another.  The result will be that we shall have reached the ideal position, the position that has made America strong: you will have one Party in Government and another Party as a responsible Opposition.  That in my view is the healthiest form of democracy, the form of democracy that has stood the stresses in other countries. I believe that Germany collapsed because of P.R. during the economic crisis of the '30s, whereas America, where the blizzard blew more fiercely than anywhere else, did not collapse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephRoddy" hpid="Mr. Roddy Mr. Roddy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roddy</NameTxt>
      <P>Seeing that Sligo has been very much in the news I felt I should intervene in this debate.  As has been said, Sligo was the first place that held an election under P.R.  It was the Sligo ratepayers who were responsible for the introduction of that system of election.</P>
      <P>This Bill has come as a bombshell to the people.  They never asked for it and were quite content to live under the Constitution in which P.R. was enshrined by the Taoiseach himself. That system safeguarded minorities and was the system responsible for putting him into power.  Were it not for that system of voting, his Party would have been a very small minority in Parliament.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reason the Taoiseach is seeking to change that system is obvious. P.R. worked well up to 1948, but at the 1948 general election the Taoiseach's Party was defeated and the inter-Party Government was formed.  That Government gave the people the greatest era of peace and prosperity they ever enjoyed since the foundation of the State.  There was a resurgence of the people and new hope was given to them after the policy of suppression of the Fianna Fáil Government in the preceding 17 years.  There was a revival of that prosperity again <Col N="847" /> under another inter-Party Government which was elected in 1954.  It is because of the good work of the inter-Party Government during those two periods that the Taoiseach has decided to change the system of election.</P>
    <P>If the Taoiseach succeeds in getting a majority to vote for this Bill, representation of minorities will be completely wiped out.  Fine Gael may win a few seats but their numbers will be so small that their voice will be ineffective as an Opposition in the Dáil.  Therefore, I appeal for the rejection of this Bill and I ask all sections of the community to preserve their God-given right to be represented in Parliament.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach has done some queer things over the years but this is the most dangerous move he has ever made since he first entered political life.  Clann na Talmhan and Labour will be denied representation although they played an important part in legislating for the welfare of this country. Labour at one time helped to put Fianna Fáil into office and to retain them there for a while.  It is disgraceful that an effort should now be made to eliminate such people from the national Parliament.</P>
    <P>I can put forward no better argument against the abolition of P.R. than to quote what the Tánaiste said at the Árd Fheis in the Mansion House in 1953 when it was suggested that P.R. should be scrapped and the British system introduced.  The Tánaiste, who may be the next Taoiseach, said that P.R. was a better system than that operating in England, that the system which operated in that country might well give a minority a very substantial majority in Parliament.  It had done so in Britain and could do so here under the system of the single member constituency and the non-transferable vote.  That was the Tánaiste's summing up on the question of P.R. and I think he should know best.  His long experience of administration must have shown him that P.R. gave fair representation and responsible government.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach has often reminded <Col N="848" /> the people about democracy.  What he meant was government of the people, for the people, by the people.  If this Bill goes through, Lincoln's definition of democracy will be slightly altered. It will mean government of the people, for the people, by Fianna Fáil&mdash;by a minority.</P>
    <P>As I have said, minorities have played their parts in the economy of this country.  Most countries of the world have a voting system which acknowledges the right of minorities to take their place in the Government. Russia is one very notable exception. All minorities there are completely eliminated.  I am afraid the Taoiseach is trying to follow suit in this Bill and trying to emulate the Kremlin.  In his effort to abolish P.R. he is attempting to bring the Kremlin to Dublin.  At the Fianna Fáil Árd Fheis last year, he wanted the delegates to take off their coats and help them to do it.</P>
    <P>I did not intend to speak for long on this Bill because it has been very well debated.  Last Sunday night, there was a debate on P.R. in the Temperance Hall in Sligo with three members from the Government side and three from the inter-Party side.  I was surprised at Senator Lenihan agreeing with an extract from a speech by Deputy MacEoin reported in the <i>Independent.</i>  He said it was quite possible to form an alternative Government to Fianna Fáil even under the single vote.  That was taken out of its context, and Senator Lenihan knows that perfectly well.</P>
    <P>It is regrettable that both Houses should be engaged debating this Bill to decide whether we shall have P.R. and representative government or the single vote and minority government. Both Houses would be far better employed debating the future of the country and trying to build up its economy.  Recently we read in the papers of the concern of other countries for their economic welfare.  We had the Russian Deputy Premier going to America seeking increased trade.  It was supposed to be merely a personal visit, but I am sure it had the support of the Kremlin.  Since then, we have had the Duke of Edinburgh going to India looking for increased trade, and <Col N="849" /> on the 20th of the month, the British Prime Minister, Mr. Macmillan, and his Secretary of State are going to Russia to discuss, among other things, increased trade there.</P>
    <P>This Bill is merely a smokescreen to blind the people and hide from them the real intention of the Taoiseach, that is, to perpetuate Fianna Fáil as the Government and to be able to control the destinies of the Party and the country from the Park.</P>

      <P>In this closing stage of the debate, I should like to make a brief personal statement. Under the present electoral system, I was elected to this House to represent the live-stock industry as a vocational member.  I have consistently acted as an independent member of this Chamber.  In view of the fact that this issue will ultimately go before the people for decision, irrespective of how this vote goes to-day, I feel, as an independent vocational member, that my correct attitude is to refrain from taking part in the vote, particularly since any vote I might give could be nothing but a partisan vote.</P>
      <P>There is no doubt that this question has become a burning hot political question in this House, which is often described as the vocational chamber. The people whom I have the honour to represent are composed of all shades of political opinion.  They nominated me to this House for a specific purpose.  I was not sent here to take part in Party politics.  I do not therefore consider that I have any authority to cast a partisan vote on such an important issue as this. Accordingly, briefly, it is my intention to abstain from voting.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened with great attention for five days now to the various Opposition speakers here and I have read some of the Opposition speeches in Dáil Éireann.  Having studied those criticisms, I came to the conclusion that although the speakers seemed to have different viewpoints, they had a few points in common. First of all, there was an insinuation behind all their statements that Fianna Fáil were taking advantage of the fact <Col N="850" /> that they were now a majority in Dáil Éireann and introducing a system of election which, the Opposition claimed, would keep Fianna Fáil in power indefinitely.</P>
      <P>Secondly, it was suggested here by various speakers that if this system of election is put into operation, the minority Parties will never get a representative in Dáil Éireann again.  In other words the Labour Party, Clann na Poblachta, the Farmers' Party, the National Progressive Democrats, Independents and so on, will be disfranchised. Indeed, I was rather amazed to hear some of the more mature members of this House suggest that people would have to resort to taking other steps and other means to obtain their rights.  I do not agree with that argument.  I do not agree that any of the insinuations made in these arguments is true.</P>
      <P>I listened to two members of the Labour Party here&mdash;Senator O'Quigley and Senator Murphy.  They took nearly a whole day impressing on the Government the reason for not going ahead with this Bill.  They pointed out that their Party would become completely disfranchised and that it would be a shame to do that.  They took us all over the world&mdash;to France, to Germany, to Italy, to Switzerland, to Africa, to the United States of America and so on.  They told us what had happened in these various countries under different forms of election.  I do not propose to follow them in their arguments in relation to any of these countries.  I know nothing about the system of election in any of them.  But I will take their minds back a few years to what happened in our own little country.</P>

      <P>I did not interrupt the Senator.  He can speak when I am finished, if he so desires.  I will take the members of the Labour Party back a few years to see if we can find a reason nearer home, as against the one they attribute to Fianna Fáil, why the system of election should be changed. First of all, let me say I have the <Col N="851" /> greatest respect for the Labour Party. I believe that workers, organised and unorganised, are entitled to representation in Dáil Éireann.  I should like to remind the Labour Party now that ten years ago, or even further back, the Labour Party was a strong political force with a strong representation in Dáil Éireann.  Why is it reduced to-day to the low figure at which we find it? I shall not go outside the country in which we stand at the moment: why is it we had only two representatives of Labour here a few years ago, and we have only one to-day?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is certainly not because we had single member constituencies or the straight vote.  That decline took place under P.R.  No matter what system is introduced, Labour could not be much worse off than they are.  They have lost one-third of their support in the City and County of Dublin within the last few years.  Remember, in Dublin City and County there is more organised labour than in all the rest of the country.</P>

      <P>That happened under P.R.  Could anything worse happen under any other system?  This proposed change in the system of election will make one important difference. In a number of elections over the past years we have had the experience of Fianna Fáil lined up on one side and all the other Parties lined up on the other side.  The minority Parties could go to the people upon any pretext, offer them any concessions.  Word then went round between the minority groups: &ldquo;No matter for whom you vote, do not vote Fianna Fáil; vote Labour, Fine Gael, Clann na Poblachta, Farmers, National Progressive Democrats, Monetary Reform, or what-have-you, but do not vote Fianna Fáil.&rdquo;  As a result of that type of <Col N="852" /> electioneering, we had a situation created in which the minority Parties' groups together formed a Government on two occasions.  In future, the Labour Party, the Farmers' Party, Fine Gael and all the rest of them will have to come out and honestly state their policy before the election.</P>

      <P>That is right.  Just imagine Fine Gael and Labour coalescing. The reason Labour was beaten, and badly beaten, in the last election was because they did coalesce with Fine Gael.  The people who voted Labour would never have voted Labour had they known that Labour would coalesce with Fine Gael after the earlier elections.  In the last election the people had learned their lesson; Labour was badly beaten.  The people who voted Labour and Clann na Poblachta never intended those Parties to become tail-wagging Parties for Fine Gael.  Clann na Poblachta contested the election in 1948.  I think they got &mdash;I cite this figure subject to correction&mdash;18 members returned to Dáil Éireann.</P>

      <P>What has happened to those representatives since?  The whole Party has been wiped out completely. If that happened under the system we are proposing to introduce, we would immediately be told to look at what happened under the system.  But that actually happened under P.R.  Even the Leader of the Labour Party failed to poll one-third of the votes.  These things have happened.  We do not need to study conditions in any other country to see what can happen.  Those who are prepared to learn by experience can see these things for themselves here at home.</P>
      <P>The proposed change will, at least, do one thing&mdash;it will make every Party stand on its own feet.  If it does that, it will do a good day's work for Clann na Poblachta and Labour.  I suggest to the Labour Party that they vote for this Bill because, as a result of it, they will be put back again on a firm foundation. I do not wish to delay the House, but I am convinced that no matter what system you have, if the election is free and fair, every Party and every candidate will have an equal chance.  In other words, what is good for the goose will be good for the gander. Irrespective of what the system is, the people will elect the Government they want.  There will be no compulsion on voters to vote one way or another.  The proposed system is an honest system.  Under it the electors will get the Government they want, whether it be Fine Gael, Labour, Fianna Fáil or anything else.  There will be disfranchisement of neither individual nor Party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Appeals have been made to the Taoiseach in this House and in the other House, to guard the rights of the people and of democracy.  Before I sit down, I should like to say that for the past few weeks, I have watched the Taoiseach sitting here, listening patiently to what Senators have had to say.  I appreciate his great interest in this debate and it is not necessary for anyone in this House to impress upon the Taoiseach the necessity to guard the rights of the people and the rights of democracy.  Twenty-one years ago, the Taoiseach introduced the new Constitution in hard and difficult <Col N="854" /> times.  It was subsequently enacted by the people&mdash;I admit not by a big majority.  We can look on that Constitution to-day as the greatest Christian document to be found in any country in the world.  It removed any obstacles which remained in the way of Irishmen expressing their views or being elected to Parliament and becoming the Government of the country.</P>
    <P>After a quarter of a century, practically 25 years, the Taoiseach has come here and asked for one amendment to that Constitution.  I submit he is doing that in order that the freedom-loving people of Ireland will have their democratic rights preserved in the future.  No man in this House will have the audacity to say that in his public career the Taoiseach has ever done anything which he did not honestly believe was in the best interests of the Irish people.</P>

The Constitution of any country is a sacred thing, something which should not be changed unless there are grave reasons for doing so.  I contend, Sir, that there is no grave reason for this proposed change in the Constitution.  I have not heard from any member of the opposite Party, at any time during past years, any suggestion that the Constitution was to be changed or that a change was needed.</P>
      <P>The first intimation of this change I got was when I read an article in the <i>Sunday Independent</i>, written, I think, some time in September, and suggesting that the Government intended to amend the Constitution.  I must give full marks to the <i>Sunday Independent.</i>  They certainly had their ears to the ground.</P>

      <P>I am very sorry if I have annoyed anybody, but I mean to make my statement fearlessly as I have always done.  I am not afraid of any interruptions, but I did not interrupt any speaker on the opposite side.  The Chair will agree with that. As I say, I give full marks to the <i>Independent</i> for having their ears to the ground, as they certainly had.  A few days after I read their article, we had a statement from the <i>Irish Press</i> which is known as &ldquo;Truth in the News,&rdquo; which was neither fish, flesh nor good red herring&mdash;I could not make anything out of it&mdash;which just stated that something would probably be done in the near future.</P>
      <P>I have met members of the opposite Party.  I meet them every day and I will admit I have some very good friends sitting opposite to me, men of whom I think a lot, and men with whom I am not ashamed to be associated in business and other capacities. As one who has been consistently opposed to them&mdash;since 1922, in fact&mdash; I can say that I am friendly with most of them and I am on nodding terms with the blackest of them.  Is that not a great thing to be able to say after 37 years?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are several matters facing the Government which are of greater urgency to the people than this proposal. These are matters of vital importance to the interests of the people. They have not been dealt with, although we have had a strong Government in power for two years.  That cannot be denied.  The first problem is emigration.  It is a hard problem, a problem which any Government or combination of Parties should face up to, no matter what their policies are. We have seen it happening.  We saw it happen during the previous Government's term and we see it during this Government's term.  We see the lifeblood of the country flowing away and nothing being done to stop it, although <Col N="856" /> we have a strong Government in power, the strongest Government we have had since 1922.  It is a festering sore which is completely draining our country.  What have the Government done to stop it since they came into office?  If they approached this matter in a proper manner, everyone in the country would be behind them&mdash;not only the Fianna Fáil Party but Labour, the farmers, the professional people and everybody else&mdash;in every effort they made.  They would be given full marks for anything they tried to do to resolve that problem.</P>
    <P>The second and most urgent matter facing us is unemployment.  Day after day, people in public life are meeting fathers of families and other people who come to our houses, no matter to which Party we belong, to ask for help. Every day they come to see if we can help them, but I am sorry to say we cannot.  Everyone is trying to do the best he can for them but still there is a big pool of unemployed for whom we cannot find work.  Is that an urgent matter?  I ask everybody is that a matter which should be tackled immediately and tackled with effect?  I maintain that it is.</P>
    <P>We have another matter that is very important to the economy of this country, the eradication of bovine tuberculosis.  We are living on the results of our agricultural exports and, no matter what we are or what way of life we have, everybody must admit &mdash;the Taoiseach and every member of the House&mdash;that we are living solely on those agricultural exports.  The cattle trade is worth £50,000,000 to us.  That is not something to be sneezed at, but something to be proud of.  Would it not be grand if we could raise that figure to £100,000,000?  I believe that it could be and, with God's help, will be raised to that figure and that, as a result, it will give the people work and everything they deserve. Our people, no matter what we may say about them, no matter what their politics are, stood by us when the country needed it most; they stood by the people who fought for their freedom and now is the time when we should respond to them and show them that we are prepared to work in their <Col N="857" /> interest and that we are prepared to put first things first.</P>
    <P>I was down this morning at the sale of cattle in Ballsbridge and I was proud to see some of the finest cattle one could see in the world being sold for export to various parts of the world&mdash;and the demand for them is growing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J.L. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I bow to your ruling, Sir; it is not in order to speak of our most important industry while we are speaking on a matter which I consider is not of importance or of urgency.  However, I leave it there.  I am sure the people will be very glad that it has been left there.  Before I leave that subject, I maintain that this is the most important problem facing this country or this House.  In saying that, I am sure I have the agreement of everybody on the opposite side of the House.  If the push and the drive which is to be put behind this abolition of P.R. were put behind the eradication of bovine tuberculosis, and if the money which is to be spent on the abolition of P.R. were put towards the drive to free this country of bovine tuberculosis, it would be a lot better for the country.  If that were put to a referendum to-morrow morning, one certainly would get the answer to it. Could we not spend the money which is being spent on this motion, in giving help to the unfortunate farmers who faced last year the worst harvest in history? Instead of taking 5/9 per barrel off their wheat and giving them back 3/- or 4/-, could we not have increased it and given them back at least what <Col N="858" /> they paid in?  Would it not be better spent in that way than on this?</P>
      <P>The writing is on the wall and there is no doubt about it.  Take the two most important local bodies we have. The Cork County Council had a meeting on Monday.  They voted on a motion relating to the abolition of P.R.  As you know, a Chathaoirligh, Cork County is one-tenth of the area of this country.  What was the result? Twenty-five members of the council, composed of different politics and Parties, voted against this proposal. The same thing happened in the Dublin Corporation&mdash;perhaps the biggest unit of votes and perhaps the biggest unit of people we have.  They voted in a similar way.  From meeting people of different politics up and down the country, I can say that that feeling is being accepted gradually.  I say &ldquo;gradually&rdquo;, and I say that the time spent in debating this important proposal is well spent, for the people are taking an interest in it and they can see now that it is in their best interests to vote against this proposal, which has neither urgency nor necessity to commend it.</P>
      <P>Have Fianna Fáil not got the strongest Government they ever got under it?  What are they looking for? Is it complete dictatorship?  Have they not got at the present time the strongest Government they ever had, after 30 or 40 years of P.R.?  They certainly have.  I cannot see why any Government or Party should vote to abolish something which gave them complete power and control.  I am not going into the reasons which have been expressed here as to why this is happening.  I have my own reasons.  I have had a long and varied experience of the Fianna Fáil Party.  I say that it will be a bad day for the ordinary people when any Party&mdash;Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael&mdash;is put in such a position that they can refuse to listen to appeals from any section of the people, when they will feel so strong in their power that they can overlook those people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have also seen that debating societies and church bodies throughout the country have debated this <Col N="859" /> matter.  People of knowledge, of science and of education have debated it in various places.  They debated it in Cork City, in University College, Cork, recently.  The same thing happened as happened in the councils and committees of which I have spoken.</P>
    <P>It has been said here that foreign countries, such as Germany, Italy and France had P.R. and that it resulted in their Governments being bad, and so on.  I maintain that the reason Germany, France and Italy were mentioned is that some of the members opposite wanted some opening to bring in something else.  They did not mention Russia.  I am not too well acquainted with the form of election there.</P>

      <P>From what I have heard, I come to the conclusion that Russia and Red China have a very straight vote.  It is so straight that if you do not vote that way, you could lose your head there.  I shall not mention them here as a parallel. Probably the real reason Germany and Italy were brought into this debate was to have a slap at an organisation known here as the Blueshirts.  It was mentioned by various speakers from the opposite side and, as one of the founder members of that organisation and as one of its last men, I am not a bit ashamed or afraid to stand up here and state that when history is written about that period the members of that organisation will be given credit for various things.  They will be given credit for establishing freedom of speech in this country, a thing that was sadly lacking.  I remember various political meetings and Senator Ó Maoláin need not laugh too much at this.  He was probably on a platform then.</P>

      <P>The greatest aspersion that could be cast on any organisation then, which was not in <Col N="860" /> favour of Fianna Fáil, was that its members were Imperialists and West Britons.  Is it not strange that we have this thing coming back?  I am glad and proud to have listened to the speech made by Senator Stanford, a gentleman of a religious persuasion different from mine and that of the majority of the people here.  It was the greatest speech I ever heard, at any time, from a person of different religious persuasion.  It was his honest, fearless statement and I feel we have been vindicated.  The people who were with me are now vindicated when we find that at least one of the people for whom we stood had the courage of his convictions years later.</P>
      <P>At the start of my speech I referred to the need for the motion before the House.  I have listened to the various speeches from the opposite side of the House and all they can say is: &ldquo;we want a strong Labour Party; we want a strong Farmers' Party; we want a fairly strong Fine Gael Party.&rdquo;  Where is the need for changing the Constitution at all if that is what they want? I have a grave doubt at the back of my mind whether that is what they want. Though I have differed with the Taoiseach over a long number of years I respect him as an Irishman and, even though I differ from him, I do not wish him wrong but I can assure him that, despite my feelings for him, he will not get my support or my vote to put this Bill through.  I suppose I cannot give him a vote in the Presidential election either.  However, that is another story and we have a fairly good man ourselves for it.</P>
      <P>Before I conclude I would appeal to each Senator in the House, no matter whether he be an Independent or otherwise, no matter what his politics are or what his Party is, not to abstain from voting on this occasion because it is the most important vote he may be ever called upon to cast.  I would appeal, finally, to every Senator to vote either for or against the Bill.</P>

      <P>Senator O'Reilly and others reveal that the Government was surprised when the Opposition jumped into the arena to oppose this measure in its initial stages.  They reasoned that <Col N="861" /> Fine Gael could be lulled into silence in the hope that the not too distant future would see them in a Government as a single entity.  What the Government assessors seemed to miss was the fact that Fine Gael, at no time, lost sight of the time when it might be called upon as a unit to carry out the duties of government.  At no time in our history did we forget that, but our main subject to-day is P.R.</P>
      <P>We have been blamed on this side of the House for talking tactics to keep it away from the people.  Every single person who spoke on this side has been followed by a person on the Government side so, if we delayed it, then they equally helped to delay it.  I would like to ask this House is P.R. the cause of emigration?  Is P.R. the cause of high taxation?  Is P.R. responsible for weak Governments when you see one of the strongest Governments we have had in this country since 1932?  P.R. is aimed only at preventing complete and utter dictatorship.  That is all it is doing.  The Bill before us to-day is possibly aimed at establishing that sort of dictatorial Government but to my mind, the primary object is to forget the real essentials, the bread and butter policies that should be our principal concern, as Senator J.L. O'Sullivan said a few moments ago. The Bill aims at making us forget that.</P>
      <P>Is P.R. responsible for the fact that the adverse balance of trade last month was £10,000,000?  Can anybody say that P.R. is the cause of that?  We cannot say it was.  The system of P.R. was introduced in the early days of this State for the express purpose of giving all and every shade of political opinion an opportunity, equal to its force and proportional to its support, to make its case in the councils of the nation.  That has never been denied, not even by the Taoiseach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In his Constitution, the Constitution first introduced 21 years ago and the 21st birthday of which we are celebrating by the issue of a stamp&mdash;a stamp which is being placed on the envelope with one hand while with the other, the Constitution is being disembowelled&mdash;the Taoiseach enshrined this system of election in the name of <Col N="862" /> the Holy Trinity, and the people adopted it with due solemnity. Whether or not we were against it, the people adopted it with due solemnity and our experience over the past 36 years has been that it served an intelligent people in an intelligent way. The alternative is to leave the electorate at the mercy of a highly organised minority, which appears to be the aim of the Party that runs the Government to-day, the Fianna Fáil Party.  The highly organised minority will run the country if they are successful in abolishing P.R.</P>
    <P>Why should this subject be brought into the limelight at this time, three years away from a general election and in an economic situation steadily worsening as each statistical report comes to hand, when even our new Irish air service to America is advertising special emigrant fares, when our new Irish air service to the States is in the market in a big way to collect the good business from emigration?</P>
    <P>Responsible Ministers of State inform us from platform and well-laden dinner tables that the position is actually the reverse of what we in public life know it to be.  Unemployment is rampant.  Nobody denies that.  We know it to be a fact.  We cannot blame P.R. for that.  Emigration still goes on apace and trade is aiming towards an all-time low.  There is all this when we treat ourselves luxuriously to a discussion on P.R.</P>
    <P>A Senator a few moments ago noted that there is a slackening off in emigration. There must come a time when there will be no more people to go away.  I may be wrong in my interpretation of the Senator's remarks but, sooner or later, emigration must stop; there will not be anybody to go.  While we apply our genius to talking about trade expansion and send our trade emissaries to what must be the wrong places, we fail to notice what is happening beside us.</P>
    <P>A few months ago the British Food Fair was held.  This is carrying on from Senator O'Sullivan's point about the cattle trade and the produce of the land.  Every country 1,500 miles from London was showing its hams, beef, <Col N="863" /> butter, cheese, fruit, vegetables and every product of the land in that shop window of the world but Ireland was not represented there.  We were talking about P.R. at home here and, since we started to talk about P.R. in September, 1958, close on 30,000 people have left the country if the 60,000 a year figure is correct.  All our old competitors were at that British Food Fair, the greatest agricultural shop window in the world.  Two years ago, when that &ldquo;horrible crowd&rdquo;, the inter-Party Government, were in office, on the main staircase of Olympia there was a wonderful display of agricultural produce and over it was, &ldquo;Produce of the Republic of Ireland.&rdquo;  We had not even a potato there last year.  We were talking about P.R.  Now entering the fields are our old enemies, the people with the straight vote, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, China.  They had their material there.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect of this we want to cover.  In story and school book we have shouted about how we introduced culture to Europe, how we educated everybody in Europe, and boasted that people of other countries were all running in and out of bog-holes and rate holes until we came along and raised them beyond that. At the Brussels Exposition last year, which was attended by 40,000,000 people from all over the world, every country in the world was represented except Ireland, that educated the whole lot of them, that brought our culture with the great big torch throughout the Continent.  Northern Ireland was there.  Of course, she was associated with the British Empire.  However, the word &ldquo;Ireland,&rdquo; unobtrusively, surreptitiously, if you like, got into the world exposition in Brussels.  We were at home enjoying the luxury of a discussion on P.R.  May I finish that point by saying that Northern Ireland was there?  If nothing else, it proved that we were a geographical entity, that the island known as Ireland was somewhere in the Western Ocean.  But we do not seem to be interested in the British Food Fair, in agricultural products, in our economy.  We do not seem to be interested in demonstrating <Col N="864" /> our culture to the world.  We would rather stay at home and talk about P.R.</P>
    <P>We send trade emissaries across the Continent of Europe and to America to get trade for us and, for some reason or another, we cannot get beyond sending civil servants.  I say this in an aside.</P>

      <P>Senator Cole said that the ex-Unionists or Protestants are waiting for this Bill to become law to participate in public affairs.  That, of course, is ridiculous.  I am a member of a county council with 25 members and up to very recently one-third of that council were non-Catholics.  They do not have to wait for the abolition of P.R. to take part in public affairs. They take a very active part in the various Parties.  We will have to get this thing straight and call the ratepayers a Party in case by some chance somebody would call in a splinter <Col N="865" /> group or pressure group.  They are doing a capable job.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Sullivan referred to strongholds for support of particular candidates in five-member constituencies and suggests that a good reason for the abolition of P.R. is this sub-area support for a particular individual or Party.  If special support is discovered in a certain pocket of a constituency and various pockets of larger constituencies, there is only one way of making use of those pockets and that is by the maladjustment of the constituency&mdash;to gerrymander it. I have not suggested that anybody would gerrymander a constituency but it is fair for people to think that it may occur.  If you want to make sure that you can utilise any particular pocket in a constituency, there is only one way to do it.  I suggest that some of the Government Deputies ought to go to the North and do a course there and they will be experts on how it is done.  It is just plain gerrymandering. I know quite well that that is not the wish of Senator O'Sullivan&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Senator Ted O'Sullivan. Senator Lenihan brought us from Timbuctoo to Tinahely, all over the world.  He skipped Cuba, which changes its Government by the gun, the Argentine, straight-vote people, which changes its Government by the gun, but brought us to the other places that do not change their Governments by the gun.  Castro, Peron, Batista and all these boys could speak at great length on the straight vote.</P>
      <P>The Senator regards opposition as obstruction.  He said that Senator Stanford was dishonest.  Of course, anything that is said against these youngsters nowadays is dishonest. Perhaps, when the Senator reaches the age and has the brains of Senator Stanford, he will be able to differentiate between what is honest and what is dishonest.  It comes right down from the top of affairs in Fianna Fáil that any logical argument used against them is regarded as complete nonsense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Connolly O'Brien, in her <Col N="866" /> anxiety not to be misinterpreted, will vote &ldquo;No&rdquo;, when she goes outside, on the ballot paper, but will vote &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; in this House so that it will go to the people.  Senator Connolly O'Brien must know that it is going to the people and that we cannot stop it.  I should like to remind the Senator that nobody will give her the information as to whether or not this may ever go to the people.  The Government are not obliged to go to the people.  They can introduce it in 1961 or in 1962. However, her anxiety not to be misinterpreted, does not help the situation as far as we or the people on the other side are concerned, but I respect her view.</P>
    <P>Senator J.D. Sheridan is a great personal friend of mine.  Thanks be to goodness, friends can remain friends outside this House and speak in this House differently.  I consider that his statement here to-day is the answer to the impractical suggestion that we should have a vocational Seanad.  If vocational representatives refuse to vote on what they call political Bills, what will happen to such Bills if vocational Senators in an all-vocational Seanad refuse to vote?  I respect his view.  He is entitled to it until the abolition of P.R.  I do not know what will then happen his view, but, before the abolition of P.R., we democratically respect the view of the Senators.</P>
    <P>Pressure groups are referred to by Government speakers.  But what of the most effective pressure group of all, the one that is formed within the big Party?  That is the pressure group we are all afraid of&mdash;a pressure group that is the most exacting; a pressure group that moves up the political Party to the top and strangles those at the top of affairs if they do not run the country in push-button style, as they demand it. The little pressure group outside, such as the ratepayers, do not really count as a danger to democracy; it is the dangerous groups within the Parties that create danger.  As has been amply illustrated by several of the more learned Senators, within the larger Parties in America, those pressure groups are to be found.</P>
    <P>I conclude on the note that, in the last analysis, I see in this whole matter <Col N="867" /> an expression of no confidence in the Irish people by Éamon de Valera, Taoiseach of Ireland.  He is expressing the view: &ldquo;I have no confidence in you and therefore I shall organise this land in such a way that you will have no right again to do wrong.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Speaking briefly on this Bill, I should like to express the view that I consider it unnecessary and uncalled for.  There was no dissenting opinion throughout the country against the present system.  If there were, there might be some reason for it.  I am afraid there are very sinister reasons at the back of the Taoiseach's mind for requesting the abolition of P.R.  It has worked well and it is the most truly democratic system of election that is known.  I am elected to the Seanad by a vocational nominating body&mdash;&mdash;</P>

As he expressed the view that the people who sent him here did not wish him to vote on political issues, I want it put on record that the National Executive of the Irish Livestock Trade never requested me&mdash;nor did they express any view on the matter&mdash;not to express a political opinion or not to vote on a political matter in this House.  Senator J.D. Sheridan's views on the matter of his not voting are his own and he is entitled to them.  However, if Senators elected by nominating bodies adopted Senator J.D. Sheridan's attitude, it would be as well to abolish the nominating bodies.</P>
      <P>I intend to vote against this Bill because I think the reasons behind it are sinister in the extreme.  For that reason, I came all the way from the United States to cast my vote and, whether the Bill be beaten or not, I feel I shall have done my duty in the Seanad in voting against what I consider an unnecessary and sinister Bill.</P>

I have studied with equal care the points put forward against it.  Even the Taoiseach must admit that the arguments against the Bill by far outweigh those put forward in favour of it.</P>
      <P>I listened to Senator Mrs. Connolly O'Brien's excellent speech to which Senator Carton has referred.  She gave very sound and honest reasons why the system of P.R. should not be abolished.  She actually stated that when she is casting her vote when the referendum is before the people, she will vote against it.  But, notwithstanding that and against her belief and judgment, she will cast her vote in this House for the Bill.  It can be said that the reason for that is that she is one of the Taoiseach's chosen 11.</P>

      <P>In all sincerity, I believe that there are many more such members on the opposite side of the House who are thinking in the very same way as Senator Mrs. Connolly O'Brien thinks.  There are those who &mdash;notwithstanding all the talk we hear about unanimity within the Fianna Fáil Party&mdash;will vote against the referendum when it goes to the people, but who will vote for the Bill in this House.</P>
      <P>Quite a lot has been said here about stability of government.  Surely no person can believe there is necessity to change our system of election in order to have more stable government than this country has enjoyed for practically 40 years?  As has already been mentioned on a few occasions, we have had only three Premiers in this country in 40 years&mdash;Mr. W.T. Cosgrave, Mr. J. A. Costello and the present Taoiseach. It was mentioned last evening by a member on the other side of the House that too many elections prevent a Government from doing their work.  Surely a Government who have had 16 years in office without a break cannot argue that they were prevented from carrying out the programme on which they secured election?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="869" /> The Taoiseach is a very proud man. Having suffered two major defeats&mdash;in 1948 and again in 1954&mdash;I believe he is afraid that the third defeat will come in the next general election and that that is one of the reasons, and the principal reason, for the introduction of this Bill.</P>
    <P>Quite a lot has been said about appointing a commission.  I think it would have been the proper procedure if, before the question of this Bill was raised, the Taoiseach had appointed a commission&mdash;an independent commission or otherwise&mdash;to consider the necessity of amending the system of election in this country.  I believe that if that commission had been appointed and if it had recommended to the Government that there was a necessity to amend the system of election in this country their decision would have been unanimously received by both Houses of the Óireachtas.  I think that is where the mistake occurred, namely, that the commission was not set up and their views obtained before the Bill was introduced into the Oireachtas.</P>

      <P>One Senator&mdash;I think Senator Stanford&mdash;at the opening of his statement said he wished to shift the emphasis of argument and debate here from Parties and Government to the people and Parliament.  I thought that was an excellent opening, and I had hoped that it would lead him on to what appears to me the necessary conclusion, if he were to follow out his arguments.  I thought, also, that it would be a headline for the argument in the case of Senators who succeeded him.</P>
      <P>Now, let us take that.  We want to deal here with the people and their Parliament.  We are a democracy, and that means, I take it, those provisions in the Constitution by which the people are, in the final resort, the final arbiters of national action, and also that they will have the power of designating their rulers.  If we deny them that, we are certainly denying the people the fundamental right of democracy, that is, the power to be the ultimate rulers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I say that the system that we have did, in fact, deny the people both of <Col N="870" /> these rights: the right of decision, ultimate decision, and the right of designating their rules.  I shall come back later to deal with that.  Now, as to their Parliament.  The question is: what do we wish the Parliament to be? What is our view of what a democratic Parliament should be?  This Bill has to do with the Dáil, so I shall substitute &ldquo;Dáil&rdquo; for &ldquo;Parliament&rdquo;.  Do we wish the Dáil to be a deliberative assembly, a deliberative, representative assembly concerned with one purpose&mdash;the common good of the community they represent?  Or to go back to the well-known words of Burke, do we wish it to be the very antithesis of that, namely, &ldquo;a congress of ambassadors from different and hostile interests, which interests each must maintain, as an agent and advocate, against other agents or advocates?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>For which of these two ideals of Parliament do we stand?  Which do we wish to get?  Do we want a congress representing different conflicting interests, or do we want a Parliament truly representing the people and concerned in their deliberative assembly with the common good, striving to promote that common good by the use of reason and argument?  Which of the two do we want?  I say that those who are urging here that we should continue the system of representation we have got, the system of election we have got, have at the back of their minds this congress of ambassadors from conflicting interests and that they expect that the people who come in here as ambassadors from those interests will be concerned as agents and advocates to promote those interests and not to promote the common good.  Will any responsible person, who tries to think of ordered society and our political institutions, for a moment doubt which is the proper one?</P>
    <P>I expected that, at least, some of the representatives of the university which gave us Edmund Burke would have had some thought for these principles. Listening to the speeches that were made, however, it seemed to me that they were all for the antithesis of what a true Parliament should be, a true Dáil should be, namely, this congress.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="871" /> Now, let us go from Parliament to government.  It is true that the Dáil is the father, so to speak, of the Government.  It creates the Government; it brings it into being by nominating the Taoiseach and by supporting by its consent to the Government which is chosen by him.  Which is first?  In order of time, undoubtedly, the Parliament comes first, but the fact is that once the Government is selected, the Government is the mainspring of action; every member of the Government is engaged whole-time on the job of endeavouring to get action taken in the public interest. It is the mainspring of political action in the Parliament.  It prepares the programmes within the general programme of the Party to which it belongs and which has been accepted by the country and by virtue of which they get into office.</P>
    <P>Therefore, when we talk of Parliament and try to put it in contrast with government, we must admit that, in the end, it is the Government that counts most.  They are, no doubt, responsible from day to day to the Parliament, and it is for that reason that it is essential that the programmes which they bring forward should have the support of the majority, that they should be assured before they bring them in&mdash;so as not to be wasting time &mdash;that if any adjustments have to be made, they should be made with the people who are disposed towards the same line of action in the common interest and towards the common good.  That is the value of having a Government with a Party with which <i>in camera</i> the proposed legislation can be discussed.  In any Party such as you would get under the straight vote system, you will have a variety of views, and the Party must be more than half of the Dáil to be a majority.</P>
    <P>You will have, therefore, more than half the representatives of the whole nation in that Party, but they have one common objective as a Party, one common method of promoting the common good: they will have the goodwill which will give the necessary co-operation if you want to make <Col N="872" /> adjustments.  It is one thing to make adjustments with people who are disposed to agree with you, if their conscience and reason will let them; it is quite another thing to get consent and agreement with people who are, from the outset, determined to prevent you from going along the road which you imagine is the right road in the public interest.</P>
    <P>It is, therefore, of tremendous importance that a Government should have behind it the support of a body that is devoted to the same common principles.  It is because you will not get that in a coalition that I believe that coalitions, as a rule, give bad Governments.  The very idea of a congress of ambassadors, which Burke spoke about as the antithesis of the true representative assembly, is brought from the Parliament right into the Cabinet room, and you have there a group of people who are not disposed to work together in the sense of having an agreed method of arriving at the common good.  You have agents and ambassadors of different hostile interests, and they speak as agents and advocates of these sections, even when they are acting as members of the Government.  I do not think that can lead to good government.</P>
    <P>It is true that you must have coalitions on various occasions, that sometimes they are a necessity.  Even under the straight vote system, an occasion can arise when it is not possible to get a Government except by a combination of Parties and that the alternative is to leave the country without a Government.  On some occasions, you have to get support of Parties outside the Government, as we got them on some two or three occasions.  In Fianna Fáil, we got support at certain times from the Labour Party.  We got it from outside, that is, they held themselves free to oppose us whenever they wanted to and they gave us support in certain cases.  But two or three occasions arose during that time in which we could not have gone on with the national work, had it not been for the fact that we had a remedy.  The power is given in the Constitution to the Taoiseach to ask for a dissolution, and on three occasions I had to ask for that <Col N="873" /> in order to put the Government in a position in which it could get on with the work in accordance with the programme which had been approved.</P>
    <P>We had to do that in 1933.  Labour had supported us; we could not have come into office at all otherwise, because we had not an overall majority in 1932.  We lasted for a year with the support of Labour, but then the occasion came when it became quite obvious that we would be pressed, in the interests of sections of the community, to leave the line which we had set before the people and which we believed to be in the national interest.  We had to do it again later, in 1938.  We were elected in 1937 once more by far the largest Party but, after a year in office, in order to get on with our work and carry out the programme we put before the people, we had to put it to the people: &ldquo;If you wish us to put that programme through, put us in a position in which we will have a majority that will enable us to put it through.&rdquo;  We did get that majority.</P>
    <P>The same thing happened in 1943 and 1944.  As generally occurs after a Government has been in office for a period, various things happen and one section or another of the community is disappointed because certain things were done or were not done, and consequently, in the course of time, Governments become unpopular and the natural tendency is to look for a change.  That was the case following the period from 1933 to 1937, and, when we did go to the people, we did not get an overall majority in 1937, but we got it in 1938 because we had to go, as we did in 1933, and say: &ldquo;Do you wish us to pursue this programme or do you not?  If you are serious and wish us to put that programme through, you must give us the power to enable us to do so, and that power will come by giving us an overall majority.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Again, in 1943, after a period in office as Government, we found we did not get an overall majority when we went to the people, and in 1944, in order to get the position right, we had to appeal to the people again.  We had these elections within intervals of <Col N="874" /> a year because otherwise we could not have gone on with our programme.  In 1948, we got in with a majority over all other organised Parties.  We got more votes for our Party than all other organised Parties together.  It was said, of course, that the people had voted against us.  Every vote that was not cast for us was taken as a vote for others.  That was not true.  That is not the way in which people vote. You vote for a certain thing, but it does not mean that because you vote for A you are voting for B as against C.</P>
    <P>In 1948, we had returned a Party which was greater than all other Parties combined.  The people knew what our programme would be in 1948.  The people did not know&mdash;and that is where one of the fundamental rights of democracy was flouted and ignored&mdash;before that election that they were going to have a combination of people who before that were hostile in their political programmes, one to another.  The people did not know that these groups would come together and claim that they had the will of the people behind them.  The will of the people in that matter was completely ignored.  Parties went before the people saying they would not coalesce or have anything to do with coalitions, and immediately afterwards they did have a coalition.  The people's right to decide either of the two things which, under the Constitution, they are given the right to decide, policy and their rulers, was denied on that occasion.  When the Coalition had operated for a period, they went before the electors again.  I have always said that there was nothing whatever wrong about different groups coming together and forming a common group and going before the electorate in that way. I asked the Government of 1948 when it was about to go to the elections again in 1951, to go before the people with a common programme, but they did not do it.  In order to get the support of their own special interests, the Parties began to take their own individual lines.  For example, Labour began talking about Fine Gael as if Fine Gael were all the time out for their own interests and had no regard <Col N="875" /> whatever for the interests of Labour.</P>
    <P>You had the example of the Taoiseach at that time having to come out, when one member of his Government made a statement in favour of some special interest which would alienate the interests for which the Taoiseach stood, and practically unsay what the member of his Government had said.  That was because members of his Government were acting as agents and advocates of different and hostile interests.</P>
    <P>It is said that I brought this measure forward or put it to our Party to bring it forward&mdash;or whatever way it is put&mdash;only because we were defeated in 1948.  There is this element of truth in that: it was in 1948 that it became clear to me beyond any question whatever that, if democracy in the true sense were to survive here, the system by which people could go in groups and advocate anything they wished because they were in an irresponsible position must end.  It was possible for each one of these groups&mdash; afterwards combining to form a Government&mdash;to advocate any policy, no matter how conflicting, how impracticable or how impossible to carry out. It did prove to me that the multiplicity of Parties was going to increase here and that we were rapidly going to get into the position in which, once you had got a large number of Parties established, each with a special vested interest in keeping the system as it was, we would find it extremely difficult to get out of it.</P>
    <P>It was for that reason that, although we were the biggest Party, bigger than all the others combined, we stood out resolutely against any idea of &ldquo;National Government&rdquo;, as it was called, and stood outside any form of coalition.  It was a self-denying ordinance as far as we were concerned. I know how difficult it is for any Party to maintain a position like that over an extended period of time. Parties are supported very largely because of the hope by those who support them that the policy for which they stand can be put into effect.  If it becomes clear that you cannot put the policy into effect, then, of course, <Col N="876" /> everybody says: &ldquo;Very well.  We may as well be in the swim with the others.&rdquo;  In those circumstances it is extremely difficult for any Party to stand out, and when we did adopt that attitude it was said we were the bulwark of the nation, the bulwark of democracy, because we took that line. There were many who thought at the time that there was no hope that Fianna Fáil could go back as a majority again, and that belief was not without reasonable foundation, because the circumstances of the time, the grouping of the Parties, would have as its natural consequence that our Party, Fianna Fáil, would never come back as an organised majority again.</P>
    <P>To hold out then was difficult, because the chances of success were not very bright.  We stood out, and this last election in which we got in as a majority was proof that we were right.  Things happen occasionally but if a thing happens once, which might be regarded purely as an exception, it does not mean that the same thing can easily happen again.  It is because we feel it our duty to put this measure through, seeing that the good fortune has come our way to be able to give the people an opportunity of deciding this question, that we have chosen the present time.</P>
    <P>We chose this time because we knew in advance that every other organised Party in the country would be against our trying to put that measure to the people.  They would not want it to go to the people, and you could not put it to the people unless you had a majority holding the view that it should be so put, that is, you would want a complete Party majority on the side of putting it to the people.  This whole debate&mdash;the discussion in this Chamber and in the Dáil&mdash;has proved beyond question how right we were.  It has proved that there would be no hope of the people ever having an opportunity of deciding this question unless it was taken at a time like this.</P>
    <P>It has been said that this is an inopportune time.  I have never known people who wanted an excuse for opposing any measure who did not trot that out, that it was an inopportune <Col N="877" /> time, that there were other things of national importance to be done.  Of course there are, and of course there will be, at every moment, important things to be done.  But this is an important thing.  I was listening to Senator Professor George O'Brien talking more or less in that strain, too, that there were other more important things to be done&mdash;as if this was not important.  As an economist, he would be one of the very first to say that the foundation of all progress and all prosperity in practically every country is the stability of its political system. Nobody would have any confidence in a country, and nobody would think of investing in any kind of national expansion, if he thought that country had a political system that was unstable and capable of being turned topsy turvy overnight.</P>
    <P>With a coalition you never know in advance what way they are going to turn, how far the pressure of one group may induce the others to give way.  There is no definite programme fixed by the Government.  They are constantly attempting to sail in accordance with each wind that blows. Consequently, when we set out here to try to make the foundations of Government and of democracy safe in this country, to enable Governments having a definite programme to proceed in an orderly fashion with the execution of that programme, we are, as Senator O'Brien knows well, laying the foundation of real progress.</P>
    <P>As I have said, we are taking this measure at the present time because it could not be put through by a minority Party, and I have shown that it is an important matter.  Not willing to deal with this question on its merits, the Opposition have suggested all kinds of motives for bringing it in.  It reminds me of something I was told a few years ago.  A person had to make a decision with regard to an appointment, and he voted in a certain way.  It was a deciding vote, and after the vote was taken certain members of the body concerned were chatting together.  One member of the body said to the others: &ldquo;What had he at the back of his mind in voting <Col N="878" /> that way?&rdquo;  There was no apparent reason why he should have voted in the particular way he did, at least there was no reason that could be suggested to a person who was thinking of ulterior motives.  One of his colleagues replied to him: &ldquo;Would it ever have occurred to you that he gave that vote because he considered the person for whom the vote was being cast was the best?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>All sorts of motives are being suggested as to why we are bringing in this measure, but one motive will never be ascribed to us, that we are bringing it in because we believe it to be good and right and the best thing for the Irish people.  We are not denying the Irish people an opportunity of coming to a decision on the matter.  In the Constitution a provision was deliberately put in in order that there would be a preliminary discussion by way of a Bill on the merits of the question by representatives of the people, so that the people would have an opportunity of seeing the pros and cons and making up their own minds on the matter.</P>
    <P>We knew there would be opposition to this Bill.  We knew it would be opposed by the people who might easily think differently about the P.R. system, who might be attracted to it&mdash; as I was at one time&mdash;as appearing to be a fair system, and that it would be opposed by others simply because it was being proposed by us.</P>
    <P>I have shown the necessity is for taking this action while there is a Government in power that can take it.  The people can make up their minds about it.  There are very few political questions on which there are not some pros and cons.</P>
    <P>We had some Senators suggesting we should have had a commission.  I think Senators travelled a good deal in seeing what other people had done. But our people have got first-hand knowledge, if they care to use it, first-hand knowledge of how this system works, why up to the present time it has worked not too unsuccessfully and the danger that lies inherent in it&mdash;the danger that comes from the fact that it induces a multiplicity of Parties and <Col N="879" /> that with a multiplicity of Parties you will have endemic coalitions.</P>
    <P>A coalition now and again is all very well and may be the only thing that can be done in the national interest; but I feel we would not be doing our public duty if we deliberately faced a situation we see looming before us, and with the power at least to give the people an opportunity of checking that situation, we did not put this Bill to them at the present time.</P>
    <P>I have been asked: Why did you not mention this at the election?  Since 1938 I have been warning the people about what could happen with a multiplicity of Parties here.  I have spoken about it at a number of elections.  In one election I was asked would it be the policy of the Government, if elected, to put an end to P.R.  At that time I pointed out that this question could always be put to the people as a separate, independent issue and that it should not be mixed up with other issues in a general election.  In a general election a number of other issues are raised.  If you mentioned this issue at a general election and if you were defeated, it would always be said that this proposal was defeated.</P>
    <P>I should point out, by the way, that the Constitution contains the very provision under which we are acting, and we are not outraging the Constitution by asking the people to amend it.  The power of amending it is in it.  It is there because we knew that, with the changing world and with changing circumstances, it would be quite wrong to have a rigid Constitution that could not be changed if conditions made a change necessary.  I shall admit this though: I regret very much to have to bring about any change.  I have a great deal of sympathy with the people who do not like to see changes.  I, for one, would not stand for a change if I did not believe it was very much a change for the better and, in fact, a change that was absolutely necessary.  Otherwise, I would not have dreamed of bringing in an amendment.</P>
    <P>I might say this, too.  If we were anxious for an easy time, if we were anxious to stay in Government and to have no problems other than the problems <Col N="880" /> we have from day to day, then we would not have brought up this issue. Why should I or anybody else have brought it up if we did not think it was necessary?  All sorts of motives have been suggested.  Not one of them would hold water to any thinking person.  We could have continued as we were.  As far as Fianna Fáil are concerned, if our concern was the perpetuation of that organisation, its perpetuation could be better assured&mdash; mark you, I am not thinking of it as an effective instrument in securing the good of the community but simply thinking of the narrow Party organisation and its perpetuation&mdash;with P.R. than with the straight vote.</P>
    <P>One of the things that happen under the straight vote is that you can get such a complete change that Parties can very well be destroyed.  It is not true, therefore, to say that this is done for the perpetuation of our Party.  Nor can it be said it is done for giving continuing power to our Party, even while in existence.  That is no more true than many of the other statements.  It is quite obvious that no person can predict what the people will do in an election.  When you are close up to an election, if you have some political experience, you may have a fair idea of what they are likely to do; but you cannot judge what changes can take place in the future.</P>
    <P>We are not freezing this, as somebody said, into the Constitution.  The Constitution can be amended.  If at any time it was considered that there was a better system than the straight vote, and we had succeeded in getting the straight vote into use, the people would have a far better chance of changing back than they would ever have of changing from the present system to the straight vote system, because in the one case the vested interests would be so numerous and so powerful that we would never have in the Dáil an opportunity of getting an overall majority.  But under the straight vote system if any one of these Parties got a majority in the Dáil and if at any time they wished to change, they would have the power to put it through.  Remember that this whole system of the straight vote makes for <Col N="881" /> giving an overall majority to Parties and makes for one-Party government. Therefore, the possibility of changing back is much more favourable than the possibility or probability of changing the other way.  We are not freezing any more than has been frozen already.  We are not trying to predetermine the future.  We are not so foolish to think that we can do so. The future is something beyond us. We may take action and do things as best we can at the moment to try to ensure that the future in store for us will be of the kind we like.  But when we have done our best...  &ldquo;The best laid schemes of mice and men gang aft agley.&rdquo;  In these cases it would be a very foolish person indeed who would try to predetermine and arrange for the future.  It is our duty to try, in so far as we see it, to make provision that the future will be for the general interest of the community.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether I should continue on this.  The arguments that have been put forward here are simply arguments on a basis that do not stand careful examination.  As far as the suggested motives are concerned, they would not hold water with any people sitting down calmly to consider them. The things attributed to us we could not do, even if we had the will.  Those who put these arguments up know that as well as we do.</P>
    <P>As far as the system we are proposing is concerned, may I say this?  In most matters&mdash;as may be said to our scientists&mdash;simplicity is always one of the fundamental things in nature.  If you can get a simple system, and the results from it are not less favourable than those from the other system, you will adopt the simple system.  If we were trying to create here a Parliament in accordance with the ideal I have mentioned&mdash;a deliberative assembly representative of all the people, with one interest only, namely, that of the common good&mdash;how would we proceed? Would we not at once have to try to get independent representatives from the various areas within the country?  For a variety of reasons, we would know that it would be better to act on the basis of a territorial democracy, to start off with, whatever <Col N="882" /> changes or modifications we might put in afterwards; and the first simple step of which one would think would be the division of the country into suitable areas, endeavouring, as far as one could, to give equal determining power, under adult suffrage, to the individuals in these areas.  One would divide the country, then, into single member constituencies.</P>
    <P>Democracy, in its initial stages, was a simple thing.  The people gathered together in the agora or the forum and the laws were discussed in the forum. That day passed, and the time came when government by widely distributed groups evolved and one had to think then in terms of a representative Government, in terms of dividing the territory governed into suitably-sized units, giving equal voting power to the communities in those units, each unit being roughly equivalent in population. It must, of course, be remembered that one must never be too rigid, because many considerations have to be taken into account.  But that is the fundamental principle governing the idea of the single member constituency, administrative areas, and so forth. There may be certain geographical features which will make it desirable to depart somewhat from actual equality of population in each of the areas, but that departure must at all times be consistent with the idea that each member of the community will have the same influence in determining the laws through the medium of electing certain representatives to the representative assembly.  It is a simple method.  It is a straightforward method but above all, it has the advantage of simplicity.</P>
    <P>The next point then is how one will elect a representative of the smaller community?  I think one representative is by far the best.  In a single member constituency the people will know the candidate, assuming, for the moment, that he comes from within the area.  If he is brought in from outside, one can rest assured that there will be those within the area who will take very good care to let the people know what he is like.  In fact, the chances of someone coming in from outside are slight unless there is some <Col N="883" /> exceptionally good reason.</P>
    <P>Consider the position of the ordinary constituency.  Consider the position of the people in that constituency in relation to the selection of a representative.  They will want someone who will be representative of their community, just as we want Parliament to be truly representative of the nation, working for the common good of all.  These people will look for a candidate who will represent their views fairly, who will be interested in their interests and who will, having come into the national assembly, examine proposed legislation from the point of view of how that legislation will bear upon those whom he represents.  At the same time he will be in a position to work for the national interest, the general interest, ensuring all the time that, in general, laws will not bear unduly or unfairly on those whom he represents directly. If, then, the aim is to have a representative Government, the natural thing is to have one representative for each particular area.  I believe such a representative will represent such an area better and more truly, chosen in that particular way, than will a group made up of people who are &ldquo;agents and advocates&rdquo; for conflicting interests.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that under the proposed system a certain freedom is being denied.  It has been suggested that the formation of a natural political Party is being denied.  There is no foundation in either premise. Anybody will be free to go forward for election.  It has been suggested that only the powerful organisations will be able to put forward candidates. That suggestion is completely false. Under the single member constituency system, it is quite obvious that an individual who is anxious to serve his particular community, and serve the nation, who is known to his particular community, and respected by it, will have a far better chance of being elected, as against any machine, than he would have under the present system.  There is no doubt whatever about that.</P>
    <P>It will be much easier for the voter <Col N="884" /> under the proposed system to make a choice as between rival candidates.  It will be much easier for him to select the person he thinks best both from the national point of view and from the point of view of representing the local community.  It will be much easier for him to cast the balance beforehand rather than leave it more or less to chance.  If there is a group representing conflicting interests, the community involved has really no idea of how they will be represented.  Conflicting views will be represented. Representation can, then, be more easily decided in the single member constituency with the non-transferable vote.</P>
    <P>We talk about P.R.  Everybody who has considered the matter properly knows that we have not got P.R. here, the type of P.R. envisaged originally by Mill, and others.  We have nothing of the kind here.  I was one of those who were particularly anxious to limit the number of members in a constituency. I believe, with Professor Hogan, that, if one intends to get away from the bad effects of a transferable vote in order to get good Government and a competent Parliament, the way to do it is by restricting and cutting down to the minimum the number of representatives in each particular constituency. That is why we introduced the three member constituencies.  If you had more members for each constituency, it would be more in the nature of P.R., but, as the Minister for External Affairs pointed out, if one were to adopt truly P.R., one would have to go completely outside the range within which we have been operating in recent times.  Even within the widest range, I think the system has its dangers; it does induce an artificial growth of Parties.</P>
    <P>Now, I am one of those who stand for the idea of Party.  I believe Burke was quite right in his views about Party.  I believe Parties are necessary. If one wants to make progress, it is essential that there should be a group which believes that certain things are in the national interest and that the common good will be promoted by advancing those things.  In order to get results they must get together and <Col N="885" /> co-operate.  As individuals, they will not get results.  Human intelligence demands that individuals with similar interests co-operate, one with another, and form a common group.  The more there is in common the more effectively will they co-operate and the more successfully will they work together.  In any deliberative assembly, such as a democratic Parliament is, it is inevitable that an Opposition must grow.</P>
    <P>There are few people who can say they were elected under both systems. I happen to have been elected under both systems in more than one constituency, so I know something about both.  One thing is certain, that is, that under the straight vote system, you have a simple method and the people who vote know what they are doing.  However, we have not a proportional system as it is.  The idea that mathematical accuracy of representation is produced by our system or by any one of these systems is all nonsense.  Anyone who examines the rules of the voting knows that is not so.</P>
    <P>Neither is it true that you inevitably get minority government, or what is called minority government, under the straight vote system.  An example that occurs to my mind is this.  Suppose you have candidates A, B and C.  Candidate A gets 35 per cent.; B gets 40 per cent.; and C gets 25 per cent. C is eliminated as being the lowest, and, supposing 20 per cent. of his votes went to A and 5 per cent. to B, that would bring A to 55 per cent. and B to 45 per cent.  Therefore A gets in and B is out.  But B had second preferences.  Those who voted for B had second preferences, and these are not even looked at.  It could very well be that the second preference votes would go something like this: 30 for C and 10 for A; 35 and 10 are 45 and 25 and 30 are 55.  Therefore C, and not A, would get in.  So let us not hear any more about the mathematical accuracy of the existing system.</P>
    <P>It is plausible; it is attractive; but to the minds of those who want to be fair, it is based on the idea of Party representation and special-interest <Col N="886" /> representation.  It is not based on the fundamental idea that the representative should come to the deliberative assembly of the whole community with one object in view&mdash;the common good.  It is because we believe that the straight vote system will do that that we are proposing this change.  It is simpler, more easily understood and gets just as good results.</P>
    <P>When you speak about candidate B with 40 per cent. getting in where you had a division of 35, 40 and 25 per cent., you are not going to say that the 35 per cent. and the 25 per cent. should be added together and that it is a matter of 60 against 40.  It is nothing of the kind, because we may fairly well assume that, in the case of the 35 per cent. and 25 per cent. candidates who did not get seats, there would be amongest the voters in the two sections, a large number&mdash;in proportion roughly to the 35, 40 and 25&mdash;in favour of the 40 and that, in fact, although the candidate with 40 per cent. appeared not to have an overall majority, he has, in fact, by having a substantial favourite majority, a majority entirely.</P>

      <P>With regard to that, it is one of the things that gave me most anxiety.  I looked into it, and I tried to see how it works, but I assure the Senator who asked me the question that if he looks into it, he will find it produces exactly the same results&mdash;not quite in the same way, but exactly the same results&mdash;as the system of the multiple-member constituencies. I was attracted by it.  I felt the natural attraction of it.  Was it better to start with?  But then politics are a practical science.  I should like to tell scientists here that some of the greatest thinkers of the world think of it as being the greatest of the practical sciences.  I hope we are all proud of that.  It is a practical science; it is not merely a theoretical science to be looked at.  You have to see how these matters work out in <Col N="887" /> operation and very often something very attractive on paper when worked out in practice, because of the evils that have not been anticipated, because of the extent of human <Col N="888" /> ingenuity and the extraordinary nature of the human will, has to be attended to very carefully indeed.</P>

      <P>We have discussed this at great length here in the Seanad and we have had experience of the long speeches made on the opposite side.  If there are to be more of them, no one knows when it will be finished. I think it reasonable that Senators should be asked to hand in any amendments they have and to ask that the Committee Stage be taken next week.</P>

      <P>There have been long speeches on both sides of the <Col N="889" /> House.  The House has never failed to come to an agreement with regard to the time for the Committee Stage of a Bill.  I suggest, in case it is thought there may be delay, there is no intention to obstruct at all.</P>

      <P>No one should know that better than I should, Sir. There is no intention to obstruct this Bill, but it is a matter in which a great many people are interested and they are very anxious that this Committee Stage should be postponed until next Wednesday week.  I do not think a week makes any difference; once the Committee Stage is over the further stages of the Bill can certainly be facilitated.  I can assure you, Sir, and the House, that this is not suggested with the intention of postponing the actual decisions on the Bill, but in order that the Bill should be properly discussed.  On the Committee Stage we shall have an opportunity of discussing each matter in the Bill separately.  I think we should come to agreement on this matter and that views of the Opposition should be heard on this aspect of the case.</P>

      <P>On a point of order, speaking as an Independent, I must say that at first sight next Wednesday would appear to me to be quite acceptable, but I understand that an amendment, in order to be in time, would have to be in either to-morrow or the day after&mdash;to-day is Thursday &mdash;if we are to debate this next week.</P>

      <P>I would like to support the plea.  We need the Official Report of this week's debate <Col N="890" /> before we begin to formulate amendments. I feel that I express the opinion of university Senators by saying we would consider it of great service in discussing this Bill to have the Committee Stage postponed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasMullins" hpid="Tomás Ó Maoláin Tomás Ó Maoláin">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Ó Maoláin</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the debate has gone on so long that even Senator Quinlan and his friends must have made up their minds as to how they would like to amend the Bill? Since amendments do not have to be handed in until Monday, there is no reason why they could not hand them in and let the Committee Stage commence on Wednesday.  I think it is quite reasonable.</P>

      <P>On behalf of the Labour group, I would ask that the Committee Stage be taken on Wednesday week.  Neither Senator Mullins nor anyone else knew when the Committee Stage would fall to be considered, until five minutes ago.  An important Bill such as this is deserving of very close study and the Leader of the House should not attempt to push the Opposition about, by asking for a Committee Stage at so early a date.</P>

      <P>This Bill has been given a Second Reading by one vote. A great many people in the House are interested in it.  I know that by a division, if he succeeds in getting one, Senator Ó Maoláin could decide to have the Committee Stage next Wednesday by one vote, but that procedure never took place before in this House, and I think a precedent should not be established now.  I speak as the Leader of the Opposition, and as the Leader of the House for two periods, and there has never been that trouble in regard to the Committee Stage of a Bill.  I think the Senator can be assured that the Committee Stage will be conducted reasonably&mdash; and all the more so&mdash;if it is put back to Wednesday week.</P>
      <P>Senator Ó Maoláin knows the Committee Stage can be conducted almost identically with the Second Stage&mdash;practically everything on the Second Reading would be in order on the Committee Stage.  I have no desire to see that and I do not think anybody here would have such a desire, but people ought to have the amendments in their hands before a debate starts.  Whatever assurances I have given I have carried out, to the moment, and I should like to give an assurance, as far as I and those for whom I speak are concerned, that it is not our intention to obstruct this Bill, but there is a very grave objection to the Bill being taken next Wednesday.  Our desire is for orderly debate and I think, for the sake of the House itself, it would be better if this matter were postponed until Wednesday week.</P>

      <P>I am quite willing to accept Senator Hayes's word because my experience is that he has always kept it, but I am not prepared to accept the promises of some of the others on the opposite side.  I place no reliance whatever on them.  In the event that it is postponed until Wednesday week, is there any hope that it would finish within a week? Could we sit three days to finish it?</P>

There is no reason for the haste.  This is the orderly progression to get this Bill made law by the people.</P>

      <P>When we meet, when we see the amendments, and see what progress is made, we can come to some conclusion whether we will sit two days or three days.  In my 20 years' experience, there has never been failure between the Leader of the House and the Leader of the Opposition to come to an agreement, and I have been in both places with different people opposite me.  There never has been failure yet and I think Senator Ó Maoláin can rely on reasonable treatment, if he yields in this matter.</P>
