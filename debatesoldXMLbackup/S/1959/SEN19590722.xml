      <P>Business will be taken as on the Order Paper down to No. 2.  I might mention that we shall have the Appropriation Bill tomorrow and that it is expected we shall complete discussion of the following Bills before rising for the Summer Recess: Export Promotion Bill, 1959, Industrial Credit (Amendment) Bill, 1959, Tourist Traffic Bill, 1959, Undeveloped Areas (Amendment) Bill, 1959, Sea Fisheries (Amendment) Bill, 1959, Grass Meal Production Bill, 1959, and Air Navigation and Transport (No. 2) Bill, 1959.</P>

    <Title>Maritime Jurisdiction Bill, 1959&mdash;Second and Subsequent Stages.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Minister for External Affairs (Mr. Aiken) Frank Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Minister for External Affairs (Mr. Aiken)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is hoped that this Bill will resolve the doubts and uncertainties which have sometimes arisen as to the precise extent of the jurisdiction of the State in the sea areas which are adjacent to our coasts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps the most notable feature of the Bill is that it will enable what is termed the &ldquo;straight baseline system&rdquo; to be applied to parts of the Irish coast.  As Senators are aware, the breadth of the territorial sea is normally measured from low-water mark on the coastline.  Under the straight baseline system, the breadth of the <Col N="368" /> territorial sea is measured from straight lines joining outermost points on the mainland, islands, and low-tide elevations on which installations permanently above sea level have been built.</P>
    <P>The straight baseline system was approved by the International Court of Justice in 1951 in the Anglo-Norwegian Case.  The principles enunciated by the Court in that Case have been formulated in the Convention on the Territorial Sea and Contiguous Zone which was drawn up by the first United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea held at Geneva in 1958.  Although the Convention is not yet in force, its provisions dealing with the straight baseline system may justly be said to represent the present international law on the subject. Article 4 of that Convention reads as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>1.  In localities where the coast line is deeply indented and cut into, or if there is a fringe of islands along the coast in its immediate vicinity, the method of straight baselines joining appropriate points may be employed in drawing the baseline from which the breadth of the territorial sea is measured.</P>
    <P>2.  The drawing of such baselines must not depart to any appreciable extent from the general direction of the coast, and the sea areas lying within the lines must be sufficiently closely linked to the land domain to be subject to the régime of internal waters.</P>
    <P>3.  Baselines shall not be drawn to and from low-tide elevations, unless lighthouses or similar installations which are permanently above sea level have been built on them.</P>
    <P>4.  Where the method of straight baselines is applicable under the provisions of paragraph 1, account may be taken, in determining particular baselines, of economic interests peculiar to the region concerned, the reality and the importance of which are clearly evidenced by a long usage.</P>
    <P>5.  The system of straight baselines may not be applied by a State in such a manner as to cut off from the <Col N="369" /> high seas the territorial sea of another State.</P>
    <P>6.  The coastal State must clearly indicate straight baselines on charts, to which due publicity must be given.</P>
    <P>Having regard to these principles and considering the nature of the Irish coast, it is the intention of the Government to prescribe straight baselines from a point in Donegal in an anti-clockwise direction along the northwest, west and south coasts to an appropriate point on the Wexford mainland.  The result of the application of the straight baseline system will be a very considerable increase in the area over which this country is entitled to exercise the right of exclusive fishery jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>Senators may ask why we have in the Bill chosen a 3 mile limit for our territorial seas.  The answer is that we believe that the concepts of territorial sea and exclusive fishery limits are distinguishable and that a narrow breadth of territorial sea&mdash;as distinct from exclusive fishery limits &mdash; is in our own interests.  Extensions of the territorial sea have considerable strategic implications which do not result from an extension of the exclusive fishery limits.  Furthermore, a second United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea is due to be held in the Spring of next year to deal with the very problems of the breadth of the territorial sea and exclusive fishery limits; and we do not wish in any way to anticipate the outcome of that Conference.  I have repeatedly stated and I say it again that our preference in any question of extended limits is that they should be achieved, in so far as possible, by international agreement rather than by unilateral action. Accordingly, pending the result of the Conference next Spring, the breadth of our territorial seas will, under the Bill, remain as always save that in the parts of the coast where straight baselines are applied it will be measured in a different manner.  At the same time, I wish to make it clear that our adoption in the Bill of the three-mile limit for the territorial seas should not be taken as implying that we necessarily regard the three-mile limit as the existing rule of international law.</P>
    <P>The third of the three principal <Col N="370" /> objects of the Bill is contained in the very important provision which empowers the Government by Order to extend the exclusive fishery limits of the State.  Such an Order would require resolutions of approval by both Houses.  As I have already stated, our expressed preference has been for a separation of the concepts of territorial sea and exclusive fishery limits and we trust that the trend towards such a separation which was manifest in Geneva in 1958 will find full acceptance at the pending Conference in the coming spring.  While we cannot claim to be in the same category as some European countries whose economies are overwhelmingly dependent on fishing, nonetheless our fishing industry is an important and expanding one and it is only natural in conformity with the general international trend we should have under consideration the extension of our exclusive fishery area. We do not, however, propose to make an order extending the exclusive fishery limits pending the outcome of the 1960 Conference.  After that Conference we will review the position.</P>
    <P>The Bill also provides that the Government may take conservation action in areas of the high seas adjacent to the territorial seas.  This is a new departure in the international field and is based on Article 7 of the 1958 Geneva Convention on Fishing and Conservation of the Living Resources of the High Seas.  This Convention has not yet been ratified and is not in force, and action under Section 7 is not contemplated in the immediate future. Before measures of conservation are taken unilaterally there would have to be negotiations with the other States concerned and the measures taken must not discriminate against foreign fishermen.  Furthermore, the need for the measures must be urgent and must be based on scientific findings.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Lands is empowered in the Bill to issue a permit authorising fishing within the exclusive fishery limits for experimental purposes by a foreign sea fishing boat. Such a permit would be issued only in exceptional circumstances, for example, to allow study of a particular <Col N="371" /> unfamiliar method of fishing.  The Minister is empowered to attach various restrictive conditions to the permit.</P>
    <P>Section 10 of the Bill deals with offences in the territorial seas and internal waters.  Such offences are offences within the jurisdiction of the State.  However, although we claim such jurisdiction, it would be exercised only in suitable instances.  It is recognised that, under international law, offences on board ship in the territorial seas are subject in the first place to the law of the ship's flag and the coastal State has concurrent jurisdiction only; furthermore, the jurisdiction of the coastal State is exercised only in certain well defined circumstances, for example, where the consequences of the offence extend to the coastal State.  As a further safeguard for the rights of aliens Section II of the Bill provides that proceedings against an alien for an alleged offence in the territorial seas on board or by means of a foreign ship, shall not be instituted without a certificate from the Minister for External Affairs that the proceedings are expedient.</P>
    <P>Provision has been made for the prescribing of charts which will be received in evidence.  Advantage has also been taken to repeal the Territorial Waters Jurisdiction Act, 1878, and also some old enactments relating to fishing.  In the absence of adaptation or by reason of implied repeal it is doubtful if these statutes could be said to be in force at all, but they will be now repealed in so far as they are or ever were in force.</P>
    <P>The Bill is designed to come into operation on the 1st October, 1959, that is the day on which the Fisheries (Consolidation) Act, 1959, which is now law, also comes into operation. This is necessary because reference is made throughout the Bill to the Fisheries (Consolidation) Act, 1959.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the House will agree with the Minister that it is desirable that this Bill should be introduced in order to settle, with more precision than heretofore, the limits of territorial waters.  There have been some difficulties in the district courts, <Col N="372" /> where the skippers of foreign trawlers have been arrested, in determining what the limits of the territorial waters are.  This Bill should go some distance towards helping the courts to determine whether or not foreign trawlers have been guilty of offences.</P>
      <P>I take it that the charts to which the Minister has referred which are provided for in Section 13 will be something in the form of maps showing the baselines from which it will be perfectly apparent to a court whether a foreign vessel has contravened this Act.  I am not quite happy about the procedure provided for under Section 10 which relates to the jurisdiction of the courts in trying persons charged under this Act.  It certainly is not clear that the offences are to be tried in a district court.  When the Bill, in Section 10, refers to &ldquo;competent jurisdiction&rdquo;, I wonder would the Minister indicate what court is intended.</P>
      <P>With regard to Section 11, which is the section dealing with aliens who may be arrested for contravention of this Act, and infringing territorial waters, it seems to me that there is a deficiency in this section of a procedural character.No proceedings can be issued without a certificate of the Minister for External Affairs that the institution of proceedings is, in his opinion, expedient.The section however does not go on to deal with how that certificate will be proved in court.  It seems to me that there should be a provision in the section similar to what is provided in Section 13, that the certificate when produced will be evidence of its having been issued by the Minister.</P>
      <P>A provision of that kind is quite common where certificates are issued. It is to be found in the Agricultural Wages Acts and other similar Acts, and in the Social Welfare Act, 1952, that on the production of the certificate, <i>prima facie</i> it is evidence that the certificate was issued and no proof of the signature of the Minister or any other such proof is necessary.</P>
      <P>It seems to me that that section cannot be operated without some such machinery as I am suggesting.  Subject to that, there does not seem to be anything in the Bill which ought not command the approval of this House.</P>

      <P>Is cúis áthais domsa go bhfuil an Bille seo tagtha fé dheireadh.  Is Bille é ba cheart a thabhairt chun cinn a luaithe a fuaireamar údarás Rialtais dúinn féin in Éirinn chun a dhéanta.  Cúis ghearáin do bea é le fada ag iascairí agus na daoine go raibh spéis acu is gcúrsaí iascaireachta in Éirinn an gléas a bhí ann go bhféadhfadh tráiléirí ó thíortha eile teacht isteach i mbéal na gcuan sa chuid thiar theas d'Éirinn.</P>
      <P>Mar shampla, do luafainn iascairí i mBá an Daingin.  Tá Bá an Daingin óna 10 go dtí a 12 de mhílte ar leithead ag an mbéal.  Teora trí mhíle a bhí mar chosc ar thráiléirí ón iasacht a sheachaint.  D'fhág san go raibh cead agus ceart dlí ag na tráiléirí sin ó Shasana, ón bhFrainc agus ón Spáinn iascach leathslí suas soir i mBá an Daingin agus ní i gcónaí a bheadh teora na dtrí míle mar chosc ortha.</P>
      <P>Maidir leis na línte bunaidh go bhfuil tagairt sa Bhille dóibh, is mór an trua liomsa nach bhfuil léarscáil de shaghas éigin ag gabháil leis an mBille a thaispeánfadh dúinn cá háit a bhfuiltear chun na línte bunaidh sin a dhearadh.  Im thuairimise sé ba cheart do dhéanamh maidir leis na línte bunaidh sin sa chomharsanacht thiar theas ná tosnú obair ag an gCarraig Aonair as san go dtí Teach Duinn nó, mar a tugtar air, an Tarbh, ón Tarbh go Sceilg Michíl agus ó Sceilg Michíl go dtí an Tiaracht agus ón dTiaracht go cúl Chnoc Bréanainn agus as sin go Ceann Chiarraighe agus as san go dtí Ceann Léime.</P>
      <P>B'shin é im thuairimise an líne bunaidh laistaigh agus de réir mar atá an dlí fé láthair tá ceartas againn ar iascaireacht agus údarás Rialtais ar feadh trí mhíle amach ón mbunlíne sin.  Ní dóigh liom féin gur leor trí mhíle agus tá súil agam ná ceanglóidh an Bille seo aigne an Rialtais Éire a bheith teoranta in a chuid farraigí laistigh de thrí mhíle ón mbunlíne atá luaite agam den chuid thiar theas den dúiche.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Níl fhios agam cad tá beartaithe ag an Aire chun a dhéanamh mar theorainn laistigh, teorainn intíre, do limistéir iascaigh agus limistéir údaráis náisiúnta ar an gcósta.  Tá dhá <Col N="374" /> rud i gceist maidir le teorainneacha tíre.  D'éirigh na teorainneacha farraige sin ó dhream áirithe den phobal féin, iascairí, agus an riachtanas leis na cearta seo a chosaint don chomharsanacht ar fad.  Tá tábhacht i gceann acu do chuid dár muintir féin, lucht iascaireachta na tíre.</P>
    <P>An tarna cheann isé údarás náisiúnta atá i gceist.  Ní hionann an dá rud, agus tharlódh nach ionann teorainneacha farraige dóibh.</P>
    <P>Is trua liom gur thagair an tAire do thrí mhíle d'uisce imealltíre, mar is dóigh liom nach leor trí mhíle.  Tá fhios agam gurb é sin an dlí atá ann fé láthair.  Tá fhios agam, leis, má chuirtear na bunlínte nua sin ar léarscáil go méadódh sé sin údarás agus cearta iascaigh chun níos mó d'uiscí na Éireann bheith fén ár gcomrándaíocht féin.</P>
    <P>Níor mhaith liomsa a thuiscint, nó go mbeadh se i gceist, go bhféadfadh tráiléirí iasachta bonn na fairrge a scríobadh glan i ngiorracht aon trí mhíle d'aon cheann tíre nó cósta.  Is dóigh liom gur ceart an limistéar a bheith níos leithne, ar aon iasc do phortú agus a méadú agus dul in iomadúlacht.Sin ceist nach féidir, mar a dúirt an tAire, cur isteach anois air &mdash; go dtí go mbeidh an comhdháil i dtosach na bliana seo chugainn i dtaobh iascach tíre agus an na teorainneacha a bhaineann leis na nithe sin.</P>
    <P>Tá rud eile i gceist agus is tábhachtach an rud é.  Tá cearta áirithe againn ar uiscí áirithe cois cuan agus cois cósta na tíre agus is le hiascairí dúchasacha na cearta sin.  Ach is annamh ar fad atá an gléas againn chun na cearta san a chosaint agus is eol domsa agus is eol do dhaoine ar chósta Chiarraighe agus ar chósta Chontae an Chláir, go dtagann longa iascaireachta ó thíortha iasachta, taobh istigh den teorainn sin agus go mbeirid ualaí éisc leo, agus gan éinne ann le hiad do chosc, mar ní féidir le hiascairí gan longa iad do choimeád amach.</P>
    <P>Tuigimse gur gá báid chosanta a bheith níos flúirsí againn, d'aon ghnó chun ceart na n-iascairí a choimeád slán agus eagla agus scáth do chur ar shladairí iasachta a thugann foghanna <Col N="375" /> iascaigh go neamhdhleathach ar ár gcósta fhéin.</P>
    <P>Beidh sé sin níos riachtanaí má dhruidtear na bunlínte amach ó cheann tíre go dtí oileán agus ó oileán go dtí ceann tíre.  Beidh riachtanas le báid chosanta a rachadh fén bhfarraige mhór agus a cuirfeadh an ruaig ar na ruathairí sin a thagann isteach agus a scuabann leo an t-iasc a ba cheart a bheith ag iascairí na hÉireann.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith liomsa an tAire a mholadh mar gheall ar an mBille seo a tabhairt chun cinn.  Is dóigh liom go mbeidh fáilte roimhe.  Beidh fáilte roimhe ag iascairí na hÉireann ar fuaid na tíre agus molfaidh siad é.</P>
    <P>Mar a dúirt cheana, ní dóigh liom gur ceart dúinn ár naigne a cheangal do limistéar sin na dtrí mhíle.  Tá fhios againn go bhfuil an Íoslainn agus an Rúis ag iarraidh na limistéir a mhéadú go dtí 12 míle, ar mhaithe le hiascairí ins na dúichí acusan.  Beimidne, is cinnte, ag lorg rud éigin mar sin agus níor mhaith liom &mdash; agus ní dóigh liom gur mhaith an rud é &mdash; go dtuigfí go mbeimís sásta le trí mhíle beaga, gan cead a bheith againn ár n-údarás farraige a leathnú amach go dtí 6 mhíle nó 10 míle, chun pórú éisc agus suaimhneas do gach scol éisc a bheadh ag druidim agus ag iomadú cois an chósta.</P>
    <P>Tá fhios againn an t-olc a dhéanann na tráiléirí san ins na bainc iascaigh in aice linn.  Tá bainc iascaigh ar feadh 50 míle siar ón gcósta againne.  Tagann na tráiléirí thar an limistéar isteach agus scriosann siad na bainc cois tíre a mbíonn an t-iasc ag pórú agus a iomadú iontu.</P>
    <P>Mar gheall air sin, ba mhaith liom a chomhairliú don Aire gan sinn féin a cheangal le limistéar trí mhíle d'fharraige chósta na hÉireann lasmuigh den líne intíre a bhéas againn.</P>
    <P>Molaim an tAire agus an Rialtas toisc an Bille seo a thabhairt isteach anois fé dheireadh agus is cinnte go molfaidh iascairí na hÉireann chomh maith iad.</P>

      <P>Senator O'Quigley raised <Col N="376" /> the question of what was meant by &ldquo;a court of competent jurisdiction&rdquo; under Section 10.  It simply means that a court which is competent to deal with the offence, if it were committed within our shores, will be competent to deal with the offence, if it is committed on board a foreign ship.  The extent of the jurisdiction of our courts, the various courts, is limited; and they would be limited also in dealing with offences which are committed in internal waters or in our coastal waters.  I do not think there would be any difficulty about that section.</P>
      <P>In Section 11, it is set out that no proceedings taken for the prosecution of an alien for an offence alleged to have been committed in the territorial seas shall be instituted without the certificate of the Minister.  It means that the official of the State, or the Attorney General, would have to consult with the Minister for External Affairs before proceedings were instituted in the Courts.  There would be no necessity for the Judge or the District Justice presiding over the Court to see the certificate of the Minister, because the case would not come before him unless proceedings were instituted in the ordinary way by the Attorney General or the State Solicitor, whoever might institute them.</P>
      <P>Ar an bpointe a luaigh an Seanadóir Ó Siochfhradha tá cearta againn dul amach níos faide na trí mhíle ach caithfimíd ordú a chur tríd an Dáil agus an Seanad.  Ní maith linn dul níos faide ná trí mhíle go dtí go dtiocfaidh an Coinbhinsiún le chéile an tEarrach seo chugainn agus go dtí go mbeidh deireadh lena chuid oibre.  Ins an gCoinbhinsiún a bhí ann bliain ó shin nó mar sin sa Ghinéive, bhíodar ar tí aontú go dtabharfadh an Coinbhinsiún seacht míle &ldquo;territorial waters&rdquo; agus seacht míle eile ina mbeadh ceart ag an tír gur léi an cósta tráiléirí do choiméad amach ach amháin do dhaoine a bhí ag cleachtadh iascaireachta ann le fada.  Ba bheag nach ndeachaigh an riail sin tríd agus tá súil agam go rachaidh sí tríd ins an gCoinbhinsiún a thiocfaidh le chéile laistigh de shé mhí nó mar sin.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>It appears that the Minister for Lands may issue permits to foreign fishing vessels to fish within a prescribed area for a particular type of fish which will be described in the permit.  The issue of that type of permit would give rise to a certain amount of difficulty, in the sense that fishermen in an area may wish to know why a foreign trawler or a foreign fishing vessel is permitted to fish in waters in which they customarily fish.  Is it intended that the Minister for Lands, when issuing these permits, will publish any notice to the effect that a permit has been issued in respect of a vessel in a particular area?  Secondly, for the purposes of avoiding unnecessary interference with such a trawler which has got a permit, in what way is it intended to bring it to the notice of those who are customarily charged with looking after our territorial waters that a particular trawler fishing is there as of right, under this Bill?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="378" /> It seems to me that one of our vessels may unnecessarily interfere with a fishing vessel which has a right under this section simply because that protective vessel has got no notice.  It is merely a matter of machinery.  Perhaps the Minister would indicate how it is intended to implement the section in the respect I have mentioned?</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Fisheries is very keen on having this section inserted because the art and science of fishing is progressing all the time.  He wants to have the right to hire a foreign ship or permit a foreign ship to fish in our territorial waters for the purpose of giving the Minister for Fisheries and the fishermen generally the benefit of what they discover as to the new methods of fishing, and so on. I think the Minister would be very wise when issuing a permit of this kind, to give public notice of the fact that he has granted the permit so that nobody will be surprised when they see a foreign ship fishing within forbidden waters.  Naturally, if the Minister for Fisheries issued such a permit, he would also tell the Department of Defence and warn the officers in command of the fishery protection vessels that ship No. so and so, name so and so, has permission to fish within the waters.</P>

      <P>The Minister has said that his interpretation of this section is that proceedings for the prosecution of an alien shall not be issued unless the Attorney General, or the appropriate authority for issuing the proceedings, has obtained a certificate from him and that that is essential.  I do not agree with the Minister's interpretation.  I think I am entirely right in saying that if this section is not now amended, another Bill will have to be introduced to amend it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Section stands, it is a condition <Col N="379" /> precedent to the prosecution of any proceedings that the Minister for External Affairs must have issued a certificate saying that the institution of these proceedings is, in his opinion, expedient.  That is what the section says &mdash; that proceedings shall not be instituted without a certificate of the Minister.</P>
    <P>When somebody is returned for trial to the circuit court, after depositions have been taken, the first thing the alien would be entitled to see produced is the certificate of the Minister.  At that stage, the Minister for External Affairs at the time may perhaps find himself subpoenaed by the Attorney General to a circuit court, perhaps in Donegal, to prove that he issued the certificate and to produce it.  That seems an unnecessary waste of the Minister's valuable time.</P>
    <P>The Minister says the Attorney General, or the appropriate authority, will issue proceedings only after the certificate has been issued by the Minister.  If that were the case, then the section should read to this effect: &ldquo;Proceedings shall not be issued unless the appropriate authority, after consultation with the Minister for External Affairs...&rdquo;, or &ldquo;with the consent of the Minister for External Affairs...&rdquo; However, that is not what the section says.</P>
    <P>There are quite a number of provisions in various Acts which do not require the proof of the consent of the Minister.  Where one Minister does something with the consent of another Minister, there is no necessity to prove that.  For instance, you find statements in regulations such as, say, &ldquo;The Minister for Justice, after consultation with the Minister for Finance, hereby...&rdquo; The Minister should think a second time about this and perhaps he could introduce an amendment on Report Stage.</P>

      <P>First of all, Senator O'Quigley should know that Section 11 does not apply to offences against Part XIII of the Fisheries Consolidation Act, or to offences under Section 7 of this Act which relates to the conservation of the living resources of the sea, so that in the case of fishing <Col N="380" /> offences the certificate of the Minister for External Affairs is not required in order that proceedings may be instituted.  The permission or the certificate of the Minister for External Affairs is required before other types of proceedings can be instituted for example, robbery, or some offence committed on board ship within our coastal waters.  Those cases are very rare and I myself do not remember one.  As the Senator knows, a ship is governed by the laws of its own flag. We have jurisdiction, but it is seldom exercised unless the crime or the offence committed on board ship spills over onto the land or has an effect outside the ship itself.</P>
      <P>I am not quite sure whether, under some other Act, the Court may not be bound to take cognisance of a certificate issued by the Minister for External Affairs under the Seal of the Department but, in any event, I do not anticipate that there will be a great number of cases of that sort.  If it is true that a court might not take cognisance of an ordinary certificate under the Seal of the Minister's office, I suppose some official of the Department would have to go down and testify to the fact that the Minister signed the certificate.</P>

      <P>Section 12 is a saving as to jurisdiction.  There is only a small point that occurs to me on this.  The section says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Nothing in this Act shall be construed to be in derogation of any jurisdiction of the State under international law or to affect or prejudice any jurisdiction conferred by any other enactment or now by law existing.</P>
      <P>I wonder in that context has regard been had to the provisions of Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution?  Articles 2 and 3 are the basis of the jurisdiction of this Parliament and of the Government over the whole of the national territory which includes the territorial seas.  Article 2 provides that:&mdash;</P>
      <P>The national territory consists of the whole of Ireland, its islands and the territorial seas.</P>
      <P>That creates the jurisdiction of Parliament over the territorial seas and it would be more appropriate to acknowledge the supremacy of the Constitution in that regard in priority to international law or any laws made under the Constitution.  I think, therefore, that the section should read:</P>
      <P>Nothing in this Act shall be construed to be in derogation of any jurisdiction of the State under the Constitution or under international law or to affect or prejudice any jurisdiction conferred by any other enactment or now by law existing.</P>

This clause is put in to emphasise &mdash; in a way, I suppose it is necessary &mdash; that we are not changing anything except what we are changing specifically in this Bill. There are certain powers the Revenue Commissioners have to go very much further out than the territorial waters, if there is a suspected offence against the Customs Acts.

      <P>I do not agree that this has anything to do with the Customs Acts or any attempts to enforce the law.  What this section, as I understand it, is there for is to preserve the right of the State at any time to say that its territorial waters shall extend six miles beyond the base line which it is intended to introduce as a result of the passing of this Bill.  This jurisdiction under the Constitution extends at the present time to the three-mile limit. In the new situation, the territorial waters would be extended to six miles and it is to preserve the right of the State to extend its jurisdiction that this section appears in the Bill.  I entirely agree with the Minister that we cannot change the Constitution by an Act of Parliament.  The Government could not even change it in a referendum.</P>

      <P>The Senator, I think, is confusing territorial seas and exclusive fishery limits.  Section 3 deals with the outer limit of the territorial seas and we have deliberately taken no powers <Col N="383" /> in this Bill to extend the territorial seas by Order.  If we want to change the width of the territorial seas, it is an important enough question to be the subject of a special Bill.  There is no power in this Bill to extend the territorial seas beyond three nautical miles outside the base line.  There is power, however, to extend the exclusive fishery rights.  I consider it wise to make provision for extending the exclusive fishery rights because we are hopeful that we shall have an international agreement before very long which will recognise the right of every State to extend its exclusive fishery limits very much beyond the three-mile limit.</P>

He asked if it was intended that this would be printed in different languages.

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Minister for Finance (Dr. Ryan) James Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1957, following the report of a Committee of inquiry an Act was passed in Britain which had the effect of abolishing the need for endorsing any cheque which is paid into the bank account of the payee.  Since then banks here are being caused no little inconvenience as numbers of cheques drawn on them in favour of persons resident in the Six Counties and Britain are collected for payment by the banks there without being endorsed and the banks here are obliged to return them for endorsement.  This involves work and expense.</P>
      <P>The Irish Banks and the Association of Chambers of Commerce have asked that the advantage of the abolition of the need for endorsement should be extended to them and their customers and members.  About 27½ million cheques, etc. are issued in the State annually and of these about 25 million are paid into the payees' bank accounts.  The time spent by business firms in endorsing cheques and by banks in checking the endorsements and in dealing with those found to be technically irregular is, therefore, considerable and quite a substantial saving would be affected by the abolition of endorsements.  The present Bill does this.  In addition it makes further provisions in the law relating to cheques similar to those introduced by the British 1957 Act and thus restores uniformity in the matter with the Six Counties and Britain.  This is a matter of some importance in view of the larger exchange of cheques between the two areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provisions of the Bill, which protect banks paying or collecting unendorsed cheques, do not explicitly exclude cheques cashed over the counter.  This would create an anomaly as it would mean that a banker who paid a wrong person on an unendorsed cheque would attract some liability <Col N="385" /> whereas if he paid out in good faith on a forged signature he would be protected under the Bills of Exchange Act, 1882.  I am advised, however, that the banks intend to follow the practice of the Six Counties and British banks in continuing to insist on the endorsement of cheques cashed over the counter.</P>
    <P>Section 1 of the Bill extends to unendorsed cheques and similar instruments the protection which a paying banker at present enjoys in respect of endorsed cheques and other instruments.Similar protection is afforded to the collecting banker by section 4 (3).  Section 2 preserves the existing rights of a collecting banker as a holder of a cheque in due course notwithstanding that the cheque has not been endorsed.  Section 3 provides that a paid unendorsed cheque is evidence of the receipt of the sum payable by the cheque and thus will have the effect of reducing the number of cases in which drawers of cheques will require the payees to give receipts on the backs of cheques.  I should stress that the section would not make a paid unendorsed cheque conclusive evidence of receipt but that it would be open to any person to put forward rebutting evidence.</P>
    <P>Two further amendments of the law relating to cheques and similar instruments are made by the Bill.  Sections 4 (1) and 4 (2) extend to uncrossed cheques and similar uncrossed instruments the protection against claims for conversion afforded to collecting banks by section 82 of the Bills of Exchange Act, 1882, as amended.  At the same time Section 4 (1) (b) provides that this extended protection applies where any of the instruments in question is accepted for collection and the payee's account is immediately credited.</P>
    <P>Section 5 consolidates the present legislation regarding the application of the provisions of the Bills of Exchange Act, 1882, relating to crossed cheques to instruments not being bills of exchange.</P>
    <P>The consequential repeals of existing legislation are dealt with in section 6 and mentioned in the Schedule to the Bill.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="386" /> In order to give banks and the business community time in which to prepare for the introduction of the new arrangements section 7 (2) provides that this Bill shall not come into operation until three months after it has been passed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGuire</NameTxt>
      <P>This, like the Bankers' Books Evidence (Amendment) Bill which we dealt with yesterday, is a Bill that is welcomed by the banks and business community.  It is something which, I feel, was necessary because of our intimate relationships with both Northern Ireland and Great Britain in the exchange of money for the payment of goods and services. As the Minister said, the British Cheques Act of 1957 applies in Northern Ireland where, of course, there are many branches of banks which are situated in Southern Ireland and <i>vice versa.</i></P>
      <P>This Bill, as the Minister said, was asked for by the banks and chambers of commerce who went into the whole question in detail.  They could not see any particular difficulties in having the same legislation here as existed in England.  In fact, they felt it was essential that we should have the same law here in connection with cheques. No particular difficulties appear to have arisen in England or Northern Irelad in the carrying out of this new method of dealing with cheques.  I do not see why there should be much difficulty here.</P>
      <P>I note that the Minister in his statement answered some of the difficulties which were raised in the other House. I think he did so very satisfactorily.  I gathered from one of my colleagues that he is still not satisfied that the customers' interests will always be as secure as they were in the past.  Perhaps, I shall say something on that later on.  My own opinion and that of the general public is that the amount of time, trouble and expense saved will be well worth any little danger there might be of looseness.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to say something in general, though apropos this Bill, as this is the Second Reading.  The Bill is a step towards smoothing and improving  <Col N="387" /> the machinery for economic co-operation between the Republic, Great Britain and Northern Ireland.  I think it is becoming generally accepted in nearly all circles that that will help to further economic co-operation between this country, the North and Great Britain, which is a very good thing, indeed.</P>
    <P>It is not only good as an economic policy but as a good neighbour policy. Any form of coming together and working together with our northern fellow-countrymen cannot but improve relations between us and therefore advance the time when a real unity and a full unity may be established between us.</P>
    <P>The purpose, as we know, behind the economic arrangements involved in the Common Market and the Free Trade Area movement which have been going on in Europe, and about which we heard so much this week, is admittedly political.  It is known that people cannot be brought together politically in Europe, in order to defend western civilisation against the Communist menace, in a hurry and it has been conceived, and I think rightly conceived, that getting people together economically and in a businesslike way, will inevitably lead to political unity.  That, I think, is feasible in the shortly to be formed Common Market. The other nations who are not in the Common Market are showing the same feeling and they are getting together in another form, with the ultimate idea of uniting together in a political union. Perhaps we have there some kind of headline for us, and that this little Bill is one step towards co-operation with our neighbours.</P>
    <P>Yesterday in the Dáil the Taoiseach referred to his wish and his willingness to establish economic co-operation with the North.  I agree with those sentiments and I think we all agree with them, in the belief that this economic co-operation cannot but lead ultimately to closer relations of all kinds.  In business relations, one makes personal relations and when that is done, you can very often make political relations.  From small beginnings, I <Col N="388" /> think ultimately we may get very big results and therefore I think this Bill is a very good step and it could be copied in other spheres of our life so that we could get ourselves more on all fours with our neighbours.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOQuigley" hpid="Mr. O'Quigley Mr. O'Quigley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>I can see the necessity for introducing certain sections of this Bill in order to facilitate banking transactions between this country and Northern Ireland and Great Britain but the Bill goes a good deal further than that, as I hope to demonstrate shortly.  The Minister told us that this Bill has been introduced at the request of the banks and the chambers of Commerce and it is designed to facilitate business transactions and, presumably, to lower costs and improve efficiency.  I must say if that be the case, and it appears to be so, it amuses me vastly because there is hardly a meeting of directors of banks or of chambers of commerce at which they do not preach the necessity for greater efficiency and the cutting down of costs and increasing output.  They are not above complaining about increases in taxation and rates, or to attributing those increases to the inefficiency and wasteful procedures of public servants, whether in the Civil Service or the local authorities.</P>
      <P>It appears, however, that when the banks wish to increase efficiency, they do not go about it in the same way as they exhort other people to go about it.  They have to get a Bill introduced specially to facilitate them. If efficiency could be increased by Acts of Parliament, we could become a very efficient country in a short time.  It is certainly open to comment that the very people who spend so much time lecturing public servants on the need for efficiency and complaining about taxation require a Bill to facilitate them in their operations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said that certain objections were raised to some of the provisions of this Bill, particularly in relation to the position of a person who hands in a cheque which is cashed at the counter and where that person is not the owner of that cheque.  He says that the banks have indicated that they will follow the <Col N="389" /> practice of acquiring, presumably, due identification that he is the owner of the cheque.  If that be the case, I do not see why a saver is not made in the Bill.  I do not see why the Bill relieves banks from the obligation of satisfying themselves that the person who has endorsed a cheque and who hands it in is the owner because the banks will still have to segregate the unendorsed cheques from the endorsed cheques.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that the banks say they are not going to take advantage of that provision in this Bill.  In practice, they will not, but if they happen to get a cheque which belongs to me and which is cashed by Mr. X., I have no remedy against them and the banks can say that this was done in the course of business and plead this Act.  It seems to me that in that respect the Bill affords no protection to the person who will not have many cheques and who will not have facilities for safeguarding these cheques from theft or robbery. It also seems to me that this Bill is going to facilitate criminals in their activities.  Anybody who reads the newspapers must be disturbed by the number of raids made by burglars of business premises.  One is consoled, however, when one reads that there was very little cash in a safe which was blown open and that most of the contents consisted of cheques.  There is nothing to prevent somebody who gets some of these cheques, particularly if the owner happens to be a small businessman, from going to a small town, producing due identification and handing in the cheques unendorsed.  Under this Act, of course, the bank is to be relieved of all liability in relation to the owner of the cheque.</P>
    <P>The Minister has said that this measure has been introduced following the report of a British Commission of Inquiry.  That is factually correct. What the Minister has not told the House is that Deputy Sweetman told Dáil Éireann that the English Bill omitted some of the safeguards about which I am speaking and about which Deputy Sweetman spoke in the Dáil, safeguards for small business people in <Col N="390" /> relation to cheques cashed over the counter.  I have not seen the report of the Committee Stage of this Bill in the Dáil but certainly the Minister did not give what was, to my mind, a satisfactory explanation as to why he, like the British Parliament, omitted the safeguards provided in the report of the Commission of Inquiry in relation to the matters I have raised.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, with regard to the question raised by Senator McGuire, as far as this Bill goes, I do not think that the customer is less safeguarded than he was in the past.  After all, this Bill only goes so far as to say that if cheques are made payable to me and if I lodge them to my own account without endorsement, they are all right.  They are all right in this way, that the banker cannot be accused of negligence in accepting them; but, of course, if there is anything wrong with the cheque, if it is forged or anything like that, the law still stands.  It only relieves the banker of the charge of negligence in accepting such cheques. If a person has an account in the bank, it is presumed that the bank knows the person and believes he is an honest man and it, therefore, accepts these cheques without endorsement and pays them.  Now, if he is not an honest man, this would not prevent him doing a dishonest act by, say, forgery.  Therefore, I do not think it makes any difference so far as safeguarding the customer is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, in regard to paying a cheque over the counter, I am not sure if the last Senator understood me correctly. If someone gives me a cheque payable to me and if I go into the bank and say I want cash for it and hand the cheque in over the counter, they say: &ldquo;Endorse it and we will give you the cash.&rdquo;  So far as this Bill is concerned, it would safeguard the banker, if he did not ask me to endorse it.  It would safeguard him again to the extent that he could not be held guilty of negligence in not asking me to endorse it.  In practice &mdash; and this is the practice in Britain at the moment &mdash; the bankers in England and the North of Ireland have not gone so far as to pay cheques over the counter in that way without endorsement and the <Col N="391" /> bankers here will follow the same practice.  I should say that they will do so &ldquo;for the moment&rdquo;, because the legislation will be there and would enable them to change their practice in that regard at a later stage, if they thought it desirable to do so.</P>
    <P>The object of this Bill is to relieve the banker of the charge of negligence in accepting a cheque without endorsement and that is really as far as it goes. Of course, it deals with paying orders as well as with cheques.  A person can still see that his cheque will be lodged in the bank rather than cashed by another person, by crossing it.  A crossed cheque will still have the same rights and liabilities as it had before this Bill was passed.</P>
    <P>I do not think we are doing anything very revolutionary in passing this Bill. It may be a convenience for big firms. It is no great convenience for the ordinary person who is living by earning a salary and so on.  If he has to endorse a few cheques in the month it is no great hardship to him.  However, it will be a convenience to firms who get a lot of cheques.  It will be also a convenience to the banks in respect of examining the endorsement on every single cheque that goes through, which they are obliged to do at the moment.</P>
    <P>The point I made at the beginning is a very important point and it was referred to by Senator McGuire.  It refers to having one practice in the North of Ireland and England and a different practice here, leading to great inconvenience.  For instance, a person sends a cheque to the North of Ireland at the present time in payment of some account, the Northern recipient lodges it without endorsing it; it comes back to the paying bank here and they send it back again to the North of Ireland bank to be endorsed before they can deal with it.  That has led to a great deal of inconvenience and it was necessary for that reason to bring in this Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>When I saw this section, I formed the same conclusion as my colleague, Senator O'Quigley and as Deputy Sweetman did in the Dáil. The Minister has said they intend to follow some other practice.  We had much the same kind of point yesterday in connection with some other Bill. We should not legislate in this way, in the first place.  However, leaving that aside, what the banks are going to do in practice has nothing to do with the way this House legislates.  A bank can say subsequently in making a change: &ldquo;The Minister said such and such when introducing the Bill, but we are not bound by that; this is the law.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The point is that there is a significant change.  A cheque is made payable to the Minister for Finance &mdash; to Séamas Ó Riain in his private capacity &mdash; and something happens that cheque. It disappears through a lot of people and it ends up in a bank.  Up to the present, it was conclusive evidence, when Séamas Ó Riain went into court and said:&mdash;&ldquo;This is not my signature&rdquo;.That finished the thing and showed that he had not got the money. Now he has no proof, there is an absence of proof that he has not got the money, as there is no endorsement on the cheque.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Cheques in Ireland admittedly go from one person to another.  Some of the people concerned may insist on their being signed, just as some people insist on signatures on bank notes for big amounts.  In fact, I have been told &mdash; I do not know if the practice still exists &mdash; when a person gets a £1,000 bank note, he signs for it, that each £1,000 note is made up in a little book &mdash; or was in the past &mdash; and a register is kept of where they pass from one person to another.  The most obvious group of people in this country in this connection are the cattle dealers.  They give vast sums of money around like pieces of paper.  I think there will be difficulty arising in this connection. Let me say what I think as an ordinary <Col N="393" /> person.  If there is to be a loss under a system of non-endorsement, in the ordinary way a loss of £100, £1,000 or £10,000 is a snap of the fingers to any one of the commercial banks, but it might be a most serious loss to a single individual.  I think we should not legislate on that basis in the Oireachtas.  I do not mind whether this is the same as the British Act.  I do not mind whether it is the same as a universal Act.  It simply is not good practice, in my opinion.</P>
    <P>In regard to the other protections for the banks, I do not see any great objection to them, but this is certainly an exceptional protection.  It is not good enough for the Minister to dig up &mdash; I use that word without animus, but it was dug up, since the Bill was brought before the Dáil&mdash;that it is not &ldquo;conclusive evidence&rdquo;.  I know there is a difference.  If the phrase in the section were that it was &ldquo;conclusive evidence&rdquo;, it would be worse than it is.  We grant that straight away.</P>
    <P>All this is a kind of fog or smoke-screen, that the banks are going to do such and such a thing in practice.  It is said that this point is here and we are legislating in this way, but that it will not operate in this way. That is just not good enough, in my opinion.  Quite frankly, I do not see why this section is required in the Bill at all.  In the ordinary way, these documents pass around in their tens of thousands and the banks have to deal with them.  I do not see the necessity for this kind of provision in the Bill.  What is it?  It is a provision giving protection to the big people against the small people.  That is what it is.  It is based on the lines of the law relating to real property, and it is based on various other laws that have greater regard for property rights than for the rights of the ordinary small person.  It may not have any serious effect, and then, in one case, it might be very objectionable.</P>

      <P>The Minister has illustrated the difficulty which has arisen by reason of the passing of similar legislation in Britain.  Cheques payable in Northern Ireland which are not endorsed come here and have to <Col N="394" /> be sent back to Northern Ireland to be endorsed.  If that is the position, would it not remove the difficulty of the banks, if it were provided in this Bill that, in those circumstances, cheques payable in Northern Ireland or in Britain would not have to be endorsed and that the provisions of the Bill would not apply to them?  I do not see any reason why it is necessary to bring in these stray transactions which, as Senator O'Donovan pointed out, may mean a permanent loss to an ordinary person.  A cheque for £15, £20 or £30 may be a whole month's wages, and a cheque can easily get lost and no matter what protection is provided by this section, the banks can always say: &ldquo;Well, the Cheques Act, 1959, is the complete answer.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>The banks, of course, will continue to be obliged to make sure they are paying the right person.  If any of us go to our own bank to lodge the few cheques we get, we do not endorse them but there is evidence that they go through the banks because they are stamped.  The banks are liable, if they can be accused of negligence in any way, so I do not see, as I said at the beginning, how endorsement makes any difference in that case.  If I am honest and I lodge my cheque without endorsement, it is stamped in the bank and everything is all right, but if I am not honest, endorsement makes no difference.  It is very easy to forge an endorsement so the same safeguard remains so far as that is concerned.</P>
      <P>The example given by Senator O'Donovan, if I understood him correctly, does not arise here.  What he suggested was that a cheque made payable to Séamas Ó Riain which is passed around from one person to the other may not be endorsed, but that cannot be.  Unless I endorse it, it cannot be passed around.  At the moment, a cheque made payable to me cannot be accepted, except in my own account, unless it is endorsed.  That is the only point.  I must pay it into my own account, otherwise it must be endorsed as in the past.</P>

      <P>Section 3 has nothing to do with it.  I am not talking about the endorsement part of it but that it cannot be passed around.  Section 3 deals with evidence.  It could happen that a person would say: &ldquo;I did pay that account.  Here is the cheque.&rdquo; The cheque is retained for evidence in the court, but it is not conclusive evidence because it might be forged, even if it is endorsed.  It is the same evidence now if not endorsed, as it was before, if it was endorsed.  That is the only point, so far as this section is concerned.</P>
      <P>It would, of course, be out of keeping with this Bill if that were not put in because if we were to say: &ldquo;Well, an unendorsed cheque will not be payable&rdquo;, naturally nobody would endorse their cheques, if they could not produce them as evidence.  If I pay a bill by cheque and if the payee lodges the cheque to his own account, there is evidence that it went through his own bank because it is stamped.  It goes back to the paying bank and I produce the cheque and I say: &ldquo;Yes, I did pay that account.  Here is the cheque which he paid into his own account and which has come back to my account&rdquo;.  That is as good evidence now as it was before, when the cheque was endorsed.</P>

      <P>The fact is that formerly the evidence that the sum was received by the payee was his signature on the back of the cheque in the great majority of cases.  Now that evidence is gone.  I quite appreciate the purpose, the double purpose, for which this section was put in. Really, it is to clear the lines primarily, and I appreciate the point the Minister is making.  This section does make a difference and no amount of saying, as the Minister said originally &mdash; and I think he did it rather well &mdash; that the customer is as safeguarded as he was in the past will make me agree with the Minister.  I think the customer is considerably less safeguarded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="396" /> If some case arises, I do not know what the reaction, say, of one of the banks concerned might be, but there is a chance that some small person might be seriously inconvenienced.  In any event, he will be inconvenienced because he may be out of his money for a long time, even though he eventually maintains his case, whereas, at the moment, he can say: &ldquo;That is not my signature&rdquo;.  No amount of forgery will make it his signature and in the bulk of cases that is the difference and it is apparently what happens.</P>
    <P>Supposing a man gets a cheque or supposing a cheque is shown to him and although he did not intend in the first instance to do so, he puts it into his pocket and then decides: &ldquo;I am going to cash that cheque.&rdquo;  Under the existing law, some name has to be written on the back of it but under the new law, no name will have to be written on the back of it.  It certainly does make fraud easier.  What I am concerned about is the non-endorsed cheque which appears to have been paid by a banker and which is evidence of the receipt by the payee of the sum payable by the cheque. Primarily, the sum is paid by the banker acting as agent for the person who draws the cheque, and it is eventually paid by the person who provides the money to pay it.  Cheques are not handled in the simple way which has been suggested.  They are handled in the most complicated ways and they go through numbers of hands before they come for payment.</P>
    <P>I am not suggesting that this Bill, as a whole, is objectionable but I do not understand why this proposal, if it is designed as the Minister says as evidence of the receipt of money payable, is not carried out in some other way.  I simply do not appreciate the necessity for the particular phrasing in the section.  I understand from the Minister that he suggests it is purely evidence that the payee has received that amount.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>At present, if I get a cheque covering the amount due to me and endorse it, then, when that cheque goes back to the person who made the <Col N="397" /> first payment, he can produce it as evidence that the bill was paid.  When this Bill is passed, if I get a cheque and lodge it to my account in my Bank, there is the evidence that my bank accepted that cheque and passed it on. I think the evidence is just as good in one case as in the other.  I do not see any difference.</P>

      <P>Has not, from time immemorial, great sanctity been attached to the signature of a man to a document?  Is it not nowadays possible to take a cheque which had been made payable to me and to forge my signature?  Then, if the question arises, I have to swear in Court that that is not my signature.  There are ways and means of making quite sure. There are handwritting experts and the observations of people to determine whether or not the signature is in fact in my own writting and whether a person has or has not been paid by way of a cheque.</P>
      <P>With regard to an unendorsed cheque paid into my account, if I am paid £17 18s. 11d., and the bank can produce evidence that on 22nd July my account was credited with £17 18s. 11d., it is fairly conclusive evidence that that sum was paid to me.  With regard to a cheque for £17 18s. 11d. which is made payable to me and which somebody else gets and hands into a bank and represents himself as being me and the amount is paid out to him in cash then, under Section 3, the fact that that amount has been paid by a banker is evidence that it has been paid to me.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. J. Lynch)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to establish Córas Tráchtála as a statutory Board to carry on the functions hitherto carried out by Córas Tráchtála Teoranta which was a limited company.  These functions included the promoting, assisting and development of exports.  Córas Tráchtála, Teoranta, under the present Bill, is to be wound up.  I am sure most Senators are familiar with the functions of Córas Tráchtála, Teoranta, and, indeed, with its history.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Dollar Exports Advisory Committee set up by the previous Government recommended that such a body be set up for the encouragement of exports and to assist exporting organisations in the export trade. Córas Tráchtála, Teoranta, was set up by the ensuing Government in 1951. <Col N="399" /> It has since functioned as a limited company and has been financed out of yearly Votes by the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Amongst the services provided to exporters by the company are the investigation in detail of export market prospects, sending trade advisers to overseas countries to carry out on-the-spot market investigations, seeking new openings for Irish products in foreign markets, organising collective marketing schemes, supplying importers in overseas markets with information on Irish goods, advising on channels of distribution, packaging and presentation, methods of salesmanship and the selection of agents.  The company also arranges for participation at suitable trade fairs as well as the provision of publicity for Irish goods overseas through Press, television and radio.</P>
    <P>Having reviewed the results achieved by the company since its setting up, the Government were satisfied that it was in the national interest to maintain as a permanent feature of our industrial policy an organisation specifically charged by the Oireachtas with the task of advising exporters and potential exporters, as well as the appropriate Ministers, on all aspects of export development.</P>
    <P>The Government's Programme for Economic Expansion included an announcement of the Government's decision to establish Córas Tráchtála Teó. as a permanent State agency for this purpose.  Once the decision was taken to establish C.T.T. as a permanent State agency, its status as a company registered under the Companies Acts was no longer appropriate, and as I have stated, the purpose of this Bill is to establish the organisation on a basis appropriate to its position as the chosen instrument to carry out Government policy in relation to promotional and market research work in export markets.  The establishment of Córas Tráchtála as a statutory body will add considerably to its standing and authority in implementing long-term policies of export development.  It will also influence and increase the confidence which is necessary for the developing by <Col N="400" /> potential exporters of new types of goods as well as increased quantities of existing goods for export.</P>
    <P>It is proposed to finance the company by the provision of £1 million out of the Exchequer and having regard to the annual expenditure which runs at about £225,000 to date, it is expected that that sum will enable the new Board to carry on for a period of about four years.  When that sum has been exhausted, it will be necessary to come back to the Oireachtas for an increased provision, if it is so desired.</P>
    <P>The activities of Córas Tráchtála have been widely acclaimed, particularly by industrialists who have had close contact with them and I believe that with their new status, their efficiency will have increased and as well as that, it will tend to avoid something that is not so desirable that has occurred in the administration.  They have been able to get men of great ability on their staff, but there is a feeling of lack of security amongst them and occasionally C.T.T. lose good men by reason of that feeling of lack of security in their employment. As well as that, they often fail, for the same reason, to get men of the calibre-they desire.  I confidently commend the Bill to the House.  It is, on the face of it, a fairly extensive Bill but its provisions largely are machinery provisions which are adopted and have been adopted in the setting up of similar State bodies already functioning.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Prof. Hayes Prof. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Prof. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I think everybody in the House would be at one with the Minister and with the Government, or indeed with any Government, in any measure which would seem to the House to improve our position in export markets.  I am not an authority on business or on exports but I have read the debate in the Dáil and have listened carefully to the Minister today and the question I asked myself in the beginning was: Why is this Bill brought in so as to effect a change from the existing system to a new system under which you have a Board and officials of the Board?  I must say the Minister has not, it seems to me, at any rate, given any convincing explanation.  There may be other <Col N="401" /> explanations which will appear later, but on the showing we have had at the moment, I do not see any convincing reason for making a change from the system which has operated since about 1950 until the present time.</P>
      <P>The new Board will have the same functions exactly as Córas Tráchtála has had to date.  It will have, I presume, the same personnel and under Section 12 of this Bill, provision is made to transfer the staff of Córas Tráchtála to the new Board.  The Minister said this would give it more permanency.  I wonder is there anything impermanent, transitory or temporary about Córas Tráchtála as it exists.  It would appear from the Minister's speech that the operative section in this Bill is Section 15 which gives superannuation rights to the staff of the new Board.  The Minister told us that Córas Tráchtála had in the course of their operations some difficulty in getting good men to take posts with them and some difficulty in keeping their good men because they lacked security and presumably lacked pension rights.  If that is so &mdash; and I take the Minister's word at once for that &mdash; it could have been remedied presumably by a superannuation scheme out of the fund provided by the Oireachtas for the officers of Córas Tráchtála.  Instead of that, we have a very substantial Bill and the translation of this company into another State Board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not understand why the change is being made.  Only one reason has been given and if that is the only reason, the change necessitated by that set of facts could have been accomplished in a very simple way.  The Minister said this Bill would add to the standing of the Board of Córas Tráchtála.  I wonder whether the experts, the people who deal with our traders or our manufacturers, are concerned at all with the standing of Córas Tráchtála. I cannot understand how a man in the United States, in France or anywhere else who will not have any understanding of this kind of thing will worry as to whether it is a company or a statutory board.  I presume it is part of the well-known desire of the Minister's predecessor to have boards.  It <Col N="402" /> used to be the boast of Sinn Féin in the old days that the British had too many boards and that an Irish Government would abolish them.  Undoubtedly, some of them were abolished in the beginning; I took a hand in abolishing one of them myself.  However, we have got back to the situation in which we seem to have boards for every conceivable thing.</P>
    <P>No convincing case has been made for this elaborate machinery.  We all know from our experience that the more elaborate the machinery is, the larger the bill is and the more the administration costs will be.  It seems we are simply taking steps to make this thing more elaborate and more costly for the sake of providing a service which could have been provided on the basis which existed.  I am very anxious that we should increase our exports and that no expedient of any kind should be left untried which would seem to bring us to that highly desirable end, but frankly I am not convinced from what the Minister has said that there is a sound case for the change which has been made from something which has worked reasonably well into a more elaborate business about the working of which we really do not know anything and about which we have heard nothing specific except a vague statement that it will have better standing and, having better standing, will produce better results.  That seems to be extremely doubtful.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Whatever purpose the Bill was introduced for, I welcome it because it gives me an opportunity to say something about Córas Tráchtála. I particularly welcome the Bill if the purpose is, as Senator Hayes has said, to implement what is proposed in Section 15.  This is a most successful service.  I have met and talked to some of the officers of Córas Tráchtála and I know their work for some years back. When this was started, I was doubtful whether you could do such things in this way and my doubts have been resolved by the results.  The results are very heartening.  I believe the results are good because we were extremely fortunate in the men who began this service.  I think Mr. <Col N="403" /> O'Driscoll was the chief of the first Board but the young men he gathered around him have performed extraordinarily good work.</P>
      <P>There was one great drawback and that was that there was a lack of security and a lack of future in the service, and, consequently, there was a too rapid turnover of staff.  Every exporter, particularly exporters in the North American Continent, will support me when I say that the work done by an extremely small field group is productive of more magnificent results. What is much more important is that that machine now exists.  That organisation exists and our small exporters can grow into medium-sized and larger exporters by making use of the contacts this machine has established.The work is of the utmost national importance.</P>
      <P>The men in the service are too good. They are too good for the money they get and for the ceiling of the money they can hope to earn.  Commercial firms who meet them realise the worth of the work they are doing.  They realise their particular and specialist training in this work.  The ceiling of reward is too low, and if this service is to continue successfully, the ceiling must be raised and the men in that service must be rewarded adequately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one other slight comment that I would make on the work being done by these men.  I think that in some of the areas, notably in North American areas, these young officers are left for too short a time.  Two years to 2½ years seem to be the average.  There are only four or five men altogether taking Canada and the United States into account.  At the very time that they have contacts and when the developments are at their most fruitful period, these officers are frequently transferred.  That, I think, is a mistake.  I hope that the new director of the service will examine the position very carefully because I think these men start to be valuable only when they are transferred.  They are all young men in their early 30s and it is a source of considerable responsibility and pride to them to be sent on this work to a great Continent like <Col N="404" /> North America.  It takes them some time to find their feet.  They have all been quite successful.  When they are a success and when their efforts seem to be meeting with reward for the work they have done, they are frequently transferred.</P>
    <P>I think that some of them lose heart. I know two officers at least who have left the service because of that.  I think they want a longer time in the field of activity.  I think they want a higher ceiling to the reward they get.  There is no difficulty so far in getting the men but there is considerable difficulty in keeping them.  This is not quite a proper speech to make on the Second Reading of a Bill of this kind but I am very glad to have had the opportunity to be able to make these comments now.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOQuigley" hpid="Mr. O'Quigley Mr. O'Quigley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>We have not had this Bill for very long.  Consequently, it is impossible to say very much on it.  I do not know where we are going in this country with the number of statutory bodies that we are establishing.The Minister has indicated what the functions of the new Board of Córas Tráchtála will be.  These are set out in general terms in Section 4 of the Bill but I would have thought that the Minister would be on better ground and would have better reasons for urging the House to accept this Bill, if he gave us some more concrete evidence of the manner in which the Board of Córas Tráchtála has achieved the success about which Senator Barry speaks so eloquently.</P>
      <P>I do not know to what extent the company of Córas Tráchtála has been successful in its activities to date.  I do not know what projects they have been engaged in.  I have seen in the newspapers from time to time where there were officers in the Middle East and, I think, in Algeria and, perhaps, on the North American Continent. Beyond what one can get from the Press reports, I do not think we have an indication as to what the Board has been doing to date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has not given us any information as to the number of personnel at present attached to the Board <Col N="405" /> of Córas Tráchtála and the extent to which he, as Minister, envisages the number of personnel to increase.  With regard to the erection of Córas Tráchtála into a statutory body, I do not at all appreciate the Minister's remarks that it will have such a status.  If Córas Tráchtála, Teoranta, or whatever the English translation of that would be, with &ldquo;Limited&rdquo; after it, were writing to somebody in America, Canada or Australia, these foreigners would feel that they were dealing with a company and with a body which was freed from entanglements with the State.  I would not have thought that it would have been a great incentive to foreign interests to deal with a body which appears to be a statutory body because I should expect that foreign interests would feel that a statutory body was more closely associated with and influenced by Government policy, that it would be an independent company which was operated upon lines somewhat similar to other companies in industry and commerce.  To that extent, I do not think that the mere creation of this body into a statutory board will have any great influence on people abroad.  I rather think that the influence will be the other way.</P>
    <P>We had an Encouragement of External Investment Bill here in recent times.  We have an Industrial Development Authority.  We have a Department of Industry and Commerce with a trade section.  We have trade officers and consuls in various countries.  We have a Department of External Affairs. We seem daily to be spreading more and more functions, which, to my mind, is a sure way of having overlapping and wasteful expenditure and not having the necessary co-ordination which is desirable.  I wonder in what way does the State contend that the new Board will work in conjunction with the Department of External Affairs and the Department of Industry and Commerce, in addition to dealing with private firms.  It seems to me that if all those people have to be consulted, the less likely it is that business will be done.  For that reason, I do not think the unloading of work, which was heretofore carried on by State Departments, <Col N="406" /> on to statutory bodies is, <i>per se</i>, a good thing.</P>
    <P>Another of the difficulties which arise in relation to statutory bodies, and which we have mentioned before, is the little control or influence which the Houses of the Oireachtas can have over these bodies to which large sums of money are voted annually, and in this case under statute.  We are all aware of the stock answer given in the Dáil to questions relating to statutory bodies, that it is a matter of day-to-day administration and that the Minister has no control over them, or sometimes the Minister replies in effect, on the basis that he has received the information through the courtesy of the statutory board.</P>
    <P>Recently, on the Turf Development Bill, when some Senators raised the question of the relations of statutory boards with the Oireachtas, the Minister's predecessor, the Taoiseach, thought that we were merely being critical on this side of the House and that we were not seriously interested in what these relations were or ought to be.  He accused the Fine Gael Party of hypocrisy, as far as my recollection serves me in that connection.  On this Bill in the Dáil, the Taoiseach has had something of a change of mind and it now appears that the Taoiseach considers there is a problem which might be examined.  It is good to see that we are not always wrong on this side of the House and that the Taoiseach, at any rate, is open to persuasion.</P>
    <P>There is nothing, however, in this Bill to indicate in what way the Oireachtas, which is asked to vote substantial sums of money to it, can review the activities of the Board. That, of course, is common to all statutory bodies.  The Oireachtas has no way of reviewing the functions of these statutory bodies and I suppose the Minister is not to be blamed for not having made a change in this Bill.</P>
    <P>I certainly welcome any provisions, made either by legislation or by a scheme for good management, designed to provide people with some sense of security.  While it appears that the only difference between the new Board and the present company is that the staff of the new Board will have super-annuation  <Col N="407" /> rights, that in itself is a good thing because it gives people a certain sense of security without which they cannot put forward their best efforts.  If one were astisfied that this Bill will produce the effects which the Minister thinks the creation of the Board into a statutory body will produce, one could not but welcome the Bill but like the Cheques Bill which we have just passed, this seems to be another example of the notion that by introducing Bills into Parliament and enacting them into law, we will produce all kinds of good results.  I do not think that is at all likely.  It seems that the purpose of Bills of this kind is more to give the idea that something is being done rather than to produce any worthwhile results.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGuire</NameTxt>
      <P>I was a member of the original Dollar Exports Advisory Committee which was set up and which suggested the formation of Córas Tráchtála Teoranta, as it turned out to be, and I should like to say that I think it has justified the hopes the Committee originally had in setting up such a body.  I must say, however, that I have been slightly puzzled by this proposal to change the company into a board.  From what I have heard here and read in the Dáil Debates, I take it that it is really to give the officials of Córas Tráchtála security and with that, of course, we are all in agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I take it from reading the Bill that it still will be possible for the Board to appoint officials who are not necessarily in the Civil Service, that they can take in people from outside the Civil Service.  Without showing any disrespect for the members of the Civil Service&mdash;who are an excellent body of men in their own particular jobs and in their own particular way&mdash;we must face the fact that there is a certain lack of confidence in the business community in the ability of civil servants to advise on commercial matters.  That was one of the advantages of Córas Tráchtála, that they did in fact have men working for them who had commercial experience and had a commercial background.  That is one of the reasons why the business community <Col N="408" /> found them helpful and had confidence in them.</P>
    <P>The only thing I hope for is that as the company is now to be made into a board, the staff will not be turned into civil servants.  I do repeat that I have no disrespect for civil servants, as I say, in their own sphere.  One of the faults which has been found with the Department of Industry and Commerce by business people when they come here is that they are talking to people who are not really business people.  As recently as two months ago, a German came here with a genuine desire to establish a business here and he told me, and others in the commercial world, that he met nobody but civil servants and he went away without doing anything.  That may or may not be fair to the civil servants but it is true.  Certainly I think the great advantage of this board, and the one which everybody felt made it successful, was that it had not got the name of being part of a Government body.  Now it is going to become part of a Government set-up and no matter how good the men are in it, it will have that stigma in the commercial world.</P>
    <P>The board will have a tough job before them because their job has always been to deal with exports. That is a very hard task in a country which has an industrial economy built up behind a very high tariff barrier.  Now they not only have to advise people about export markets but to advise exporters that they will have to be more efficient.  That raises a lot of questions but one of the questions it does raise immediately is in regard to the necessity for everybody in industry to work harder and to do extra work for the same money. The Taoiseach referred to the same thing in the Dáil yesterday, the necessity, at all levels of the community, of putting more work into what we do for the same amount of money.</P>
    <P>If they want more money for the same work or for less work, they are living in a fool's paradise, as these people want it both ways at the moment.  We are now right up against it.  We must export.  If this <Col N="409" /> body is to carry out its function&mdash;the board itself does not carry out the work; the machinery we are using is our industries and our employees and our managers&mdash;everyone will have to be more efficient.  We want &ldquo;more production&rdquo;, as it is called, but production does not mean more goods. It means lower unit production costs. We must get down our production costs, and our unit costs must be brought down.  They are going up at present instead of going down.</P>
    <P>If the Government thinks this is a good idea&mdash;the Bill has gone so far now and I do not think it can be changed&mdash;I must say that I am apprehensive.I am sorry that the external character of Córas Tráchtála is changing and I am sorry to say I do not think it is a change for the better. The whole picture is becoming more and more governmental and more managerial.  I think that the more governmental and the more managerial our State becomes, the less flexible is our economy; and the less flexible our economy, the less able we are to compete with other countries where they are efficient, flexible and alive.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel rather disappointed that the change made is a very minor one.  Coming after the successful operation for the last eight years of Córas Tráchtála, it would seem that we should be on the threshold of something much bigger, that the organisation had proved itself and that we should have a real expansion, not what is merely a paper expansion in translating from a limited company to a statutory body.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is only right and proper that such a body should have succeeded.  We should not think that that is anything wonderful, because bodies like that have the big advantage of youth and enthusiasm.  You have young men in charge, eager to do the job and who have a lot to gain from doing the job properly.  Their whole reputation and future is at stake.  We have seen that in all the bodies set up, beginning with the E.S.B. and Bord na Móna.  What are they but simply the success story of youth in all their operations?  But remember, youth turns to age and <Col N="410" /> those bodies age and we see many of them ageing at present.  They age and become just as inefficient as any other of our bodies.  That is what we must guard against.  It is there that we need something more dynamic, if possible, than this type of statutory body, with all its security.</P>
    <P>The boards should be the mainspring for giving youth and enthusiasm to these bodies.  That is the element of the body which changes.  After all, when we have our staff appointed, that staff will stay with us until they retire on pension.  We will have to take the rough with the smooth&mdash;in most bodies, at any rate.  The board should be the mainspring of a change, changing the board periodically, bringing in new members and new faces.  If the composition of the board is faced up to and if it is used by all our Governments as a means of keeping that life and enthusiasm in our statutory bodies, I think we would have more success than we have had.  I shall turn later to some provisions in this which seem to me to militate against keeping youth and enthusiasm in this Board itself.</P>
    <P>As to the change which looks necessary at this stage, something bigger is called for, obviously.  We have been just exploring or probing the market.  Perhaps at this stage, rather than go from a limited company to a statutory body, it might have been more efficient to go into a corporation, with shares owned by the various bodies which stand to gain by the promotion of our industries.  They had eight years' experience of the work which had to be done.  Surely, it should not be asking too much at this stage, that they should go forward and supply some of the real capital necessary to do the job of exporting?</P>
    <P>We cannot for a moment think that a quarter of a million a year will really finance the job which is ahead; but the million pound contribution that is specified here by the Government over four years, if put in as the Government contribution in an export corporation, might be sufficient to provide the nucleus which, when built up with the share capital of those likely to gain, would put a really efficient and dynamic export corporation on its feet.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="411" /> Our exporting bodies cannot maintain in the United States and in other countries their own exporting organisations.The time has come when we need in those centres one co-operative export organisation, handling our products.  It would seem that that should be the natural follow-up&mdash; maybe it will come yet&mdash;of the activities of Córas Tráchtála.</P>
    <P>Again, it would seem that certain finance for such a body should come from those benefiting by it.  Perhaps a service fee would not be out of place, or better still, a voluntary donation fund associated with this body, through which medium the firms benefiting might show their appreciation of the services placed by the nation at their disposal.  We had a rather similar development in the case of the tea importers, with the groups concerned putting up the share capital to do the job.  I do not know whether there is any real lesson to be learned from that or not.</P>
    <P>On this question of the members of the board, we read here a caveat or prohibition, that members of the board cannot be members of either House of the Oireachtas and that even if they stand as candidates in an election, they should cease to be members.  That is proving rather restrictive on those bodies.  We must assume that because a member seeks election to the House, he is only going further in his public duty and that, if anything, he will increase his efficiency as a member of the board.  Be that as it may, if the House is prepared to prohibit members of the Dáil and Seanad from sitting on those boards&mdash;and again there may be reasons for that&mdash;there certainly should be an extension of that prohibition to candidates who ever stood for the Dáil or Seanad.  That would prevent what has been happening under both Governments&mdash;the &ldquo;consolation prize&rdquo; that has sent a defeated candidate on to some State Board.</P>
    <P>That is a misuse of the functions of the board.  It is treating the board as something where you just turn up once a month and you simply sit and take the usual passive part in the proceedings.If it is to be the dynamo of the <Col N="412" /> company, we must rule out any suggestion of political patronage or as one distinguished ex-Minister said: &ldquo;Providing a Nazareth Home for defeated candidates.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There is very careful provision here in relation to the officers of the Board, that they cannot become members of the Houses of the Oireachtas or if they do, there are very elaborate provisions that they must be seconded from the board and so on.  I admit that is a step forward but it does not go far enough.  Recently, I visited Holland where I had the pleasure of a long session with the Secretary-General.  I was struck by the efforts the Dutch Parliament make to draw on the brains of their country and get them into Parliament, so members of boards are not excluded.  It even extends to civil servants.  That goes for the Dutch Parliament and when a person is elected, he is given leave of absence, seconded, and if there is any differential between his salary and the salary of members of the Dutch Parliament, his employer makes up that differential to him.</P>
    <P>In other words, the real principle is established that nobody suffers finan cially by going forward and making his contribution by becoming a member of Parliament.  We are operating an outmoded system here which excludes really trained members of our community from playing their part in our Parliamentary life.  I am not for one moment saying that Parliament should be composed of just that section, but it is quite wrong that that section should be excluded by the ridiculous financial arrangements which exist at present, including the allowances payable to members of the Oireachtas. I just mention that point because even though it is not any worse in this board than it is in the others, it is part of the cancer that is on us.</P>
    <P>To come back to the members of the board, I think the lead given by the Agricultural Institute Board should be followed here.  That is a board which was fought over for a number of years with the interests concerned demanding a voice in the selection of the board. At least, you had this panel system, various groupings of the organisations <Col N="413" /> concerned.  While that is not perfect, it would seem to me that there should be some similar provision for nomination by interested exporting companies, companies capable of exporting, to the board.  Whether or not we should go so far as to give them actual direct election to the board as has been given to the Council of the Agricultural Institute, I do not know, but at least I think they should feel they were being consulted and had a right at least to nomination.</P>
    <P>This three to seven member board, to my mind, seems to be too narrow for the task in hand.  What can three to seven members represent but three to seven exporting interests?  I should think that this board should work in some way or other with an Exports Promotion Council which would put up ideas to the members of the board &mdash;the small number of members on the board&mdash;and in turn, receive back from them occasionally an account of their stewardship.  In other words, we might take this Bill as being a very minor one, just making this change from a limited to a statutory body, and if that is the case, the other developments should come and come fast because we are not satisfied with the impact they are making on export markets. We are not putting the finances behind it.</P>
    <P>We might possibly be heartened by what the Taoiseach said in the Dáil on the question of jet craft and this sum of £10 million being made available. That certainly is a courageous action. Whether we agree with it or not, we shall have an opportunity of saying in the very near future but he said there was much more money available, many millions available, for tasks like that.  I suggest the setting up of a foreign export corporation is something which to my way of thinking should take precedence over jet aircraft and everything else.</P>
    <P>Again, I endorse everything Senator Barry has said.  We are far too parsimonious with the men we send abroad to represent us.  We make totally inadequate allowances for the vast difference in living standards and the value of money as between here and the United States.  We have the same real complaint whether it is with <Col N="414" /> regard to our Army Jumping Team, our young research workers or Córas Tráchtála.  Their allowances are totally inadequate.  What is really needed is some type of incentive for business men who are making gains to partake in the activities of these statutory bodies.  It would seem to have the major defect that the officials concerned do not partake in the gains, except in so far as they can persuade the board to increase their salaries and allowances.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The tenor of the debate seems to suggest that this Bill is unnecessary, or that if it is necessary at all, much more should be done than is being done.  As the House is aware, Córas Tráchtála Teoranta was in the nature of an experiment and once it has been established that its activities are desirable and worthwhile, it is reasonable to give it a status commensurate with the activities it has undertaken and the importance we attach to them.  In order to comply with the Companies Act, Córas Tráchtála Teoranta is required to have share capital, but nevertheless it had to depend on annual voted moneys, so, in essence, it was a statutory body and its formal establishment in this fashion will recognise it as such.</P>
      <P>I want to say to Senator O'Quigley that this Bill is not being introduced as a political measure.  We do not want one ounce of kudos out of it. We are not putting on the face of appearing to do something more than is being done, so if the Senator wants to make a political point, he is welcome to it.</P>
      <P>The intention is to make the board more effective, if that can be done through this means, and we believe it can.  The members of the board are, in the main, business men.  As Senators will see, the Minister has power of nomination of one-third of the members of the board at every annual meeting or at some other date in the year's operations the Minister will fix. That might satisfy Senator Quinlan's point that there is that degree of replacement or cutting off of dead wood, if it appears.  There is that facility there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="415" /> As everybody knows, the export business is very complex and difficult. We all appreciate that if we are to have any measure of industrial expansion, it will have to be largely in the export field or in so far as we import commodities not yet manufactured here in that particular aspect of production as well.  But, by and large, apart from increasing our industrial capacity in the export field, it is necessary, too, from a balance of payments point of view.  Therefore, in order to be effectively represented in this what I have described as complex, difficult and important field of activity, we must have the best means of giving information to our exporters.</P>
    <P>I am not suggesting, nor would I want to suggest, that exporters should depend exclusively on such an organisation.I said in the Dáil that this organisation should not relieve our exporters of the responsibility of having on their staffs people with the necessary training, ability and foresight to promote and foster exports; people who can go abroad, meet prospective purchasers and seek out markets for the commodities they have to sell. There is no better means than the personal representation of the individual firm.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the exporting firms that they might avail of facilities now open to them for training young men in that field.  The different business organisations in existence&mdash;the Management Institute, the Exporters Federation and the Federation of Irish Industries &mdash;have co-operated with the educational authorities in providing a Diploma in Export Trade.  There has been at least one recipient of that Diploma after a long and difficult course.  It is still available and I believe still operating in Dublin.  I urge that it might be extended to other areas, if suitable candidates offer.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, I urge on the firms interested in export markets that they should have on their staffs people who can carry on convesations in the vernacular of the countries to which they go.  I would instance the facilities which are cheaply and readily available for instruction in foreign languages. <Col N="416" /> I refer in particular to the vocational schools in the larger centres throughout the country.</P>
    <P>I think that might answer Senator Quinlan's point that exporting companies themselves might invest in the funds of this Board.  In so far as this is a State-sponsored body, I do not think that that would be possible under this legislation.  Nevertheless, the £1,000,000 now being provided will be provided only as the Córas Tráchtála Board will require it.  It is true that the expenditure, running at about £225,000 a year, is infinitesimal compared with the expenditure of other European countries.  Their trade is possibly and is in fact in many cases on a larger scale.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Norton pointed out in the Dáil, the staff of Córas Tráchtála is microscopic compared with the staffs of other export promotional organisations of other countries.  If the new Board see opportunities of expanding and increasing their staff&mdash;expanding their scope of operation&mdash;I am sure they will take them.  The moneys will then be used up much sooner than anticipated and they will have to come back to the Oireachtas to seek further subvention.  After that period, which at best will be about four years, the Oireachtas will have the opportunity of reviewing very closely the activities and the successes which I hope the Board will attain in its activities.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, as is contained in the provisions of the Bill, the Board, as in the case of every other State Board, will have to report annually and its report will be on the Table of each House of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinlan mentioned the effectiveness of public representatives' criticism or queries.  The activities of these Boards will always be a live issue.  If we are to give such Boards their freedom of action, that flexibility that I think they deserve and certainly require to carry on their jobs effectively, we must not restrict or spancel them in any way by too much probing at Dáil Question Time in the same manner as Ministers can be in respect of their Departments.  Further, if they are to get ahead with the job they have to do, they must not be bound <Col N="417" /> by the Civil Service file system, with every activity minuted, checked and counter-checked.  As they are dealing with businessmen, it is better that they have that freedom of activity that businessmen feel is necessary and no doubt for good reason.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinlan made a point about the requirement that if a member of the Board is nominated to the Seanad or to the Dáil, he shall be deemed to have resigned.  That is no new principle.It is an easement of the original principle contained in the first State Board Act&mdash;I think, the Electricity Supply Act, 1927.  The restriction was much stronger.  I think it disqualified members of the Board from being nominated or elected or from sitting or receiving payment as members of the Oireachtas.  Strangely enough, that provision stood until very recently-until, in fact, last year.</P>
    <P>Before that, there was the question which was raised in connection with the election of a Deputy to the Dáil who happened to be a member of the staff of the E.S.B. and who would have been disqualified from standing for the Dáil under this section.  In fact, his election was in doubt, but he resolved it in so far as he himself was concerned by resigning his position in the E.S.B.  However, that did not resolve the doubt that existed as to whether or not he was properly elected. The Deputy in question has been elected properly a number of times since then and so that point does not arise.</P>
    <P>Latterly, in the preparation of election legislation, the Department of Local Government raised this section as perhaps being repugnant to the Constitution, or at least that it might be challenged as being repugnant to it. For that reason, the 1927 Act was amended in the last E.S.B. Bill.  The provision in this Bill is exactly on all fours with that provision as far as members of the Board are concerned who will seek nomination to either House of the Oireachtas.  I think it is reasonable that if employees of the Board want to stand for the Dáil or the Seanad, they should temporarily <Col N="418" /> resign their positions as employees of the Board.  I do not think that would impose any great hardship.</P>
    <P>I have much sympathy with the point raised by the Senator about the loss such a person might incur.  I am sure that in the case of anybody who has enjoyed or will enjoy his salary with Córas Tráchtála and who considers what he might expect to get from either House of the Oireachtas, he will think twice before he seeks election.  Perhaps that restricts the quality of those coming into the Oireachtas, but if there were a means of supplementing the income of a Senator, Deputy or Minister and bringing it up to what he enjoyed before his election when he occupied one of these outside positions, I should be very glad if it could be devised.  I am sure it would be difficult for the solicitors who used to pay me my fees to be expected now to give me the little extra I might have gained if I were still practising at the Bar.</P>
    <P>Generally speaking, as far as the status of the Board is concerned, we are in effect recognising what is there already in essence and, as Senators know, people who do business internationally have available to them organisations which can report not only on the status of the organisations they are dealing with but on their affairs generally.  I am sure it is well known that Córas Tráchtála in its present position depends for its existence on annually voted moneys.  The new status we shall now give it will enhance its position <i>vis-a-vis</i> the organisations it has to deal with and particularly the hardheaded businessmen from the dollar countries and other hard currency countries.</P>
    <P>For the reasons I have stated in my opening remarks, as well as those I have given in replying to the debate, I believe we shall be benefiting Córas Tráchtála by passing this Bill.  We shall be giving it that security not only for itself but for its officers that will better enable it to achieve its purpose.  I believe also we shall be enabling it to assist industrialists to find export markets and eventually assisting in a <Col N="419" /> very material way the general economy of the country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought the Senator's original remark was that the board should act in close liaison with existing exporting groups.  In fact, there is an Exporters Federation or association; I forget exactly what the title of it is.  As far as nomination is concerned, it is something new that I am not prepared to deal with now, but I can assure the Senator that nobody has ever questioned the ability or the integrity of any person who has ever been nominated to the board. It is not a board on which any great kudos are to be gained but a man might get satisfaction from serving his country and serving his business associates even though at very small remuneration.  I doubt if it would be a desirable principle to have nominating panels because these boards are not so much representation of interests as a selection of what are considered to be the best men for the job.  Somebody has to make that decision; somebody has to be responsible for that selection, a responsibility which the Minister has to bear publicly.  By and large, I believe the method of selection to this board we now propose to be adopted will prove better in the long run.  The system of representation by an individual because he happens to belong to a certain organisation may not necessarily mean we will get the best board.  There may be two excellent men in another organisation which might not be entitled to more than one representative.I think the system is working reasonably well and there is no point in complicating it.</P>

      <P>Has the Minister considered the desirability of a provision which will prevent the appointment or reappointment of persons over a long period of years?  If you have people on a board of this kind and there is a stipulation about retirement by rotation and reappointment, that may not be in the best interests of the board.  It would be preferable to have some limit in relation to the appointment of members of the Board.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Hitherto it has been the practice to have a member of the staff of the Department of Industry and Commerce on the Board.  No doubt, he will be very close to the Minister and will be able to report on the capacity and the ability of individual members of the Board.  In that way, the Minister is enabled to keep in very close touch with the activities and therefore with the assessment of the qualities of the members of the Board. As well as that, the Minister may call for any information he needs from time to time and that information might include, for instance, the appointment of members to the Board which might make other information available to him from which he could judge the quality and the capabilities of the members of the Board.</P>
      <P>I agree with the suggestion of the Senator that it is undesirable that because a member is once nominated, he shall always be a member of the Board. I do not believe that is the intention, and members of the Board will be reappointed only so long as it is reasonably certain that they will continue to be useful members of the Board and, as I have said, the Minister will have means of receiving information about the capabilities of each member.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="421" /> A member of the Board who retires shall be eligible for re-appointment.</P>
    <P>The danger there is that if a person is reappointed for two or three terms, he is more or less automatically reappointed and in small Boards of this kind there is a necessity for bringing in new blood and new points of view. That need is so great that perhaps it would be better if subsection 6 were changed to read:</P>
    <P>A member of the Board who retires shall be ineligible for immediate re-appointment.</P>
    <P>That would mean he would have to go off the Board for at least one session and that would break the chain.</P>
    <P>I have every confidence in the Minister and in his anxiety to get the best possible men and while such a clause might prevent a person from continuing and he might lose the services of a good man for three years, surely there is plenty of work to be done in the country by such a good man released from this Board.  There is far more to be gained by having that provision to break the cycle.  Perhaps the sub-section could be reworded to indicate that a member of the Board who retires shall be ineligible for immediate reappointment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>To adopt that suggestion would automatically exclude the degree of continuity that might be desirable.  It is far better to leave the section as it is, to leave a certain discretion to the Minister to reappoint or not to reappoint, as the case may arise. I have only one experience of making an appointment of that nature.  The Senator, I am sure, knows of the recent appointment I made to the board of Irish Shipping, a young man of ability whose politics I do not know. I knew he had an interest in shipping and that he had general business ability.  That is the manner in which I would approach such appointments in the future and I would suggest to the Senator that to provide a stringent subsection, as he suggests, might defeat the purpose it is proposed to achieve.</P>

Only the best are good enough and the <Col N="423" /> rewards should be commensurate with those in similar employment in commercial life.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know if the Minister is in a position to say whether the present staff who entered into employment with Córas Tráchtála have been consulted with regard to the provisions of this section.  There are people who may have joined up with Coras Tráchtála on particular conditions.  They joined up at a time when it was a company.  Now, they find themselves by this section, being transferred into the employment of a semi-State body.  I do not know if these people have any particular views on the advantages or disadvantages of the changes made.</P>
      <P>I recollect that in the Transport Acts there was always a most elaborate provision in respect of people in the service of a particular company before the transfer date; then providing for their transfer as a result of the new company which was formed and giving suitable recompense to people who did not opt to transfer or who, on their transfer, got conditions of employment which were less beneficial to them than those they had prior to the transfer created by the statute.</P>
      <P>I do not know at the moment what the terms and conditions of service of the present personnel of the Board are but subsection (1) of Section 12 enables the Board to give any of these members less favourable terms in regard to conditions of service than they have had.  There is no provision whatever in the Bill to give them compensation if they do get less favourable conditions of service as a result of the passing of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="424" /> I wonder, therefore, whether the Minister has any information as to whether these people have been consulted or whether these conditions would meet with their reasonable requirements.Subsection (6) provides that &ldquo;The Board may at any time remove any officer or servant of the Board from being its officer or servant.&rdquo;Statutory bodies can do only the things they are authorised to do by statute.  Therefore, it is necessary, in this case, to provide that if the Board can appoint, that the Board can dismiss or remove any officer or servant, but there is an in-between situation which the Board might in its prudence wish to achieve.</P>
    <P>They might not want to dismiss a particular officer but might wish to discipline him.  In consequence of that, the appropriate action for the Board to take would be to suspend him from duty, say, for a week, a month or three months.  There is no provision in this Bill to suspend an officer or servant of the Board.  I am quite satisfied that, unless that is put in, the Board may lose the services of a person whose services they do not wish to lose but whom they might like to discipline for a short period.  That happens quite regularly in other employment where people are suspended without being dismissed.  After suspension, it is not unknown that such people reach high places in their employment.Has the Minister considered that?  It seems to be a desirable amendment to subsection (6).</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>There will be no suggestion of worsening conditions. The existing staff have, in fact, pressed for the establishment of a Board of this nature.  I doubt if the difficulty of suspension will arise.  The difficulty which has arisen is the recruitment of suitable staff.  The Board, having gone to great pains to recruit a suitable man, will endeavour to ensure that he will stay in his employment.  I doubt if the question of suspension will arise, if a man is suitable.  He will be given every reasonable chance of overcoming any indiscretion he might commit.  I do not think that the Senator should feel unduly worried about this omission as he calls it.  If <Col N="425" /> something serious of the nature he suggests arises, it would be easy enough to come back again and get the appropriate power.</P>

I am quite satisfied that there can arise circumstances where the appropriate action to be taken in relation to a particular servant is to suspend him.  If I am within the rules of order, I would move now that the words &ldquo;The Board may at any time suspend or remove any officer or servant...&rdquo; be inserted.  I think the Board should have the discretion to suspend a person rather than dismiss him.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;seeks election to the Dáil or Seanad, it is desirable that he should be deemed to have resigned his membership of such board.  The distinction between a member of the board and an officer or servant is that a member has certain powers and certain functions in the policy making of that board.  Over and above all that, there are many State boards which have a very high employment-giving potential and it is considered undesirable that a member of such a board who presents himself as a candidate in an election should be open to, first of all, a suggestion that he could use that position unfairly against fellow-candidates in that he had certain employment-giving functions.  It might be desirable that he should be protected against unfair canvassing of a nature that might require him to give promises to seek employment for others.  As well as that, before elections, many groups approach prospective Deputies or Senators and ask them what their attitude would be, or is, to certain grievances, real or imaginary, which that section of the community might have.  There are many sections of employees who are organised within the servants of State boards and I think it would be undesirable that a member of a State board should be open to&mdash;I do not want to use the word pressure&mdash;perhaps to persuasion in the <Col N="427" /> exercise of his functions, having his eye on the possibility of future elections. These are roughly the considerations and as well as that these election campaigns last for several weeks and it might be presumed that the member of the board would not have full regard to his duties over that period.</P>

      <P>The Minister's argument is entirely unconvincing and quite unrelated to the facts.  This exact section came up on the Electricity Supply (Amendment) Bill last year. Amendments were put down to that Bill and of course they were not accepted by the then Minister for Industry and Commerce.  It is quite useless making any suggestions or tabling amendments even in regard to the most modest amendment which any businessman would wish to have, and such as I suggested for subsection (6) of Section 12, as they will not be accepted by the Minister.</P>
      <P>The Minister tells us he wants to create a board which will be flexible and immediately we start off by constricting the board and putting it into a strait-jacket where it cannot even&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator is talking about the last section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOQuigley" hpid="Mr. O'Quigley Mr. O'Quigley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am merely talking about the approach to this matter and illustrating it by subsection (6) of Section 12.  The Minister's references to the pressure these people are subjected to at election times and the influences to which they may be open are quite unrelated to the facts.  We have, for instance, members of the staffs of county councils who are members of the Oireachtas.  A member of the staff of the county council is a person who exercises discretion in determining whether a person is entitled to home assistance or to a supplementary housing grant, or to a grant <Col N="428" /> for this or that, and he can be seconded during his term of office and retain all his pension rights.  I am not quite certain whether, in certain circumstances during his leave period, he cannot return and work.  In any event, you have the position where an inspector of the Department of Local Government, who is concerned with sanctioning grants and plans for houses which will qualify for grants under the Housing Acts, can be a Deputy and of course to all intents and purposes he is a full-blown civil servant, except that he has not got an established status, but he exercises precisely the same functions as a civil servant.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, you have the example of county medical officers of health. We have had one instance at least of a county medical officer of health who inspects premises of people and who can be open to the same pressure as a servant of a semi-State body and it is all right for him to retain his employment and to continue to act in that employment while a member of the Oireachtas.  The same applies to salary drawing employees of local authorities.  They, too, have certain statutory functions to discharge, but at the same time they can be members of the Oireachtas and discharge these statutory functions.  But a scrivener on the staff of a semi-State body cannot be seconded from his employment, either part-time or whole-time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>

I am pointing out the various public officials who can receive salaries and still be members of the Oireachtas.  A scrivener on the <Col N="429" /> staff of Coras Trachtála would cause tremendous trouble and constitutional disorder if he were permitted to act or was seconded on a part-time basis while he was a member of the Oireachtas.</P>
