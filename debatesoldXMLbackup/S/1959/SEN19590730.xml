    <Title>Industrial Grants Bill, 1959  (  Certified Money Bill)  &mdash;Second and Subsequent Stages.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. J. Lynch) Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. J. Lynch)</NameTxt>
      <P>I might explain at the outset that some Senators will be aware that the Bill originally appeared in the Dáil under the title Undeveloped Areas (Amendment) Bill, 1959.  It was considered, during the course of the passage of the Bill in the Dáil, that a more appropriate title would be the Industrial Grants Bill, 1959.  The title has been amended accordingly, with certain minor consequential amendments.</P>
      <P>The main object of the Bill is to give effect to the policy outlined in the White Paper, &ldquo;Programme for Economic Expansion,&rdquo; in relation to grants for industrial development outside the undeveloped areas.  In the White Paper it was pointed out that the improved facilities which the Industrial Credit Co. would be in a position to offer following the increase in the Company's resources should in general meet adequately the requirements of industrial promoters and that it was the intention that grants under the Industrial Grants Act, 1956, would in future be made only in exceptional circumstances and for projects of exceptional importance.  It was also indicated that legislation would be promoted to transfer administration of the Industrial Grants Act, 1956, from the Industrial Development Authority to An Foras Tionscal thereby enabling the Authority to concentrate on promotional activities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Industrial Credit (Amendment) Act, 1958, has substantially increased the resources available to the Industrial <Col N="654" /> Credit Co. and a further Bill to increase these resources still further was, as Senators are aware, before the House yesterday.  The Company is now in a position to provide finance required for industrial development on a liberal basis and in a variety of forms to meet the needs of the industries concerned.  Industrialists can now go ahead with expansion plans in the knowledge that finance required for sound industrial projects will be readily available from the Industrial Credit Co. in whatever form is appropriate e.g. by way of long or medium term loans, hire purchase facilities, investment in equity shares or redeemable preference shares.  However, in the case of projects of exceptional national importance, it may be necessary to supplement the capital facilities, which I have outlined, by grants.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, the Bill provides that grants may be made for the establishment or development of projects located outside the undeveloped areas where there are considered to be sound reasons why the project cannot be established in the undeveloped areas, where the project is of exceptional national importance having regard to its size, character or export potential and the need for financial assistance by way of grant, as distinct from other forms of financial aid, is established.</P>
    <P>Under existing legislation grants for projects outside the developed areas are limited to two-thirds of the cost of factory buildings or £50,000 whichever is the less amount.</P>
    <P>I should like to emphasise the words &ldquo;existing legislation&rdquo; because in the course of the passage of the Bill through the Dáil, several Deputies appeared to be under the misapprehension that this was an extension for the first time of grant-giving facilities for industrial projects located outside the undeveloped areas.  These facilities were available under the Industrial Grants Act, 1956.  This Bill, to a large extent, extends the facilities but restricts the undertakings to which these facilities will be afforded to undertakings of exceptional national importance. The £50,000 limitation is now considered to be inconsistent with the <Col N="655" /> concept that, in future, grants outside the undeveloped areas will be given only for projects of exceptional national importance.  At the same time, it is necessary that the grants available for projects located in the undeveloped areas should continue to be more attractive than those available for projects located elsewhere.  Accordingly, the Bill provides that for projects outside the undeveloped areas grants may be given for up to two-thirds of the cost of buildings and services and one-third of the cost of machinery and equipment.  The corresponding limits for projects in the undeveloped areas are the full cost of buildings and services and half the cost of machinery. The Bill also provides for an overriding maximum grant in any one case of £250,000, unless the Government having regard to the employment likely to be afforded approves of the making of a larger grant.</P>
    <P>In that latter connection, I should like to instance, if I may, an occasion when the powers of the Government might be called in under this section. Before the Bill was drafted, there came to the attention of the Government a likely project which was mooted in the United States by industrialists who contemplated setting up a very major industry somewhere in Europe.  They examined several areas on the Continent of Europe; from there they came to Belfast, and from Belfast to Dublin.  The industry was of such major proportions that it was considered it would be a national loss if, for want of adequate assistance, such an industry should be lost to this country.  I do not know if it has been decided yet where to locate that industry, but at least we ensure in this provision that if a project of such magnitude should come our way, we will not be in any worse position from the point of view of giving grants and other facilities than our neighbours in the North or indeed any other country on the Continent.</P>
    <P>The Government would not be disposed to avail of the special provision for grants in excess of £250,000 unless in the case of a proposal offering <Col N="656" /> prospects for the employment of, say, 2,000 or more workers.  In the case of grants for undeveloped area projects, there is, of course, no overriding maximum.</P>
    <P>The Bill also provides for the transfer of responsibility for grants outside the undeveloped areas from the Industrial Development Authority to An Foras Tionscal.  As Senators are aware, grants under the Industrial Grants Act were administered by the Industrial Development Authority who, in essence, were a promotional body. That body then found itself in the invidious and embarrassing position that, having encouraged the promotion of an industry, it had to examine the amount of the grant, if any, to be given.  It was at the specific request of the Industrial Development Authority that it was relieved of these grant-giving functions.  They are now being reposed in An Foras Tionscal which is the body charged with the giving of grants for projects located in the undeveloped areas.  That arrangement will also have the merit that in future there will be only one grant-giving body instead of as heretofore one body dealing with the undeveloped areas and the other dealing with the developed areas for grant purposes.  This should, in the long run, facilitate matters for promoters.</P>
    <P>The total resources available under existing legislation for grants for industrial development amount to £6 million, of which £4 million was provided for the undeveloped areas and £2 million for projects located elsewhere.  Of the £6 million available for industrial grants, over £2½ million has either been paid or approved for payment and the opportunity is being availed of in this Bill to increase the maximum aggregate of grants to £10 million.</P>
    <P>The Bill also proposes to remedy a weakness in the existing legislation in that it does not permit of assistance to be granted to promoters in respect of the capital cost of electricity supply. It is the practice of the Electricity Supply Board to finance what might be described as normal capital costs of electricity supply where they are satisfied <Col N="657" /> that these costs are justified in relation to the expected return.  Substantial capital expenditure may, however, be involved in the provision of transmission lines, sub-stations, etc., for projects located in areas remote from the general transmission system, and the E.S.B. may not be in a position in some cases to undertake liability for total capital costs.  There was one specific undertaking in which the capital cost of electricity supply was so prohibitive that the promoters either decided not to go ahead or to wait until such time as better provision would be made for assisting the supply of electricity in that way.</P>
    <P>Provision has, therefore, been made in the Bill to enable An Foras Tionscal in such cases to provide financial assistance to promoters by way of a grant to cover half the additional cost.  In addition, the Bill empowers An Foras Tionscal to guarantee in whole or in part, that, where arrangements are made for spreading the capital payments over a period of years by addition to the charges for consumption of current, the capital charges will be met.</P>
    <P>This Bill represents a further step towards the implementation of the policy outlined in <i>Programme for Economic Expansion</i> and I confidently commend it to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardMcGuire" hpid="Mr. McGuire Mr. McGuire">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGuire</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill would seem to be, at the same time, a limitation and an extension of the facilities to be provided in future in the way of grants to encourage industries.  We all welcome anything that will expand our economy and our industrial activities so as to give employment.  For that reason, I think the Bill is welcome to everybody.  A commendable feature of it is that there is a more realistic outlook in not confining our encouragement to restricted areas of the country in the belief that by giving grants we shall be able to get industries to go to undeveloped areas even though those areas are not the ideal situation for these industries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Mr. Whitaker has pointed out in <i>Economic Development</i>&mdash;we are all quoting it nowadays; there is so much good sense in it that one cannot but quote it; in fact Mr. Whitaker has put <Col N="658" /> under one cover the facts of our economic life which many of use in the business community have been trying to get over for years&mdash;every part of this country is undeveloped, and not only one area in the west and that therefore we should welcome industries in any part of the country.  I include Dublin in that.</P>
    <P>I saw in the debate in the Dáil on this Bill that people were still harping on the idea that Dublin had too much industry and that industries should be obtained for other parts of the country. We all agree with that, but we are up against the situation now that it does not matter where industries start, whether it is in Dublin or anywhere else in the country.  We can employ Irishmen in Dublin.  There are no places more than 100 or 150 miles apart and seven-eighths of the people in Dublin are countrymen.  It is no longer right to call someone a Dublin man as distinct from a Waterford or Cork man.  In fact it is very hard to find a real Dublin man in Dublin to-day. For that reason, I do not think it matters where the industries are established as long as they come to the country.</P>
    <P>We have had the mentality here in the past whereby we seemed to assume that there are crowds of people absolutely clamouring to get into the country to set up industries, and we said: &ldquo;You cannot come here unless you do this or that.  You cannot come in here if the same sort of industry exists already.&rdquo;  That is a fatal outlook. One of the worst things that was done here at the beginning&mdash;it was done in the form of incentive&mdash;was to give people monopoly markets.  There should be competition in industrialisation just as there is in distribution.  I do not think anybody would seriously suggest that we should limit the number of shops in Dublin or Cork.  That has been suggested but it is very silly. The more shops you have, the better. Let the good ones survive and the bad ones go down.  That is what private enterprise is and it should be the same in industry.  The only way we will get exporting industries is by letting the best industries fight it our inside their own market.  The best ones will not <Col N="659" /> only win inside but will be able to export as well.</P>
    <P>I see from this Bill that there is a choosiness coming into our thinking in regard to those to whom we will give grants.  More care will be taken about the kind of people who will get grants under this new scheme, although the grants may be much larger than in the past.  I could talk quite a long time this afternoon on the development of industry.  Last week, we had several Bills on which this subject was fully discussed.  I, therefore, do not propose to extend the subject to-day since it would be mere repetition.  The Minister has heard all we have to say on this subject.  The only new thing we have in this Bill&mdash;it has been taken out of the Title but it still remains in the body of the Bill&mdash;is the question of the undeveloped areas.  The real point I want to get over is that I think the whole country is an undeveloped area.</P>
    <P>Let us have industries wherever it is most suitable for them.  I am very suspicious of the industry that agrees to go some place outside its sphere of activity merely because it gets a grant.  I am very suspicious of people who, for a grant, will set up an industry in a place which is not the best place for its operation.  In this particular context, as I said the other day, grants are necessary at the right time and in the right place, but as a major means of creating industry, there is only the one policy which we have not tried yet&mdash;perhaps, it is like the Wedding Feast at Cana; we are keeping the best wine until last&mdash;and that is a real reduction in direct taxation.  That is the only thing that will make industries strong and bring industries to this country which are worth while having.</P>
    <P>It will give us industries that will last for good.  They will not depend on grants but on their own strength and business capital created by themselves. Industry would be strong in that way. As far as this Bill goes and for what it is, I welcome it.  Finally, I would suggest that we should seriously think of giving a real incentive to the creation of industry by really getting down to reducing direct taxation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOQuigley" hpid="Mr. O'Quigley Mr. O'Quigley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the kind of <Col N="660" /> Bill that is much more likely to produce favourable comment from this side of the House than some of the Bills we have been discussing during the past few days.  I welcome this Bill which will, as the Minister says, make better provision for the establishment of industries in the undeveloped areas and the areas outside it.</P>
      <P>It seems a wise provision to streamline the operations of the various bodies concerned with industrial expansion up to the present time. While I was wondering why the Industrial Development Authority was being shorn of the power to make these grants, what the Minister has to say seems clear&mdash;that the Industrial Development Authority does not want to have the decision in that matter and that it would make for the better operation of the Industrial Development Authority.</P>
      <P>I hope that the emphasis on the development of what we are calling the undeveloped areas will continue.  It is all very well to say that the whole country is undeveloped.  That may be so but there are some parts more undeveloped than others, and in justice to the people living in those areas who have suffered losses, I think they should get the maximum help at the earliest possible moment.  I hope this Bill will not be so operated that any disadvantages will accrue to the undeveloped areas.</P>
      <P>There is one suggestion that occurred to me.  Perhaps the Minister might consider it.  One of the drawbacks of an industry sited west of the Shannon is the cost of transport.  Goods produced in North Mayo or Galway will cost more to the extent of the increased transport involved because the industries are situated so far away.  I would ask the Minister to consider whether it would be possible to provide some form of relief in relation to petrol and transport generally that would reduce the cost of transport for a firm operating in areas a long way away from the coast.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For instance, the report of the Castlebar Bacon Factory recently disclosed a slacking of activity on their part.  One of the difficulties which a company such as that must suffer is <Col N="661" /> the extra cost of transport from Castlebar to Dublin, if exporting.  It has that additional disadvantage as compared with the factory producing bacon in Dublin.  It seems to me that it should be possible to provide industries which use their own lorries for the purpose of transporting their goods with petrol and, perhaps, with taxation remissions as an case to them and a compensation for the disadvantages from which they suffer.</P>
    <P>I do not know to what extent this Bill ties in with other Departments.  I wonder to what extent there is co-operation between Roinn na Gaeltachta, which has certain responsibilities in regards to industries, and An Foras Tionscal?  Do their functions overlap or do they work in harmony?  It does seem that there may be duplication of effort.  I am not sufficiently familiar with the situation to know what the position is and whether there is a constant exchange of views between An Foras Tionscal and Roinn na Gaeltachta.</P>
    <P>It has always struck me, as a person coming from North Mayo, that very little is heard of the small town of Foxford where there is an industry which was established long before we had native government and which is still thriving and producing woollen goods of various descriptions, blankets, rugs and so forth.  I have often wondered how it is that that village, through all the economic circumstances, has survived and is producing goods of the highest quality.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>That is just why&mdash; quality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOQuigley" hpid="Mr. O'Quigley Mr. O'Quigley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there is something more than that in it.  The industry was located in a very poor region originally because the raw material was there available.  You had very poor, rocky, gravelly soil and sheep were plentiful enough.  It was that, together with the prayers of the nuns in charge of it, that enabled this to become a very worthwhile industry for the people in that locality.  I have always felt that is an example which should encourage and inspire other people who think of founding industries <Col N="662" /> in areas remote from centres of activity.</P>
      <P>In relation to what Senator Ó Maoláin had to say on the Air Navigation and Transport Bill last night regarding remarks which I made, I want to say that I have great confidence in the future of this country and I hope that will be a comfort to him.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="JohnOQuigley" hpid="Mr. O'Quigley Mr. O'Quigley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>As I say, I have great confidence in the country.  I believe that the people in the West have been neglected very seriously over all those years and that they are entitled to the full benefits of the policy envisaged and pursued under the Undeveloped Areas Act.  I hope that the benefits which they will derive under this Bill, far from being fewer will, as the Minister said, be improved and extended.  That is due to the people in the undeveloped areas who have been neglected for a long time.  In the matter of industry, no less than in the matter of agriculture, they deserve better than they have received up to the present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Prof. Quinlan Prof. Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Prof. Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>In discussing this Bill, we cannot fail to be struck by the large scale of the grants involved and by the fact that such generous support in the past has not inspired more industrial expansion in the country.  There appears to be something missing and one wonders if this very liberal grant&mdash; two-thirds of the cost of building etc., and one-third of the cost of machinery &mdash;is the most effective way to encourage local people to help themselves. That seems to be our main problem, to get the people to help themselves.  While these grants may call for local participation, the raising of some funds locally&mdash;and I hope they do&mdash;there is one other contribution to be considered and that is the labour contribution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="663" /> As my reference to this last night was somewhat misunderstood by Senator Murphy, I want to expand on the contribution which I think labour can make.  We would have a healthier industrial framework if the workers in our industries had contributed part of the capital necessary to get those industries going.  I think we all agree that that would be healthier and that they would as a result take a more active part in the management and in sharing the responsibilities for the success or failure of those industries. We know that in some regions workers have not got money to put up the capital.  It then becomes a question of whether the workers should borrow a certain amount to invest in a local industry and pay it back afterwards or, better still, whether there could be some sliding scale in these grants&mdash;in other words, some type of an attractive loan over the years which would enable the workers to take up a certain number of shares in the factory.</P>
    <P>Seeing that our stated aim is to produce competitive products would it not be possible, where we want the maximum output from all factors of production, including the labour force, especially the areas more remote from Dublin, to induce people to work an extra number of hours in the week? This would be one means of getting a worker to contribute to the capital of the factory and of thereby enabling the worker to acquire a certain number of shares in the factory.</P>
    <P>The extra work involved could very well be charged&mdash;I know that my trade unionist friends may not agree with this&mdash;at a lesser rate, in other words, as a contribution to lowering costs.  At the same time, whatever rate is charged could be credited as a local contribution to the capital of the firm.  That would then cut down the amount of State involvement and some money would come back to the State. It would also give that necessary feeling of ownership which I feel is missing amongst many of the employees in our factories.  They regard the factories too much as just a means of providing them with a job at so much a week.  They do not share to <Col N="664" /> that extent in the ups and downs of the factory.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry but the Senator does not know what he is talking about.  The Senator never worked in a factory and he should not cast a slur on the Irish worker.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not casting a slur on the Irish worker.  I make the suggestion because it appears to me that the three elements&mdash;the workers, the Government and the local people &mdash;are in a partnership in their endeavour to develop industry&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator would make slaves of the workers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and I feel that up to this the Government have been giving out very liberal grants. You can get a certain amount of capital locally.  I feel that if we also can do something to make worker-ownership more of a reality, we may approach the point where the factory will be regarded more in the way of a private enterprise rather than a concern for which one works and for which one has no further responsibility or no further share in its schemes.</P>
      <P>To pass on from that point, I disagree with Senator McGuire that there should be no real boundary, that industries are as necessary in Dublin as elsewhere.  That may be.  Dublin could bear more development but only when there is a strong country behind it and, in the last analysis, the problem of migration is nearly as severe a problem as the problem of emigration.  It is just as costly for the State because if we succeed in transferring 100,000 of our people from a region down the country to Dublin, naturally Dublin has to face the cost of housing them and providing all other necessary services for them.  These services are very often available down the country and are only half used, due to the low density of population.  I think we should encourage industry all round and certainly should not be lax in the effort to decentralise it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said that the criterion for the increase of the grant over £250,000 would be that the factory <Col N="665" /> should be capable of employing more than 2,000 workers.  Of course, that hard and fast requirement is not written into the Bill, and I am glad it is not, because I feel that the benefit conferred on the locality should be the main criterion, and that depends on the number of workers and their wages &mdash;in other words, it depends on the total pay packet brought into that community by the industry.  I know I may have taken too rigid a view of what the Minister said, but I certainly feel that the lower level should be the right one.</P>
    <P>Then there is this provision in Section 3(5), of a Department veto.  This semi-State body, An Foras Tionscal, cannot grant in excess of a quarter of a million pounds without getting the approval of the Government&mdash;not so much the Department of Industry and Commerce as the Government itself. That is very much in line with the provision we tried to have inserted yesterday in the other Bill.  It is a rather wise provision and shows that two heads are better than one.  It more than vindicates the stand we took yesterday to give a similar power to the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would say&mdash;at least, looking at the South&mdash;that one of the most striking industrial developments in the past two years has been the erection of cattle marts.  We must regard that as an industry, since it is the machinery for handling our main agricultural product.  As far as I am aware, that development occurred without any grants whatsoever.  It was done co-operatively by the farmers concerned.  I should like to know from the Minister why such undertakings cannot be classed as industries within the meaning of the Act.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCarter" hpid="Mr. Carter Mr. Carter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carter</NameTxt>
      <P>Why should they?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>If the people can do it themselves, it may be good State policy not to do it; but it has been a very splendid achievement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCarter" hpid="Mr. Carter Mr. Carter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carter</NameTxt>
      <P>Where does a fair come in?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>The best part of a half million pounds has been raised in that manner.  The next co-operation needed is co-operative machinery for <Col N="666" /> the processing of vegetables and market garden produce for markets in England and elsewhere.  That development could logically flow from the cattle mart idea.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCarter" hpid="Mr. Carter Mr. Carter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carter</NameTxt>
      <P>Where do fairs come in?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>That would help to provide the money to process these items.  I take it that such industries should come within the meaning of the Act and I suggest to the Minister that they may be capable of very fruitful development in the future.</P>
      <P>Finally, I cannot let the opportunity go without drawing a parallel.  While I welcome this Bill, I would be very much more enthusiastic about it if we could have similar provisions for agriculture.  There should be some grant, approaching two-thirds of the value of the farm and one-third of the value of the stock, to any suitable young man.  Some may say that would be extravagant, but I do not think it would be any more extravagant than the measures we are forced to take now to develop industry.  To get the young people of the Ireland on to the land, we shall be forced to take similar measures.  The product is there but we have not developed it.  I believe that a similar, strong, revolutionary step will have to be taken in the development of agriculture and especially with regard to the pressing problem of farm apprenticeship.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Before going on to deal with the Bill, it might be well to refer to the concluding remarks of Senator Quinlan, in which he sought to imply that the present Government were neglecting agriculture in favour of industrial interests.  Senator Quinlan, and Deputy Dillon in the Dáil, have been constantly reiterating that point. It might be no harm to emphasise again that there has been an increase of nearly £2,000,000 in the current Estimate for the Department of Agriculture over the previous year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a provision in the White Paper for increased amounts to be made available, through the Agricultural Credit Corporation, over the next five years, and in the current year, in the past six to nine months, probably the best credit scheme ever organised <Col N="667" /> for the farming community has been set on foot by the banks, with the co-operation of the N.F.A. and the Government, in the form of the cattle-credit scheme, making credit available to the farmers for re-stocking their land.  That credit scheme, instituted by the banks in the past six months, shows that the banks have absolute confidence in the farmers and in the Government.  It was a revolutionary scheme in itself, but it is going on very well.  Any figures given by Senator Quinlan as to finance available to agriculture should not ignore the enormous sums made available at the moment by the banks, particularly in this cattle-credit scheme of loans, which has been so successful.  However, that is not the purpose of the measure before us.</P>
    <P>It might be no harm to go back on the history, over the past seven years, of grants to industry in this country; and the very real success which has attended Government effort in that regard.  The Undeveloped Areas Act was passed in 1952 by the Fianna Fáil Government of that time, supplemented in 1956 by the Industrial Grants Act, where the principle was extended to the rest of the country.</P>
    <P>The Undeveloped Areas Act has been a tremendous success and it might be no harm to give a few figures as to what it has meant.  Including the supplementary benefits which have accrued from the Industrial Grants Act&mdash;which have not been anything like as great as under the Undeveloped Areas Act, though successful in a modest way&mdash;under the two Acts the total number of projects helped or approved to be helped amount to 77. There is a concrete good; 77 projects are being helped under those two Acts and £2,695,000 has been made available from State funds.</P>
    <P>That is not the whole picture, since that £2,695,000 from the State has brought into being a capital investment in these projects amounting to £7½ millions.  There is a very practical good which has accrued in seven years of operation since the passing of the Act.  The total number of people employed or to be employed as a result of this £7½ million investment <Col N="668" /> comes to 5,655.  I know we require even more progress to settle some of the unemployment difficulties, but there is a concrete step in the right direction.</P>
    <P>Last week, on the appropriation Bill, we had Senator Burke in the front bench opposite, bemoaning the evidence, as he saw it, of emigration, during his stay in East Clare, whence he had just emerged after an unsuccessful election battle.  He spoke of travelling through Feakle and complained about the number of old people he saw and the lack of evidence of young people and of employment opportunities.  I happened to be there, after some success, and within four or five miles of Feakle in East Clare. I was in Scariff, where there is a factory going up for the manufacture of chipboard and wallboard.  It is in course of erection and was started by local capital.  It is being erected by a local firm which has done quite a lot of construction work.  The Government have made available £186,000 for that under the Undeveloped Areas Act.</P>
    <P>That factory, which is based on native raw materials, forest products of State plantations, in East Clare, is practically completed.  The local capital has been supplemented by German capital and German know-how.  It is a project that will employ 200 or 300 people at a minimum; it is based on our own raw materials; and it is assisted by State money to the extent of £186,000.  If that is not the answer to what Senator Burke complains about, rural depopulation, I do not know what is.  It seems to me that is how the matter should be tackled, when you have the Government stepping in to supplement local enterprise. That is only an isolated instance of the type of work done here since 1952, particularly under the Undeveloped Areas Act, and which has made available total capital investment of £7½ million and has given employment to some 5,600 people.</P>
    <P>The Undeveloped Areas Act has been very successful and the Industrial Grants Act has been not so successful. I think it was hastily drafted in the dying days of the previous Government&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I think that of the 77 projects approved, 15 actually arose under the Industrial Grants Act.  The limitations of that Act were very obvious and for that reason it is rightly being repealed and put into this more comprehensive measure.  The Industrial Grants Act only made available grants up to £50,000 or two-thirds of the cost in respect of building: there was no grant whatever in respect of machinery.  This Bill is much more comprehensive.  It retains the two-third grant in respect of building and it raises the maximum from £50,000 to £250,000.  As the Minister indicated, the grant from the Government may be increased in exceptional circumstances, if this is considered desirable.  In addition to that, for the whole of the country, a one-third cost grant for machinery is available which was not available until this Bill was introduced.</P>
      <P>The case has been made in the other House and it may be made here, as I have heard it being made down the country, that this comprehensive measure, by introducing these grants for the whole of the country outside the undeveloped areas will militate against the undeveloped areas and that in some way the balance will be shifted. An examination of the operation of the Undeveloped Areas Act shows the falsity of that and shows that there is a very real differential between the grants available in undeveloped areas and the grants available outside.  The differential is a very real and concrete one.  In the counties west of the Shannon, the Undeveloped Areas Act of 1952 still applies and there is a maximum total cost grant available for the erection of buildings.  The grant outside the west of Ireland in respect of buildings under this Act is only two-thirds of the cost but the maximum total cost grant is still available to any project west of the Shannon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to that, there is a half-cost grant available for the installation of machinery west of the Shannon, that is, a half-cost grant west of the Shannon as against a one-third cost grant east of the Shannon.  That is a very big differential and it has been <Col N="670" /> preserved for future projects which may be located west of the Shannon. The reason for the Government's proper endeavour to increase the grants available outside the west of Ireland is quite obvious.  I would say this was done particularly with export industries in mind.</P>
    <P>If we are to increase our export potential to any real extent, it is obvious that many of the export industries must be located near the east coast.  I am afraid that is inevitable, in the light of present trading conditions. Indeed, that fact is written into the Bill, that it is in respect of export industries that it is chiefly intended to provide.  Such industries may be prohibited, because of transport and other difficulties, from locating themselves west of the Shannon.  For that reason, it is very important that we should have this measure and it fits in with the plans which the Government have announced and which are set out in the White Paper with the emphasis on industries for export.</P>
    <P>I think the argument that the west of Ireland is in any way prejudiced is unsustainable because there is still a very considerable differential in the maximum grants for building while the half-cost grant for machinery is still available west of the Shannon.  To that extent, the same grants are not available east of the Shannon.  I think it is only proper that the differential should be preserved because of the very strong social arguments which should incline us towards development in these counties.</P>
    <P>The policy of encouraging undeveloped areas is, I think, admitted in most countries at the moment.  I think there is a tendency in Britain and in most other countries to shift industries away from cluttered-up centres and there are many good reasons why that should be done here.  The Bill also represents what I might call a tidying up operation in that you now have promotional activity concentrated in the Industrial Development Authority and grant-giving activity undertaken by An Foras Tionscal.  It goes some distance towards carrying out what was envisaged in the White Paper.</P>
    <P>The last important point is that there is now being made available to <Col N="671" /> this body £10 million in resources for grant-giving purposes over the next few years.  Heretofore, the limit was £6 million; it is now being increased to £10 million, and that sum will be available to An Foras Tionscal for grant-giving purposes to supplement the industrial development of the country over the next few years.  That, taken in conjunction with the Bill which we passed yesterday, the Industrial Credit Bill, should ensure that there will be available over the next few years for the industrial drive being initiated by the Government which is backed by way of loans and grants sufficient inducement for enterprises either from at home or abroad to start up and provide much-needed projects.</P>
    <P>It is projects that we principally want.  There is no point in arguing or theorising about nebulous concepts such as we heard about from Senator Quinlan in regard to the workers.  I agree with the trade union organisers that the worker is worthy of his hire. Senator Quinlan's nebulous theorising will get us nowhere.  The State can do something positive.  We can say to potential investors: &ldquo;We have here a scheme of loans and grants and we are making these available to you.  We are also giving certain tax remissions in respect of export industries.&rdquo; If we can provide better and more adequate inducements than other countries can offer, we shall get the investment.  That is the practical way to look at it and I think the Government are, to the fullest extent, implementing what was previously set out and presented to the Oireachtas last September.</P>

Is léiríú don tír é go bhfuil sé ar aigne an Rialtais gníomh éifeachtúil chun leas tráchtála na hÉireann a dhéanamh, chomh fada agus is féidir é.  Tugann an Bille seo an t-airgead agus an chabhair atá riachtanach chun dul ar aghaidh leis an obair sin. Molaim é agus is dóigh liom gur cheart dúinn traoslú leis an Rialtas go bhfuil an iarracht dhéanamh acu chun dul ar aghaidh mar sin.  Ní bheadh coinne againn le haon ní eile <Col N="672" /> ón Rialtas a bhfuil maitheas na tíre ina gcroí, agus in ionad iad a lochtú, ba cheart iad a mholadh as an iarracht seo atá ar aigne acu chun tionscail na tíre a chur ar aghaidh.</P>

Maidir le cáirde a chur ar fáil do no cumainn a bhfuil ar intinn acu tionscail a chur ar bun, nó cabhrú le tionscail, deirtear go bhfuil an soláthar seo ar fáil sa tír ar fad.  Is fíor sin ach ní locht é sin agus molaim é.  Tá an ceart ag an Rialtas ach, taobh istigh de sin, tá beagáinín imní orm ar eagla gurb é an rud a bhí in aigne an Rialtas cloí beagnach go hiomlán leis na dúichí ata forbartha.  B'fhéidir nach ceart an imní sin a bheith orm ach nuair a chloisim Senadóirí mar an Seanadóir Mac Guidhir á rá gur cuma cén áit in Éirinn a gcuirtear tionscail ar bun, tá eagla orm go raghaidh an teagasc sin ródhian isteach in aigne na ndaoine atá ag déanamh na iarrachta agus go nglacfaí leis an tuairim chéanna i dtaobh leas na tíre.</P>

Beidh a bhean ann agus beidh a chlann ann. Beidh tionchar an fhir oibre san áit sin, agus tionchar na mná agus na clainne ar chúrsaí gnóthaí na háite sin, agus is rud rí-thábhachtach ar fad é sin.</P>

    <P>Má bhíonn tionscail anso i mBaile Atha Cliath agus daoine á dtabhairt aníos ó Iarthar agus Deisceart na tíre chun dul ag obair sna monarchain, beidh ar an oibrí a bhean a aistriú ansan, a theaghlach a aistriú nó muintir eile a bhunú ansan dó féin. B'fhearr liom sa, agus b'fhearr don tír, go mbeadh tionscail scaipthe ar fúd na tire.  Sin é an t-áthas a bhí orm leis an mBille chun tionscail a chur ar siúl san dúichí neamhfhorbartha. Níl aon locht agam iad a bheith á bhforbairte i ndúichí eile.

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeOBrien" hpid="Professor O'Brien Professor O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to welcome this Bill as a step in the right direction towards the rationalisation of the location of industry in the country. At a time when emphasis is being placed more and more on the necessity for producing for export, it becomes quite essential that industry should be localised in the most intelligent manner and this Bill is part of the programme of industrial development outlined in the Grey Book and in the White Paper.</P>
      <P>That grants should be given to industries to help them to begin operations is perfectly accepted nowadays. In Great Britain a great deal is done to help the so-called Special Areas and in Northern Ireland a great deal is done to start up factories.  Therefore, we are not doing anything at all exceptional or unorthodox in giving grants to help industries in their early stages.</P>
      <P>I do not wish to go into the whole question of the history of Irish industrial protection since 1932.  It has been debated recently in the Seanad on the Bill for the amendment of the Control of Manufactures Act.  As I said on that occasion, I think it was inevitable, and although it may have possibly been pushed rather too fact, too far and perhaps indiscriminately, at the same time one must admit that it did attain certain benefits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The history of Ireland is that of a country which was backward industrially and it would have been too much to expect that an independent Government would not have done something to try to push industry forward, even if it did so, as I said, rather indiscriminately and too fast. It provided a certain amount of employment in the country which would not otherwise have been there, it reduced a certain number of imports, and in that way helped the balance of payments, and it produced a certain amount of Exchequer revenue through customs duties.  Therefore, the old policy of industrial protection had <Col N="675" /> certain justifications.  But even the people who were most in favour of it 25 years ago now accept that that phase is over, that the home market has been pretty well saturated and that if we want an industrial future we must try to produce for export markets.</P>
    <P>Whatever may be said for a policy of industrial protection&mdash;that is to say, attracting industries inside a national area by means of tariffs&mdash;very little can be said for artificial localisation inside that area.  The exchange of goods between areas, national or international, is a reasonable transaction based on the fact that the cost of production in different areas will differ &mdash;what the economists in their jargon call the law of comparative advantage. If industries are left alone to settle down by themselves without any political interference, every industry will tend to settle down at the point of minimum cost of production and consumers will benefit by the exchange of industrial products from the places where they are produced at a minimum cost, subject always of course to the limiting factor of transport costs.</P>
    <P>The essence of a policy of industrial protection is to interfere with that national and international localisation of industry.  What an industrial tariff does is to raise transport costs&mdash;to increase the cost of transporting a commodity into a nation, not by actually increasing shipping or rail rates but by putting up a protective barrier which has the same effect as the raising of freight costs.  A tariff is really the equivalent of an addition to transport costs.  Therefore, to that extent it limits the area of profitable international exchange of goods and to that extent it tends to bring about a certain artificial localisation internationally which may be justified on all sorts of grounds.</P>
    <P>Every country in the world pursues a policy of protection today.  Therefore it would be unrealistic to argue the pure, undiluted free trade doctrine that there should be no protection in any country.  That would not be suitable for an assembly of this kind and we have to accept that for various <Col N="676" /> reasons, some good and some bad, every country in the world has protected its industries and has to that extent raised the price of certain articles to the consumer and has interfered with the optimum localisation of industry as dictated by considerations of production costs.</P>
    <P>Once an industry has been attracted into the national area, once the tariff has succeeded in attracting an industry behind it, it should be allowed to be located inside the area at the most advantageous point.  The law of comparative advantage&mdash;the law of the interchange of goods based on different costs of production in different areas&mdash; applies nationally as well as internationally. Any attempt to interfere with the localisation of industry inside a national area simply has the effect of raising the costs of production a second time, making the protected article doubly expensive to the consumer. By the original tariff the industry has been attracted into an area where, without the tariff, it would not have grown.  Then, by trying to divert it from the point of minimum cost inside that area to another area, the costs of production are raised a second time.</P>
    <P>That has two adverse consequences. The first is that the price of the article is raised to the domestic consumer more than it would have been if the industry had been allowed to settle down at the point of minimum cost. The second is that the chance of developing an export industry based on fairly low costs of production is considerably reduced if the industry for some reason or other is diverted to a higher cost area.  Therefore, by attempting to interfere with the natural location of industry inside an area, the costs of production have been raised twice.  Therefore, prices have been raised.  In that way the domestic consumer is being unnecessarily penalised and the possibility of exports is being reduced.</P>
    <P>We ought to be clear in this discussion that the unit of economic welfare is the nation, that is the nation as a whole and not any particular part of it.  Therefore, inside the nation, mobility of the factors of production <Col N="677" /> should be tolerated and not in any way discouraged.  We should attempt to have our labour force and national advantages exploited to the maximum. It is a very archaic and indefensible position that any distribution of population inside a nation is sacred, and any attempt to freeze the existing population distribution is really an attempt to go against natural population movements and to resist progress. After all, human progress has depended very largely on the movement of labour and capital from points where it is less profitable to points where it is more profitable. Whereas that may be impeded internationally for national motives, to attempt similar impediments inside a nation requires extremely strong justification and the onus is certainly on people who would advocate such a course.</P>
    <P>That point has been put very well in the Grey Book, at page 159, where it is stated:</P>
    <P>It has been general policy for many years to favour the decentralisation of industry with the aim of bringing to areas away from the larger centres of population some share in the employment and other advantages resulting from industrial development.  It is time to consider whether this is a correct policy to maintain in the conditions which we are now facing...  In our present circumstances, with virtually the whole country undeveloped, it seems wasteful to subsidise remote areas specially by providing more extensive grants.  Special subsidisation of this kind entails additional burdens on the community as a whole and retards progress in the most suitable areas where concentrated effort could give better results.</P>
    <P>Those passages from the Grey Book were written before recent developments in European trading areas, and if they were true when they were written they are even more true today. I take it those passages in the Grey Book form the basis of the Government's policy of industrial localisation which is enshrined in this Bill?  I do not suggest for a moment that there <Col N="678" /> may not be social reasons for attempting to prevent the depopulation of particular areas too rapidly.  That point was made by Senator Lenihan.  Everybody must agree that there may be exceptional circumstances in which efforts must be made to prevent too great a depopulation of particular areas in the country.  Therefore, if this principle is admitted within limits, a certain amount of encouragement of localisation in those areas can be justified.</P>
    <P>But it must be clearly realised that this is something for which an economic price is being paid in order to reap some sort of social gain.  It must be remembered that industries of this kind will of their very nature be less efficient than industries located in places where employers find costs lower.  Industries of this kind should, therefore, certainly not be export industries; they should be home market industries.  The consumer will be asked to pay an additional price for the products of these industries over and above what he would be asked to pay as a result of the straight national tariff.  I am not saying for a moment that that price should not sometimes be paid, but we must clear our minds on the position.  We must be perfectly clear as to the fact that artificial localisation of that kind does incur costs.  We must incur those costs with our eyes wide open and we must try to reduce them to the minimum.</P>
    <P>Whatever we may do in relation to the artificial localisation of industries for the home market, any attempt at localisation for the export market is doomed to failure.  As has been said frequently in the Seanad in recent months, the foreigner has no duty to buy our products unless we produce them at a price competitive with other countries.  In addition, building up industries behind a tariff in order to localise them artificially in high-cost areas is, of course, highly contrary to a policy of attempting to build up export industries.  I assume that the principles I have been trying to expound are embodied in this Bill and that is why I recommend it.</P>
    <P>Preference is still given to the undeveloped areas in many respects. <Col N="679" /> That can, I suppose, be justified on social grounds.  In the Dáil a distinction was made between the undeveloped areas and the underdeveloped areas; the area west of the Shannon could be described as undeveloped and the rest of the country as underdeveloped. Using that distinction, this Bill attempts to help industries in the underdeveloped as apart from the undeveloped areas.  It contains a great many improvements on existing legislation. Procedure is simplified.  The number of authorities concerned is reduced.  There is less overlapping between the various authorities concerned with industrialisation.  There is, too, the possibility of making grants to existing firms which, of their nature, are more likely to expand than new and untried propositions.  The amounts available are increased making it possible to start larger industries with a greater potential for export.  Both the scope and purpose of the grants is increased.  Machinery and equipement may now be assisted in areas outside the undeveloped areas.  There is no doubt that this Bill, if it is intelligently administered, should help in the export drive and, in that way, help our balance of payments problem, which is becoming more and more acute, without injuring the legitimate expectations of the undeveloped areas which still have a claim, on social grounds, to a certain preference.</P>
    <P>The very fact that this Bill was attacked by almost every speaker in the Dáil is rather a good sign.  Everybody seemed to think it would benefit someone else's constituency at the expense of his own.  Representatives of the undeveloped areas said the Bill would help industries in the underdeveloped areas and representatives of the underdeveloped areas said it would help the undeveloped areas. Rural Deputies were all agreed in the usual anti-Dublin complex and said that the Bill ought to be amended so that no assistance would be given to the City of Dublin, which is too well off already.  All this seems to me to indicate that the Bill will probably do good all round.  Everybody in the Dáil seemed to be jealous of the benefits other people would get out of the Bill. <Col N="680" /> That indicates to me that pretty well everybody will get benefits out of it; even the despised City of Dublin, which everybody's hand is against, might receive some benefits under this Bill as far as I can interpret it.</P>
    <P>In order to clarify the position, I want to make it quite clear that there may be reasons of a non-industrial kind, a non-economic kind, for giving particular assistance to certain areas on what I shall describe as cultural or social grounds.  The best example of that is, of course, the Gaeltacht.  The policy of the Government with regard to the Irish language is something everybody accepts.  These areas, therefore, must be assisted as far as possible.  That is agreed in the Grey Book at Page 156 and subsequent pages.  There are organisations like Gaeltarra Éireann concerned with &ldquo;the fostering of industry in Gaeltacht areas.&rdquo;  It operates tweed and toy factories, organises cottage Knitwear industries and markets the various goods.  It has now been established as an independent board.</P>
    <P>On Page 157 it says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Allowing that the Gaeltacht is a special case and needs individual treatment, it should be possible for Gaeltarra Éireann, under the general directions of Roinn na Gaeltachta, reasonably to meet the needs of that case.  Other remote areas may also have special natural advantages in the spheres of tourism, fisheries and afforestation and their potentialities in these respects can be exploited...  For industrialisation generally, remote areas do not, on a realistic appraisal of our conditions, appear to have any good case for special treatment through the medium of a separate body.</P>
    <P>I agree with these statements and they have, in principle, been embodied in this Bill.</P>
    <P>I wish now to summarise the arguments I have been trying to make in order to clarify some of the issues to which this Bill gives rise.  If the object of industrial policy is to build up exports, then there must be no tampering with the optimum localisation of these industries.  If they are tempted <Col N="681" /> into the country by means of tariffs, export bounties and other incentives of that kind, the people running the industries must be allowed to be the best judges of their own interests and they must be allowed to locate these industries at the point of maximum advantage, at the point where labour is available to produce as cheaply as possible and, therefore, to export. Secondly if the object of the Bill is to prevent too great a depopulation in certain areas, certain home market industries must be directed there.  But it must always be appreciated that consumers in other parts of the country will have to pay a tax for the benefit of the people in these areas and there is, therefore, a taxation plus subsidy transfer being made between different areas of the country.  I do not say that can never be justified, but it must be clearly understood that something uneconomic and expensive is being undertaken for some purely social purpose.</P>
    <P>If it is desirable to maintain industries in special areas because of their Irish-speaking characteristics or other reasons of that kind, very well, they can be artificially maintained for cultural gain, in circumstances of that kind.  I would regard them in the nature of social services and I would be inclined to put all the estimates for them together with expenditure on universities, museums and art galleries. It is something in the nature of a social service that industries should be artificially encouraged in the areas where the language is spoken.  I do not, for a moment, say I dissent from that.  All I am trying to do in these few remarks is to clarify thinking on the matter, and see what are the issues involved.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would say this very strongly and I hope that the people whose duty it is to administer this Act when passed will bear this in mind, that in view of our present circumstances in this country the onus of proof on people urging artificial localisation is extremely great.  The onus of proof is on those people and cannot be lightly discharged, especially in the case of export industries.  The new developments that are taking <Col N="682" /> place in Europe today are all against artificial localisation.  All the reduction of tariffs inside the Common Market, and inside &ldquo;The Seven&rdquo; is against artificial localisation.  It is in favour of free trade in the broadest sense of the word, in allowing production to take place at the points of optimum advantage.  That is the trend in our time.</P>
    <P>In the first half of the present century centrifugal forces were at work.  The centripetal forces have now taken their place and, instead of Europe falling apart, as it has in the last 50 years, it is now coming into larger trading areas, and we must bear this in mind.  For us to bring about an artificial localisation inside a very small national area, at a time when all the countries of Europe are seeking larger industrial areas, would be a retrograde step, a step we could not afford, a step that would condemn us in the eyes of the world, a step that could condemn us an unintelligent and out of step with the forces around us.</P>
    <P>The fact is that the recent developments in Europe have created difficulties for this country and the straight speaking of Mr. Cahan, naturally a great friend of ours, the Deputy Secretary of O.E.E.C., was a very needed awakener for Irish public opinion.  Industrial protection in this country is going to be more difficult in future than it has been in the past.  The whole trend in Europe is towards larger trading areas, fewer tariffs, less interference with markets dictated by cost considerations.  We have to swim with that tide or sink.  Therefore, as Mr. Cahan told us, Irish industry in the future cannot rely on a protected market at home.  It cannot rely on preferences abroad, and Ireland has become less attractive as a field for investment by foreigners as a result of recent developments.</P>
    <P>I wish the new Minister for Industry and Commerce success in his office.  I should not like to be in his place because I think he is entering on a very difficult operation at a very difficult time, but this Bill clearly is one step in the right direction at a <Col N="683" /> time when the whole of the Europe is steering towards a more intelligent localisation of industry.  This Bill is trying to get Irish industry more intelligently localised than it has been in the past, and to break down those artificial interferences with localisation which have been raising costs of production, raising costs to the consumers of protected products, and making it more difficult than it would otherwise be to break into export markets.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCole" hpid="Mr. Cole Mr. Cole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cole</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to refer to Section 2 of the Bill under the provisions of which the Board may assist companies to acquire land, construct and adapt buildings and other works, and provide services and facilities in connection with the land to the amount of two-thirds of the cost of the buildings, of the land and the adapting of the buildings.  This is an outright grant in each case.  If instead of making an outright grant of that sum, the money were spent in this way, that the Board would say to a company: &ldquo;Where do you want your factory? We will build the factory for you and let it to you, lease it to you, rent it to you at, perhaps, a nominal rent, or a very small rent, for as long as you want to remain in the factory, and as long as you are producing goods,&rdquo; would that not be a much more suitable use of this money in the interests of the factory?  In other words, the factory is not lost if the company should go into liquidation.</P>
      <P>A company, getting one of these grants or loans, may attempt to start a certain business, with a certain amount of risk.  If it fails, does the building for which we have granted two-thirds of the cost come into the assets of that company when in liquidation?  I presume it does and I presume then that the grant is completely lost to the taxpayer. If we built the factory and rented it to the company, would that not be of much greater advantage?  In other words, we would have that factory to give to some other company and with some reconstruction, if necessary, it would be suitable for some other industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only other point to which I <Col N="684" /> should like to refer is the reply made by Senator Lenihan to Senator Quinlan relative to grants for certain agricultural activities.  While I feel it is slightly irrelevant, I ask your permission, a Chathaoirligh, to reply to Senator Lenihan on that point.  He believes that because the agricultural grant was increased by some £2,000,000 everything in the garden is rosy.  I would remind him that those agricultural grants were not all going into the farmer's pocket.  The money granted for the tuberculosis scheme and other schemes does not all go into the farmer's pocket, but the Senator quoted figures which might be relevant with regard to the £10,000,000 suggested under this Bill.</P>
    <P>He quoted figures showing that there was £7,500,000 of capital invested in industry during recent years, giving employment to approximately 5,600 people.  I think those were the figures. Looking at that another way, if we divide the 5,600 into £7,500,000 we get a figure of something like £1,500.  If we gave £1,500 to each of 5,600 farmers I wonder would we get better results? Better still, if we gave 5,600 young boys scholarships to an agricultural school in this country, or outside it, would the Government and this House not think that would have better results in the long run?  That is why I am a little bit doubtful about the amounts of money we are granting and guaranteeing in this House this week. It is all going in the one direction and thought perhaps this Bill is necessary, I should like to say I am just a little bit doubtful about some of these Bills for that reason.</P>

      <P>It is comparatively easy for me to reply to the debate on the Second Reading of this Bill in the Seanad.

      <P>As a matter of fact, Senator Lenihan practically made a <Col N="685" /> Second Reading reply on behalf of a Minister and no Minister could have explained the purpose of the Bill more fully.  I am grateful to him for it but, however, there are just a few points to which I should like to refer.</P>
      <P>The first point was very well made by Senator McGuire that grants are not always necessary for industrialisation except in the right place.  I tried to emphasise that in the Dáil in another way by saying that the giving of grants is not a <i>sine qua non</i> of industrialisation in this country or in any other country, and in this country, neither inside nor outside the undeveloped areas.  The greatest difficulty there, if one can call it a difficulty, in the present circumstances, is the finding of the necessary capital.  As I pointed out in introducing the Bill, the Industrial Credit Company have now been put adequately in funds to meet any worthwhile industrial proposal, but an occasion may arise when a grant may be necessary in order to give such a proposal the necessary push-off.</P>
      <P>In that respect, I should like to refer to the point made by Senator O'Quigley that perhaps some form of subsidisation of transport might be introduced. An amendment to that effect was put down in the Dáil and withdrawn, I hope, by reason of the force of argument I put up against it. It is felt that it is better in a case like that to give an initial grant in order to overcome whatever disadvantages there may be by way of location rather than to provide moneys annually, which would have to be voted annually, and which, perhaps, in the long run, would lead towards inefficiency and certainly to complacency amongst the promoters of the industry, if they felt, from year to year, for one reason or another, they could lean on the Exchequer to get them out of the temporary difficulties created by the disadvantage of location.  It would not make, in the long run, for the efficient management of such an undertaking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Senator also mentioned the danger of overlapping between the Board of An Foras Tionscal and Roinn na Gaeltachta.  Roinn na Gaeltachta was <Col N="686" /> set up for a different purpose altogether. Senator O'Brien pointed out that there is in that Department provision for special treatment for Fíor-Ghaeltacht areas, and there is also on the Board of An Foras Tionscal a member of the staff of Roinn na Gaeltachta.  That was done deliberately in order to ensure that there would be the necessary liaison between the Department and An Foras Tionscal. Similarly, there is a member of the staff of the Department of Industry and Commerce on the Board as well.</P>
    <P>The point made by Senator Quinlan may have been misunderstood by some Senators, particularly by Senator Tunney who took him up on it.  I feel that what he was suggesting was that there should be a greater realisation of the community of interests between employer and employee.  That realisation is coming more and more into industry and for that reason there is a greater degree of co-operation between employer and employee and a greater degree of understanding of the difficulties between one side and the other, and of the fact that the interests of the employer are the interests of the employee.  The employee knows that unless his employer is prospering and getting a reasonable return for his investment, the interests of the employee himself will, in the ultimate, suffer.</P>
    <P>The provision of Government approval for projects of a magnitude in excess of the maximum grant of £250,000 is not consistent with the point the Senator made during the debate yesterday on the Industrial Credit Bill.  The Industrial Credit Company by its nature must have that degree of confidential negotiation which would not be the same as that required in the matter of the giving of grants. When the difficulty arose about the giving of grants in excess of £250,000, the Government had regard to what would be the best machinery to investigate such a case and, in order to give the necessary force of authority, and to repose the responsibility in the right place, they decided that the Government themselves should undertake the sanctioning of grants in excess of the maximum provided in the Bill. <Col N="687" /> I may say that the figure of 2,000 workers is not a hard and fast figure. I mentioned that in order to give an indication of the size of the industry which would qualify for special grants in such cases.</P>
    <P>Senator Cole's point about the renting of factories was examined in relation to the introduction of the original Bill and it was found that the provision of factories <i>simpliciter</i> in advance of proposals for an industrial project being made was often found to be a fairly expensive exercise, that in many cases the factory proved that it was not in all cases suitable for the industry which would ultimately occupy it, and the cost of adaptation was exorbitant in relation to the cost of the original structure.  As a result of calculations made subsequently by An Foras Tionscal, they decided that the giving of a grant by way of assistance for the building of a factory is more attractive to the proposers.  That may not be consistent with the point which the Senator was making.  On the other hand, our casualties have been very few; in fact, I think they were only two, and of those two one of the promoters handed back the factory as it was to An Foras Tionscal who have since been trying to interest some other undertaking in it.  In the long run, it is better that the grants system be applied in order to give the promoters that freedom of action in design and freedom of action which security of tenure will give to enable them to put their proposed undertaking on a sound footing.</P>
    <P>I was very interested in what Senator O'Brien had to say and while possibly he interpreted in greater extreme all the purposes of the Bill, generally speaking, what he said was true.  In the first place, we must realise that in so far as further industrialisation is possible in this country, it is possible only in the sphere of manufactured goods we have to import or those we can export competitively.  Assistance would naturally be given for the promotion of industries, whether inside or outside the undeveloped areas, for the manufacture of goods we would otherwise have to import and goods <Col N="688" /> which we may be able to export and these goods will have to be competitive both as regards quality and price. If they are competitive as to price, it is reasonable to assume they will require access to ports and for that reason it has been decided that if such an industry came our way, if the necessity arose for the giving of a grant, and if it was established that for good reasons it could not be located in the undeveloped areas, then the industry may, with the assistance of a grant, be located elsewhere.</P>
    <P>If the purpose of the manufacture is export, naturally it must be located in or near one of our ports.  I stated in the Dáil that I looked with some apprehension on the continued growth of Dublin.  Nevertheless, if for the purpose of assisting our economy generally, if for the purpose, for instance, of helping in our balance of payments problem, an industry could be established nowhere in the country other than in Dublin, I do not think we should deliberately legislate to preclude the establishment of such an industry in Dublin, Cork or any of the other big towns, for that matter.</P>
    <P>As Senators have said, there is a realistic undertone in the provisions of this Bill.  I am glad Senators have recognised it.</P>

      <P>Senator Lenihan, speaking on the Second Stage, seeking to allay the fears of people who thought that the undeveloped areas might suffer as a result of the introduction of this Bill, said&mdash;if I took him up correctly&mdash;that industries to be established in areas or in places outside the undeveloped areas would be only for the purpose of producing for export.  Since the Minister has given the status of a Ministerial statement <Col N="689" /> to Senator Lenihan's speech, I feel I ought to raise this point.</P>
      <P>It seems to me that there are three circumstances in which An Foras Tionscal will make a grant to an industry outside the undeveloped areas.  These are set out in paragraph (a) of subsection (1) of the Section. Its size may be a sufficient consideration to warrant the Board's making a grant, the character of the undertaking may be sufficient; or the probable extent to which its products are likely to be exported may be sufficient.  These are three headings under which it seems to me the Board will make a grant in respect of an industry in places outside the undeveloped areas and it is not confined&mdash;as I think Senator Lenihan erroneously interpreted the section&mdash;to industries which will export.  The Minister might confirm that that is the correct interpretation because it might give rise to some misunderstanding.</P>

      <P>On a point of explanation, I did not say that the section was confined to grants for export industries.  I said these grants would in most cases be conferred on export industries.  I doubt if there is such scope for industries of the size and character involved except in regard to export industries.  As Senator O'Brien said, the home market is largely saturated.  In future, I think the reality will be that the majority of the grants will be for export industries. However, that is not in the section and I did not say so.</P>

    <P>If we read that disjunctively we find &ldquo;the Board shall make the... unpaid part thereof&rdquo;.  It does not seem to make sense.  It is not English or even legal English.

      <P>It has just been pointed out to me that exactly similar words are used in Section 3 (1) of the Undeveloped Areas (Amendment) Act, 1957.  That Act brought up the total amount of funds that were available. There had then to be a similar provision where the Board had made a grant and where they had not sufficient moneys.  The subsection reads:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where a grant which the Board have decided to make under the Principal Act remains unpaid in whole or in part on the expiry of the Principal Act, the Minister shall <Col N="691" /> make the grant or the unpaid part thereof on the terms which were determined by the Board.</P>
    <P>I take it that, if the English offends the Senator's and my susceptibilities it obviously has passed the Parliamentary draftsman on a number of occasions. I take it that, in the language of Parliament, he is all right.  I urge the Senator to leave it as it is.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. J. Lynch)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to provide for the payment of additional funds to Bord Fáilte Éireann to enable the Board to operate schemes of financial assistance for the development of major tourist resorts and the provision of additional bedroom accommodation in tourist hotels.</P>
      <P>It is clear that in the general plan to expand the tourist traffic industry considerable importance must be attached to the development of our tourist resorts.  Many Irish resorts are lacking in the facilities and amenities which people expect to find when they go on holidays. We are all aware and proud of the fact that nature has endowed our country with a wealth of natural beauty and other attractions for visitors, but we have to realise that if the tourist industry is to be properly developed, these natural assets must be supplemented by the provision of practical facilities such as promenades, parks and outdoor recreational facilities of various kinds.  Furthermore, in view of the uncertainty of the Irish climate, it is essential that adequate indoor recreational facilities should also be available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the Tourist Traffic Act, 1952, the Minister for Industry and Commerce may, on the recommendation of Bord Fáilte Éireann and with the concurrence of the Minister for Finance, <Col N="694" /> guarantee loans required for the purpose of providing amenities and services at tourist resorts.  In addition, he may authorise the Board to make grants to meet the interest charges arising on such loans for a number of years.  A scheme for the giving of these guarantees and grants has been in operation since October, 1953, but although resort development proposals have been formulated by local interests in some cases, little real progress has been made in carrying out major improvements. The failure of the guaranteed loan scheme to promote resort development may be attributed to the fact that it can of necessity be used only in the case of works which will earn the revenue needed to repay loan and interest.  Examples of revenue earning works are ballrooms, entertainment halls, amusement parks, boating lakes, pitch and putt courses and tennis courts.</P>
    <P>There are, however, many improvement works which are essential for the proper and orderly development of tourist resorts, but which are not directly revenue earning, and consequently cannot, in the ordinary way, be financed by means of loans.  Works of this kind include basic site development, provision of promenades, parks, river-side walks and pathways.  The past experience of Bord Fáilte Éireann in relation to resort development works supports the view that substantial capital investment of a non-remunerative type is essential in order that profit earning activities may later be established.  It is the opinion of the Board that in many centres local interests are unlikely to be in a position to proceed with revenue earning projects unless basic amenities of a non-revenue earning character are first provided; and it is clear that non-revenue earning works of this kind will have to be financed other than by way of loan if the general development of our tourist resorts is to be achieved within a reasonable time.</P>
    <P>It was precisely for this reason that, as announced in the White Paper on Economic Expansion, the Government have decided to set aside a sum of £1 million to assist, by way of grants, the financing of a 10-year programme <Col N="695" /> for the development of major resorts. The new grants, which will supplement expenditure from local resources and the guaranteed loan facilities already available through Bord Fáilte Éireann, will be confined to non-revenue earning works of the kind I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>The grants will be subject to two conditions, namely, that the works to be carried out at a resort shall form part of a fully co-ordinated plan of development for that resort, and that a substantial local contribution will be forthcoming either from a local development group or from the local authority concerned.  The scheme will be administered by Bord Fáilte Éireann and its operation will be limited to 10 years so as to ensure that development of resorts will take place as rapidly as possible.</P>
    <P>It is visualised that the works to be undertaken with the help of these grants will constitute part of an overall development plan to be prepared by the local authority and the local development company or other local interests concerned, in consultation with Bord Fáilte Éireann.  In the normal way the responsibility for the execution of the grant works will rest upon the local authority, to whom the grant moneys will be issued; and the revenue-earning portion of the project will be undertaken by the local development company with whatever funds are raised locally, as well as by means of loans guaranteed by the Minister under the Tourist Traffic Act, 1952.</P>
    <P>It must be realised that the task of developing our resorts is primarily one for local enterprise, even though some assistance from the State is obviously necessary if the job is to be done quickly and properly.  I must emphasise, however, that while the State and Bord Fáilte Éireann will continue to assist financially and otherwise in the carrying out of the necessary development works, the main initiative and effort must come from local interests.</P>
    <P>Local authorities in particular must play their part and adopt a more <Col N="696" /> positive attitude towards the development of the tourist traffic.  Senators who are interested in tourist development can render the industry no greater service than to use their influence to persuade members and officials of local authorities of the importance of the industry and of the necessity for active local co-operation in order that the potentialities of the tourist traffic may be exploited to the full.</P>
    <P>Under this Bill, local authorities and other local interests in major resort areas will, in the course of the next 10 years, have an excellent opportunity of developing and improving local amenities with generous assistance from the State.  By availing themselves of the opportunity they can lay the foundation for the establishment of a thriving tourist trade that can bring additional employment and prosperity to their locality.  This Bill provides that over the next ten years Bord Fáilte Éireann will be able to draw a sum of up to £1 million from the Exchequer to be paid in the form of grants to local authorities and other agencies who are willing to prepare and execute suitable schemes for the improvement of local amenities.</P>
    <P>About eighteen months ago, the House considered another Tourist Traffic Bill, the purpose of which, <i>inter alia,</i> was to renew the power of the Minister for Industry and Commerce to guarantee loans required for the construction, extension and improvment of hotels and other forms of holiday accommodation.  The then Minister said on that occasion that hotel accommodation continued to be a major bottleneck in the tourist industry and that further substantial private investment would be necessary in order that the tourist industry might be enabled to meet the demand for more and better accommodation.  Over the past two years there has been a small increase in the total number of registered bedrooms in hotels and guest houses, but the rate of progress is extremely slow and far from adequate to cope with the growth in international travel which experts say we may expect in the next few years.</P>
    <P>It would appear that one of the biggest deterrents to the expansion of <Col N="697" /> accommodation is the heavy capital cost involved in relation to the comparatively short duration of the tourist season and the consequent low rate of occupancy in hotels in tourist centres. Accordingly, in order to provide further encouragement and assistance for the expansion of hotel accommodation, the Government last year decided to authorise Bord Fáilte Éireann to introduce a scheme of grants to cover portion of the cost of additional bedrooms and bedroom/bathroom units in tourist hotels and motels. The scheme was introduced in May of last year.  The grants cover 20% of the cost involved, subject to maximum limits which range from £275 for a double bedroom with bath to £175 for a single bedroom without bath. Where central heating is installed in the new accommodation a further grant of one-third of the cost, subject to an upper limit of £25 per bedroom, is payable.  In order to finance the scheme over the next ten years this Bill provides for the payment to Bord Fáilte Éireann of a total sum of half a million pounds in that period.</P>
    <P>The scheme of grants can be altered to suit changing conditions and I understand that the Board are proposing certain changes in the scheme as it has operated up to the present. I hope to be able to consider these proposals soon, but my consideration of them will be influenced by the fact that the Government have already provided a very generous measure of assistance in a number of ways to the hotel industry.  Hoteliers already have the advantages of a State guaranteed loan scheme which assures them that the capital required for the carrying out of improvement works will be readily available.</P>
    <P>They also have the benefit of the grants made by Bord Fáilte Éireann to cover the interest charges arising on State guaranteed and other loans for the first 5 years during which the loans are in operation.  If they carry out improvements to their premises they qualify for a remission for seven years of two-thirds of the local rates attributable to the improvements and there is also the concession that 10% of the capital expenditure incurred is <Col N="698" /> allowable as a deduction in computing profits for income tax and corporation profits tax.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, as announced by the Minister for Finance in his Budget speech, provision has been made for the granting of a 2% annual wear and tear allowance for capital expenditure on hotel buildings with effect from 6th April, 1960.  Last, but not least, hoteliers benefit directly from the expenditure of almost half a million pounds which is applied each year by Bord Fáilte Éireann to the general development of tourism and the publicising of Irish tourist attractions.</P>
    <P>The special funds which are being made available to Bord Fáilte Éireann under this Bill for the development of tourist resorts and the expansion of hotel accommodation are, of course, in addition to the existing annual maximum grant of £500,000 which is available to the Board under the Tourist Traffic Act, 1955 for the general development and publicising of the tourist industry.</P>
    <P>I confidently commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOQuigley" hpid="Mr. O'Quigley Mr. O'Quigley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister can quite rightly commend this Bill with confidence to the House.  The only criticism, strange to say, that I would offer of the Bill is in regard to the financial end.  If I had anything to do with the ordering of the finances, I would take some of the money in regards to Aer Lingus and add it on to this Bill.  It would be much more likely to be productive in different directions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that people are generally agreed that the Tourist Board is certainly making progress.  This Bill is designed to assist it in a way which, I think, many people would regard as very necessary.  The provision of ordinary amenities such as seating accommodation, walks and that kind of thing is very necessary.  I have oftentimes felt it was a great pity that at some of our tourist resorts these ordinary amenities were not available to tourists, whether from home or abroad.  I am quite sure that Bord Fáilte will spend this money very advantageously for the tourist industry. It will make benefits available to the <Col N="699" /> people of the country generally as well as to the tourists.</P>
    <P>There is one point in which, it seems to me, sufficient progress has not been made by the Tourist Board. I do not know whether the Tourist Board itself can do very much about it.  It does not make any difference, it seems to me, whether you have good accommodation, if the services to be rendered by hotels are not up to standard.  We are told that the standard of cooking in some of our hotels is extremely low; that there is no imagination whatever in the menus provided and that the food is not served in a way that makes it appetising. After all, when people go on holidays, the three elements that matter to them are&mdash;the weather, food and the bed they lie on.  As far as drink is concerned, the hotels and public houses will take care of that. Nothing much can be done about that aspect of it but the food given to people in hotels is a very important thing.  This does not apply merely to the smaller-class hotel.  Food is the kind of thing that really leaves visitors satisfied.  One of the acid tests in regard to tourists returning to a particular area or a particular hotel is the question as to whether the food is good.  The first inquiry that people make about hotels is what the food is like.</P>
    <P>I do not want to appear as a kind of gourmet but it seems to me that the Tourist Board might direct its attention to the provision of menus which would be likely to attract people and the kind of meal that might leave a good impression on tourists, both Irish and foreign.  I have seen hotels where it is obvious that grants given by the Tourist Board have been expended. There is a lot of gloss and glitter and chromium finish, with bars and lounges rigged out in a very fine style, but other amenities, such as the simple matter of providing toilet accommodation, and the manner in which that accommodation is kept, are absolutely deplorable in most cases.  I often think that the acid test of a management in a hotel is how toilet accommodation is kept.  It is a very simple thing but lack of attention or <Col N="700" /> failure to realise the importance of a matter of that kind is responsible for that defect.</P>
    <P>I understand from some hoteliers that the attitude of the Tourist Board towards the type of accommodation being provided is rather too rigid.  I know of a case recently of an hotelier who would not be in Grade A or in Grade B but as he pointed out when an inspector came around, there are people who go to Grade C hotels because it suits their income.  They do not go to a Grade B hotel because they cannot afford it.  &ldquo;What I am providing,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;is suitable for people with a certain income and I get sufficient of them.&rdquo;  I think regard should be had to the position of that kind of hotelier and that kind of traffic which he is likely to have.  The Board should not insist on the kind of improvements which the hotel proprietor feels would not bring him in any more income, or which if he did make them would necessitate his raising his charges with consequent loss of some of the traffic.</P>
    <P>Another complaint I have heard from another hotelier is that the scheme which An Bord Fáilte wishes him to carry out would destroy the whole character of the hotel.  The inspector from the Tourist Board should look at the hotel as a building and see what should be done.  In this case, the proprietor knew precisely what was wanted and he was not prepared to meet the requirements of the Board.  Consequently, no improvements of any kind were carried out. It may well be that that was only the outlook of that particular inspector, but if it were general, it would be a bad thing.  A great deal of regard should be had to the views of the people on the spot who know the type of trade their area is likely to attract.</P>
    <P>There is another matter which calls for some attention.  There has been an improvement in relation to the sailings from Dun Laoghaire and there have not been the same bottlenecks there in recent years as a result of the representations made by the Department of Industry and Commerce and An Bord Fáilte to British Railways.  The matter on which I am about to speak is something over which we can exercise no <Col N="701" /> control.  I understand there are times when tourists from this country returning to England find on arriving at Holyhead that there are not nearly sufficient coaches to accommodate people in any degree of comfort.  That situation, of course, is likely to create a sourness in the minds of people who have enjoyed themselves here and militates against the prospect of these people returning because of the discomfort they had to endure in the last stages of their holidays.  Some representation should be made to British Railways to ensure that that situation is avoided, or if it is not possible to avoid it completely, that it is minimised to the greatest possible extent.</P>
    <P>I also understand that in regard to the car ferry service which has been introduced no provision is made for a service during the day time.  People who come on the car ferry service from Britain find themselves down at the docks at 4 o'clock in the morning and that is not the type of thing that is likely to encourage these people to come over here, bring their cars with them, buy petrol and so on.  That seems to me to be a matter in respect of which the Tourist Board might be able to effect some improvements.</P>
    <P>Members of the Dáil and the Seanad regularly receive the Bord Fáilte publication <i>Ireland of the Welcomes.</i>  In general, that seems to be a well turned out production but there seems to be an undue emphasis on what is not typical in Ireland.  It conveys a false impression to people abroad that we are still going around in práiscíns and báiníns.  I do not know whether it is fair to the country or to the people living in rural parts that they should be so portrayed in that magazine.  I have known American tourists to come here and to be sorely disappointed with the few castles they found. Apparently they got the impression from some source that Ireland was a different kind of place from that which they found it to be and they were sorely disappointed as a result of their experience.  It seems to me that in this magazine they ought to portray more accurately the conditions which people may expect to find here.</P>
    <P>As I say, the only regret I have is <Col N="702" /> that more money is not being devoted to this well worth while industry than is being devoted under this Bill, and that some of the money being devoted to other matters is not being devoted to tourism.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan2" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Because of its unique importance to the economy of the country, I am sure the House will welcome anything designed to help the tourist industry.  I think there can be little doubt that there are many resorts and many towns which have outstanding attractions but which are not properly developed and which, by the expenditure of even a small amount of money, could be very much improved.  This Bill which combines with the grants for the development of amenities, grants for the expansion of accommodation, should go a long way towards realising the potential income of many towns from the tourist industry.</P>
      <P>I should like to suggest to the Board that when allocating money under this Bill, they should ask a town when preparing a scheme to make up their minds as to what exact characteristics of the town they want to develop.  It should make up its mind as to the principal attraction of the town as a tourist resort, and should build the town as a tourist resort around that attraction.  Every potential resort, every town which holds itself out as having pretensions to being a tourist resort, presumably has some attractions, some amenities, such as fishing, bathing, golf or scenery.  Presumably, it has a number of attractions, but it almost certainly has one outstanding attraction, and it is very necessary that the town should decide what its outstanding attraction is and should devote at least a high proportion of the money it gets towards emphasising its best point.  It should build around its best point and it should aim at having a distinctive character.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nothing would be less desirable than that all our resorts should be more or less alike and have the same attractions.  It is essential that each town should do its best to develop a distinctive characteristic.  A tourist <Col N="703" /> resort which tries to do everything, which tries to offer everything, will probably end up by pleasing nobody and certainly will leave no lasting impression on the tourist who visits it.  It will not move him to think that this is a town which he will never forget, to which he will come back again and again, and to which he will send his friends.  I would, therefore, suggest to the Board that when they are considering schemes from towns and allocating money, they should ask each town to consider that point and try to emphasise a particular attraction and bring out a particular characteristic&mdash;a different one, if possible, for each town.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LouisWalsh" hpid="Mr. Louis Walsh Mr. Louis Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Louis Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to endorse what Senator O'Quigley has said with regard to the standard of cooking.  The Board has a scheme of staff training in a number of places throughout the country and they finance that scheme very generously. I feel that too many waitresses are being sent forth from the six months' course, while hotels find it extremely difficult in those areas to obtain cooks. If more time were devoted to instruction in cooking, by an intensified course, and less time were given to waiting, it would result in quite an amount of good to the tourist industry generally.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Quigley also said that there is a greater demand for grade B and grade C hotels than for grade A in tourist districts.  With that viewpoint I certainly agree.  In an area with which I am very familiar, a middle-class hotel refused a great number of people, through lack of accommodation, while a better class hotel in the area, a much more expensive hotel, just did not have the numbers of people which they could accommodate.  The successful growth of tourism depends largely upon ability to cater for the middle class.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No country in Europe depends to a greater extent on tourism than we do. A reasonable flow of tourist business coming into a district is nearly as important, socially and economically, as a factory.  It can provide a living for <Col N="704" /> people in remote areas where there is little possibility of attracting the industrialist. Compared with the proposals to extend the Undeveloped Areas Act and the Industrial Grants Act, the proposals contained in this Bill are meagre enough, over the ten year period, considering the fact that tariff walls are crumbling all over Europe at present and therefore tourism may be an important factor in our economy in the years that lie ahead.</P>
    <P>This money is well worth while spending on the proposals in this Bill. However, the lesser known areas&mdash; which have considerable potentialities &mdash;will not benefit to the extent to which I should like them to benefit under the Bill.  If the Minister is not aware of the expenditure by An Bord Fáilte on non-major resorts at present and their commitments to that particular expenditure for the next two or three years, I should be grateful if he would make inquiries and find out&mdash;as I have done&mdash;what their expenditure is on these smaller and lesser known resorts at present and what their proposals are in that connection.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated that substantial local contributions will be expected. I cannot see much difficulty in getting local contributions in an urban area or from a borough council, but there is not much chance of getting local contributions in a small area.  A local authority, namely, a county council, may not be in a position to put up the funds.  The Minister will appreciate that that small area is represented by a county councillor who lives a number of miles away.  He will find it difficult to influence the other members of the council.  Even then, the council may not have authority.  As chairman of a county council, I am not so sure that a council can expend money, or contribute to the expenditure of money, other than on a county road or on some matter for which they are responsible, such as the provision of sewerage and water supplies.  The Minister will appreciate that the county council go to considerable expense in providing amenities of a social nature at tourist resorts, in order to help out <Col N="705" /> the tourist.  They also provide lighting. Considering the rate which is being paid now in many counties&mdash;in some of them it is more than three times the rate paid pre-war&mdash;it is not easy to expect them to provide much of a local contribution, even if these smaller areas can benefit.</P>
    <P>At present, no person can carry on a hotel unless it is registered by An Bord Fáilte as a hotel, irrespective of the size of the building.  If it is registered as a hotel, it cannot obtain a reconstruction grant under the Local Government Housing Acts.  A private house&mdash;or a house in which business is being carried on, if there is a separate entrance&mdash;is entitled to obtain a reconstruction grant of up to £140, with a supplementary grant from the local authority of a similar amount; but hotels ae excluded from benefit under the Housing Acts.</P>
    <P>An Bord Fáilte have a scheme under which a grant of £175 is provided, I think, in the case of a single room with bath but it states here that the project shall comprise five bedrooms so that if an hotel erects three or four bedrooms, it cannot qualify.  The minimum size specified is 130 sq. feet for a double room and 80 sq. feet for a single room.  In many places, I find the bedrooms are too large and are not economical.  In other countries, sometimes bedrooms are smaller.  It might be well to investigate whether the prescribed area should be reduced.</P>
    <P>If, as the Minister states, new regulations are being brought before him for consideration I would ask him to see that a project will be entitled to a grant for a lesser number of bedrooms than five.  The Minister will appreciate that there are small family hotels which have not sufficient capital to provide five rooms at one time.  They may not have sufficient space to expand and while the proposal is admirable from the point of view of C.I.E. or the large company hotels, it does not always suit the small family hotel which is important in the tourist drive.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with other Senators in welcoming this Bill.  My <Col N="706" /> only regret is that it did not come to us earlier in the session when we could have, with benefit, I am sure, devoted a whole day to discussing the various aspects of the tourist trade because the Minister in his introduction made interesting references to many essential features of the tourist trade today.</P>
      <P>I feel at one with Senator O'Quigley and others in thinking that the £1 million voted here is too little.  It has been suggested that it should be spent over a ten year period.  I hope the Minister will succeed in expending it in a far shorter time with the desired results so that he will be back before the ten years are up seeking increased grants to meet increased expenditure in this valuable industry.  It is recognised that tourism is our second industry and that it is growing very rapidly.  Consequently, it is coming to the stage where in the future we shall have to make a far greater investment in it and incur much more expenditure than we have incurred up to the moment.  With that in mind, it seems that tourism is so closely linked with our travel facilities that I wonder was it a mistake that the tourist industry was not included in the new Ministry which has been set up to deal with communications and so on, because in many ways tourism is the greatest single contributor to our rail and air services.</P>
      <P>We have an excellent air service between here and the Continent and we are to have a jet service.  If we have this jet service, I feel we must use it to the full and it then comes within the province of the tourist industry to fill these jets.  I cannot see any great objection to what might be viewed by some international authority as a concealed subsidy to the airlines by the Tourist Board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a few aspects of tourism with which I wish to deal briefly.  The first is the number one problem of the tourist industry&mdash;extending the tourist season.  It seems to me that far more positive direction and example are required from the State.  Our tourist industry is largely concentrated into the months of July and August and one of the chief home factors concentrating <Col N="707" /> it there is that school holidays are mainly in those two months.  If we really want to develop and lengthen the season, the Department of Education should set a headline by ensuring that it is possible for parents to take holidays either in June or September. It might be well if schools generally finished pretty near the 1st of June and opened again early in September.  To compensate for that, I do not see why the American practice of having a midterm break between the 1st September and Christmas could not be followed.</P>
    <P>I think the State and local authorities likewise with their many employees could set a headline by putting some premium on holidays taken outside the months of July and August, perhaps by allowing additional days or longer leave, when holidays are taken outside those two months.  In those two months, all our citizens can avail of any good weather periods by going to the sea at weekends or just going down in the evenings rather than being cut off completely from the good period. I think a valuable contribution can be made to the June and September periods.</P>
    <P>I feel we should be able to utilise May and October largely for instructional purposes.  We all recognise that practically all groups, whether farmers, industrial workers or others, require, or could benefit by, a great deal more instruction in various fields. Especially for the farming community, May is a rather slack month, and October in many regions is slack also. Certainly, the region which is busy in May is not very busy in October so that our hotels and accommodation could, with benefit, be utilised to foster the idea of combining business and pleasure, giving instruction to our farming and other communities while at the same time, giving them the advantages of a communal holiday.</P>
    <P>After that, there is still the problem of the hotel staffs and of the extra training they need and also of their holiday period.  One of our greatest difficulties is that when a hotel has its staff trained, the season ends and there is nothing further for them to do but <Col N="708" /> emigrate.  Until we can face up to that problem, we shall find it difficult to maintain the high standard of service that is so necessary in order to keep the tourist industry in the forefront.</P>
    <P>We should explore other possibilities of developing the tourist trade by utilising the facilities we have without having to incur expenditure on elaborate buildings and so on.  I have in mind what might be termed farming family holidays or country family holidays.  People living in the country, by adding a few rooms to their houses, could cater for families during the tourist season.  Many country families have cars and it would be good utilisation of the cars to make then available to the tourists at a reasonable charge during a few days in the week.  We have to be distinctive, as was emphasised by Senator Ryan, and develop what is the chief characteristic of our people, namely, that we are a family people and we should cater for the family unit in the matter of holidays. The family unit is a guarantee of continuity of the tourist trade because the children who come to the country for the first time and see the magic of nature, the animals and everything else that is to be seen on the farm, will go back with a glowing view of Ireland and its attractions and they, in turn, will want to bring their children to sample these pleasures.  That is an aspect of the tourist trade that should be developed.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister will be able to resolve some of our dilemma.  Senators express views in this House but they are third removes from the source of action, Bord Fáilte.  How can the Minister harness the genuine enthusiasm and co-operation in both Houses on such a completely non-political subject as tourism?  I suggest that the Minister might consider using his offices as Minister for Industry and Commerce to set up a joint committee of both Houses, a tourist development committee, which would channel the views expressed in both Houses and would then be in a position to have them presented to Bord Fáilte, to the benefit of Bord Fáilte and Parliament. <Col N="709" /> We would not feel, as we often feel, that we are blowing off hot air and getting nowhere.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to indicate if there is any hope of setting up such a committee.  We all feel the necessity for a committee system here.  We feel the futility of the L. and H. type of debate engaged in on both sides. Would it be possible to introduce the committee system that is in operation in Holland, America and elsewhere? The Minister for Finance disagreed with that suggestion recently because he felt the subject was rather political, that is, the Industrial Credit Company, but nothing could be less political than the development of our second most important industry, the tourist industry. The Minister may be able to set a headline and may be able to harness the energies obviously present here and bring them together, irrespective of Party.</P>

      <P>I do not think I am the only one who is confused as to how the various authorities concerned in the matter of improvements in towns and rural areas and tourist resorts operate.  There are county councils, corporations, municipal authorities, the Board of Works and Bord Fáilte and when we wish to discuss some project, we do not know which authority or what conjoint authority should do it.</P>
      <P>I shall refer to amenities which have been provided in Dublin and the vicinity of Dublin.  Dublin is the greatest tourist resort in this country. Could the Minister indicate to what extent Bord Fáilte subsidised the amenities provided in Dublin?  I have in mind the promenade at Clontarf and improvements at Howth.  They are within the jurisdiction of the corporation.  These improvements are magnificent and are a great attraction to tourists and provide facilities for the citizens of Dublin.  The green that has been created along the Clontarf wall is a great attraction and is used by many visitors and citizens.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That brings me to refer to the Bull Island and Dollymount Strand, which has not been developed to the extent <Col N="710" /> that it should be.  Unfortunately, a group of citizens objected to Corporation plans for the improvement of the Bull Island.  I do not know how the matter stands at present.  It would create a tourist attraction if Dollymount Strand were improved according to the plan which is at present in abeyance.  I do not know how many authorities are involved.  The Port and Docks Board erected signs at the entrance to the strand indicating that anybody bathing there is in grave danger of drowning.  Yet, bathing facilities are provided within 50 or 75 yards of that warning to facilitate people in drowning themselves. That is fantastic.  I suggest that if Bord Fáilte have the authority, they should help in the improvement of Dollymount Strand because it is just as important that developments should take place in the city of Dublin as in any part of the south or west of Ireland.</P>
    <P>The amenities already provided by the Corporation at Howth and Clontarf are a wonderful attraction.  The same would probably apply on the south coast of Dublin.  I read in the paper that people objected to the Corporation taking in portion of Sandymount strand.  Senators will recall that, years ago, Fairview Park was a slobland.  To-day it is a beautiful park and it is delightful to see children availing of the lovely green there on Summer evenings and using the hurling and football pitches. Bord Fáilte, the municipal authorities and other authorities conjointly should provide facilities in the area to which I have referred, which attracts a greater number of visitors than any other area.</P>

      <P>Before the tea adjournment I was speaking about the lack of facilities at Dollymount Strand. It is a pity that better facilities cannot be afforded by somebody, be it Bord Fáilte, the Board of Works or Dublin Corporation.  At holiday week-ends up to 20,000 people visit that island.  If there is a sudden downpour, those <Col N="711" /> unfortunate families are drenched before they reach the Clontarf road where they can get buses back to the city.  I saw plans for the provision of magnificent facilities, shelters, toilets and so on which, unfortunately, for some reason or another are in abeyance at present.</P>
      <P>I leave the North side and go to the South side to Dun Laoghaire.  It is a few years since I travelled by train from Dun Laoghaire to Dublin.  I never saw worse carriages anywhere than on that train.  If such carriages are still provided for the conveyance of tourists from Dun Laoghaire to Dublin, it is a very bad advertisement for the country at a time when these tourists are setting out to enjoy a holiday in Ireland.  The facilities at the pier itself have been greatly improved, but they are still not sufficient to meet the great influx of people coming by boat and travelling by train to Dublin. It is a big contrast with the splendour of the airport and the approach to Dublin for those who can afford to travel by air.</P>
      <P>I move now from Dublin, having commented favourably on the improvements at Howth and at the esplanade at Clontarf.  Last Sunday I travelled to Navan.  Passing over the bridge near Navan, approaching one of the nicest towns in Ireland, I asked in astonishment was the river over which I was passing the Boyne.  Because of the accumulation of mud and &ldquo;flaggers&rdquo;&mdash;I think that is what they call them&mdash; the royal iris and fallen trees, you could not see this river which is of such historic importance.  The river could form a lovely approach to the town of Navan if it were cleared and cleaned, and I am sure it would be a great attraction for anglers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The conditions there struck me as something that should not be allowed to exist.  Tourists coming to this country often make Dublin their headquarters and drive to various places in the precincts of the city.  Anybody seeing the condition of the Boyne would be tempted to ask what the local authority, the Board of Works, Bord Fáilte or whatever authority is responsible, was doing in the matter.  The <Col N="712" /> same thing applies in other cases, too. It all adds up to a disparagement of the beauties of our country and indicates complete neglect.</P>
    <P>I wish to pass now to a wider field and deal with the provision of bathing facilities at seaside and inlands resorts. Killarney had no bathing facilities on the lakes for visitors anxious to have a dip in Lough Léin. Then, for some reason or other, the bathing facilities provided were entirely inaccessible to the ordinary people.  The only means of ingress was through the golf links.  Possibly one could be prevented from using the golf links as a right-of-way.  It seemed rather extraordinary to put this magnificent swimming pool in such a locality.  Possibly it was Bord Fáilte who were responsible for providing the pool, but the position in which it is sited is quite fantastic.  It is too far from the town and access to it might possibly embroil one in an action for trespass.</P>
    <P>Last year I was in a small village in West Cork.  The weather was bad. Had the weather been fine, the situation would have been rather perplexing. There were no proper bathing facilities and it would have been quite impracticable to bathe under the conditions that existed there.</P>
    <P>As far as the countryside generally is concerned, for quite some time now I have been campaigning for the use of lime-wash.  Everywhere one goes, one sees relentless grey walls and grey houses.  Lime-wash would brighten things up considerably.  Its application is easy.  It is comparatively cheap.  Such houses and cottages from Cork to Connemara and Donegal should be lime-washed.  That would enhance the natural scenery from the point of view of the tourist.  Equally, our towns are drab in appearance.</P>

      <P>It is the Senator who is the saboteur.  I do not interrupt the Senator when he speaks and I expect to be accorded reciprocal <Col N="713" /> treatment by him.  I am not sabotaging anything.  It is not sabotage to point out how amenities might be provided or conditions improved at very little cost.  One always appreciates the town which receives a liberal coat of paint. There are towns in which development associations look after these things and the towns in question are a credit to these associations.  Last year I travelled through the little village of Durrus.  I understand it was placed quite highly by the Tourist Board, though it did not get first place.  It was a pleasure to drive through it.  There were about 20 houses, and each one had been freshly painted.  Surely other villages could follow the good example set and improve the appearance generally of the villages.</P>
      <P>I do not suppose Bord Fáilte could do anything about bathing in dangerous waters.  Last week two young men were drowned in the River Liffey through being entangled in the weeds. Of course, it is foolish for people to go into water in which there are weeds. On the other hand, it is not always easy to resist the temptation.  Some steps should be taken to clear rivers of weeds, particularly rivers in the more densely populated areas which are availed of by people for bathing and swimming.</P>
      <P>With regard to the facilities in our hotels, I have never had any complaint about either food or accommodation. Admittedly, I avoid the rush periods and I believe that it is during the rush period that cause for complaint arises. It is rather an extraordinary situation that two Grade A hotels in the City of Dublin were prosecuted not so long ago by the Dublin Corporation for non-compliance with the health regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I remember, when the Health Bill was being enacted here, I referred to the fact that there would be duplication of inspectors.  At one time I myself was one of those Corporation inspectors, and I say that it is not the butcher shop but the place behind it to which attention should be paid. In hotels it is the kitchen which requires inspection and care, as far as cleanliness and hygiene generally are concerned.  It is a curious fact that Dublin Corporation had to prosecute <Col N="714" /> two first class Grade A hotels for not complying with hygiene regulations, though prior to that Bord Fáilte had the responsibility of grading them.  To my mind, it does not reflect credit on Bord Fáilte that such an event should occur.</P>
    <P>I shall conclude by referring to O'Connell Bridge and by saying that down through the years I have been angered by all the derogatory remarks made by architects and other allegedly aesthetic people upon what they call: &ldquo;The thing on O'Connell Bridge.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I certainly did not intend to make any contribution to this debate until I heard the remarks of my namesake on the far side of the House.  I am not an aesthete. I make no pretence to being an aesthete, but I dislike this managerial stunt when they put up a monstrosity of that sort, and I know that the whole public opinion in the city of Dublin stands out against it.  The Senator, I suppose, was a chief officer.  There was nothing in this city, in relation to tourism, that gave rise to so much genuine criticism as the disgraceful monstrosity on O'Connell Bridge, and it says very little for the elected representatives of the people that they did not order it to be removed.  Many times I have had a low opinion of that body but my opinion was never so low as when they did not order the people who put up that monstrosity, that disgraceful affair on O'Connell Bridge&mdash;and I suppose the Senator was one of the managers, one of the backroom boys in the Corporation&mdash;to have it removed. I am surprised that he should have the cheek to stand up tonight and defend that thing.</P>

It is no defence to say they put nice flowers along O'Connell Bridge.  It would have been all right to sink a flower bed into the bridge, level with the surface of the bridge, and nobody would have any objection to it.  I do not stand up here as a person who has any knowledge of art but I do know the reaction of the people of Dublin to it, the unanimous reaction of the Press and the reaction of the people who commented on it.

      <P>In conjunction with other Senators I should like to welcome the Bill because any Bill providing money for tourist development is, in my opinion, a good measure, and provides a valuable investment for the country.  At the outset, I should like to compliment the Minister for Industry and Commerce on taking over that important Department and to say that his success as <Col N="717" /> Minister for Education leads me to believe that suggestions made here will receive from him the same attention as suggestions received during his most successful term as Minister for Education, and that they will be followed up in the same way as were the suggestions made to him at that time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>Hear, hear!</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasMullins" hpid="Tomás Ó Maoláin Tomás Ó Maoláin">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Ó Maoláin</NameTxt>
      <P>Therefore, I think that the suggested Joint House Committee to discuss tourism, and examine problems relating to it, is completely unnecessary because I am convinced that the Minister will not alone have taken note of what was said here to-night but will read the Official Report of the debate.  I feel that, in due course, if he considers something valuable has been suggested by any Senator, he will bring it to the attention of Bord Fáilte.  On a couple of occasions during the last two years I devoted some time, during the course of my remarks in this House, to the question of tourist development.  I do not propose to go over the whole ground again to-night but I am afraid, judging by the complete lack of activity in regard to some of the matters suggested, that the people in Bord Fáilte must not have read the Official Reports of Seanad Éireann because there were excellent suggestions made here last year during the debate on the Tourist Traffic Bill and on the Appropriation Bill which, I fear, received no attention from Bord Fáilte.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to be taken as in any way trying to deprive Bord Fáilte of the credit which I think is due to them for their endeavours to do a creditable job for tourist development in this country, but I am obliged to say I am not satisfied that the dynamic drive which we were led to believe would be put into the tourist industry has yet materialised.  When we hear that there was only a small increase in the number of bedrooms provided during the past two years, in spite of all the advantages now available by reason of legislative action here, it is proof, in my opinion, that Bord Fáilte are not putting the push behind one aspect of tourist development which is its most <Col N="718" /> important aspect, that is, the provision of accommodation for the visitors we expect to attract.</P>
    <P>The greatest bottleneck in the development of tourism, in my experience, is the complete and utter inadequacy of single bedroom accommodation. Very little effort, if any, has been made by Bord Fáilte to encourage hoteliers to go into that aspect of the problem in a big way, in a way which will ensure that a potential visitors trade of many thousands will be secured for this country and not lost, as it is being lost, by reason of the fact that adequate accommodation in single bedrooms is not available in any of our reports.  Neither is it available in the city of Dublin.</P>
    <P>I know of one hotelier at the movement who has been turning down applications for single bedrooms at the rate of 20 a day for the months of July and August simply because he has not got the accommodation, and does not see any prospect of providing it.  I referred on previous occasions to the case of a father, mother and their grown-up daughter, or an engaged couple, who write to a hotel and ask for single rooms.  The father and mother want one double room and one single room and the engaged couple want two single rooms, but the hoteliers, by reason of the fact that the income from the double rooms is much more attractive and popular, are in a position to let double rooms but not single rooms, with the consequence that the father and mother and grown-up daughter probably do not come here at all but go to the Continent, or take their holiday in a caravan or in a camp in England.  Something must be done about that and, in my opinion, nothing has been done.</P>
    <P>Under this Bill, £500,000 is now being provided in the form of grants for the purpose of development of holiday accommodation.  I hope the Minister for Industry and Commerce will strongly urge on Bord Fáilte that the greater proportion of that £500,000 should be allocated to hoteliers who are prepared to go into this project of the provision of single bedroom accommodation.  More than that must be done.  If a hotelier builds a block <Col N="719" /> of single rooms, he finds that the furnishings are just as costly as the furnishings of double rooms and he finds that his income from a single room is half what it would be from a double room.  On top of that, when he has completed the job and provided accommodation for that class of tourist, which is a most profitable class, he finds that his local authority will slap an increase on his rates.</P>
    <P>Therefore, there is active discouragement to any hotelier to extend his premises in the direction of providing single room accommodation.  Some consideration should be given by the Minister or by Bord Fáilte, or both, to the possibility of hammering out some scheme which will encourage hoteliers, not only in the form of grants and guaranteed loans, but in the form also of a cut in rates either for a stated period or for good, to provide by new buildings single room accommodation for visitors.  There is no doubt that there is a big potential tourist trade being lost to us for these reasons.  I feel that unless the drive comes from the authorities directly concerned with tourism, such as the Department of Industry and Commerce and Bord Fáilte, the hoteliers by themselves will not go into the matter on a big scale.  I hope, as I say, that something concrete will come out of these discussions here today in that regard.</P>
    <P>I am not satisfied either that Bord Fáilte have broken through the red tape and the administrative bottleneck about which we heard something during the debate on the Tourist Traffic Bill last year.  I am not satisfied that they have overcome the delays which we were told they would overcome in a short time.  Particularly am I not satisfied that they have solved the problem of dealing with applications for loans from the point of view of their architectural section.  I complained on former occasions of the delays in regard to the approval of plans or the inspection of actual projected improvements for hotels.  I feel that these applications, and perhaps the plans also, hardly ever get beyond a junior official.  I do not say that <Col N="720" /> applies to every case but it certainly does apply to some cases I know, and I am convinced that the reason for their rejection and the reason for the discouragement given to hoteliers is that the Board itself or its higher executives did not hear of these cases and had no opportunity of examining these applications.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand how it is that a situation such as this can arise.  A man who invested quite a considerable amount of money in a hotel, who showed initiative, ability and vision in the modernisation of the hotel, and who had practically committed his available capital to the improvement and further extension of that hotel, applied to Bord Fáilte for one of these interest free loans to the tune of between £3,000 and £4,000.  He submitted plans to Board Fáilte, and the plans were visionary plans which involved pretty big structural alterations, and when he applied for the £3,000 or £4,000 loan, he had collateral to the extent of £25,000 in the shape of three buildings, valued by independent valuers.  He also had money still in the bank which he did not want to touch but he could not get the loan. The excuse was that his plans were not as satisfactory to the board's architect as they should be.  I think Senator O'Quigley referred to something of that nature.  If I understood him correctly, I should like very much to support his remarks in that regard.</P>
    <P>He did not get this loan and he almost became discouraged.  Fortunately, being a man of courage and vision, he decided to commit his remaining capital.  He went ahead with the job and has done it himself. He now has one of the finest modern hotels in this country.  His experience is most discouraging.  When he meets other hoteliers and tells them of his difficulties they are inclined to become discouraged and to throw up the sponge at any possibility of development of their own premises in view of the fact that that small amount of money was not made available to him despite his excellent security.</P>
    <P>Loans and grants, particularly interest-free loans, should be as easily <Col N="721" /> obtainable by a solvent business man as it was at one time possible for a solvent business man to get an overdraft in the bank.  I hope such accommodation will again be provided.  That is a bottle-neck that has to be widened if we are to make any progress in the provision of the tremendous amount of bedroom, lounge and bar accommodation required in many of our hotels.</P>
    <P>Senator Seán Ó Donnabháin referred to Dún Laoghaire.  I want again to draw the attention of Bord Fáilte who, I am afraid have done nothing about it, to what those in the hotel trade believe to be the greatest single factor militating against the extension of the tourist season, for the months of May and June particularly.  I refer to the lack of a day sailing in the Holyhead-Dún Laoghaire route.  There are thousands of people in England&mdash; which is our best tourist market, in my opinion&mdash;who would like to come to Ireland and who would have money to spend.  Seventy out of every 100 people who visit this country come by sea.  Not everybody likes to fly and not everybody can afford to fly. There are thousands who come by sea and there are thousands who would like to come here.</P>
    <P>Many of them want to avoid the peak period rush holidays in July and August and would like to come here in May or June.  Some of them are old. Many of them do not like the long train journey from North-eastern England or from South-western England and the night trip on the boat which is involved in May and June.  If British Railways could be persuaded to put on a day's sailing from, say, the middle of May instead of, as at present, the 1st July a tremendous number of potential customers from the Midlands of England, particularly, would be inveigled into availing of the service. They would come over here in the months when our tourist trade is slack and when our hotels are in an excellent position to cater for them.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of all these journeys by sea is the deplorable service between Glasgow and Dublin.  Apparently no effort has been made to improve that service.  I suggest Bord Fáilte <Col N="722" /> could ensure a tremendous increase in tourist traffic if some steps were taken to ensure a decent service on the Glasgow-Dublin and the Dublin-Glasgow route.  I do not think it necessary to develop these points any further except to say, in connection with Senator Seán Ó Donnabháin's remarks&mdash;and Bord Fáilte might take this up, too&mdash;that the first thing the tourist who lands on the mailboat pier at Dún Laoghaire sees these bright sunny mornings is a dilapidated puffing billy of a steam engine.</P>
    <P>We have some of the finest diesels in Europe on some of our lines as, for instance, on the Westland Row-Wexford line.  Yet the first thing a visitor sees when he lands at Dún Laoghaire is an old-fashioned steam engine.  It puffs up and down there for half an hour getting up steam in a station on which hundreds of pounds were spent to beautify it with beautiful white paint and a very nice colour scheme.  It will not be long before the beautiful white paint is as black as the railway station used to be before the diesels came.  Soon the goods impression created by this fine job which C.I.E. have done will be lost because of these old steam engines.</P>

      <P>Bord Fáilte should put this up to C.I.E. Why is it necessary to use steam engines and give the people such a poor impression of Dún Laoghaire and Ireland when they arrive at the pier?</P>
      <P>I think the money voted for the development of tourism is well invested and I should like to see much more of it.  If the drive is made on the lines suggested in regard to single-bedroom hotel accommodation, Bord Fáilte will secure, without the expenditure of thousands of pounds on newspaper publicity abroad, thousands of customers who are now forced to deprive themselves of the pleasure of a visit to Ireland because of the lack of the accommodation to which I have referred.</P>

      <P>I congratulate the Minister on the introduction of this Bill which is designed to help one of our <Col N="723" /> major industries.  I agree with those Senators who say there is room for improvement in the cooking in many of our hotels.  The menu in many of our hotels is the same year in and year out. There is a scarcity of trained personnel in that profession.  We should do something to improve the quality of the cooking in our various hotels.</P>
      <P>Last Sunday morning I had experience of a hotel in the principal tourist town in the West of Ireland.  I came to that town hungry and poor.  I was not a tourist but a visitor.  I had money to pay for a meal for myself and for those who were accompanying me.  I asked a respectable gentleman on the street where I could go for a meal.  He pointed to a hotel and said it was one of the best hotels there.  I proceeded to that hotel.  On the way to the dining-room, I met a gentleman who stopped me.  I said: &ldquo;The dining-room, please.&rdquo;&ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but you will have to get a ticket.&rdquo;  I asked: &ldquo;A ticket for what?&rdquo;  He said: &ldquo;A ticket for the dining-room.&rdquo;  I said that that was all right.  He produced a ticket and said that a meal in the dining-room cost 6/6d. and consisted of a mixed grill.</P>
      <P>I was hungry and, were it not for that, I would not have had a mixed grill.  However, I paid for it and proceeded to the dining-room with my friends.  I had no choice.  It was one o'clock in the day in our principal tourist town in the West.  At one of the principal hotels there, I could not get a lunch unless I was prepared to accept what was called &ldquo;a mixed grill&rdquo; but was not a mixed grill.  It consisted of bacon, egg, a small piece of pudding and a bit of tomato.  It had obviously been cooked for a considerable length of time.  I am not making a complaint.  I was glad to get anything.  However, I thought over this matter and remembered that that hotel was aware that there was a considerable number of people in the locality on Sunday last.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They knew well there would be some rush on them although there was no rush at the time I was there. That was all they had to offer and, if there were tourists from Carolina, <Col N="724" /> there would be no other treatment for them than to pay for their meal and take what they got.  If that is all that can be expected from our so-called Grade A hotels, the Tourist Board is falling down on a job.  I am not exaggerating the facts of the case I have instanced.  I protested to the manager at being charged for a meal before it was provided.  I should like to make that protest here this evening particularly on account of the town where it happened, in the tourist area.</P>
    <P>There could be a big improvement in the cooking of meals in hotels and in the manner in which they are served.  Our vocational committees and other organisations could help by training staffs for our hotels.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that money is being provided to help local bodies to improve the amenities of our tourist centres.  I would suggest to the Minister that one object to which we might allow money to be devoted, apart from the provision of water, sewerage and other amenities, is derelict sites and ruins which are to be found in every village and town in many of our tourist counties.  Local bodies, I do admit, have powers under what is known as the Derelict Sites Act to remove these unsightly ruins but this puts a direct charge on the rates and in most counties the rates are not able to bear it.  I agree with Senator Louis Walsh who says there is a danger that public bodies will not avail of this money because they have too many other commitments to meet.  I would ask the Minister to consider giving assistance to public bodies to deal with these derelict sites and ruins that are destroying our countryside.  You can travel through many of our counties, particularly in the tourist areas, and see no houses except unsightly buildings without roofs which are a disgrace to our countryside.</P>
    <P>I heard Senator Seán Ó Donnabháin being interrupted a few minutes ago. He should not have been interrupted because the suggestions he made were practical and worthy of adoption.  I hope that as a result of the passing of this Bill there will be great improvements in many of our tourist centres. I have one other suggestion to make. <Col N="725" /> Apart from tourist areas, adjoining the sea, we have some splendid tourist centres in the heart of Ireland.  Take County Westmeath, where we have some of the most beautiful lakes in Europe, most of them neglected.  They could all be improved.  I should like to know if money under this heading can be utilised for the purpose of improving those lakes so that they can be brought to the notice of the people who come to Ireland to spend their money.</P>

      <P>I, like the other Senators, welcome the Bill and hope great benefits will come from it.  The only comment I have to make is to disagree strongly with the point made in such an excited fashion by Senator O'Donovan in regard to the thing on O'Connell Bridge.  As a Dublin man I think it is one of the greatest improvements to our city in recent years. I disagree with him also on the point that the people generally do not approve of it.  My experience is that nine out of every ten people approve of it.  As a Dublin man sitting in this House, I did not want to remain silent on this question.  I believe the whole opposition in this regard has been merely the result of propaganda by a small section of the people of Dublin. The vast majority of the people of Dublin think that structure is a great improvement and an amenity that ought to be left there.</P>

      <P>Níl mórán le cur agam leis an méid molta atá déanta ar an mBille seo.  Molaim é agus is cúis áthais dom go bhfuil a leithéid á bheartú agus á chur chun cinn.  Tá ní amháin nár cuireadh aon bhéim air agus sé sin go bhfuil dhá chineál tráchta cuairteoireachta againn in Éirinn, trácht cuairteoireachta laistigh den tír féin do mhuintir na hÉireann gur maith leo dul ar saoire agus cuid eile d'Éirinn seachas a gcuid féin a fheiscint.  Is dóigh liom gur ceart go luífi níos mó air sin mar tá cuairteoireacht chomh riachtanach dár muintir féin agus atá sé riachtanach córacha a chur ar fáil dóibh sin comh maith le iad a chur ar fáil do dhaoine ón iasacht.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tá an difríocht seo ann, dar ndóigh: <Col N="726" /> na cuairteoirí laistigh d'Éirinn ní chuireann siad aon mhéadú ar an ioncam náisiúnta.  Tá an t-airgead laistigh den tír cheana a chaithfidh ár muintir féin má théann siad ar thuras go Cill Áirne, Gaillimh nó Dún na nGall, agus b'fhéidir nach bhfuil sé sin chomh tábhachtach i gcúrsaí airgid leis an rud eile, ach is tábhachtach thar barr é do mhuintir na tíre féin, do mhuintir Baile Átha Claith, dul fén dtuaith nó muintir na tuaithe teacht go Baile Átha Cliath, nó go háit eile art mhaithe lena sláinte nó ar mhaithe le saoire dóibh féin.</P>
    <P>Is tábhachtach chomh maith na daoine a thagann thar lear go hÉirinn.  Siad sin a bheireann leo an t-airgead breise atá chomh tairbheach do thráchtáil na cuairteoireachta.  Ní eile, níor cheart dearmad a dhéanamh gurb iad ár gcine féin dhá dtrian de na daoine a thagann anso ó Shasana nó ó na Stáit Aontaithe.  Tá sé riachtanach córacha a bheith ullamh dóibh, ní amháin chum iad féin a mhealladh ar ais arís ach chun daoine eile a ghríosadh chomh maith.</P>
    <P>Tá sna Stáit Aontaithe tuairim is 20 milliún daoine go bhfuil cuid de dhúchas na hÉireann iontu.  Ba cheart dúinn oibriú orthu sin agus oibriú orthu ar an dtuiscint gur cuid dár gcine fein iad agus gur ceart dóibh turas a dhéanamh go hÉirinn.  Tá Éire ann anois nárbh eol dár seanaithreacha céad bliain ó shin.  Ba cheart dúinn súil a choimeád air sin agus feidhm a bhaint as agus tuilleadh spéise a mhúscailt i measc na ndaoine a thugann cuairt ar na ceantair úd as a dtáinig siad.  An chuid is mó de na daoine a thagann ó Mheiriceá agus Sasana is de chine na hÉireann íad.  Meallann siad san daoine eile. Meallann áilleacht na hÉireann, compord na hÉireann agus caraictéar na hÉireann roinnt eile ach is roinnt bheag é.</P>
    <P>Is iad ár muintir féin na daoine is mó a thagann ar cuairt chugainn.  Is dóigh liom gurab é an cuspóir ba cheart a bheith ag Bord Fáilte Éireann ná fáiltiú thar n-ais roimh na daoine a chuaigh ó Éirinn thar lear agus a chur in iúl dóibh go bhfaghidh siad luach a gcuid airgid.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="727" /> Ba mhaith liom dá dtabharfadh an tAire tuairim éigin dúinn faoi cad é an gléas atá ag Bord Failte Éireann chun na tithe ósta a riaradh mar ba cheart maidir le compord an lucht fanúna iontu, maidir le bia, riar bia, agus maidir le córacha eile a bhaineann le turasóireacht.  An bhféadfadh cigirí cuairt a thabhairt ar na tithe ósta sin gan a chur in iúl roimh ré go bhfuil siad ag teacht, ionas go bhféadfaidís rudaí a réiteach cosúil leis an ngearán a rinne Seanadóir anois beag i dtaobh lóin a fuair sé nach raibh sásúil i dtig ósta den Ghrád A i mbaile éigin san Iarthar?  Is dóigh liom go mba cheart go mbeadh eolas le fáil i dtaobh cé acu atá na tithe ósta sin dá rearadh fé mar ba mhaith linn iad a bheith.  Ba cheart dúinn luí air sin&mdash;luí ar an bhfírinne.  Is iad ár muintir féin na cuairteoirí is iomadúla a thagann ar cuairt chugainn in Éirinn agus ba chóir dúinn ár ndícheall a dhéanamh chun go dtiocfaidís thar n-ais arís agus taitneamh a bhaint as a dturas.</P>

      <P>In so far as there was any criticism levelled against this Bill, apart from An Bord Fáilte, it was that sufficient money was not being made available under its provisions for the purposes set out.  I should like to remind Senators, however, that the provisions in this Bill are not total amounts.  The £1,000,000 provided for amenities is intended to supplement local contributions.  I should like to remind Senators also that all the ills from which our countryside suffers are not the responsibility of An Bord Fáilte and that there is an onus on local authorities, much more than they have been inclined to accept in general, to brighten up the countryside and avail of the facilities they have for the clearance of derelict sites and so forth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I might say, however, that even though the Derelict Sites Act is in existence, it has not been, for one reason or another, availed of to any appreciable extent for the purposes for which it was intended.  Therefore, there is in preparation in the Department of Local Government the heads of a Bill that will speed up the clearance and facilitate in general the clearance <Col N="728" /> of these derelict sites throughout the country.  I have to travel to many places myself almost every week.  I agree with Senators that it is unpleasant to see houses that have been vacated, with thatched roofs falling and haybarns with rusty corrugated iron hanging down and not used. These are eyesores that should be removed on the very earliest possible occasion.</P>
    <P>It is a pity that local authorities have not availed of the powers they have.  It is hoped that with the powers they will get and the facilities that will be available to them, they will tackle that job with greater vigour and with some effect.  We all agree that we have in this country facilities and amenities that are not available in many other countries which call themselves tourist countries.  We may not have scenery which is nicer than anywhere in the world; we may not have roads that are better than the roads anywhere else in the world; but we have a combination of scenery and roads that is better than anything that can be found in any other part of the world.</P>
    <P>For that reason, I think we have here an attraction for motor tourists in particular greater than in any other country that I am aware of or have read about.  The big difficulty is, of course, the provision of adequate and suitable hotel accommodation.  Despite the inducements offered in the previous measures, unfortunately, the hotel owners have not been availing of these facilities to the extent required.</P>
    <P>Senator Ó Maoláin pointed out one of the immediate difficulties, that is, the propensity of the local authority to increase their income by way of rates from the owners of premises which are improved.  I have often wondered whether our local rating system is the proper one, whether we should not have a new system of local taxation altogether because I believe it bears unfairly on too few people. The property owner has to bear the brunt of local taxation, whereas a wealthy man who owns no property in a particular area can get away without paying any local taxation or paying relatively little local taxation.  There are many people who are wealthy <Col N="729" /> people in a local community and who pay taxation only to the central Exchequer.  However, I do not know whether the day will come when we can so revise our local taxation system as to ensure that the burden will be borne more evenly throughout the community.</P>
    <P>Since we have got this system of rating, the system of valuation through which we provide our local taxation, I think it must be accepted that the rates must be based on the value generally of property, but, nevertheless, there are means whereby hoteliers can escape the full brunt of the local taxation by way of the remissions provided. I said, in opening, that if improvements are carried out there is for a period of seven years a remissions of two-thirds of the increased rate attributable to these improvements.  As well as that, account is also taken of the fact that there may not be full occupancy of increased bedroom accommodation, so that it is not quite true to say that rates are slapped on&mdash; as has been said here&mdash;the minute somebody adds to his premises, particularly to hotel premises.  Nevertheless, I have great sympathy with them, but, on the other hand, we have the systems of relief that has been introduced not only by way of relief of rates but the tax concession of 10 per cent. of the capital expenditure and the further two per cent. annual wear and tear allowance.</P>
    <P>In regard to the criticisms of hotels in particular&mdash;or possibly the criticism of An Bord Fáilte in so far as they have the means of requiring these hotels to attain a certain standard&mdash; Bord Fáilte cannot be on the doorstep of every hotelier.  It is a matter for the hotels themselves to appreciate that they have a goose and to take advantage of that goose in order to get the golden egg will, in the long run, affect their own business.  It is true for Senator O'Quigley to say that our food standards are not very good.  I will agree with him if he refers to the question of variety but not if he refers to the question of quality.  By and large, the quality of our food is as good as we get in any part of the world but unfortunately we have not got the capacity to get variety in the food.  We <Col N="730" /> need only refer to our own restaurant in the House.  There is not a Senator who could not reel off tomorrow's menu, whether it is for luncheon or for tea.</P>
    <P>Similarly in many hotels we can anticipate approximately 75 per cent. of what is to be provided: kidney soup, or brown windsor, roast mutton, roast lamb, cabbage, peas, carrots, potatoes, mashed or roasted, and a few sweets, trifle and so on, with which we are all too familiar.  That perhaps is not the fault of the hoteliers themselves but rather the fault of the training facilities we have been providing down through the years.  I am glad to say that Bord Fáilte have taken up that matter very actively and, I hope, ultimately, very effectively. There are a number of training schools for hotel staffs throughout the country which are operated by Bord Fáilte in conjunction with the vocational committees. There is one in Cobh and one in Bundoran and there is one elsewhere. There is a particular one in Athenry in which young chefs are trained and which was opened only last Winter.  I believe that with such training, we shall be able eventually to provide a variety of dishes for our visitors that will enhance the tourist trade and add considerable to the income of the hoteliers throughout the country.</P>
    <P>There is one matter in that respect which I should like to raise and it is a personal point.  In many parts of the continent, they have special dishes.  It may be goulash or sauerkraut, which I think is peculiar to the Alsatian countries. There are in our own country dishes which we could popularise in a similar manner.  I will come nearer home and refer to drisheen which is a dish popular in Cork.  Unfortunately, very few people outside Cork eat drisheens&mdash;perhaps because it is prepared in a simple and not generally attractive form.  I feel that there is room, especially in Cork, for cashing in, so to speak, on the individuality of drisheens by presenting that dish in such a manner as to make it attractive to visitors not only from abroad but from our own country.  Perhaps there may be other dishes peculiar to other parts of the country which might, with <Col N="731" /> a little imagination and care, be presented in such an attractive fashion as will, first of all, create a reputation for that dish and consequently a reputation for that particular area.</P>
    <P>Senator Louis Walsh made a point about Grade B and Grade C hotels and appeared to suggest that if a person improved his hotel and qualified for Grade A rating, he would automatically have to increase his prices.  I do not think that is correct.  Perhaps I misunderstood the Senator.  All that Bord Fáilte requires is that the hotel &mdash;no matter what its grade&mdash;should publish its prices in advance so that its customers will know what they are being charged for rooms and for a meal for the short or long term they propose to stay.  Certainly a man with a Grade A hotel can charge as low as he likes as long as he publishes in advance the cost of his room and food.</P>
    <P>It is true, of course, that the bulk of our visitors from abroad come from the Midlands of Great Britain and it would be wrong for us to ignore that fact or to ignore the possibilities that are available to us in catering for that kind of trade.  The defects of the cross-channel services have been the subject matter of inter-Governmental negotiations and certainly Bord Fáilte have on many occasions made representations to British Railways for improvements in these services.  I should like to point out, however, that many defects of that nature are not peculiar to this country, or to the services being provided for tourists coming to this country.  I am sure many Senators have had experience of British Railways as they operate in Britain.</P>
    <P>On my way back from a Council of Europe meeting last year, I ran into fog and had to come overland from Parish and across the English Channel by ship.  The services provided for us certainly were anything but First class.  When we arrived at the station at Folkestone we found there was one dining-car capable of seating 20 people and there were 260 people on the train.  Even though the boat arrived in at 6 o'clock in the morning, there were no facilities for seating people and the first 16 or 20 <Col N="732" /> people into the dining-car were the only people who got breakfast between there and London, unless they had flasks with them and very few had.  These are matters which would scarcely be tolerated in this country and if they were experienced somebody would kick up a tremendous row.  The British seem to accept them without any great show of resentment. I mention this experience only to indicate that if there are shortcomings here, they are by no means peculiar to our own country.</P>
    <P>As I have said, in so far as there were criticisms made, many of them were directed against Bord Fáilte.  I was one of the critics of Bord Fáilte before I ever realised I might have some responsibility for them.  Now because I have responsibility, I am not going to try to defend them until such time as I may find that these criticisms are not justified.  I have not had the opportunity of going in to the matter fully yet and, as a matter of fact, I was to meet members of the Board today but I had to postpone the meeting as I had to come to the Seanad.</P>
    <P>I am not satisfied that we are getting either an adequate return from the money we put at the disposal of Bord Fáilte or for the effort they are putting into it.  I am not suggesting that that shortcoming, if it is a shortcoming, is due to Bord Fáilte itself. Bord Fáilte cannot be expected to lead people by the ear and show them what should be done or how it should be done.  As many Senators know and have pointed out, there is a responsibility on local communities to do something for themselves&mdash;and on individuals, for that matter.  An Bord Fáilte have the facilities for helping them on their way.</P>
    <P>So far as the specific complaint made by a Senator Ó Maoláin is concerned, I, too, have had similar experience of a hotelier who appeared to have everything in his favour and who was more than reasonably solvent, who had well prepared plans for extension and he was almost literally played out by An Bord Fáilte in the matter of securing his grant.  These are matters I propose <Col N="733" /> to investigate for myself, now that I have the opportunity of doing so.</P>
    <P>Senator Ó Donnabháin took us on a conducted tour from the front at Clontarf down through the country and back again to O'Connell Bridge. As far as the specific question he put to me is concerned, as to who financed the improvements at Howth and Clontarf and Dún Laoghaire, the truth is, of course, that the local authority, as they should do, carried out the major portion of it but An Bord Fáilte assisted them by way of grant.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to get into the row between two Cork men resident in Dublin about the merits of the thing on O'Connell Bridge.  I have my own views on that, but not being a member of Dublin Corporation, I have no responsibility for it and no means of doing anything about it.</P>
    <P>Senator Louis Walsh made another point about the fact that, in order to qualify for a grant under this hotel bedroom extension scheme, there had to be a minimum of five bedrooms. Unless we have some minimum, it would be very difficult to know what is and what is not a hotel.  It is not the intention, I may as well say candidly, to assist in the extension of ordinary private accommodation of people who may want to let their houses or let rooms in their houses to tourists in the Summer time.  The intention is, not only to extend but to improve accommodation and to ensure that such accommodation is of a certain standard.  If people want to go in for the constant letting of their premises or rooms in their premises to tourists, they will have to set about getting proper registration from An Bord Fáilte; otherwise An Bord Fáilte will not be interested in assisting in improving their premises.  They have other means available to them to do that.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinlan's suggestion about a House committee is one which I approach with mixed feelings.  In the first place, tourism was examined in great detail by the first inter-Party Government.  I think it was through <Col N="734" /> a special commission or special expert consultants, who presented a report called the Christenberry Report.  At the same time, a delegation of Irish hotel-owners went to the United States and studied tourism from most angles and particularly from the hotel accommodation angle.  These, too, presented a report about the same time.  These reports were examined by the Government&mdash;I think, by two successive Governments&mdash;and a special Cabinet sub-committee was set up to report and make recommendations to the Government.  After prolonged examination and discussion, the 1952 Tourist Act emerged and that is the basis on which our tourist policy stands.</P>
    <P>To that extent, it is a combination of not only the combined thinking of two Governments but of outside experts, as well as our own hotel experts at home.  As well as that, as the House knows, there is the Irish Tourist Association&mdash;which is composed largely of members of local authorities &mdash;who receive their income from the local authorities and who have representation on An Bord Fáilte as well. I believe that a joint House committee might to a certain extent tend to overlap what is already being done and there might be certain duplication of effort.</P>
    <P>I should like to assure the Senator, however, that as far as I am aware, An Bord Fáilte examine very closely the debates touching on tourism in both Houses and any worthwhile suggestions contained in these debates are always examined home and, where desirable, are adopted.  As well as that, there is no Deputy or Senator who, if he feels he has a worthwhile suggestion to make, need have any reluctance about approaching Bord Fáilte or any one of the officers or members of the Board.</P>

The Minister indicated that he would like, as far as possible, to have local contributions. Would it be possible to have local contributions by way of payment on cars entering those major resorts?  It always struck me that the travelling motorists gained the benefits of the resorts, while paying little or no contribution. A slight fee, of 2/- or 2/6, on each car would build up a fund and help the contributions from the Board.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. J. Lynch)</NameTxt>
      <P>Senators are already aware&mdash;apart altogether from the debate on the Industrial Grants Bill&mdash; that the principle of providing financial assistance from State funds to facilitate the establishment of industries in parts of the country which suffer from competitive disadvantages such as remoteness from the main centres of consumption and from supplies of industrial raw materials has been accepted in the Undeveloped Areas Acts and now in the Industrial Grants Bill.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to deal with a special case of this sort by providing for the establishment of a limited company to revive the project for the production of grass meal from grass grown on reclaimed bogland in the Bangor Erris area, Co. Mayo.  I do not know how many Senators are familiar with that area but those who are, will know it as a vast area in which development of any sort is practically impossible because of the peculiar type of bogland in the area. When I first saw it, it reminded me of a prairie of bog.  Scattered through it are a number of houses in which people are living and it was a matter of amazement to me that they were able to eke out a living in any way from these lands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="737" /> The setting up of the original Grass Meal Company was designed to provide relief for these people in some way, not only for the purpose of providing immediate employment but as a long-term policy of bringing these lands into a condition that would enable them to be cultivated, thus providing a living for a greater number of people in the area.  The basis of the project was that after an initial development period of five years grass meal would be produced competitively from grass grown on reclaimed bogland without a continuing subsidy.  There was such an extent of bogland there that the ultimate intention was to move to another area in the immediate vicinity having reclaimed the first area and put it into a state of productivity.</P>
    <P>The present Bill provides for the amendment of the Grass Meal (Production) Act, 1953.  This Act provided for the establishment of a limited company&mdash;Min Fhéir Teoranta&mdash;to undertake the drainage and cultivation of bogland in the Bangor Erris area, the processing of grass and other plants for sale including, in particular, the manufacture of grass meal, and the carrying on of kindred and incidental activities.  It provided that the nominal share capital of the company would be £100,000 to be subscribed by the Minister for Finance, and it also provided for grants not exceeding in the aggregate £165,000 out of moneys to be provided by the Oireachtas to be applied in defraying capital expenses.</P>
    <P>Min Fhéir Teo. was incorporated in March, 1954 and commenced operations in the Spring of 1954 on the ploughing and sod fencing of lands at Glenamoy, leased from Bord na Móna. I should have mentioned that Bord na Móna had already acquired most of this land in the area and they found that some of the bogland they had acquired was not suitable for their particular purposes.  It was blanket bog as opposed to the deep, wide bogs that they required for turf production. Blanket bog is comparatively shallow and of limited extent and, for that reason, Bord na Móna found it unsuitable and therefore they were able to lease it to this company at a comparatively low rent.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="738" /> On the change of Government in 1954 an inter-Departmental Committee was set up.  They examined the economies and finances of this company. There is a reference in the report of a subsequent committee&mdash;to which I shall refer later&mdash;to the terms of reference of the inter-Departmental Committee. The committee said that there was no evidence to suggest that Min Fhéir Teo. would or should exist except on the basis that the mainspring of its activities would be the commercial production of grass meal.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 13, at page 10 of the report of the Committee on the Glenamoy Grass Meal Project further states:</P>
    <P>For this reason, the committee&mdash;&mdash; that is the inter-Departmental Committee of 1954&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>felt that their function was, not so much to assess the desirability of the social objectives of a regional character hoped to be achieved by the grass meal project, but rather to review the economic and financial effects likely to flow from an attempt to attain these objectives by continuance of the Company's activities.</P>
    <P>Therefore it will be seen that the committee set up by the previous Government approached their examination not so much on a social basis but purely from a financial and economic background.</P>
    <P>This committee reported at the end of 1954 or early in 1955 and following the receipt of the report, which recommended that the grass meal project should be discontinued, the then Government decided that the plans for the erection of a grass meal factory should be abandoned and that portion of the lands occupied by the Company should be used by the Department of Agriculture for experiments on the reclamation of blanket bog, and that the balance of the lands should be used by the Department of Lands for afforestation purposes.  In accordance with these decisions the affairs of the Company were wound up early in 1956.</P>
    <P>I might say at this stage that the original Grass Meal Company had already reclaimed a considerable portion <Col N="739" /> of the bogland at Glenamoy and at a cost much lower than they had originally anticipated.  The ultimate user of that portion of the bog had the advantage of the original drainage and reclamation.  That user was known as the Peatlands Research Station which, as I have said, was undertaken by the Department of Agriculture and the Forestry Division of the Department of Lands.  These activities are still going on and there is no intention of interrupting them.</P>
    <P>A committee was appointed by my predecessor in August, 1957, to examine the practicability of reviving the project.  Their report, which was unanimous, was published in November, 1958, and that is the report from which I have quoted.  The committee considered that grass meal can be produced competitively in relation to current market prices from grass grown on reclaimed bogland after a period of five years from the commencement of reclamation.  They also considered that, taking account of the potential home and export trade, a market over and above that catered for, or likely to be catered for, by existing grass meal producers, should be capable of development to provide an outlet for the output of a plant at Glenamoy. They recommended that the project should be revived, that an independent statutory company should be established to operate the project and that the Company should be provided with a sum not exceeding £165,000 by way of non-repayable grant to defray capital expenses and a further sum of £30,000 in the form of share capital for working capital.</P>
    <P>The present Bill provides for the establishment of a limited company, Min Fhéir (1959) Teoranta, to which, with certain amendments, the provisions of the Grass Meal (Production) Act, 1953, shall apply.  The principal amendment proposed in the provisions of the 1953 Act is that the share capital of the Company shall be £200,000 instead of £100,000, the provision for the making of grants up to £165,000 to the Company being at the same time dropped.  This is the normal method of financing a company undertaking <Col N="740" /> activities of an industrial or commercial character and has been adopted on the advice of the Minister for Finance who will subscribe the share capital.</P>
    <P>I need not emphasise the very great need, on social and economic grounds, for providing suitable employment opportunities in areas such as that in which the project will operate, or the competitive disadvantages which make industrial development in such areas a matter of peculiar difficulty.  As indicated by me when the Bill was before the Dáil, the motivating factor in the setting up of the Grass Meal Project is the social problem of relieving to some extent the uneconomic conditions of North Mayo.  By means of initial expenditure on reclamation, bogs can be brought into cultivation and made to contribute permanently to the economic wellbeing of the area and of the country as a whole.  I do not claim that this measure will provide a cure for the entire social and economic ills of the area.  The project will, however, afford employment for a certain number of workers there and will result in the economic utilisation of areas of bogland that might otherwise have remained unproductive for many years.  I recommend the Bill to the House, and I hope it will meet with the approval of Senators.</P>

      <P>This Bill is largely a technical Bill and, if the committee established in August 1957 is correct in its assessment of the future of the company which it is proposed to establish under this Bill, everybody should support the Bill.  If the committee is not correct in its assessment, then this is a Bill that should not be supported.  The matter is of such a technical character that it is very difficult for ordinary lay people to make up their minds as to what should be done.  My inclination would be in the direction of supporting this Bill but it seems to me, on reading the Dáil Report, that the prospects for the success of this company are not very great.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>No, but I have read <Col N="741" /> the correctives to that report.  The Minister has not given any indication as to whether or not there are other companies engaged in the production of grass meal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>I certainly did not hear that it was emphasised but I gather that there are five or six other companies engaged in that business in this country and that they are able to fulfil the requirements of the Irish market.  I also gather that in Britain some companies that engaged in the production of grass meal have closed down and there is a possibility that, on the introduction of this Bill, if this company is to succeed, some other company engaged in the production of this commodity will close down in some other part of the country.  If that is to be the result, it does not seem to me to be good economics.</P>
      <P>However, as I say, my inclination is to support a measure of this kind and I would do so readily if I were at all satisfied that the prospects before this company were as bright as the Minister appears to think they are because I know the area which the Minister speaks about very well and it is, as he picturesquely described it, a prairie of bogland and the surprising thing is that so many people have existed in that area for so long.  That is my attitude towards the Bill in general.</P>
      <P>The Minister said towards the end of his speech that when this company gets under way it will employ a certain number of people.  I should imagine that the Minister could be a little more specific as to the number of people likely to be employed initially and eventually.  I notice that, in relation to the much more difficult proposition that we shall probably be dealing with later to-night, the provision of a transatlantic air service, Aer Rianta was able to forecast the likely outcome of its trading in the first, second and third years.  Perhaps the Minister might be able to give the House the benefit of the assessment of the committee established in August, 1957, as to the prospects of this company in the first, second and third years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="742" /> There is only one other matter that calls for comment.  It really has nothing to do with this Bill but it is relevant in so far as the Minister has raised it in his speech on the Second Stage.  He said that the company established in 1953, which came into existence in 1954, acquired land from Bord na Móna who, apparently, had acquired large tracts of bog which proved unsuitable for their purposes. That is a most interesting statement.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Do not misunderstand me.  They had to take certain areas and were able to discard some of the land as being unsuitable.  As the Senator knows, they could not carve it up as they liked.  They had to take certain areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOQuigley" hpid="Mr. O'Quigley Mr. O'Quigley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>That might be so but the way the Minister put it suggested to me that Bord na Móna, one of the State-sponsored bodies about which we hear so much, had acquired large tracts of bogland in North Mayo which were unsuitable for their purposes and that meant to me that public money had been expended for a purpose which could not be realised. The Minister qualifies that by saying they had to take the good with the bad, the rough with the smooth.  The reason the point appealed to me so much was that I had known a case where Bord na Móna acquired bogland from a man and paid him his money and he had no title to it, good, bad or indifferent.  I was wondering was this another of the operations of the State-sponsored bodies over which Parliament can exercise no control.</P>

      <P>This project has a history of some years and it is one of the admirable projects, such as the transatlantic air line and the chassis factory, which were unfortunately abandoned by the Coalition Governments. <Col N="743" /> The project also suffered from a certain difference of opinion between the Department of Agriculture and the Sugar Company.  The Department of Agriculture seemed to be against the project whereas the Sugar Company gave evidence at the original committee which indicated that the project had good prospects of success.</P>
      <P>One gathers from the facts contained in the report that the reasons offered against the project by the Department of Agriculture were largely theoretical whereas the reasons offered in its favour by the Sugar Company were largely practical reasons based on the experience which the Sugar Company had gained from work of the same type.  When it comes to evidence offered by two witnesses of this kind, unlike some of the Senators on the other side of the House, I am inclined to accept the evidence of the person who has practical experience rather than that of the person who is offering purely theoretical evidence.  The committee which reported in 1958 made a very comprehensive review of this project&mdash;a very much more comprehensive review, I think it is fair to say, than that made by the inter-Departmental Committee in 1954.</P>

      <P>From the people from whom evidence was taken by the 1958 committee, which mentioned that far less evidence was taken by the earlier committee, I think it is fair to say that the 1958 committee gave a much more comprehensive review of the project. Having considered the matter fully, this committee came down firmly with the recommendation that grass meal could be produced competitively from grass grown on reclaimed bog and that this could be done without a subsidy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The vast majority of Senators, I would say, have no personal knowledge of this very technical subject.  We have got to rely very largely on the report of this committee.  This committee has made a very definite recommendation that grass meal can be produced competitively.  Unless <Col N="744" /> somebody can produce very definite evidence and technical details to show that the committee is wrong, I certainly would be inclined to accept its recommendations rather than accept comments by members of the Dáil who had no particular qualifications to comment on this very technical subject.</P>
    <P>The committee has come down with a recommendation that grass meal can be produced competitively.  Having examined the position very carefully, they say that the home and export markets can absorb what the project is likely to produce.  They say that at the moment the market can absorb it and that the market is, in fact, expanding. It is clear from this report that the project will, in fact, show a profit.</P>
    <P>Purely from the commercial point of view, this project will show a profit and can be a success.  But we would be wrong to consider it purely from the commercial point of view.  Apart from the social advantages of the initiation of this grass meal factory, it is very heartening to be assured it will also show a profit commercially.</P>
    <P>It is, of course, of great importance that this factory will provide employment in an area where it is extremely difficult to find employment and where any employment provided, and particularly employment in a company of this size, will be peculiarly welcome and very important to a very large surrounding area.  It will, for instance, obviate the necessity of providing land in the midlands for the small-holders in this area, which is a congested area. As Senators are well aware, the problem of finding land in the midlands and eastern counties for people in the congested districts is becoming increasingly difficult.  Consequently, any project of this kind, which will obviate the necessity even in a few dozen cases of providing alternative holdings, is a very important and welcome one.  I presume that, ultimately, the land developed for the production of grass meal will be divided up and handed over to the farmers, thus relieving congestion in that area.</P>
    <P>This industry is one which has the merit of having its raw materials provided here at home.  Many industries set up here from time to time have <Col N="745" /> been criticised because they are said to be artificial in the sense that all their raw materials have to be imported and that it is unlikely to be economic to import all the raw materials and then try and export the produce.  Consequently, any industry based on native raw materials is likely to be a good one.  In that respect this industry certainly starts off on the right foot. From that point of view, therefore, and from the other point of view I mentioned, this project should be welcomed. It is something which, not only from the social point of view but from the financial point of view, is likely to be a success, and I certainly think the House should welcome it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGuire</NameTxt>
      <P>Senators often use the phrase that they did not intend to intervene in a debate but that what somebody said reminded them of something.  That applies to me on this occasion.  I had not read this Bill very carefully.  We have been having a number of Bills lately, and I confined myself to those about which I thought I knew something.  When I saw &ldquo;grassmeal&rdquo; I did not think it had very much to do with me but Senator O'Quigley has remarked that this is another State body which is being set up.</P>
      <P>I happen to know the owners and directors of some other existing companies in this line of business.  I was shown over one of these factories and it seemed to me to be a very well-run business.  I should like to ask the Minister is there a sufficient market? I am in favour of competition, but I think it should be fair competition and not competition by the State.  In this whole question of State bodies competing with private enterprise we are being told all the time that the State will operate only where private enterprise has failed or is unable to fulfil the function required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I happen to have in my bag, sent to me this morning, a catalogue sent out by the Great Southern Hotels.  This is a linen catalogue showing all the goods I sell.  Surely nobody can say that the drapery distributing trade is not fully provided for?  Here we are setting up a new body and I should <Col N="746" /> like to ask the Minister: will it compete with people already in the grassmeal business?  To come back to this catalogue, it is headed: &ldquo;It is so easy to shop in Ireland.&rdquo;  This was sent by a gentleman to my son with the following note:</P>
    <P>I have just returned from a visit to London.  While in the Irish Tourist Office I noticed this brochure enclosed herewith.  I thought you would be interested in seeing it.  In case you had not already done so, I took one back to show you.</P>
    <P>This is the tourist office run with Government money, provided by Bord Fáilte, I take it?</P>
    <P>The catalogue, which is excellently turned out, says: &ldquo;The shop in this hotel is open each day from 8 a.m. to 11.30 p.m.&rdquo;  In private enterprise you are not allowed to keep your shop open until 11.30 p.m.  The unions have a very quick answer for you.  We were made to close our business at 5.30 p.m. during the war.  Now we are trying to get the union to agree to longer shopping hours in Dublin, as they should, to enable us meet the situation to-day.  C.I.E. can keep the place open from 8 a.m. to 11.30 p.m.  I hope the same principle will not operate in relation to this Bill.</P>
    <P>When I was in Galway recently at a meeting, and similarly in Killarney, I was approached by the chairman of the Chamber of Commerce on this very subject.  I was told in Killarney that they had people coming into Killarney when the shops were closing on Saturday night and leaving on Sunday morning, and these people shopped in the C.I.E. hotel shops.  That sort of thing is happening all over the place.  Yesterday I overheard two customers. One said to the other: &ldquo;No, we will not buy it here.  We will buy it in Shannon.  It is cheaper.&rdquo;  Incidentally it is not cheaper to buy in Shannon.  It is 15 per cent. dearer.</P>
    <P>It has often been said that the State will operate only where private enterprise fails.  Will that principle be adhered to now?  It is one thing for State bodies to provide a service which private enterprise cannot provide, but <Col N="747" /> if this principle is to be projected now into a market, which is already very limited as far as private enterprise is concerned, I am afraid we shall end up with a completely socialistic State, and in a very short time.  That will not be the fault of private enterprise.  Private enterprise is asked to pay the piper when State companies do not succeed; when they do succeed, they take money out of the pocket of private enterprise.</P>

In other words, the project will not interfere with existing grass meal producers.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Seán Ó Donnabháin</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope so also. I anticipate that is the intention.  I do not believe private enterprise would face into Bangor Erris.  From what the Minister has said, I understand five years will elapse before this blanket bog will produce sufficient grass for conversion into grassmeal.  A great deal of employment will be provided in the preparation and reclamation of this bog.  I understand when the project is brought to fruition there, a similar project will be started in another area. That will give us systematic reclamation of blanket bog.  I know how difficult it is to produce crops on bog of this nature.  The late Senator Baxter spoke very favourably, indeed, about the work done by Comhlúcht Siuicre Éireann at Gowla.  I understand that is a deep bog and would, from that point of view, present difficulty in relation to drainage and preparation for the ultimate production of crops.</P>
      <P>I understand from what the Minister has said that, contemporaneously with the preparation of the bog for the production of grassmeal, work will also be put in hands from the point of view of agriculture and forestry.  I think that is an excellent idea.  I have had experience of the difficulty of growing trees on bog consisting of humus and with very little of nutritive value.  I think trees are about the most difficult thing one can try to grow on bog.  I have spoken here before about planting cut-away bogs.  In the cut-away bog there is something more than merely the peat humus and so there would be a greater prospect of success from an afforestation point of view. However, I think the three should be combined&mdash;grass meal, agriculture and forestry.  The forestry work will provide a shelter belt for the other operations.</P>
      <P>I do not think anybody should object to this project.  Nobody can claim that this industry should be established elsewhere.  I commend the Bill to the House.  I hope it will show profitable results for the people in Bangor Erris and ultimately for the nation as a whole.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>In this Bill, there is something far more important at stake than whether or not this venture at Bangor Erris will be a commercial <Col N="749" /> success.  To my way of thinking what is happening here undermines our whole system of getting expert advice and acting upon that advice.  Most Government decisions are based on the advice tendered by Departmental officials; when further advice is called for, and inter-Departmental committee is established and the report of that committee is highly regarded by Governments in all countries.  The report represents the consensus of opinion of Government servants.</P>
      <P>We have here a report of such a committee which, in 1954, recommended against this project.  One has there the amazing situation in which the costings of the company, Min Fhéir Teoranta, are entirely different from the costings of the Department of Agriculture.  Obviously Min Fhéir Teoranta wanted to stay in business. They give a costing&mdash;I quote from the report&mdash;of £17 per acre and the Department of Agriculture give a costing of £28 odd per acre.  In other words, where are we going with expert advice if we have those two different estimates, one given by the Department of Agriculture which is now openly derided?  It is actually condemned by the Minister concerned.</P>
      <P>To my mind that seems to undermine our whole confidence in the impartiality and efficiency of our civil service.  There is a paragraph here that actually shocked me.  I quote from Volume 176, column 1258, of the Official Report of the Dáil Debate where the Minister, Mr. J. Lynch, says:</P>
      <P>Again I want to repeat that I do not know who these civil servants were.  They were set up by Deputy Sweetman and Deputy Dillon and they were very well aware of the attitude of Deputy Sweetman and Deputy Dillon to this whole project.  It is hard to blame them if they had a certain bias, by reason of the fact that these were two very important Ministers, towards their examination &mdash;perhaps an unconscious bias to the project that they had before them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To my mind that is a very serious accusation, that these inter-Departmental <Col N="750" /> committees, if a Minister knows how to set them up properly, can get the answer he wants.</P>
    <P>Then we have this other committee set up in 1957.  We have the report of that committee here before us and it apparently ridicules the previous one.  In other words, the passage of this Bill is in effect a condemnation of the reliability of the Department of Agriculture.  I have criticised the Department heavily many times myself but I wonder is that really what members of the Seanad want?  That is what you are doing, and that is what you are opening the workings of Departments to in the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>We got one foolish costing of 2½d. a gallon for the production of milk.  In the circumstances, there is a way of finding out these things and that way has increased considerably since 1954.  It has increased because there is now an experimental station in Glenamoy which is doing very good work, and which is available for giving costings for what it would cost per acre to do this.  If that station is not capable of providing such simple costings, reliably attested, it should not be in the research business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Personally I do not know the names of the members of the inter-Departmental Committee but, from what I can gather, there could have been very few members of the Department of Agriculture on it, seeing they were cited as the body that gave evidence. Certainly it was inter-Departmental and I am quite prepared to state, without knowing their names, that these men were at least as good as those who signed the present report.  I am not casting aspersions on the men who <Col N="751" /> signed the present report when I make that statement because I am only paying tribute to the top civil servants, the men who would naturally be selected to take part in the inter-Departmental Committee.  I do not know if this is the first time that a Government, in endeavouring to excuse a change of mind, has tried to place the blame on its own civil servants. Apparently the whole kingpin of the costings hinges on the estimates given by the Irish Sugar Company for its work at Gowla.</P>
    <P>I would make one practical suggestion now.  This Bill is going through so why not hand over the whole lot, lock, stock and barrel, to the Irish Sugar Company, and even make them a present of this £200,000 of the taxpayers' money?  Appoint their board <i>en bloc</i> as the board of this new company and let us see what success they can make of producing grass meal.  I make that suggestion and I think the Irish Sugar Company, being prepared to stand behind their figures, should welcome the opportunity of that challenge.</P>
    <P>The other point is this appeal that we must do something for the Glenamoy region.  I heartily agree with that but, if we have £200,000 to spend, the place to spend it is on the existing installation there.  I am aware of the excellent work done there under the direction of Dr. Walsh, now head of the Agricultural Institute.  I know the force and the dynamism he has put into that, and the feeling he has for the people in the West and if he were given £200,000 he would confer far more lasting benefit on the West than ever this grass meal factory would confer. This is the problem about which Senator Ó Donnabháin seemed to be rather confused&mdash;wanting systematic reclamation of the bog land and wanting it linked with other activities.  He pictured farms being made available. Surely that type of work, if that is what is desirable, is far more appropriate to the present work carried out by the Department of Agriculture in Glenamoy? I think this work is more appropriate to the Agricultural Institute than to this body that, by its terms <Col N="752" /> of reference, will be set up to do one job&mdash;the making of grass meal&mdash;and will be prevented from having the flexibility of changing by the fact that it will have a big investment in the plant necessary for the production of grass meal.</P>
    <P>Again, if you want to spend the money in this region, if you spend it on grass meal how much will go out of the region in the cost of plant?  If you spend on research even one shilling of it there, it will remain in that region, and there will be no extra cost for work done elsewhere.  You have the whole Agricultural Institute able and willing to make a complete success of that.</P>
    <P>Finally, I am treating this Bill solely on the principles involved.  We are faced with two conflicting reports and the way to resolve that is to ask the Agricultural Institute to conduct a costings investigation.  There is also the fact that grave doubt has been cast, due to the fact that grass meal factories have closed down in England recently. I appeal to the Minister to consider giving this money for relief in that region, for the development of that region, to the body doing research in Glenamoy.  Alternatively, if he does not do that, hand it over to the Irish Sugar Company and give them this £200,000 from the taxpayer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCole" hpid="Mr. Cole Mr. Cole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cole</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill, for the fact that it may result in a company that will give us a profit, or a return, but I would welcome it more if the words in the title of the Bill &ldquo;in the Bangor Erris area&rdquo; were omitted.  It would then be an Act to authorise the Minister for Industry and Commerce to promote a company for the acquisition, drainage and cultivation of boglands.  I look on this project, to a certain extent, in that light, that it is an experiment, and that out of this experiment great things may come.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am particularly inclined to take that view when I read in page 15 of the Report on the Glenamoy Grass Meal Project that a Mr. Gamble, a former inspector of the Land Commission, gave evidence of previous small experiments in this way.  He said that very good crops had been <Col N="753" /> obtained on the cultivated areas and that he felt that the schemes would have had every chance of success if each allottee had been provided with 15 or 20 acres of reclaimed land, whereas in actual fact they had only a few acres for each allottee.</P>
    <P>On page 42, we read that the Director of the Norwegian Bog Association in a paper entitled &ldquo;<i>Economic and Social Importance of Bogs in Norway</i>&rdquo; said:</P>
    <P>...over 300,000 acres of bog representing about 14% of the total area of land under cultivation in the country have been brought into use in Norway for agricultural purposes.</P>
    <P>That is the long term view of what this might mean and that is why I would support and welcome the Bill. As regards its effect in this country, I take it that the first effect will be to a certain extent its employment value. I think I saw somewhere in the Report that at least 140 or 150 men were mentioned as a possibility for full all-year-round employment, but, first of all, it was probably introduced there as an employment venture and secondly, with the possibility that it would pay its way, apart from the necessary initial capital.</P>
    <P>The third possibility is the possibility of gaining knowledge and bringing the knowledge gained to reclaiming vast areas of bog elsewhere. Travelling around the country, I see small farms on the edges of bogs and small plots of land of one or two acres which the farmers themselves have obviously, through manuring and cultivation, reclaimed from the bog.  I have often wondered how much more we might do in that respect on the edges of bog by reclaiming, perhaps, small amounts.  As Mr. Gamble said, if 30 acres were added to the holding on the edge of the bog, it would make it a commercial proposition for that man who could perhaps subsequently reclaim more on his own part.  It is in that respect that I would support this Bill.</P>
    <P>There is also the aspect Senator McGuire mentioned, that this will be, to a certain extent, in opposition to the <Col N="754" /> private companies and, of course, all these State-financed companies or State-assisted companies naturally have an advantage, although, as we know, some of them are not able to compete with private companies, even though they have the initial advantage. In that respect, I welcome the last paragraph of the Report.  I think it should be borne in mind, particularly by the Minister, that where these companies are in competition with existing producers, they should go so far as to say that the new company will not sell their product at a lesser price than the existing producers can get.  In the first instance, they should try to export it and not compete, but then, in all fairness to the existing producers, they should say: &ldquo;We will not sell our meal cheaper than you will.&rdquo;  That would be only fair to the existing producers on the part of the companies who have State finances at their back.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>I read the report. I was reared beside the bogland and I know it would rob you to try to do anything with it, because you can apply artificial manure, lime it, drain it, sow crop on it, let it out, and in a few years, it has gone back into rushes again.  I happen to know perhaps a little too much about bogland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we have money to spend, it would be better if we gave back some of the subsidy that has been taken from lime, if we reintroduced Section B of the <Col N="757" /> Land Project, if we gave money to be spent again by the county councils under the Local Authorities (Works) Act.  That was work that was reasonably well done.  It gave employment. We helped to reclaim and drain, in many cases, valuable land.</P>
    <P>Senator Ryan said that this is an admirable project which was unfortunately abandoned by the inter-Party Government.  The inter-Party Government abandoned it on the recommendation of an inter-Departmental Committee. I cannot agree with him that this is an admirable project.  It is a daft project.  It should be abandoned immediately, before the taxpayers' money is bogged down in it, never to be retrieved.  That will definitely happen in this case.</P>
    <P>We all know that grass meal is the raw material for the agricultural industry. It supplies the protein in the making of balanced rations.  We know that protein is available at present at half the cost at which it is derived from grass meal.  I am quite sure the Minister is aware of that.  If we wanted to establish a grass meal factory or if the State wanted to go into competition with private enterprise and make a success of it, I think their grass meal factory should be established in the fertile Midlands&mdash;Meath, Kildare, Dublin, Limerick, Tipperary, Offaly or Westmeath&mdash;where good grass grows naturally.</P>
    <P>We have no proof that if you lime this land, drain it, put phosphates, minerals, and so on, on it, it will continue to grow good grass or first-class grass for making into grass meal. You may have to put tons of lime and phosphates on that land every year, with the result that it is bound to be an uneconomic proposition.  However, where you have fertile land and natural grass, it is bound to be an economic proposition.</P>
    <P>The inter-Party Government wound up this piece of codology&mdash;that is all it is&mdash;and established one of the best peat land research stations in Europe which is an asset to County Mayo and to the nation.  We are told that the demand for grass meal here at present is between 7,500 to 8,500 tons.  The <Col N="758" /> existing factories, under private enterprise, produce approximately 11,000 tons.  They have a market here for between 7,500 to 8,500 tons and they have a surplus of 2,500 to 3,000 tons. Therefore, 25 per cent. or more of what they are making has to be exported. They are lucky enough to have a market for it in the Six Counties.</P>
    <P>There is a glut of grass meal protein in Britain.  Grass meal plants and factories have had to close down there. Senator Ryan shakes his head but he will have to admit that that is correct. What are we to do here?  If we subsidise this project, will we close down some of the factories that are being run by private enterprise&mdash;people who have bought their own equipment and put their own money into it and who, without any financial assistance from this State, are making a good job of it and have made a good job of it up to the present?  Undoubtedly that is what we shall do.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, will we adopt the suggestion which appears at paragraph 56, page 34, of the Report of the Committee on the Glenamoy Grass Meal Project?  Professor Sheehy said &ldquo;it would be a reasonable to include grass meal in all these compounds and that it would be justified, though not necessary, on nutritive grounds to make this compulsory.&rdquo; We are going back to compulsion. Do we intend to make the farmer use something which he does not want to use?  Will we put further taxation on our farmers in order to bolster up a shaky project?  That is what Professor Sheehy is recommending there. I am not in favour of doing anything like that.</P>
    <P>Our farmers are finding it hard enough to increase production due to direct and indirect taxation which is helping to cripple them.  If we are to produce more and export more, we shall have to reduce taxation on our farmers and give them the raw material as cheaply as possible so that they can compete on the British and any other market.  It would be a daft policy to adopt what is mentioned in that report, that is, &ldquo;that it would be justified, though not necessary, on nutritive grounds to make this compulsory&rdquo;. <Col N="759" /> We should not stand for that for one moment.</P>
    <P>The Minister is making £200,000 available by way of share capital by taking up that amount of shares in the company.  They will not be called upon to pay a dividend or interest. Therefore, they will have a continuing subsidy of at least £10,000 to £12,000 per annum&mdash;that is, if you accept the normal bank rate.  Therefore, if they produce 1,000 tons, they will have a subsidy of from £10 to £12 per ton. If they produce 2,000 tons, they will have a subsidy of from £5 to £6 per ton.  Even with that, I doubt if they would be able to compete with private enterprise.</P>
    <P>We should ask ourselves: Will this project give extra employment?  We have been told by the Minister and Senator Ryan that it will, but, despite all the facts this Committee set out and all the information available to them, we have not been told how many people the project will provide with employment.  We have not been given any rough estimate.  I claim it will not mean any extra employment. You may employ extra people in North Mayo but you will put people already engaged in this business out of employment in Meath, Dublin, or some other county.  That will not benefit the State.</P>
    <P>The next question we must ask ourselves is: Will this project help to increase production?  I doubt if any article that has to be subsidised by the State and that will result in indirect taxation on our farmers will help to increase production.  Have we a market for the commodity?  I believe we have not a market for it at present.  The market is overdone. If we put another 2,000 or 3,000 tons on the market, we shall saturate it and it will be an utterly uneconomic proposition.</P>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil Party have a majority in this House.  If this goes to a vote to-night, they will not run out.  They will wait and vote on it and put it through.  I would agree entirely, if they intend to go ahead with it, with Senator Quinlan's suggestion <Col N="760" /> to hand it over to the Sugar Company and definitely show it is not being set up to give jobs to some of the Fianna Fáil boys in County Mayo.  That is all it is being set up for: we know that from past experience. If the Minister intends to go ahead with this project, the Sugar Company have people with experience and the technical &ldquo;know-how&rdquo;.  If anybody can make a success of it, they will.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruane</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill especially as I come from the area where this project is about to start.  It is a pity that some years ago the change of Government brought about a change for some reason or another in this area.  The first action of the inter-Party Government in 1947-48 was to stop the generating station there.  It was closed down for three or four years until there was a change of Government again in 1951.  When that Government of 1951 were elected, they started the machines in the Bangor Erris area and the next move by the Fianna Fáil Government was this grass meal project.  I was in Erris about two weeks ago and I am very sorry that some of the Senators here and members of the Dáil were not invited instead of the 40 or 50 officials who were there.  I am sure every Senator and member of the Dáil would benefit by the experience of seeing what has been happening there for some years past.  They would see a field of oats on the bog, a field of potatoes, a field of wheat, of barley, mangels, turnips and onions.  I was proud that I lived to see the day when that was possible in Erris.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reading the reports of the debates in the lower House, I was disappointed to note that so much venom was displayed against this scheme.  If we are to make any progress, it is not by poisonous or venomous speeches we shall make it.  As one who knows a great deal about the cereals on exhibition, I can say it would be much cheaper to proceed with that scheme, even if we cannot sell the grass meal at an economic price and even if the Government had to help in regard to it, than to take 150 migrants into the Midlands.  It would cost between <Col N="761" /> £3,500 and £4,000 to take a migrant from Erris up to the Midlands.  That is in the report which any Senator can read.  I appeal to the members of the Seanad to pass this Bill without a division.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. J. Lynch)</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall confine myself as far as possible to answering specific points that were made and if I can, or if necessary, defend the finding of the 1957 Committee as opposed to the inter-Departmental Committee.  In the first instance, there are, as Senator Quinlan says, five or six other companies but this Committee clearly state in paragraph 70 (a) (ii), under &ldquo;Conclusions&rdquo;:</P>
      <P>Taking account of the potential home and export trade, a market over and above that catered for or likely to be catered for by existing grass meal producers should be capable of development to provide an outlet for the output of a plant at Glenamoy.</P>
      <P>The members of the Committee that made this report are, I am sure, very well known to most members of the House.  Their capacity for examining such a proposal, I would say, is beyond question.  I for one would be very glad to rely on the recommendations given by such a body of men.</P>
      <P>I should like to say, in reference to Senator Quinlan's suggestion that I am blaming civil servants in order to justify a change of mind, that I have never had a change of mind about this project.  I introduced it initially in 1952 and I criticised the previous Government for abandoning it and the Report of this Committee justifies my criticism of that Government.  I did say in the Dáil that the approach of Deputy Dillon and Deputy Sweetman to the original Bill was so venomous and so hostile that it was difficult for the committee of civil servants who were set up to examine this Bill, not from the social aspect but from the purely financial and economic aspect, to come to any other conclusion than the one to which they did come.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I might say to Senator Quinlan in respect of his suggestion that we are casting aspersions on the judgement of the officials of the Department of <Col N="762" /> Agriculture, that in the course of their evidence before this later committee, the Department of Agriculture witnesses said on a number of occasions that the evidence they had given before the inter-Departmental Committee in 1954 was not now, in the light of events accurate, and I shall refer the Senator to at least two of these instances.  The Department of Agriculture witness said to the 1957 committee&mdash;by describing it thus, I shall distinguish it from the inter-Departmental Committee&mdash;that the period between the opening of the drains and the commencement of cultivation now proved to be shorter than had been suggested by them to the inter-Departmental Committee.  That was one instance in which the Department of Agriculture changed their evidence in the light of experience. Another instance was: The Department of Agriculture witnesses advised the inter-Departmental Committee that re-seeding was necessary every second year and that only two tons per acre of grass was possible.  The Department of Agriculture official, according to this report, doubted the advice that was then given and was satisfied that 2½ tons per acre &ldquo;would not be unrealistic&rdquo;. Those are the words used. As a matter of fact, as the Senator knows, Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann, for whom he obviously has some regard, are emphatic about the fact that 2½ tons per acre was not unrealistic. Therefore in two material instances the evidence available and given to the inter-Departmental Committee was contradicted by the same witnesses before this 1957 Committee.</P>
    <P>The Senator referred in particular to the cost of the drainage.  Min Fhéir, Teoranta, in 1953 drained a large portion of that bog and they had practical experience of the costing and the working of such drainage.  Therefore, we are able to rely not on the evidence of experts but on the evidence of their own working as to what the cost of drainage was.  What better evidence could there be for any examination, no matter what the purpose of it was than the actual cost of operating?</P>

      <P>The interest in so far as it referred to that part of the operation. I do not wish to refer any further to the difference between the 1957 Committee and the inter-Departmental Committee.  I did say during the course of the passage of the Bill in the Dáil that I did not know the identity of any member of the inter-Departmental Committee.  Since then, in fact only to-day, I met a senior civil servant, not from the Department of Industry and Commerce, who volunteered that he was a member of the inter-Departmental Committee.</P>
      <P>In regard to the evidence of Mr. Scanlon, the Company Chairman, as to the availability of an export market, it does appear from this Report, and it did appear in the Dáil debates subsequently, that there was a direct conflict of evidence.  I am satisfied from what was said to me to-day that the two parties were not quite <i>ad idem</i> as to what they were discussing at the time. In the event, the fact was that what the Chairman of the old Committee said to the inter-Departmental Committee about an export market was to some extent misinterpreted accidentally and that misinterpretation found its way into the report.  I do not want to refer any further to the conflict between the two Committees.</P>
      <P>With regard to the availability of a market, I am prepared to accept the report of this Committee which, as I have said, is composed of eminent men both in the fields of engineering, agriculture and accountancy, but I am also prepared to accept more concrete evidence that came into my possession since the Dáil debate.  I received a letter from a man who is associated with one of the existing companies producing grass meal in this country.  He assured me that there was an ample market in Northern Ireland and even in Britain for good quality grass meal.  To bear that out, he enclosed letters from a North of Ireland oatmeal and provender miller asking for deliveries of a quantity of grass meal.  That was only a small quantity.  It does not add much to the force of what I am saying now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He also produced a letter from a <Col N="764" /> firm operating on the Corn Exchange in Liverpool asking his company to supply 100 tons of grass meal a week for each week from the end of July, or as early as it is possible to provide grass meal, until the end of December. That would be well over 2,000 tons to one firm alone in Britain.  In other words, it would absorb the economic output of Glenamoy alone. So, there is concrete evidence to refute the suggestion that Deputies made in the Dáil that in seven years' time, nobody would be buying grass meal. The fact is that, according to the evidence I have from the inter-Departmental Committee and according to the factual information of a person in the trade, the market for grass meal in Ireland, the Six Counties and Britain is increasing as long as a good quality and reasonable prices prevail.</P>
    <P>Senators very rightly suggested that the establishment of this company should not prejudice the operations of individual companies.  As far as quantity is concerned, I think the report of the 1957 Committee will allay any fears they might have.  As far as price is concerned, it is reasonable to assume that to produce grass meal in a bog area will create an impediment against undercutting.  That is very real.  I would not think for a moment that such production, having regard to the original cost of development and drainage, could in any way injure the existing company as far as pricing is concerned.  In any case, the Irish Crop Dryers Association represented before the inter-Departmental Committee, did not as far as I could gather, make any such case.  I met them myself on a couple of occasions before the original Bill was passed and not only did they not say that they had any apprehension about it but they offered the utmost co-operation. The 1957 Committee in their report suggest that the new Board of Min-Fhéir Teoranta will give the same degree of co-operation to the Irish Crop Dryers Association and I am sure they will.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Quigley asked also about the number employed or to be employed. <Col N="765" /> When the original company was wound up, there were then 31 people employed.  That was only the development work and it was taken over then by the Department of Agriculture and the Forestry Division of the Department of Lands.  They employed, as of June, 1959, 60 people but they had expended in the short time they were there a total of £187,000 on research alone.  That was almost the entire amount that was to be provided initially for the setting up of this grass meal plant.  That was expended in a period of about three years employing only 60 people.  I understand that that expenditure was more than double the expenditure that had been anticipated.  I am not trying to take away from it but so far as the suggestion that the operations going on there are of much greater value is concerned, I do not think anybody can assess that.  It is a research station&mdash;an experimental station but at all events it is costing much more than the inter-Party Government who set it up had expected it would cost.</P>

      <P>Senator Cole, I think, struck the nail on the head when he said that the long-term consideration of this measure is one that we cannot ignore.  It is one, unfortunately, which the inter-Departmental Committee did not consider.  It seems that they had no option but to ignore it under their terms of reference.  If we consider the cost of putting one man into a farm acquired by the Land Commission, we are led to believe that it varies from between £3,000 and £3,500.  If we can get in this manner in a short period 2,000 acres of land capable of being cultivated, it will <Col N="766" /> give roughly 50 farmers 40 acres each in the long run.  To divide such an acreage would cost the Land Commission about £150,000.</P>
      <P>So, if we relate the original capital outlay to the value of the land that will be brought into cultivation and the social value of putting families to live there and work on the lands, I think we cannot over-estimate the value of what is envisaged in this Bill. As a matter of fact, while sitting here today, I was reminded of the contribution made by the late Senator Baxter when the Bill was originally before this House.  As reported in Volume 41, Column 704 of the official debates he said:</P>
      <P>This is a small and simple looking measure.  I welcome it and venture to prophesy that, simple as it appears, it may after some time be written down as one of the most important proposals that has come before the Oireachtas since this State was established.</P>
      <P>I am not attempting to claim that for the Bill but I would certainly commend the outlook Senator Baxter had at that time and would commend the hopes he had for the ultimate objectives of this Bill which are not only to provide employment for a certain number of people immediately but to bring back bogland hitherto useless but which ultimately can be cultivated.</P>
      <P>Incidentally, before I sit down, I should say that the numbers expected to be employed on the operation itself are about 150 to 170 for seven months of the year and about half that number for five months of the year in the valley period.</P>

      <P>On this section, which is the section to establish the <Col N="767" /> company provided for by the Act of 1953, I want to make this remark arising from what the Minister said. It appears that officials of the Department of Agriculture gave certain evidence to the inter-Departmental Committee established by the inter-Party Government, which was wrong, according to the Minister, on two material facts.

      <P>If that is the fact, I merely want to say that it must necessarily follow that the recommendations of the inter-Departmental Committee must have been wrong and if the Government were prepared to accept, as they did, the recommendations of the inter-Departmental Committee, which it made from wrong evidence of a material character, it seems to me that all this talk about spleen and venom on the part of the Government is quite misdirected because they acted on wrong recommendations framed on the basis of wrong evidence.</P>

They did not offer themselves to take over the operation at Glenamoy since they were so occupied with the operations at Gowla.  Nevertheless, they gave one of their experts as a full-time manager at Glenamoy and unfortunately he had to go back again to Comhlucht Siúicre. It is not envisaged that Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann will, nor do I think they would want to, undertake this operation themselves.</P>

      <P>So far as I know we have had no justification at all for the proposals as to what the capital of this company should be.  The Minister in his concluding statement on the Second Reading suggested that he had had no representations from private enterprise companies which would suggest that they were concerned that this company would interfere with them.  I happen to be aware that they are very concerned; they have been concerned not only recently but for many years with this proposal.  The Minister's views on it are well known and if the Minister says the civil servants were <Col N="769" /> obsessed by Deputy Dillon and Deputy Sweetman, then I can say the private companies were obsessed by the Minister.</P>
      <P>The Minister is a man who speaks very quietly but I heard him speak with a fair amount of force in Dáil Éireann on this matter.  Everybody is entitled to be concerned about something which is close to his heart.  If the Minister for Industry and Commerce comes in here and says the civil servants on the inter-Departmental committee were concerned about the attitude of the two Ministers&mdash; that is to say Deputy Dillon and Deputy Sweetman&mdash;the private enterprise companies were well aware, and could not be unaware, of the position about which they kept themselves informed. The opinion of the Minister for Industry and Commerce is well known by anybody who paid attention to his speech.  This kind of argument, and the production of a letter from Liverpool, a recent one I suppose&mdash;&mdash;</P>

As I said, there was no statement that I heard from the Minister, or anywhere else for that matter, justifying this and I read both the report of the inter-Departmental committee and of the committee set up since 1957.  Mind you, I read them with an open mind because I was not concerned in any way except from the point of view of representations made to me by people concerned with these private companies. I formed the opinion that the report of the inter-Departmental committee was a much better document than the other report.  A far better one.</P>

I would refer to paragraph 63, page 38, of the Report.  It is broken up into details there, such as Senator O'Donovan's economic mind would require.

      <P>In deference to the Minister, who probably is anxious to finish this Bill, I shall not press an amendment that I could move on this Stage.  It is no reflection on the Minister or on this board.  It is a general principle which I hope to advocate in regard to each and every board that is set up.  I hope we shall succeed in having this principle inserted, for the protection of the House and for the good name of the Oireachtas.</P>

      <P>Before we adjourn, Sir, may I raise a matter of <Col N="774" /> privilege.  It seems to me to be clearly a matter of privilege.</P>
      <P>This evening, on the 6.30 news on Radio Éireann, a statement was made from the Government Information Bureau, with direct reference to proceedings here last evening.  I have the statement here, and I propose to quote it, not for the purpose of discussing it in any way, but in order that Senators will be aware of what was said on the Radio.  It begins:</P>
      <P>With reference to the tendentious motion moved on the adjournment of the Seanad on Wednesday evening, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Welfare has issued the following statement:</P>
      <P>There is no foundation for the allegation that the names and addresses of unemployed persons have been supplied from official sources, for election or other purposes, to members of the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>If a Deputy, in an effort to assist a person to obtain suitable employment, requests that that person's name be submitted for a reported vacancy and that person is found at the time not to be registered for employment, it is normal practice to inform the Deputy to this effect.  This facility is available to all Deputies at all times.</P>
      <P>I think, Sir, that the use of the Radio to answer statements made in this House, is a clear breach of privilege. It is a very remarkable innovation, and I think it is the business of this House to see that it does not go unnoticed.</P>
      <P>The question mentioned here was raised here last night in an orderly fashion.  No Minister and no Parliamentary Secretary attended.  The question was raised in the precise terms accepted by the Chair.  The ruling of the Chair was criticised twice by the Leader of the House and here we have a repetition of that criticism in the words &ldquo;the tendentious motion&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a story told of a boy being caught in an orchard stealing apples.  When the man who owned the orchard asked him where he got the apples, the boy said: &ldquo;I got them from God, sir.&rdquo;  Constitutional practice is, and has always been, that a matter raised in the House is answered in the House.  That is normally the practice.  The motion was accepted by the Chair.  It is only courtesy and also&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>No, Sir, I am explaining why it seems to me to be a matter of privilege.  I must surely be allowed to say that I cannot leave it without saying what it seems to be to me.  This action would seem to indicate <Col N="776" /> a deliberate change of Government policy with regard to this House and it is for that reason that it seems to me to be a matter of privilege.  I should like to submit to you that contempt for this House has been shown already by the refusal of the Parliamentary Secretary to attend and this is a repetition of that contempt.  If Government statements on the radio are to be substituted for attendance by Ministers in this House that means a very marked departure from our normal democratic procedure.  What we have here, Sir, is, in effect, Government by discussion and the innovation which I am bringing to your attention now seems to me to be the substitution of Government edict on the radio for discussion here.  That seems to be a very dangerous thing.  I think every member of the House should stand against it, whatever opinions he may have.  I am bringing it to your notice so that you may take such steps as you may consider appropriate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;because I know his technique but I want to say that I do not know where this statement came from.  I did not hear it and I was not supplied with a copy of <Col N="777" /> it by anybody.  I got a copy here of what Senator Hayes has read and so far as the protest concerning the breach of privilege is concerned, the only breach that I know of was the use of Seanad Éireann for the same purpose for which Dáil Éireann has been used by certain Deputies over the past two years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that the Senator who is the Leader of the House has proved himself unfit to be in that position.  He is ruining the transaction of business in the House. That will have to be taken up as well as the matter to which I have already referred.</P>
