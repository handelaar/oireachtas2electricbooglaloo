      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>Naturally, everyone who is concerned to see that the least well-off members of the community are to be looked after as well as the community can afford, welcomes this Bill.  When the Central Fund Bill was before the Seanad, I spoke about this matter myself and I suggested that if money was not very tight with the Minister, he might give the old age pensioners an increase of 2/6 a week. I formed the impression that the Minister accepted this good advice following the rumpus that occurred in Britain after their Budget.  Anyway, the Minister has done it, and he deserves the gratitude of people concerned about the conditions of the old age pensioners, the non-contributory widows, and the people in receipt of unemployment assistance who are, perhaps, the worst off of the three groups.</P>
      <P>Let me say first of all that the 2/6 a week barely brings the purchasing power of the old age pension up to what it was in 1938-1939.  It means that the community as a whole, whose general welfare has improved by something in the region of 20 or 25 per cent., are not prepared, apparently, to give any more to these, the least well-off sections of the community.  One could argue and make a coherent case that the old age pensions should be increased by a good deal more than this figure of 2/6 a week.  A social welfare officer spoke very disparagingly to me of the 2/6 increase and no one knows the conditions better than the people who do the field work in this connection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="136" /> I made a suggestion myself&mdash;I noted that it was subsequently mentioned, perhaps quite independently, by two members of the Dáil in the debate in the Dáil&mdash;that something higher than the normal standard should be given to the old age pensioner who lives alone.  I am aware that the people who have to operate the Act see a difficulty in that in its initial stages.  They feel they would have to call on every old age pensioner.  I do not think that would be necessary.  It could be done by putting an advertisement in the newspapers that any old age pensioner who claimed to be living alone should send in an application.  That would get rid of a lot of the extra administrative work.  The least an old age pensioner living alone should get, I feel, should be a figure of 35/- a week which would be 5/- a day.  That would merely give them what the rest of the community apparently have got though, of course, we are all aware that it is not evenly distributed over the community.</P>
    <P>I believe we all welcome the Bill but it is the least that could be given in the most elementary way of justice to the old age pensioners, the recipients of unemployment assistance and the non-contributory widows.  The cost does look large in a full year, roughly £1? million, which is a sizeable amount of money.  Special consideration should be given to people living alone, although I know there is an administrative point of view that there is a difficulty in giving special consideration to individual cases, particularly here in Dublin.</P>
    <P>Many years ago, I did St. Vincent de Paul work myself and we had a system whereby we gave a very small amount to old age pensioners who were living alone.  I can still remember their names, though some of them have, no doubt, left this orb long since.  We gave them 1/- a week extra, mainly in order that we could call around to see them.  On the ordinary card, they got 4/- or 5/- a week for groceries, but the fact is that the St. Vincent de Paul Society gave them 1/- a week purely to have an opportunity to call to see the people who were living alone.  People who know them <Col N="137" /> and who live among them tell me that a number of them are suffering from malnutrition.</P>
    <P>In this month's copy of the <i>National Observer,</i> which came to my hand this morning, there are two columns of material on the subject.  For example, it says:</P>
    <P>Recently, a distinguished physician made a striking statement to a Fine Gael Research and Information Centre Meeting.</P>
    <P>Most doctors, he said, knew that the hospitals of Dublin were full of old people suffering from nothing other than starvation.  Others have since confirmed his statement as nothing but sober, disturbing truth.</P>
    <P>For, it is clear, the combination of senescence, poverty and ill-health is daily bringing to our hospitals creatures so neglected as to be an indictment of us all.</P>
    <P>The point is, that where two of them are living together or where they are living with their families, particularly in the country where perhaps they are looked after by their neighbours, they are better off&mdash;I do not mean to suggest that the Dublin neighbours do not look after them because they do&mdash;but the problem is more serious in Dublin because of the higher cost of living&mdash; the only way to solve that problem is to give a larger sum of money to the people living alone.  I do not think it would cost very much because I believe there are actually very few of them living alone but some like to be independent and do not want to feel they are in the position of being almost compelled to live with someone else when they like to live in a room by themselves.  Subject to that criticism, I welcome the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnLOSullivan" hpid="Mr. J.L. O'Sullivan Mr. J.L. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J.L. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator O'Donovan in his view that the allowance given to meet the cost of living to the old age pensioners is very meagre but I am sure it is a Government decision and anything we say will not affect it.  Probably the Minister himself has not the power to increase it without the approval of the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a section of the people who <Col N="138" /> I believe are very harshly dealt with not only under this Bill, but for some time past, and they are the people who are in receipt of small pensions for services rendered outside this country. I have known of cases which came before pensions committees, where an increase on these small pensions amounting to as little as 5/- a week often reduced their old age pensions by 7/6 per week.  I believe that the means test in this respect should be modified to some extent.  Those people have spent a lifetime in some foreign service and when because of the cost of living or for some other reason, they get a slight increase in their pensions, their old age pensions can immediately be reduced in this country.  I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to look into this matter and if it is possible to give these people some consideration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DominickMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill, naturally, cannot be opposed, but it would be wrong to let it pass through the Seanad without saying that I, and the people who think with me in the Labour movement, think that this increase of 2/6 a week is miserable in its amount and miserable in the date from which it is to operate.  The plight of the old age pensioners is surely well enough appreciated by all of us to awaken our conscience in regard to what is happening.  I quite appreciate that proper increases to old age pensioners and others in receipt of social benefits are costly on the Exchequer. I accept right away that if these are to be brought to a proper level, then extra taxation must be levied, but I think the Government have a responsibility in this matter.  They have the responsibility in so far as they can to alleviate the plight of these people by imposing, if necessary, extra taxation. It is not for me, and this is not the place, to suggest where the extra taxation can be secured, but I think we will accept in principle that extra taxation must be levied and must be borne if these people are to be treated properly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The date from which the increase is to operate is 1st August.  Really, I should have thought that with the smallness of the increase, the Government <Col N="139" /> would have at least applied the increase concurrently and given some ease to these people.  I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will go back to his colleagues in the Government and ask them seriously to consider between now and the next Budget proper benefits for these people and at the same time take a decision that the necessary revenue must be collected to give these proper benefits.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>This measure is a timely one and it shows that the Government appreciate the position of the old age pensioners.  If I were asked my opinion on this matter, I would have tried probably to give the same amount of money, but I would do it in a different way.  I think the pensioner who is living with his or her family is in a better position than the two old age pensioners living together and is in a far better state than the single pensioner.  I would prefer to see single pensioners given 5/- or 7/6d. if they are living alone because they have to bear the cost of rent, fire and other expenses.  In my opinion, they are the people who are far worse off.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Donovan mentioned a case where that was brought to his notice by a charitable organisation, the Society of Saint Vincent de Paul.  I have been told that pensioners living with their families consider that the money is a private perquisite.  I have even heard it said that it is money to drink, but the single pensioner living alone is one for whom charitable organisations will still have to make up the difference between what that pensioner receives by way of old age pension and what he needs for mere existence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to what Senator Murphy said about extra taxation, I do not think this country can bear any extra taxation.  There is a sum of £150 million taxation on the country at the moment, which represents £1 per week per head of the population.  If we could get better value for money, perhaps we might be able to do with less taxation, but I think that any extra taxation would be self-defeating.  It would mean that we would get less <Col N="140" /> production and the cure would be worse than the disease.</P>
    <P>We support this Bill which we regard as a move in the right direction. I would urge on the Minister that next year he might consider the question of the single old age pensioner and the two old age pensioners living alone. They have not the benefit of the family income, the family roof or fire.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOQuigley" hpid="Mr. O'Quigley Mr. O'Quigley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Murphy complained that these increases will not be payable until 1st August of this year.  I think he is entirely correct in his complaint because this Bill is about two years late.  This is a Bill that should have been introduced two years ago, following upon the savage inroads made upon the standard of living of the old age pensioners, the unemployed and the widows and orphans by the 1957 Budget.  The Government are making some small restitution even at this late stage and we are glad, but there is nothing in the Bill in which to congratulate them.</P>
      <P>There is only one other point I wish to make about the Bill.  It is in relation to the scale of means set out in Section 3 for determining the payment of pensions to widows.  I have been looking up the 1952 Statue which is referred to in Section 3.  From my reading of the 1952 Statute, there has been no change in the scale of income which is set down in column 1 of the Table in Section 3.  It seems to me that that Schedule should be revised and that the income should bear some relationship with the decline in money values.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The cost of living has risen about 25 per cent. since 1952.  Therefore, it means that a person who, in 1952, had an income of £117-15-0 was in a much better position and was much better off than a person who has an income of £117-15-0 at the present time.  What it means is that a person who has £117-15-0 today would need to have 25 per cent. more to be in the same position as a person with that sum in 1952.  It seems to me that every time the rate of pension for widows is increased, the scale of income should also be increased proportionately with the increase in the cost of living <Col N="141" /> Perhaps, the Parliamentary Secretary might indicate why that is not done. It seems to me to be elementary and a matter which might engage the attention of the Parliamentary Secretary and his Department when they are introducing a Bill of this kind in the future.</P>

      <P>Ní mian liomsa mórán a rá ar an mBille seo ach fáilte a chur roimis agus a bheith sásta go bhfuil a ndícheall déanta ag an Rialtas sa rud so.  Is breágh bog is féidir le daoine áirdeanna níos mó a thabhairt dosna daoine atá i gceist san mBille so ach ní míníonn siad dúinn in aon chor cad as go dtiocfaidh an t-airgead breise nó cad iad na cánacha breise is ceart a chur ar na daoine chun na breiseanna seo a chur i bhfeidhm.</P>
      <P>Like other Senators who have spoken, I welcome these increases which are being given to the classes of persons envisaged in this measure.  I am glad to see that the Bill is welcomed by all sides of the House. At the same time, it is to be observed that the welcome being given from the opposite side of the House is being watered down a bit, by suggestions that these increases to old age pensioners, blind pensioners, widows and orphans and so on should be greater.  We would all like to see the increases greater than they are, but we have to be realistic and bear in mind the capacity of the community to bear any extra increases.</P>
      <P>When we consider this matter objectively, we must admit that there is a good slice of the national revenue being paid out to these classes of people who come within the scope of Social Welfare.  Roughly some £22 million is a big sum for this country. Having regard to the resources of the country, the position would compare favourably with that of other countries. After all, there is a limit to what can be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator O'Donovan and others advocated special consideration for the old age pensioner living alone.  I do not know if that is a practical suggestion. I imagine that such a decision, if it were adopted, would give rise to considerable administrative difficulties.  As well as that, it is always rather invidious <Col N="142" /> to discriminate between one section and another in these matters.  Therefore, if there were to be any extra increases, those increases should apply all round.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Quigley referred to the increase in the cost of living and gave a percentage figure.  I do not know where he got that figure and I should like to see it myself.  I do not agree with the figure he has given as regards the increase in the cost of living since 1952 &mdash;which, I think, was the year he mentioned. Any fair-minded and unbiassed individual will admit that the Government here have brought the social services up to a reasonable level, even having regard to the increase in the cost of living.</P>
    <P>As I said at the outset, we should all like to see these classes of people, the needy sections of the community, getting more if we could afford to give it to them; but in considering any such increases as certain Senators here have in mind, we must remember that we have to cut our cloth according to the measure, that we must have regard to the national resources and that we have not done too badly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesJOKeefe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Like other Senators, I am very glad that the less fortunate in our community have been considered this time and granted a half-crown. There are two observations I should like to make.  First of all, in Dublin particularly&mdash;I do not know about the rest of the country&mdash;the Dublin Board of Assistance are obliged to subsidise their old age pensioners with a grant of home assistance.  I would like the Parliamentary Secretary to ask the Minister to issue an order forbidding a board of assistance&mdash;in Dublin or elsewhere&mdash;from taking into consideration this increase of half-a-crown. At the present time, if a person is receiving x shillings in pension and y shillings in subsidy, there is no sense whatever in, from 1st August, increasing the pension to make it x plus 2/6 and reducing the subsidy by 2/6. Therefore, I would like the Parliamentary Secretary to see if the Minister could issue an order to that effect, forbidding boards of assistance from taking into consideration this increase of 2/6.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="143" /> There is another observation I would like the Minister to consider, that is, in the case of non-contributory widows' pensions.  There are widows who were granted a non-contributory pension, not through any fault of their own but because their husbands were possibly out of employment for the required number of years beforehand, or otherwise.  The Minister should do something to forbid a means test in such cases.  It is a hardship.  If a widow is in receipt of a non-contributory pension and if she is fortunate enough to secure some kind of employment&mdash;like the contributory pension widows, who have no means test&mdash;to help her to augment this pension, to raise a family, there is a means test introduced there and then and her pension is reduced accordingly.  I should like the Minister to consider doing away with the means test as far as the non-contributory widows' pensions are concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OwenSkeffington" hpid="Dr. Sheehy Skeffington Dr. Sheehy Skeffington">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel, like several other Senators, that this Bill represents something quite considerably less than the minimum that we owe to the old people of our country. I would ask the Minister and the House to look back to the days when it was a main plank in the platform of the Republican Party that Cumann na nGaedheal were paying an old age pension of only 10/- a week.  The modern equivalent of 10/- a week is almost exactly 27/6 a week.  In those days, we were told of the extreme stinginess and grudging character of the Government, that expected old people to live, pay for food, clothe themselves decently, pay rent and pay for fuel at the wretched rate of 10/- a week.  In those days, 10/- bought just about what it is possible to buy for 27/6 now&mdash;which represents the new total pension including these fresh increases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would ask members of the Government, in particular, to ask themselves, in these circumstances, in looking back, with the full knowledge of the facts they have now, whether they now consider that the Government of those days were perfectly <Col N="144" /> right to pay only 10/- a week and could not do any better.  I am aware, of course, that they cut 1/- off the pension and that there was a great amount of cheering when the 1/- went back on again in due course.  But were Cumann na nGaedheal right at the time they were paying 10/-?  Was that sufficient?  Was that as much as we could afford to pay?  If they were being mean, stingy, unimaginative and inhuman, can all those adjectives be applied now to the present Government?  It seems to me they have either to say that the 10/- was right then, or admit that they themselves are doing precisely what their predecessors did in those days to the old people.</P>
    <P>I would ask the House to consider what level of existence people can achieve on an income of 27/6.  I suggest that their conditions are sub-human and that there are tens of thousands of people in this country today who are living in those sub-human conditions.  I suggest that many of them are too meek, and indeed too weak physically, to make the kind of protest that all of us here should make if we examine our hearts and consciences.</P>
    <P>Supposing an old person is paying for rent something like 5/- a week. That is not an enormous amount. Many of them are paying more, but let us suppose they are not paying more. Supposing that, for a considerable portion of the year, they are spending 4/- a week on fuel, which is absolutely essential for an old person, particularly an old person who is under-nourished. Supposing they spend something like 1/- or 2/- on an average a week on clothing&mdash;put it down at 1/-.  Probably the most expensive item will be footwear. I would ask members of this House, when they see old age pensioners, to have a look at their footwear, which has to do them not just in these months but in the months from November through the winter to February, March, and so on.  I do not think it excessive if we say they would have to spend an average of one shilling a week&mdash;surely that is not excessive on clothing, including footwear? Supposing they have to spend <Col N="145" /> one shilling a week on transport, which is not improbable.  We make no concessions in our semi-nationalised transport for old people.</P>
    <P>How much of the 27/6d. is left for food?  Something like 16/6d.  A sum of 16/- in the week for food is a little over 2/- a day.  I wonder how many members of this House, if they were to try to do it for a bet, could exist, say, for a fortnight without spending more than 2/6d. a day on food?  I have a feeling that the weight of quite a number of individual members of this House might drop under those conditions. I may say that light-heartedly, but nevertheless the fact is that we all must recognise now that to try to exist, and try to live a human life, on such a level of food intake is virtually impossible.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, we apply a means test to these people, a humiliating means test.  If they have so much as £2 a week from any other source, they get no old age pension.  I wonder why is it considered that £2 a week is enough to permit them to do without any old age pension?  It is almost as if the Government were recognising that it takes £2 a week for them to keep fairly alive and that if they have that, they are all right.  If that is the case, surely the minimum pension should be £2 a week?</P>
    <P>I was asked on two occasions recently to make an appeal for the Mendicity Institute here in Dublin. Their main aim now is to provide very simple, very clean and adequate meals for old people or any people&mdash;for poor people&mdash;with no questions asked. I notice that in the preceding year as many as 87,000 of these meals were served, whereas last year 92,000 of these meals were served.  They are as simple as can be.  They consist of one dish.  It is good and wholesome and plentiful.  The fact that there is such a demand for such meals&mdash;the Mendicity Institute is only one of many such institutions &mdash; provides, I suggest, an indictment on our society, because we are not doing what we ought to do for our old people and our poor.</P>
    <P>It has been said that we have not got the money, that taxation is already too high, and so on.  I remember <Col N="146" /> last year&mdash;I think on this very Bill &mdash;the Minister for Finance said that nobody apart from myself had mentioned where the money might come from.  I had suggested a very considerable cut in the Defence Estimate. The Minister, while being content to say that nobody but myself had made any suggestion as to where the money could come from, paid no attention at all and did not even consider or comment on the suggestion that one might save something on the £6 million or £7 million a year we spend on the maintenance of our defence system.  We could save quite a considerable sum on that Estimate alone.  If the sub-human conditions in which our old people are forced to live to-day were to be considered by the Government as a national emergency, I suggest they would find the money.  I am afraid we have a tendency to sleep light on other men's wounds.  It is not regarded as a national emergency and so we make this absolutely minimal gesture of throwing them 2/6d. a week. I notice that in Britain it is possible to pay a couple of old age pensioners a joint pension in the neighbourhood of £250 a year, whereas our comparable pension, with this increase, will be something like £143 a year.</P>
    <P>The United Kingdom is a much wealthier country than we are.  However, I notice that in Denmark they succeed in paying to an old couple of that kind a joint pension of £200 a year.  They pay it at the age of 65 and it is a non-contributory pension, though there is a means test which is applied at about the same level as ours &mdash;above £100 a year.  In a small and even poorer country like Iceland, they pay a joint pension of £227 a year at the age of 65.  It is contributory and there is also a means test.</P>
    <P>Finland pays a joint pension of £287 to a pair of old age pensioners at 65. That is contributory, but there is no means test.  Against those figures, I suggest that our joint pension of £143 a year for a pair of old age pensioners granted to them most grudgingly at the age of 70, with a means test, though admittedly it is non-contributory, is, in the light of those comparative figures from other <Col N="147" /> countries&mdash;not all of them wealthy countries&mdash;an indictment of our failure to provide for our old people and for our blind pensioners and widows in the manner in which we ought.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that this 2/6d. a week is something like an absolute minimum, but it is far below what any decent minimum should be.  If you ask at any of our institutions&mdash;the Government are well aware of the fact&mdash;how much it costs to keep an old person, they know well they cannot do it on 27/6d. a week.  I do not want to stress that any further for the main reason that I think we all feel ashamed of the disgraceful manner in which we treat our old folk.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Government&mdash;and I put the appeal quite apart from any Party political considerations, because I have not noted any difference between this Government and the Coalition Government in this respect&mdash; to consider very seriously whether, before this time next year, they cannot find it absolutely necessary, as a matter of national emergency, to treat our old people and our dependent widows in a manner of which we need not feel ashamed, as I feel heartily ashamed of having to-day to support this wretched Bill.</P>

      <P>I would remind Senator Sheehy Skeffington that an emergency does not last forever and that we are dealing with the day-to-day problem.  Social welfare at its best in any country you take is not a living wage; it is a contribution in aid. Senator O'Donovan spoke about a problem which is a very live one, that is, the problem of old age pensioners living alone.  You cannot force them, in a democratic State, into an institution. They have a right, if they choose, to live alone.  He referred to an article in the <i>National Observer</i> dealing with the question of malnutrition.  Now, you could fill the house of an old age pensioner living alone with the best foods imaginable and he would still suffer from malnutrition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Senator says that he has a <Col N="148" /> knowledge of St. Vincent de Paul work and I am sure he has.  Anyone knowing the plight of those old age pensioners living alone knows that they are not able to cook for themselves properly, or to prepare the nourishment which will save them from malnutrition. Their general diet consists of tea, bread and butter.  That is all they are able to provide for themselves. This is really the problem of the old age pensioner living alone who has not got an income of £104, let alone 104 pence or 104 farthings, and yet chooses to live in the room or garret by himself. It is a very vexed problem.</P>
    <P>The Dublin Board of Assistance, and other such local authorities, provide supplements to old age pensions, but then you encounter the individual with an understandable pride who will not take that, even if it is offered to him and you just cannot do anything about it.  There is one institution which comes to the relief of people who fall by the wayside and are too proud to look for social assistance, although I see nothing wrong with it.  It gives a limited relief and there may be other institutions like it.  The problem of the old age pensioner who has not got one penny coming in to him during the year is something towards the solution of which we should all direct our energies.</P>
    <P>I dispute the contention of Senator O'Quigley that the cost of living has gone up by 25 per cent. in the past seven years.  I refute that statement; it did not go up by that figure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1943" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">

      <P>That figure is wrong. He argues naively that we should keep our eyes open and when the cost of living goes up by so many points, then we should raise all social services.  We should all like to see the Utopian days when there would be a barometer for salaries and wages which would go up and down in that kind of way.  These are very great problems which we cannot solve overnight and as far as this Department is concerned, when the cost of living went up in the past two years, we brought in a Bill and increased the old age pensions.</P>

      <P>They got the increase and they will get this one.  We are dealing in millions in this.  We are taking one quarter of the current expenditure and devoting it to social welfare.  When Senator Sheehy Skeffington talks about saving a million pounds in the Department of Defence, he should realise that that would not give us exactly 2/6d. a week for old age pensioners alone and you cannot pick out old age pensioners without picking out social beneficiaries like non-contributory widows and orphans and unemployment assistance recipients. So the sum is a very large one which would have to be provided and while one would stand for economies all round, you have the problem of increased taxation and that is a very knotty problem.</P>
      <P>The Senator talked about Iceland, amongst other countries, where old age pensions were higher than here. The cost of living in Iceland is one of the highest in Europe, unless it has gone down recently, and the cost of living in Finland is not too low either.  It is fairly high there.  What the people are getting with one hand they are giving out with the other.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Sullivan spoke about the recipients of small pensions from outside. We understand that problem quite well, but the means test is there and they are far better off than the people to whom I have just referred and who were referred to by more than one Senator.  Single persons or married couples living in cities or in rural areas who have not got a brass farthing coming into them during the year are the people to whom we should direct our attention.  The person who has £52 10d. per year and can still get the old age pension is a lot better off than the person with nothing coming in.</P>
      <P>As I said and I repeat, the local authority can come to their aid as everybody in this Assembly knows. There are dozens and scores and hundreds of people who will not go to the local authority or to an institution.</P>

      <P>Wexford has always a problem of its own, but I am talking about the question generally.  The numbers in the county homes are much the same all the year round. I think the people in the county homes are well off especially when I read of a person who has been burned to death by fire caused by parafin oil, or whose house has been burned down while he was in it.  If such people were in county homes, they would be under medical care; they would have good nurses and nuns to look after them; and they would be getting nourishing food, not only bread and tea.  They would be far better off. We cannot force them if they wish to stay out of the county homes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>On Section 1, which is the section giving the half-crown increase, I wish to say, arising to some extent from what the Parliamentary Secretary has said in his reply, that this half-crown is not enough.  I asked the Parliamentary Secretary&mdash; he did not advert to it&mdash;whether he is now satisfied that the 10/- a week which was being paid by Cumann na nGaedheal was enough, because he is doing no better.  It is all very well to say it is not possible to do everything we wish to do but is he really satisfied that the Government, in doing precisely what Cumann na nGaedheal did 30 years ago, are doing the best possible?  I should like to hear whether the Government are prepared now to retract what they said then about the stinginess of Cumann na nGaedheal or whether they feel they themselves are behaving in an equally stingy manner.  Is the 27/6 a week, which is the equivalent of the 10/-, really enough?  I am disappointed that the Parliamentary Secretary seems to be so satisfied that we cannot do better.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary has spoken of the institutions, and he is quite right in two points he makes.  One is that many of these old people living <Col N="152" /> alone would be better off in institutions. There is no doubt about that.  I think he is also right in saying that a large measure of progress has been made in such institutions, though I am sure he will agree that quite a lot more progress must be made.  Anybody who has walked the wards of such institutions where you see consecutive wards of 30, 40 and 50 people will realise there is much to be done still.</P>
    <P>However, I should like to relate this to the increase of half a crown and to ask the Parliamentary Secretary to tell us the rough average figure he thinks it would cost to keep these old age pensioners in institutions.  He has the figure at his finger-tips and I am prepared to bet it is considerably more than 27/6d. a week.  If it is not £5 a week, I shall be very much surprised. I should like to hear his comment particularly since in an institution all the buying, catering and overheads are considerably less&mdash;because they are bulked&mdash;and because in some cases the institutions cater for thousands of people&mdash;than in the case of the individual buying as an individual in the market.  The institution's costs are less per individual and yet they cannot do it at 27/6d. a week.  Why should we ask our old age pensioners, whether they be living alone or not, to struggle along on an absurdly unrealistic figure?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKennedy" hpid="Mr. Kennedy Mr. Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The cost in institutions is based not alone on the food consumed but on the cost of the nursing staff, and so on.  All the costs are bulked together and the cost per head is taken into account.  I cannot give the Senator the cost of the food per individual, but when we talk of institutions and the cost per head, we take into account the physician or physicians, the nurses, the wardsmaids, the medicines and other items associated with an institution.  I have no recollection, and I cannot supply the information in this debate, of the cost per head of the food consumed by the individual, but I am sure it is not very high with bulk purchases and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Senator wants to draw a comment from me about what we said about Cumann na nGaedheal and what we think now.  We were criticising 9/- a week that time, not 10/-.  There is a <Col N="153" /> big difference between 9/- and 10/- in relation to money values.</P>

      <P>Nobody thinks that anything is enough.  I have a very open mind on what is enough and what is not enough, but you are in a world of realism and you have to cut your cloth according to your measure. You reach a point in taxation and expenditure when the game is not worth the candle, when what you give is not worth the paper it is written on. We should like to give more if we could but the last straw breaks the camel's back.  A time might come when the State might find it very difficult to meet all its commitments, and there are other commitments.  A Government have to look ahead and in planning have to bear that in mind. In those conditions, we are doing fairly well in this Bill.</P>

      <P>I was greatly disappointed when the Parliamentary Secretary said they are doing very well. A few weeks ago in the Dáil, the Taoiseach's Parliamentary Secretary said the pound is worth 7/5d.  What is half a crown worth to-day?  It is a disgraceful act at this stage, with the cost of living never as high as it is, that we are offering the old age pensioner this meagre increase, after their 70 long years; some of them cannot even get the full amount because of the means test.</P>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary asks where the money will come from.  I have a circular here which was sent out to all Senators and Deputies.  It deals with the Land Project and I should like to quote from it to see whether or not we are giving justice to the old age pensioners&mdash;&mdash;</P>

That is a question I should like to ask the Parliamentary Secretary: where do they get these millions for the Land Project when they cannot get anything for the old age pensioners who are the fathers and mothers of some members of the community?  Some of them have 5/- or 10/- a week.  I have with me a letter from an old I.R.A. man&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Senator Carter said that the previous Government did not do anything, but when Deputy Corish was Minister for Social Welfare, he did a lot.  He gave 5/-, not 2/6d., and the cost of living was lower then than it is today.  After the promises made at the last general election that they would be better off, they are worse off today than ever before.  Let us be honest about it because there is no use in being dishonest.  They are starving in the midst of plenty.  The names of the institutions today are changed. Instead of being called county homes, they are now called after some Saint, but that does not make them a whole lot better.  The county councils will not provide enough money.  We give six shillings a week to the blind, but we are not allowed to give six shillings extra to the old age pensioners.  That is where the Parliamentary Secretary is wrong.  I tried a few times to speak at a meeting of my own county council on that but I was ruled out of order.  We would like to help the old age pensioners and the widows if we had the power, but no one has that power except the Government and the responsible people in the Department of Social Welfare.</P>
      <P>The tax on dog racing was reduced the day after the Budget, as was the tax on dancing, but the poor old age pensioner may wait until after August to get the miserable 2/6, and he will not get any back money.  That is a disgrace in this State after years of native government.  The cost of living was forced up when the Government withdrew the food subsidies and the Parliamentary Secretary brags and boasts that they are doing something when they are really doing nothing. It is a shame, and I ask Senators who support the Government, to voice their opinions and tell us whether the old age pensioners and the widows in their constituencies are living in luxury.  They are not in my constituency, and well I know it.</P>

The Parliamentary Secretary has said that the means test level has been changed several times and that the last time it was changed was in 1952.  I suggest to him that 1952 is too long ago&mdash;it is seven years ago&mdash;and if it was considered in 1952 that a person with £2 a week should not have a pension, it should be remembered that £2 a week in 1952 bought quite appreciably more than £2 a week buys now. Therefore, it is high time this means test scale which appears here in the Table was revised.  After all, in 1952, the cost of living index figure was 122 and it is now 146 or 147, which is 20 per cent. higher.  It is 20 per cent. higher today than it was in 1952 and, therefore, I am not satisfied with the <Col N="157" /> Parliamentary Secretary's statement that this scale has been changed constantly and that it was changed in 1952.  I should like to see it changed in 1959.</P>

      <P>When the Parliamentary Secretary was dealing with Section 1, he did not seem to be very <i>au fait</i> with one of the fundamental statistics in relation to social welfare. He could not tell us what is the cost of food, or what is the cost of maintaining an individual, in a single institution in this country per day or per week.  One would think that when the Parliamentary Secretary is dealing with old age pensioners and widows and orphans, he would at least know what it costs to maintain a single person as regards the item of food.  It speaks very badly for him that he could not give a more clear answer to Senator Sheehy Skeffington's questions.</P>
      <P>I referred to the scale of means tests set out in the Table in Section 3 and I was guilty of an understatement when I said that the cost of living had risen by 25 per cent. since 1952. The Parliamentary Secretary again displays a great knowledge of statistics when he throws up his hands and says that I am talking nonsense and that he does not know what I mean.  Might I say for the benefit of the Parliamentary Secretary that the cost of living figure stood at 114 in February, 1952, and in February, 1959, it stood at 146? That is an increase of 32 points which works out at an increase of 28 per cent.</P>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary was dealing with the difference between 9/- and 10/- in 1932 and he made play with the fact that there was 1/- in the difference&mdash;a difference of 10 per cent.  When he comes to an increase of 25 per cent. in the cost of living, I would expect that some consideration would be given, as apparently it has not been given by the Parliamentary Secretary or the Government, to increasing the amount of income which a person can have before he can qualify for the different rates set out in the Schedule.  I think it is high time that instead of devoting their attention to other things which do not affect the lives of the people in an intimate way&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>They do not agree. I made no great play.  I hurt the Senator's loyalty and allegiance to Fine Gael when I referred to the simple matter of 9/- and 10/-.  If it is hurtful to the Senator, I am awfully sorry because he is more concerned with that than he is with the welfare of the people benefiting under this.  The point which Senator Sheehy Skeffington raises in regard to widows' noncontributory pensions is a problematical one.  We have attempted in Social Welfare not to have three different scales of means test.  We think that, in the long run, it is best to have a means test, say, for the widows and orphans, the old age pensioners, noncontributory pensions and unemployment recipients.  We endeavour to have them all on the one level.</P>

      <P>May I make a point?  When I quoted 122 as the cost of living in 1952, I was quoting the August figure.  Senator O'Quigley was quoting the January or February figure.  In 1951, it was 111. It is very probable that the figure of 114 for January and February, 1952, is correct.  I was quoting the August figure in respect of 1952, 122, and 1958, 146.  The point I make about the means test is not that there should be different levels for different categories. but that the level is now too low.  One hundred and four pounds a year in 1952 meant a level of real wealth which it does not mean today.  There is a difference of at least 20 per cent., and that should be allowed for in this means test Table in 1959.</P>

      <P>This Bill is being introduced for the purpose of amending and extending the Housing (Gaeltacht) Acts of 1929-53. Already under those Acts upwards of 5,000 new houses have been built and another 5,000 have been improved at a cost of £1 million in grants and £¼ million in loans.  Notwithstanding what has been done, however, it is estimated that about 3,000 new houses are needed and that about 5,000 existing houses require to be repaired in the Gaeltacht areas.</P>
      <P>No increase has been made in the grants for new houses since the passing of the 1949 Act in spite of the big increase in costs which occurred in the interim.  To remedy that situation, it is proposed under Section 2(1) of the Bill to increase the present building grants by £25 in the case of houses which do not possess running water and sanitary facilities, and also in the case of houses which will have these facilities but where a public water supply or sanitary facilities are available. It is proposed also to increase the present building grants by £50 in the case of houses which will have running water and sanitary facilities but where a public water supply and sanitary facilities are not available.  It is further proposed under the same Section to make available an additional sum of up to £100 for the provision of a fitted bathroom in the house.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="161" /> It is proposed under Section 2 (2) of the Bill to increase the improving grants by £30 so that grants of £110, £130 and £150 respectively will be available according as a house will have three rooms, four rooms, or five or more rooms.  Under Section 3 (1) it is proposed to provide improved sanitation facilities either in the form of a £55 grant in respect of the provision of water, £30 for sanitary facilities or a combined grant of £85 for both.  It is also proposed to provide a maximum grant of £140 for the provision of a bathroom.</P>
    <P>There are many houses in which there are already water or sanitary facilities but in which these are in a bad or faulty condition.  It is intended under Section 3 (1) to provide a grant of up to £40 for the repair or improvement of such water or sanitary facilities.</P>
    <P>Under the Act of 1953, a maximum grant of £80 is available in respect of the provision of an additional room for visitors.  However, this grant was not used to the extent envisaged&mdash; probably due to the smallness of the grant.  I now propose to increase and extend this grant as shown in the Table which accompanies Section 3 (1). However, as our concern is mainly with visitors who have an interest in the language, it is intended that this assistance will be available only in the areas scheduled in the Gaeltacht Areas Order, 1956.</P>
    <P>As the law stands at present, loans of up to £100 in addition to a building grant and of up to £40 in the case of an improving or a special extension grant are available.  These loans were provided under the 1949 Act and under present conditions the amounts advanced are not nearly large enough. There are a good many households in the Gaeltacht living under very bad housing conditions for whom these loans, in addition to the grants available, are insufficient to enable them to provide proper accommodation for themselves and their dependants.  It is to provide for people of this type that it is intended to make available the loans set out in Section 5 (1) and (2) of the Bill i.e. in the case of a building grant, a loan equal to the amount of <Col N="162" /> the grant; and, in the case of an improving or extension grant, a loan of up to half the cost of the work in question.</P>
    <P>Under Section 3 of the Act of 1929, it is not possible to give assistance under the Acts except to the occupiers of existing houses.  As a result of this condition, it has been found necessary to refuse assistance to people such as tradesmen, fishermen and others who intended to get married and settle down in the Gaeltacht. I think it is obvious that to maintain such a condition would not be to the best advantage of the language or of the Gaeltacht itself.  There is no such a condition in the General Housing Acts and it is intended under Section 3 (1) of this Bill that this condition will not in future affect people in the areas scheduled under the Gaeltacht Areas Order of 1956.</P>
    <P>Assistance of an entirely new kind is set out in Section 4.  As Senators are aware, emphasis is now being laid on the speaking of Irish in the secondary schools, and it is to be expected that this emphasis will be felt very much in the Gaeltacht and that there will be more visitors than ever going there to learn and to practise the speaking of Irish.  It is only right to take full advantage of the situation for the benefit of the people of the Gaeltacht.  In addition, it is very important that the existing amenities and undoubted possibilities of the Gaeltacht areas as tourist centres should be exploited to the full in the interests of the Gaeltacht people and of the country as a whole.  At the moment, however, there is not sufficient suitable accommodation in the Gaeltacht areas to cope with any big increase in the number of visitors.  To cope with this situation and to provide a steady income for the people of the Gaeltacht areas, it is intended to make available a grant of up to £200 for the provision of one holiday chalet to accommodate visitors.  The kind of chalet envisaged is a simple well-built structure erected at a reasonable cost.  In addition to this grant it is intended under Section 5 (3) to provide loans of up to £200 in cases in which loans would be deemed necessary.  It is quite possible that some people would like to <Col N="163" /> build more than one chalet and accordingly it is intended under Section 5 (4) to provide loans of up to £300 to help with the provision of a second chalet and another loan of up to £300 to enable a third chalet to be built if so desired.</P>
    <P>Another kind of assistance provided for under Section 4 is also of an entirely new order.  It is intended to provide for grants of up to £5,000 to enable approved bodies to erect hostels in Gaeltacht areas.  It is thought that such accommodation will be needed to house groups of students, etc., for whom the ordinary household accommodation would not be suitable or sufficient.  The type of hostel envisaged is a building in which cooking, eating and sleeping accommodation would be available for upwards of 20 people.</P>
    <P>As the law stands at the moment, there is relief from any increase in rates for 20 years available to grantees under the Housing (Gaeltacht) Acts in respect of work carried out under these Acts.  Accordingly, the enactment of Section 3 (1) of the Bill would result, in respect of persons who are not occupiers of existing houses, in such persons not being liable for rates at all. I also think such generous relief from rates is no longer necessary.  Accordingly, it is proposed under Section 6 of the Bill to adopt what has been done under the General Housing Acts of 1958 and to give a sliding scale of relief from rates in future in respect of building work.  Although this is a reduction in the relief already available under the existing Housing (Gaeltacht) Acts, it is nevertheless greater than the relief available under the General Housing Acts.  In the case of housing work other than building operations, it is proposed to leave the system of relief from any increase in rates as it is at present but to reduce the period of relief from 20 years to 10 years.</P>
    <P>In the Schedule to the Act of 1929, there are listed the district electoral divisions comprised in the Gaeltacht for the purpose of the Gaeltacht Housing Acts.  This Schedule was never amended and is now completely out of date.  In quite a number of these divisions no application for housing assistance <Col N="164" /> has been received for a long time. In some others, no assistance has been approved for some considerable time because the condition with regard to the Irish language was not fulfilled. Senators are, of course, aware that the Gaeltacht areas have now been determined by Order under Section 2 of the Ministers and Secretaries (Amendment) Act, 1956.  The question whether the benefits of the Acts should be confined exclusively to those areas was considered.  As, however, there are some households in outside districts where Irish is the habitual language of the household, I would be loath, and I think it would not be to the advantage of the language, to deprive these people of the benefits of the Acts. Accordingly, I propose under Section 7 of the Bill to restrict the benefits of the Acts in future to the counties in which grants are ordinarily sanctioned.</P>
    <P>The foregoing are the chief aims and provisions of the Bill.  I am placing it before the Seanad for consideration in the confident hope that the House will agree to it.</P>

      <P>The Minister is right in saying that the Bill is one which should commend itself to the House.  The provisions in relation to increasing grants for new houses, for sanitation and for reconstruction of existing houses, are in line with what has been done for housing generally in the rest of the State, outside the Gaeltacht areas.  Indeed, it comes to me as a surprise to learn that the amount of the grants has not been increased since 1949, in spite of the substantial increases which have taken place in the cost of building materials and in the cost of labour since that time.  Therefore, the amount by which the grants are being increased seems to be reasonable and seems to bear fairly close relationship to the grants <Col N="165" /> ordinarily available under the Housing Acts for the country at large.</P>
      <P>The section dealing with the grants for holiday chalets which may be provided by individuals and by groups of persons is novel and is one which anyone interested in the promotion of Irish and in the preservation of the Gaeltacht must welcome.  I have a recollection that, when the Gaeltacht Industries Bill was going through the House, I mentioned that I felt a good deal could be done, both for the people in the Gaeltacht areas by way of providing them with an income and for the Irish language, if some kind of a local tourist industry were provided; and I had in mind, as I think I mentioned on that Bill, the provision of more facilities in the way of accommodation for people who would wish to go to the Gaeltacht for the purpose of getting the language at its source.</P>
      <P>People who are interested in learning Irish and who would like to hear Irish spoken in the Gaeltacht are also human and like creature comforts. They like to have the ordinary facilities of running water and sanitation.  It must have proved a disincentive to such people in the past that adequate accommodation, merely putting it on that basis, was not available, through no fault of the people in the Gaeltacht, for them if they went there.</P>
      <P>I notice that Section 4 contemplates that grants of as much as £5,000 will be available to groups of persons.  I take it that these will be people who are banded together in different organisations for the promotion of Irish.  I observe that the grants will be at the discretion of the Minister and subject to regulations to be made by the Minister.  I know it is quite a stock provision in legislation that regulations will be made.  I do not see anywhere, by the way, immediately in the Bill that regulations, if made, will be laid before either House of the Oireachtas. I presume that that is in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I must confess I am becoming less and less enamoured of the provision in Acts which enables regulations to be made.  We are all inclined to console ourselves with the thought that in due time we will be sufficiently diligent to <Col N="166" /> look up what regulations are being made and challenge them, if necessary. I am not aware of any regulation that has ever been challenged in either House of the Oireachtas.  It seems to me that in this subsection of Section 4, we are not defining even in broad terms the principles upon which the regulations will be made.</P>
    <P>I should imagine that if the Minister is to have power to make regulations, there should be some boundary within which these regulations will be made. Perhaps in the course of his reply the Minister would indicate what conditions will be attached to the making of grants to bodies of persons under subsection (2) of the new Section 3 of the 1929 Act.</P>
    <P>There is another matter which to me personally is not very satisfactory. Grants to individuals for the building of chalets will be dependent upon whether the person applying for the grant shows, to the satisfaction of the Minister, that the Irish language is in habitual use by him.  I do not know what that has to do with the provision of chalets in the Gaeltacht areas.  It appears to me that if we are to provide chalets to facilitate people going to the Gaeltacht for the purpose of learning Irish, whether or not the person who provides a chalet has Irish does not seem to enter into the question.  If some wealthy Englishman decided to build a number of chalets in any Gaeltacht, I think we would all regard it as very useful that these chalets would be available for people who wanted to go down and spend a period of three weeks or a month there.  Similarly, if anybody else who happens to be resident in the Gaeltacht is of a mind to make this accommodation available, not primarily for his own benefit although presumably he will benefit from renting it or from the money he will get for it by way of tariffs for accommodation, it would be a service which we would all be glad to see. Therefore, I do not understand that it is necessary for a person to satisfy the Minister he habitually uses the Irish language in the home.</P>
    <P>I have this further objection to make on that matter.  Administratively, it creates difficulty in showing to the satisfaction of the Minister that the <Col N="167" /> language is used habitually.  I think there will be considerable difficulty and that it will lead to all kinds of representations and perhaps discrimination, unfortunately, when grants are given to some persons and not to others.  The making of grants dependent on whether or not people have a knowledge of Irish is undesirable because it is making the use of Irish a means of obtaining money.  As I said on the debate on the motion to establish a commission to inquire into methods for the revival of the Irish language, you are debasing the Irish language once you put a money value on it&mdash;and that is still being continued in this section.  My personal view is that that is not wise.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see that, in Section 6, the Minister has gone back to the old system, since he does decide that it is necessary to make people pay some rates in respect of new houses.  I am glad to see he has gone back to the old sliding scale that was introduced in the earlier Housing Acts&mdash;I think, some time in the 1920's.  That is a provision that many people in this country would wish to see restored in the general Housing Acts and applied. Since the Minister has decided that these new houses or reconstructed houses will be liable to rates, I am glad to note that it is not the scale that was set out in the last Housing (Amendment) Act but the scale that was in the earlier Acts that is in Section 6.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister's expectations as to the use which will be made of this Bill will be realised and that it will in fact result in a steady influx of young and old into the Gaeltacht.  I hope that when these chalets are made available there will be a special effort by people to keep them in a condition which will prevent them from deteriorating within a few years and, at the same time, still have them in a clean and attractive condition that will invite people who go to inspect them with a view to staying in them to come and spend some part of their holidays in them with their families in the Gaeltacht.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Dá bhrí sin is féidir a rá go mbeidh líon na gcainteoirí Gaeilge ag dul i méid agus dá réir sin is mó an tsuim a cuirfear sa bheartas seo atá againn, sé sin, daoine a chur go dtí an Ghaeltacht chun líofacht cainte d'fháil ó na Gaeilgeoiri atá ann. <Col N="169" /> Is ceart féachaint chuige go mbeidh an gnáth chompórd ar a laghad le fáil ag na daoine sin a rachaidh go dtí an Ghaeltacht feasta agus nuair a cuirfear an Bille seo i bhfeidhm beidh sé sin le fáil ann.  Ba mhaith liom dá bhféachaimís cuige go gcuirfí maitheasaí an Bhille seo os cóir na ndaoine sa Ghaeltacht nuair a bheidh an Bille rite, agus b'fhéidir nárbh olc an cuimhniú é coiste do chur ar bun i ngach paróiste sa Ghaeltacht.  Nuair a ritheadh Acht na dTithe trid an Oireachtas i 1932 cuireadh coistí ar bun ar fud na tíre chun treoir agus comhairle a thabhairt do na daoine a bheadh ag lorg deontas faoin Acht agus is é ainm a bhí ortha san ná public utility societies.  Dá mbeadh a leithéid sin de choistí ins gach paróiste sa Ghaeltacht chun an treoir cheart a thabhairt do na daoine ba mhaith an rud é.  Níl ansin ach mo thuairim féin.  B'fhéidir go bhfuil tuairimí eile ag an Aire agus ag Seanadóirí maidir leis an gceist sin.</P>
    <P>Tá na tithe seo ag teastáil go mór sa Ghaeltacht, mar na daoine a bhéas ag dul ann feasta, scoláirí agus lucht eolais, beidh siad ag lorg compórd de ghnáth-shaghas.  Fadó, na daoine a bheadh ag dul don Ghaeltacht bhéidís sásta cur futha in aon saghas botháin.</P>

    <P>Dúirt an tAire nuair a bhí sé ag tabhairt an Bille isteach go raibh muintir na Gaeltachta taobh thiar de mhuintir na Galltachta maidir le tithe.  Is fíor sin agus más féidir an scéal sin do leigheas leis an mBille seo is maith an rud é.  Ní fheicimse cén fáth nach mbeadh saoráidí agus maitheasaí comh maith le fáil ag muintir na Gaeltachta agus atá ag muintir na Galltachta, nó b'fhéidir níos fearr mar gheall ar an saibhreas Gaeilge atá aca.  Má tá muintir na tíre seo dáiríre i dtaobh aithbheochaint na Gaeilge caithfidh <Col N="170" /> siad bheith sásta íbirt a dhéanamh agus teacht i gcabhair ar mhuintir na Gaeltachta agus cibé is gá a chur ar fáil dóibh.  Caithfimid bheith sásta costas áirithe do chur orainn féin in a thaobh sin.</P>
    <P>Anois, fé mar adúras, tá forálacha nua san mBille ná raibh in aon Bhille a tugadh isteach anseo fós.  Beidh sé ar chumas mhuintir na Gaeltachta tithe do thógaint anois agus is cuma an raibh tigh acu cheana nó ná raibh.

Rud ion-mholta ar fad isea é feabhas a chur ar cheist na dtithe sa Ghaeltacht mar tá an-chuid tithe sa Ghaeltacht nach bhfuil ar fónamh agus nach bhfuil sé de ghustal ag na daoine féin na tithe a chur i dtreo.

      <P>I did not intend speaking any English today on this measure but lest there be any misunderstanding about a few things that are in it, I feel it is necessary just to say a few words in English.  We have often had debates here and elsewhere about what should be done for the Gaeltacht with a view to preserving the Irish language in those parts of the country.  I think that most of us who have given any thought to the question will have realised now that one of the first essentials for the attainment of that objective&mdash;the objective of preserving the Irish language in the Gaeltacht&mdash;is to improve the economic and social conditions there.  The economic wealth and social welfare of the Gaeltacht is tied up with the question of the preservation of the language.</P>
      <P>I know that is fully realised by the Minister and by the Government.  The question of housing in the Gaeltacht is a very important one because those of us who have had recourse to these Irish-speaking districts know very well that there are many habitations in the Gaeltacht that are not up to modern conditions.  As I said in my contribution in Irish, I, for one, cannot see any reason why the people of the Gaeltacht cannot enjoy the same amenities as those enjoyed by the rest of the community.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>What I said was that this section confines grants to people who can show to the satisfaction of the Minister that they speak Irish habitually.  What I am saying is that it does not matter who builds the chalets in the Gaeltacht.  If an Englishman came here and built 20 <Col N="174" /> chalets, that would be a service and it is the building of the chalets that is important and the provision of accommodation for people who want to learn Irish.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonKissane" hpid="Éamon Ó Ciosáin Éamon Ó Ciosáin">
      <NameTxt>Éamon Ó Ciosáin</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree with that suggestion at all.  I think the contention that those applying for a grant under this Bill should be Irish speakers should be strictly adhered to. It is here in Section 4:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Where, in the case of a person who is ordinarily resident in an area which is one of the areas for the time being determined to be Gaeltacht areas by order under Section 2 of the Ministers and Secretaries (Amendment) Act, 1956 (No. 21 of 1956), and who proposes to erect in any of the said areas a holiday chalet, such person shows to the satisfaction of the Minister that the Irish language is the language habitually used by him, the Minister may, in his discretion but subject to the provisions of this Act and the provisions of the regulations made by the Minister thereunder, make to such person a grant (in this Act referred to as a holiday chalet building grant) towards the erection of the chalet and the grant shall not exceed £200 or one-half of the estimated cost of the chalet (whichever is the less).</P>
      <P>There it is.  There is no doubt about that section and I am fully in agreement with its provisions.  I would ask the Minister to make sure that the provisions of the section will be strictly adhered to, that the benefits of this measure will go to the people living in the Gaeltacht, to the Irish speakers in the Gaeltacht and nobody else.</P>
      <P>There is just one question that I want to ask about what are described as &ldquo;brúanna&rdquo;.  The equivalent in English would be &ldquo;hostels&rdquo;.  There is a grant being provided under this Bill up to £5,000.  I take it that the grant will be available only to public bodies and I wonder if&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Senator Ó Ciosáin, I welcome this Bill, but perhaps for rather different reasons.  I join with him in drawing attention to the need to assist people in parts of our country which happen to be more underdeveloped than other parts.  What this measure attempts is to give assistance to people who need special assistance, more than the general body of the community, to build houses for themselves and also to provide accommodation for the tourist trade.  That is very good because these areas are tending, as far as we know, to become underpopulated. I was wondering why similar treatment could not be given to other areas in the country which are also becoming depopulated rapidly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I noticed recently that a deputation from Leitrim&mdash;Senator O'Reilly's county&mdash;drew the Government's attention to their plight in that county.  They showed that emigration figures were higher there than in any other county.  Some time subsequently, I noticed, in answer to a question in the Dáil, that the appropriate Minister gave details of the numbers of schools which were closed in various counties and again Leitrim happened to be the one which had the greatest number closed because the children were not there to fill them.  I think it is only <Col N="176" /> proper that public assistance should be given to areas which need assistance and I quite agree that Gaeltacht areas need the assistance which the Minister is asking for in this Bill.  He and the Government should also consider affording the same type of assistance to other areas equally in need of assistance. After all, the people in those areas are all Irishmen, whether they come from Cork, Galway, Donegal, Mayo or even Dublin.</P>
    <P>I would also ask the Minister&mdash; perhaps this would be more appropriate on the Committee Stage&mdash;to tell us what is a chalet.  It is not defined in the Bill.  I think that the Minister, when he introduces a new term into legislation, would be prudent to define what that term means and put the definition into the Bill.</P>

    <P>Isé an príomh-riachtanas saol príobháideach na ndaoine féin a fheabhsú.  Is ceart don Rialtas bheith <Col N="177" /> cúramach agus imníoch é sin a thabhairt chun críche.  Tá cuid mhór déanta cheana féin agus ní maith an rud é dearmad a dhéanamh air.  Tá réabhlóid i gcúrsaí tithe déanta le leathchéad blian.  Deineadh a lán faoin sean Bórd na gCeantracha gCúng, ach na tithe a dheineadar sin, níor criochnaíodh go ceart agus go h-iomlán iad. Má déantar le cuid mhór des na tithe sin anois, seomra nó dhó a chur leo, uisce agus córachas sláinte agus compóird a chur ionntu cuirfidh sé feabhas mór ar na tithe sin atá ann cheana féin.  Mar tá na foirgintí sásúil go leor agus tá siad ina seasamh fós. Is trua a rá gur féidir le haon duine a ghabhann trén cheanntar a thabhairt fé ndeara go bhfuil faillí déanta ar mhaisiú na tithe seo.  Go minic, tá plaistéar na tithe ag tuitim amach idir clocha na bhfallaí, agus nithe eile mar sin.</P>
    <P>Do thaithnigh go mór liom an ní a dúirt an Seanadóir Ó Ciosián, gur cóir agus gur gá, b'fhéidir, daoine a chur i measc na ndaoine chun iad do ghríosadh chun feidhm a bhaint as téarmaí an Bhille seo agus saoráidí a sholáthair dóibh féin a dhéanfadh maisiú ar an saol atá acu.  Mholfainn é sin go léir, mar is dóigh liom gur gá an teagasc sin a thabhairt.</P>
    <P>Tá mé ag caint go dtí seo anois ar na gná-thithe ag an ngná-mhuintir agus a riachtanaí atá sé feabhas a chur orthu san agus barr-mhaisiú a chur ar a saol.  Is féidir leis na sean daoine, a bhí ins na tithe cheana féin, feabhas a chur leo le na sleachtú.</P>
    <P>Maidir leis na chalets, is maith an smaoineamh é.  Isé an gnáth-thuiscint ag na daoine le chalet, pé scéal é, go mbeadh sé in a thígh breise, go mbeadh sé in a thigh cónaithe do lucht chuarda nó lucht chiureadh, fiú amháin.  Is maith go mbéidís ann ach tagann an cheist isteach anois: cé hiad go mba chóir go mbeadh an t-údarás acu feidhm a bhaint as téarmaí an Bhille seo chun chalets do thógáil.</P>
    <P>Arís, tá mé ar aon fhocal go láidir leis an Seanadóir Ó Ciosáin gur le lucht Gaeilge iad agus nár ceart go mbeadh aon bhogadh as an smaoineamh ag an Roinn, ag an Rialtas nó ag pé údarás atá ann; mar is furust a thuiscint dá bhféadfadh daoine <Col N="178" /> Gallda airgead d'fháil chun cabhrú leo chalets beaga do thógáil thiar, ar an gcósta, nó in aice le h-áit álainn éigin ins an Ghaeltacht, do thabhairidís fé iad féin, agus ná béadh ins na chalets sin ach láthair Béarla agus Galldachais gach aon saoire.  Tá an coinníoll seo sa mBille agus ní dóigh liom gur ceart chur isteach air.</P>
    <P>Maidir leis an tríú rud, na brúanna nó hostels, is áirithe liomsa gurb é an cuspóir a bhí in aigne an Aire agus an Rialtais, nuair a cheapadh an deontas san, gur ar son na Gaeilge a chuirfí a leithéide sin ar bun, go mbéadh coiste nó cumann éigin ann agus gurb é a gcúram agus a gcuspóir an Gaeilge a chur chun chinn nó a theagasc no chun caidreamh soisialta a dhéanamh trén Ghaeilge, gur chuige sin a bhféidís ann agus nár chalets do dhaoine priobháideacha a bheadh ann in aon chor.</P>
    <P>Ba cheart go núsáidfí iad ar son cuspóir atá laistiar an Bhille ar fad, sé sin, leas na Gaeilge, úsáid na Gaeilge, eolas na Gaeilge a thabhairt do dhaoine agus caidreamh na Gaeilge mar ghnáth-theanga agus mar ghnáth-chleachtadh i measc roinnt éigin den phobal atá againn, go mór mór lucht chuarda don Ghaeltacht, chun sleacht a chur ar a gcuid Gaeilge. D'fhéadfaidh mac-léinn tamall a chaitheamh, gan trácht ar an riail nua atá beartaithe le scrúdú an Árd-Teastais, chun, an cumas agus an oilteacht cainte sin d'fháil a bheidh riachtanach dóibh.</P>
    <P>Tá súil agam nach ar an Ard-Teastas amháin a bheidh an ní sin ag obair ach go leathnófar amach go dtí Teastasaí eile é agus go dtí an Bunoideachas fé dheireadh, agus go dtí lucht oiliúna ollscoileanna fhéin.  Tá a fhios ag daoine go ndéanfadh sé maitheas do chuid mhór acu sin.</P>
    <P>Pé scéal é, molaim an Bille seo agus is dóigh liom gur rud tábhachtach é. Is dóigh liom go gcuirfidh sé in iúl do lucht na Gaeltachta nach bhfuil dearmad ar fad déanta orthu.  Cuirfidh sé in iúl rud eile, gur gá dóibh féin bheith múscailte maidir le spiorad agus dúil agus gníomh.  Ba mhaith liom go ndéanfaí teagasc dóibh ionnas go gcuirfidís orthu féin bheith gníomhach, bheith mórtasach agus <Col N="179" /> bheith oilte i gcúrsaí a bhaineann le leathnú na Gaeilge agus chun an pobal a dhíriú chun é usáid i gcoitinn.</P>

      <P>Ar an gcéad dul síos, ba mhaith liom a rá go bhfuilim fíor bhuíoch don tSeanad toisc go raibh siad chomh báidhiúil leis an mBille seo.  Is cúis athas dúinn an moladh a fuaireamar an seo indhiú.  Is léir, mar admhuionn na Seanadóirí go bhfuil fiúntas sa mBille seo agus tá dochas agam go rachaidh sé chun tairbhe mhuintir na Gaeltachta.</P>
      <P>Is é an chuspóir is mó sa mBille seo ná an tionscal cuairtíochta a chur ar aghaidh sa nGaeltacht agus í a chur ar fáil do na daoine ann.  Is é mo thuairim féin, as ucht na tograí atá sa mBille, go mbeidh seans ag muinntir na Gaeltachta nach raibh acu riamh cheana agus is é sin cuairteoirí a mhealladh insteach san nGaeltacht.</P>
      <P>Tá fhios agam go bhfuil suim mhór ag daoine sa Ghaeltacht san tograí sa mBille seo chomh maith le daoine laismuigh de.  Tá áthas orm a rá go bhfuaireamar moltaí ó mhórán daoine go bhfuil suim acu sa Ghaeilge agus, freisin, tabharfaidh siad pé cabhair is féidir leo chun cuspóirí an Bhille do chur ar aghaidh.</P>
      <P>As far as the points made by the different Senators are concerned, perhaps I should deal first with what I call the ordinary provisions dealing with ordinary housing under the Bill. Senators will see that, under these provisions, very generous grants are being given for new houses and for improvement grants, and also for the modernisation of existing houses by way of providing bathrooms, sewerage and water, where necessary.  They all fit in with the main object we have as far as these proposals are concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the chalet provisions, may I emphasise the matter from the point of raising the economic standard of the people in the Gaeltacht?  It is very difficult indeed in these backward places to get something that has a hope of surviving from a business point of view.  What I mean by that is that, due to the long distances Gaeltacht areas are situated from railway stations, and so on, the cost of transport, as far as locating industry in these isolated areas <Col N="180" /> is concerned, would generally be prohibitive. Therefore, one could not expect&mdash;except possibly for some particular industry in respect of which the raw material was available there on the spot&mdash;to make much headway in that direction.</P>
    <P>The one industry that has made progress, not alone here but in every country with isolated backward areas, is the tourist industry.  That is equally true about the Highlands of Scotland and the isolated parts of Austria up from the valley of the Inn.  Where they have set out to cater for tourism there, it has left a permanent mark on their economy.  I have no doubt that if full advantage is taken by the people of the Gaeltacht of this Bill it can have a very dramatic effect on their economic life.</P>
    <P>Under the chalet provisions, they are entitled to three chalets.  As far as the first chalet is concerned, they are entitled to get a grant of half the cost or up to £200 and a loan of up to £200.  The reason I differentiated between the first chalet and the others in respect of which money will be provided on loan is that I consider the first chalet the most important of all. It can have a number of different uses.  As I said in the Dáil, it can be used as a dower house.  From the social point of view, particularly in Gaeltacht areas and also in congested areas, there has been much easaointeas between the young man or the young woman who gets married and the old people of the house. Under these provisions, the first chalet can be used either by the young people, if they want to settle down and marry there, or by the old people.</P>
    <P>The second use is, where they have a good house themselves in places like Cois Fairrge or other places in the Gaeltacht, that they can move to the chalet and let the house that is well-equipped, having been served by water, sewerage facilities and with a bathroom, and so on.  They can let it to the visitors.  In the third place, they can let the first chalet.  They are entitled to put up two more or at least to get money on loan under this scheme from my Department for two further chalets for the purpose of letting.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="181" /> While I emphasise that this chalet scheme is just the general outline of a national scheme for tourism in the Gaeltacht, once we have the accommodation there we shall be coming in with a number of other smaller schemes that will fit in with our main objective.  It is my intention, for instance, where fresh-water fishing is available in a Gaeltacht area, to bring in schemes to promote angling there and thus enable the people with chalets to get in on a potential tourist market from February until September. In every other case&mdash;and the whole of the Fíor Ghaeltacht areas will qualify under this Bill&mdash;it is true to say that the one thing they have in these areas is a general wealth of scenery, in most instances, beside the sea.  They have these natural advantages which have never been exploited and which, to my mind, make these areas eminently suitable for bringing at least a full national slice of the tourist cake to these people.</P>
    <P>In respect of some of the suggestions that have been made here&mdash;I think it was by Senator Ó Cíosáin&mdash;that local organisations should be encouraged to take full advantage of the provisions of the Bill, I am glad to say we have already got many suggestions on similar lines from many bodies interested in the language movement and in the provisions of this Bill.  They have volunteered their full help in any type of promotion organisation of that kind.</P>
    <P>It is also possible, and indeed I believe it is quite feasible, that when we get the accommodation there, we can have an organisation or a centre in the cities that will channel the kind of people we want down to these areas where these chalets are being provided. I should like to point out to Senator O'Quigley that the sole purpose of the provisions of this Bill is to provide not only for the people within limistear na Gaeltachta but also the people who realise the value of the Irish language and are prepared to speak it in their own homes.  Indeed, it would be difficult to justify, from the taxpayers' point of view, the provision of benefits of this kind, for people who are not concerned with the preservation of the Gaeltacht, and who are not <Col N="182" /> themselves prepared to use the language and to promote it in Gaeltacht areas.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Quigley may not have seen this possibility, that unless I worded Section 4 in the way I did word it, that chalets will go to people who are ordinarily resident in Gaeltacht areas, plus those I am satisfied use the Irish language habitually, it would leave this scheme wide open to all kinds of abuses.  Some merchant prince from Dublin, who possibly would not know the Irish language, might come down and look for a chalet at the expense of the Gaeltacht.  It would also leave it open to other promoters&mdash;shall I call them?&mdash;of tourism, in different parts of the country, to take benefits under this Bill, the object of which is to help the people who are living in the Gaeltacht, not only to promote tourism for them but to provide an income for them.  If a man in the Gaeltacht has two or three chalets, he will get a reasonable rent for them, and indeed the increase in income might run into £100 or £150 a year, and it would make a tremendous impact on the standard of living both of himself and his family.</P>
    <P>The point was made that chalets are not defined in the Bill.  I suppose, strictly speaking, that is true, but we may and will have regulations just as we now have regulations as to the type of plans that we approve in respect of housing which is administered by my Department.  We shall have similar regulations so far as the chalets are concerned, in respect of their requirements, measurements and so on.  They will have to be approved by the officials of my Department before a grant will be sanctioned.  As a matter of interest, I may say that some Senators may have been at the Spring Show and may have seen the chalet which was on exhibition there.  That, in my opinion, would qualify for a grant.</P>
    <P>So far as the bruanna or hostels are concerned, as Senator Ó Siochfhradha rightly surmised, they will probably be provided for students in connection with the language movement.  What we have in mind is that where there are worthwhile committees, those <Col N="183" /> responsible can avail of this provision. We also have in mind that the different communities which run schools may find it advisable to bring a certain number of their students down to the hostels during the summer months.  Not only would they be under supervision but they would get the benefit of the practice of the spoken language and in that way help the language cause.</P>
    <P>I should also mention that I introduced some time ago a scheme for helping with the provision of secondary education, which is very badly needed, in the Gaeltacht.  We are making some progress, and if we do not provide secondary education in the Gaeltacht, we will not get the raw material to come to the universities and eventually fill the posts in the Gaeltacht which it is desirable to have filled by native speakers.  The development of secondary education is going ahead in the Gaeltacht.  It may be quite useful and helpful to have power of this kind to provide hostels where they may be necessary in that connection.  It was never intended by me nor was it the intention of the Department that a single individual should get £5,000 from the Roinn for his own use, for the building of a hostel of his own, under the section.</P>
    <P>Senator Murphy welcomed the Bill and expressed the view that it might be a good thing if its terms could be applied elsewhere.  So far as I am concerned, I am trying to look after one part of the country for which I am responsible so I cannot express any opinion on that.</P>

      <P>I still think a definition of the word chalet might be necessary because some of those houses which will be constructed might subsequently be neglected and become more like sheds.  To my mind, chalets are wooden structures and I cannot imagine a wooden structure on the western seaboard.  Structures of tiles, concrete or masonry might subsequently be neglected and become eyesores, so a definition of the chalet type of building would still be necessary. To my mind, one of the things necessary in those areas is plenty of lime-wash. I have travelled through many parts of the country and I have heard many comments on the lack of lime-wash.</P>

      <P>I should like Senators to advert to the fact that grants and loans of £200 are contemplated in this Bill, which, in turn, means that it is the building of a type of chalet which could be erected for that amount that is contemplated.  Needless to say, the housing and engineering officials in my Department will lay down certain specifications as to the type of chalets and as to the space which must be available in order to qualify for these grants.  It may be that in time some of the people in the Gaeltacht areas, in order to attract possibly a better and wealthier customer, may put up more elaborate chalets.  The more elaborate they are, the better we shall like it, but our help is confined to what is laid down in this Bill.  I do not think there is any necessity to put in any further definition because it would be impossible to put in a definition to cover every type of holiday building.  If the specifications to be laid down are left to the officials of my Department, Senators need not worry.</P>

Nevertheless, we are asked to pass it in a few minutes and I do not think it is right.  There is the argument that benefits will accrue but the benefits ought to accrue intelligently and we ought to make the benefits as good as we can make them by giving some consideration to them.  Therefore, the Bill should be discussed on Committee Stage.  There are several points I wish to raise because this happens to be a matter I know something about.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Minister for Local Government (Mr. Blaney) Neil T. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Blaney)</NameTxt>
      <P>Under this Bill it is proposed to supplement the income of the Road Fund so that the more important and urgent road works necessitated by two recent developments may be financed.  A number of branch railway lines have had to be closed as being uneconomic and the extra bus and lorry traffic thus brought upon the roads requires immediate improvements of the roads concerned.  These cannot be carried out with the necessary expedition by the aid of the road grants normally allocated to the counties in question as other roads have already a prior claim on those grants.  It was decided, therefore, to give special grants to these road authorities.</P>
      <P>The second development has arisen where a major industrial undertaking has created a considerable increase in road traffic and given rise to a need for major road improvements on a scale which the road authority would be unable to deal with on the basis of their existing grant allocations.</P>
      <P>The extra finances required for these two classes of road improvement schemes could not be made available from the normal resources of the Road Fund, in view of its existing commitments. It has, therefore, been decided to supplement the Fund by £2 million, spread over a period of 5 years, half of it to be a free grant and half repayable to the Exchequer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This should enable the more pressing road problems arising under the two heads I have mentioned to be <Col N="187" /> dealt with, provided that the grants are limited to roads affected by recent railway closings and to public roads serving major industrial undertakings where acute road problems have arisen.  In both classes of cases the road problems involved must be so substantial that they cannot be dealt with under the road authority's normal grant allocations.</P>
    <P>Subject to the passing of the necessary legislation, provision had already been made in my Department's Estimate for the first year's free grant of £200,000 to the Road Fund, and on the same basis I have advised a number of councils of my acceptance of proposals for grants under the scheme.  Five county councils have been advised that they may prepare five-year schemes to deal with roads affected by railway closings.  Six have been informed that schemes may be prepared to deal with public roads serving industrial developments.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the Seanad.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOQuigley" hpid="Mr. O'Quigley Mr. O'Quigley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is obviously one the introduction of which has been necessitated by the closing down of certain branch railways. Indeed, it is precisely what some people on this side of the House said would arise as a result of the powers given to Coras Iompair Éireann to close down branch railways under the Transport Acts.  It does appear to be a logical development from that act of the Oireachtas that in certain circumstances C.I.E. should close down certain branch railways as not being paying propositions.  For that reason, we cannot have any reasonable objection to the introduction of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It does strike me, however, that thought might be taken by the Minister and the local authorities with regard to the expenditure of money on main roads.  As far as I can see, the general view of the motoring public, no less than the pedestrian, is that there seems to be a terrible amount of money being wasted on the creation of highways to produce the result that a person can do a journey of 120 or 150 miles in 20 minutes less time, with resultant great risk to life <Col N="188" /> and limb on the way.  If the money to be allotted under this Bill is to be contributed towards that kind of development it is not one that I would encourage.</P>
    <P>There is another matter which arises on this Bill, that is, the expenditure of money on roads in rural areas.  I have been delighted to see that in some counties in the rural parts of Ireland all the roads are being tarred and that the rural people have now as good roads serving them as those on the major or county roads.  That is a development which should be encouraged. It is due to the people of rural Ireland that money should be spent on improving roads in country districts rather than the creation of speedways out of the existing trunk and main roads.</P>
    <P>In the years since the war ended, the number of motor cars acquired by farmers and others resident in rural Ireland has increased out of all proportion. Consequently, those people are paying road taxation and are entitled to expect that an increased amount of the money being taken from them in taxation should be spent upon the roads in rural Ireland.  I hope that will be the policy.  Apart from these observations and provisos, I have nothing to say on this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCarter" hpid="Mr. Carter Mr. Carter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carter</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to endorse some of the points made but I disagree entirely with the assertion that main roads are given too much attention. That is not a fact.  While local authorities are making every effort to make and maintain main roads, the main roads in the midlands are not all that is to be desired and with the increasing volume of traffic, some of them are deteriorating rapidly.  The main road from Dublin to the Midlands is mostly undulating ground and will require a good deal of attention in the immediate future, because of the amount of heavy lorry traffic it will bear, due to the closing down of uneconomic branch lines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The argument that county roads are being neglected because of the development of main roads is not strictly correct.  The Minister has stated that six local authorities have been instructed <Col N="189" /> to begin programmes, and in that connection I would press the claims of Longford as a county through which all the heavy traffic to the north-west and west passes.  This imposes a heavy strain on our main roads, but we are not being considered for a grant under this Bill.  However, I am hopeful the Minister will consider our county in the near future. We are a small county with a large main road mileage to maintain.  We cannot say we have had any branch lines closed down, but due to the closing down of the Cavan and Leitrim railway, our roads must bear increased traffic.</P>
    <P>In our county, a penny in the £ on the rates produces only about £620. Due to increased mechanisation, the road programme is increasing generally, but unfortunately it has not the same labour content as it had not the past.  However, we cannot put back the hands of the clock.  Any money spent on the development of main roads is money well spent.  If motor traffic continues to increase as it has increased in recent years, main roads will need all the attention possible, but that does not mean that the county roads will be neglected.  They will not because each local authority has a programme for its county roads that is abreast of the main roads.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>I come from County Westmeath where there is a very heavy strain on the ratepayers to try to keep the main and secondary roads up to a certain standard.  We are in the centre of the country and the majority of the traffic from the west and north-west travels through our county.  The resultant strain on the roads places a heavy strain on the ratepayers, and any relief we can get from the Exchequer will be very welcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister: why close down the branch lines if the Exchequer is to be asked to subsidise the county councils in repairing the main roads?  From the taxpayers' point of view, what is the difference between subsidising the railways and subsidising the roads?  I believe the main roads of the country at present are not able to bear the extra traffic <Col N="190" /> being thrown on them.  It would have been much better had we kept those branch lines open.  The money would be better spent subsidising branch lines than in subsidising roads and throwing extra traffic on them.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator O'Quigley that it would be much better to spend this money improving some of our secondary roads.  I know stretches of road in my county that cost £12,000 per mile.  I claim that is a waste of the ratepayers' and taxpayers' money, and I have said so at Westmeath County Council.  We are making roads for road hogs to travel over at 80 m.p.h. with definitely greater risk to life and limb.  Miles of the road from Mullingar to Dublin are straight, but all of a sudden, you come to a dangerous railway bridge where there is no vision on approach.  I am referring to the bridges at Kilcock, Enfield, Moyvalley, Knead's Bridge and Clonhugh.  The Minister should get in touch with C.I.E. about them. Within the past three years, there have been from six to eight fatal accidents there.</P>
    <P>It will be agreed that the workers will welcome this Bill.  Since the Local Authorities (Works) Act stopped, we know 7,000 fewer people have been employed by local authorities than there were 2½ years ago.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1943" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is helping five counties and County Donegal is getting the biggest piece of the cake, £75,000.  We have, I suppose, in our county of Wexford, the worst roads in Ireland and we cannot get money.  Our county council sent a request to the Minister to receive a deputation.  He did not receive them.  We got a letter from the Department last month saying that the funds were not available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a new bridge in Wexford on the road leading from Gorey to Wexford town and if the ratepayers of the county have to pay for the road to the new bridge, it will impose a heavy burden on the rates, and we cannot get any relief.  After all, it is a new bridge leading to the town of Wexford and there will be a lot of heavy traffic on it.  The Minister just says he has no funds available.  If he has not got the funds, how does he <Col N="191" /> provide these five counties with them? I see that Cavan County Council is getting £45,000; Donegal County Council, £75,000; Leitrim County Council, £40,000; Monaghan County Council, £45,000; and Sligo County Council, £45,000.</P>
    <P>Those counties are getting the money because the railways failed under C.I.E. and, as Senator L'Estrange said, I would prefer to see the railways carrying the heavy traffic.  If we have no railways, we have no transport.  We are dependent on buses.  It is wrong that failures in one Department should cause a lack of funds in another. Money was thrown into the railways and over the next five years, a further £5,000,000 is provided for them, while, at the same time, there is no railway service in those five counties.  The money comes from the taxpayer, whether it comes from the central Government or anywhere else.  I want to say that that sort of spoon-feeding certain counties at the expense of others is wrong.</P>
    <P>Wexford County Council are in a bad position with regard to this new bridge.  That bridge will be a big asset to the town and all the heavy traffic will travel on that road from Gorey, and if it is left to the county council to provide money from the rates, it will create a problem at the next rates meeting.  There is grave dissatisfaction in the county council, ten of the members of which are members of the Fianna Fáil Party.  They are not satisfied with the answer that there are no funds.  I say to the Minister that he must have money because the Government have the food subsidies, the Prize Bond money, and the luxury goods tax, but, at the same time, nobody can get anything out of the Government except the few counties, and the Minister lives in one of those counties.  It is sticking out&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>We had an election in 1944 because the Opposition defeated the Government on the Transport Bill. We were told at that time that the railways would be faster, fares would be <Col N="192" /> cheaper and there would be more employment. What have we today?  We have neither trains nor employment on the railways.  The county councils and the ratepayers have to maintain the servicing of the main roads for heavy haulage and cattle, horses, sheep and pigs are being brought to the markets by lorry which should be carried on the railways which are just rusting away for want of traffic because the Government went into competition with themselves. C.I.E. put lorries on the roads so it was not private enterprise that killed the railways.</P>
      <P>One can see buses which are usually practically empty running through the country alongside the railways.  One seldom sees 32 passengers on a bus and that is all due to mismanagement.  It is all right when the bus is going through the countryside picking up passengers.  The Minister says that £225,000 is being provided, but that is divided between five counties and other counties are starved for want of money.  Wexford County Council should get more because they are entitled to their fair share of the national cake.  Minister, the county council is very dissatisfied with your attitude.</P>

      <P>The discussion on this Bill in the House gives us an opportunity of offering very sincere congratulations to the local authorities and to the Minister's Department for <Col N="193" /> the really extraordinarily good work which has been done on the roads within the past 10 years.  I have to do a fair amount of driving through the country and it is most satisfying to see that, not merely the main roads but also the side roads, are in excellent condition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1943" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamStanford" hpid="Professor Stanford Professor Stanford">
      <NameTxt>Professor Stanford</NameTxt>
      <P>I have gone through Wexford, too, and so far as I could see, there has been an enormous improvement in the roads there. Needless to say, there is still room for improvement.</P>
      <P>Others who also deserve our congratulation are the county engineers. These men have really done an extraordinarily good job on the kind of road they are designing.  They are sensible about it.  They do not think in terms of great wide German main roads.  They are planning roads which add to the scenery and, at the same time, improve our communications. It is a job that needs tact as well as skill, and I think the House will agree with me when I offer them our congratulations.</P>
      <P>I would urge the Minister to do all he can to encourage development on our roads.  There are three very good reasons for spending plenty of money. The first is the obvious one that they are our essential means of communication. The second is that the tourist trade benefits greatly from good roads. I would urge our local engineers and others concerned with design here, too, to consider the character of the country in making our roads.  I would urge them not to think in terms of the straight, speedy roads.  There is a charm in the well designed, safe, winding road, and, personally, I believe the American tourist will ultimately get a great deal more satisfaction from genuine Irish roads than from a kind of make-shift imitation of American roads in our small country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I urge, too, that the condition of a country is judged very largely by the condition of the roads.  There is nothing that increases the prestige of a country more than that visitors should <Col N="194" /> go back to their own countries and say: &ldquo;Irish roads are amongst the best we have travelled on.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>One other aspect of the road problem which has been touched on is the question of employment.  I think employment on the roads is one of the most beneficial forms of employment we can provide.  I have talked to roadmakers on occasions and I believe there is nothing more satisfying to a manual labourer than to work on making a good road.  There is nothing more satisfying to a local man than to be able, when a road is completed, to point to it and say: &ldquo;I had a share in making that road.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Other countries, among them countries behind the Iron Curtain, have made a great deal of roadmaking from the point of view of building up the morale of the people.  We have heard of experiments in Yugoslavia, for example, in which young people voluntarily turned out to build great roads. That has engendered an enthusiasm for other forms of joint enterprise on the part of young people.  I suggest, then, that it is not merely a matter of wages and of providing employment on the roads; it is equally a matter of strengthening our national morale&mdash; the morale of the workers who build the road and of the people who travel over it.  I urge the Minister to do all he can to spend money reasonably but generously on the roads.  To my mind, money spent on making good roads is money well spent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LaurenceJosephWalsh" hpid="Mr. Laurence Walsh Mr. Laurence Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Laurence Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to add my voice in congratulating the Minister and his Department on the wonderful progress made throughout the country in providing good roads. Complaints have been made about some counties getting more money than others.  Naturally it is only to be expected that some counties should get more because in those districts where railways have been closed down, priority must be given to the roads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator O'Quigley pleaded for better services now that there are more cars using the roads.  We all agree with that, but there are other things besides good services to be considered in the improvement of county roads. <Col N="195" /> The first essential is the elimination of dangerous bends.  That is a costly job. It costs more to remove a bend than it does to put a good surface over a considerable length of road.  All these things are taken into consideration by our county engineers.  From my experience&mdash;it is a pretty long one now&mdash; our engineers plan their policy and programme.  At a meeting they ask us to provide so much money when we are considering the estimates.  We consent and we get a grant from the Department.  On the whole, every county is treated fairly equitably in these matters.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>In the midst of all these congratulations to the Minister, perhaps I might be permitted to say a few words in criticism.  The Minister referred to six county councils having been informed that schemes may be prepared to deal with public roads serving industrial developments.  I can understand why one would want a special scheme in relation to the road from Midleton to Whitegate out of which millions of gallons of petrol will be running very shortly.  I do not understand what kind of industrial developments require special roads in other parts of the country.  A kind of light industry one finds in most towns does not require a special road.  I beg leave to question the logic of that statement. I do not know these industrial <Col N="196" /> developments requiring special roads. I have not heard of any; I do not know where they exist.  If that is the justification for the allocation, I beg leave to doubt the equity of it.</P>
      <P>With regard to roads generally, when the last inter-Party Government took office, they found the county roads in a most desperate condition.  One could go down through the centre of Ireland, through Westmeath, Offaly and Leix and one travelled on roads in mud six inches deep.  I travelled over some of them.  They were in an appalling condition. The policy with regard to these roads in the preceding four or five years had been entirely wrong.  An enormous job was done on part of the Naas Road.  Part of it which could have been improved by the removal of six feet of bank was left untouched. The removal of that bank would not have cost a great deal.</P>
      <P>One scheme I have never been able to understand was the removal of the hump or the hollow on the near side of the Curragh.  It took 12 months to do that.  I remember having to take the detour round it during that period. Another piece of work that puzzles me is the removal of a gentle slope which led up to a railway bridge.  That costs quite a good deal.  It does not lead to road safety because when a slope is removed, one can go through at 60 miles per hour.  I do not know why we should constantly bow to those people who want to drive along our roads at 70 or 80 m.p.h.  That can only lead to more fatal accidents.  In the first few years after the road was widened in the Kill area, there were more fatal accidents on it than there had been in previous years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCarter" hpid="Mr. Carter Mr. Carter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carter</NameTxt>
      <P>That is no reason why a road should be left like a cattle track.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>Possibly not, but there are plenty of cattle tracks on some of our county roads.  It was found rather difficult to change the attitude of the Department and the county councils towards the county roads.  As a matter of fact, a good deal of rather objectionable pressure had to be put on the people concerned, the sort of pressure that ought not to have to be used.  I am not exaggerating the <Col N="197" /> position.  I was not personally involved. I have no great interest in it, but I had experience of the roads as I drove along them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>The roads in the smaller counties like Kildare, Louth and so forth are generally better. During the famous West Limerick by-election, we were lucky that the weather was fine; otherwise, we would have been drowned in a sea of mud. I take it the situation there has been improved.  I hope it has.</P>
      <P>The policy of devoting more money to the county roads has been continued. As Senator Stanford has said, people coming in here do not want great wide roads.  One can travel from the North to the South in one day.  I do not know anyone who wants to travel faster than that.  One can go down to Cork in the evening, do one's business the next day and return home that night.  It is only right that more money should be allocated to the county roads.  If that policy is continued over a period of years, the problem of the county roads will be solved.  Once one puts a good surface on a county road, it lasts a good deal longer than the same surface on a main road carrying heavy traffic.  I am not to be taken as opposing improvement schemes, when necessary, but some of the improvement schemes seemed to me to suggest the drawing of lines through maps.  With the limited resources we have, it seemed to me that that sort of thing resulted in undue expenditure on a limited part of our total mileage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Otherwise, so far as the Bill is concerned, I do not see any objection to it.  It increases the amount of money to be made available for road work by <Col N="198" /> way of grants and advances to the Road Fund.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Some of the views expressed by Senators were far removed from the terms of the Bill but they were of such importance nevertheless that I feel I should deal with them to some extent.  Senator O'Quigley and others took the view that we were generally being rather wasteful in our spending on main roads and that these moneys were being spent mainly for the purpose of speed and that this was something we should not seek.  I disagree with the assertion that money is being wasted but I certainly agree with the second assertion that for speed alone&mdash;it very often leads to greater danger&mdash;we would not be justified in spending large sums of money.</P>
      <P>Another point that seemed to run through the speeches of many Senators is that too much is being spent on main roads and not enough on county roads.  In that connection, I should draw the attention of the Seanad to the fact that approximately £1,000,000 was earmarked for main roads this year and for the past few years, whereas for county road improvement, maintenance and so on, £2.4 million was the figure.  The amount going to county roads from the Road Fund is almost two and a half times the amount allocated to main roads.  So far as these large jobs are concerned, these jobs that seemed unnecessary to Senator O'Donovan, such as the one in Kildare and perhaps in other places, while I agree with him to some extent, I should like to go into the details of the various jobs of that kind that were done and I would need to give them complete examination before I could really say whether or not they were justified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been so much concerned about that matter however, that since I became Minister for Local Government, I have gone out of my way to convey to local authorities, county engineers and all who have to deal with those schemes that I did not look with favour on grandiose schemes undertaken for the sake of being grandiose.  In fact, we have sent out a special circular on that subject, drawing the attention of local authorities <Col N="199" /> to that aspect of the matter and also leaving it to the elected representatives on local authorities&mdash;which was not the case in the past&mdash;to consider and reject such schemes or to furnish to my Department alternative proposals to those put up by county engineers where they thought the latter proposals were not justified.  The alternative proposals are given a full examination by my officers who deal with such matters, and where a case is made by the elected representatives contrary to that put forward by the county engineer, I am afraid that, as an elected representative myself and having been an elected member of a local authority, I shall hold with the elected representatives oftener than with the official view.  That may not always be right but that is how my mind works on this matter.  We have taken very definite steps to try to rectify the situation, if rectification is required.</P>
    <P>An interim measure has been introduced pending the results of an examination now being carried out in my Department on this problem of the amount of money spent on county roads <i>versus</i> main roads.  We have laid down as an interim measure certain new regulations&mdash;or departures, if you wish&mdash;that local authorities may adopt, if they so desire.  If the county road situation is such that there is a very low mileage of dust-free roads, which are tantamount to tarred roads, there is provision, as stated in a circular sent to local authorities, whereby they can transfer, with the sanction of the Department, part of the main road allocation to county roads.  That is purely an interim arrangement while we are examining the entire position. We are, in fact, faced with the prospect of reclassifying a number of our roads&mdash;it may well be that that will have to be done&mdash;but in the interval&mdash; and the job may take a considerable length of time, as Senators will appreciate&mdash;we have made this temporary arrangement which, I think, makes for flexibility as between county and county and there is no longer that strict adherence to uniformity that was formerly part and parcel of the grants given for main and county road improvement.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="200" /> The question put by Senator L'Estrange was: &ldquo;Why should I close branch lines?&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>No; I did not ask why the Minister should close them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, the question was rather directed to me and if I should take it on myself to answer it, it would be to say that naturally my Department has no function in the closing of branch or other railways. The Senator went on to ask why we should subsidise roads rather than railways.  That is a very big question and I think it has engaged the attention of, I suppose, the best brains in the country over a number of years.  I think the result has been that more railways have been closed since the people with brains sat down to see what is economic and what is not.  I shall not dispute the wisdom of closing those lines, but I might say from my own small knowledge of these matters that not only were some of these lines losing substantial sums of money annually, but they were also approaching the point at which an immense amount of money would be required to keep them in a safe condition for further traffic.  Not only did we face the loss incurred in general working but also the renewal of certain stretches of these lines which, as far as I can understand, would have meant, at least in some cases, a far greater burden than we are now asked to meet in regard to roads that will substitute for those closed lines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Other Senators argued on much the same points in regard to the closing of these lines, but in some cases it must be remembered lines were closed, not by persons on this side of the Border, but by the Six County Government.  Unfortunately, we had no control over these lines and in some cases the closing of lines on our side of the Border was consequential on the closing of Six County railway lines.  The whole question of the rightfulness or otherwise of the closing of branch lines is something we really cannot discuss now.  These lines that were closed were losing money; the permanent way in some cases was in a <Col N="201" /> dangerous condition and a great amount of money would be required to restore it to normal condition; and even when that had been done there was no prospect that it would then pay.  We must face the fact that these lines have been closed and undoubtedly will remain so.  We have seen the last of them and we must do the best we can without them by making our roads suitable to carry the additional traffic.</P>
    <P>The question of dangerous bridges in Westmeath, on the road through Enfield and on down there, was raised by Senator L'Estrange.  I should say that in regard to the four or five bridges mentioned by him certain consideration is already being given to them and plans are in hands for some of them.  The big difficulty which the local authority has found in regard to most of these is to get the rights of way on the lands adjoining them.  To do these things, as Senators know, does not appear to be a big job, but it very often turns out to be a lengthy one.  We are there to help, but in all cases the initiative must come from the local authority.  It is not the practice of the Minister for Local Government or his officials to go down the country and root out these people and say: &ldquo;There is a bridge to which you must attend.&rdquo; Generally, they get on with the bridges themselves.</P>
    <P>In practically every case, we give substantial grants for the reconstruction of bridges and we shall continue to do that.  We hope to remedy many of these dangerous bridges many of which, as has been remarked, are situated between good stretches of straight road.  We are not neglecting them, nor are the local authorities being in any way slow in the matter.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Donovan raised the question of the six counties where we have informed the county councils that they can prepare schemes under the heading of roads to serve industrial undertakings and I gathered he rather doubted that there were six such in the country. I think the Senator has already recalled the Whitegate one himself and there are also the Shannon Airport road, the <Col N="202" /> Arigna Coal Mines road, the Avoca Copper Mines Road and the Gypsum Mine road in Cavan, on the Monaghan border.  Those in fact take in the six. If there are others, and I hope there will be, so much the better.  If we get sufficient of these scattered throughout the country, our least trouble will be finding moneys for the roads to serve them.</P>
    <P>In regard to the general criticism by another Senator that so much money is going to my own county and to counties north of the line, I can only say&mdash;in addition to what I have said already about Six-County lines being closed, with consequent closures on our side&mdash;that, in the main, those counties, if not poor counties, have a valuation of such size that one penny would not bring in much money and their rates are generally above average and any additional large draw on money, such as in this case, would impose an impossible burden on them.  In addition to that, this case has been made by those counties since as far back as 1952.  In my own county, with the promised closing of certain lines in the offing, we hammered this case from 1952.  Sligo, Leitrim, Monaghan and Cavan have been doing likewise.  The fact is whoever is pinched most usually squeals most.  That I think is the case and it can be proved in this instance.</P>
    <P>Those were the counties pinched most and which saw the greatest hardship in replacing railways with roads. Also in 1952, in my own county, a special transport committee was set up and the general direction in which that committee was pushing in those days was in the direction of the Department of Industry and Commerce whose responsibility the closing of railway lines must be mainly.  Eventually, the matter crystallised in the general direction of the Department of Local Government which was responsible for roads and we came to this point.  The fact that those five counties benefited is not due to the fact that I come from one of them, or that I pass through those counties very frequently.  It is due to their efforts to make a worthwhile case, which they did make.  If they are now getting these funds it was not only because of their case but <Col N="203" /> because we knew the plight in which they were going to be placed and the likelihood of some of their road systems breaking down entirely, if nothing were done about them in the very near future.  That is my answer to why these grants seem to be in the one direction at the moment.</P>
    <P>In regard to Senator Stanford and Senator Walsh, it was indeed refreshing to hear, from two speakers at any rate, congratulations to the road makers of this country and some recognition of the fact that without doubt&mdash;no matter what may be our view of certain local roads&mdash;unless we do not want to admit it, our road system has been improving continuously.  We hope that that progress will go on until we have not only good county and main roads but adequately dust-free tarred surfaces on our country road system as well.</P>
    <P>The general impression to be gained from some Senators is that we are just not doing enough about these matters and that we should provide more money.  Undoubtedly, I should like to give every county in the Twenty-Six Counties a similar amount of money as is given to the five counties in question, but it remains that despite the fact that there will be an increase, and has been an increase in the recent past, in the amount of taxation money collected, our grants must remain for some time in the future at the same figure, that is around the figure of £5,000,000.  It may well be asked why we are not able to increase the allocations when we are getting greater revenue, but the position is rather difficult.  The commitments already made on the Road Fund are substantial and due to those commitments, and to debts which we are committed to pay, and are trying to pay off, we cannot foresee any worthwhile increase in the general grant allocation for a number of years ahead.</P>
    <P>To pinpoint the position, the commitment in 1954 for the Road Fund was £1.8 million.  By 1957, three years later, it had risen to £4.18 millions.  In order to bolster up the situation and to get us out of our difficulties in that year, a special subvention from the <Col N="204" /> Exchequer of £9,000,000 had to be paid into the Fund and even then, despite the increase in the revenue, our commitments were still £3,250,000. Much as we should like to, we cannot give any substantial increases, or hold out the hope that the State will be able to afford increases in the general grants to councils, within the next few years.</P>

      <P>I want to ask the Minister a question.  His Department sent a circular to Wexford County Council offering so much money to take over a bridge.  The council believed that the offer was unnecessary and that the money would be wasted. The money, which was about £18,000, was taken back and I wonder if the Minister could now transfer that money to the roads in Wexford.</P>

I think this matter only goes to prove what I have said&mdash;that we are open to the wishes of any council. Where a council thinks that a job would be wasteful spending or where they do not want to accept the money, we are not going to push it down their throats.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Minister for Local Government (Mr. Blaney) Neil T. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Blaney)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to remove a special restriction on the building of bridges over the River Shannon.  Where a bridge over navigable water has to be reconstructed, the general procedure is that a public inquiry is held into the merits of the particular solution proposed.  Following the inquiry, the Minister for Local Government makes a bridge order, but the consent of the Minister for Industry and Commerce is required; he is the Minister concerned with navigation interests.  In the case of the River Shannon the Commissioners of Public Works must be consulted also, in their capacity as Shannon Navigation Commissioners. Navigation interests in the case of the Shannon are therefore amply protected by these requirements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It sometimes happens that, where there is an existing opening span, the best engineering solution is a new fixed span which will give adequate clearance for navigation.  This is at present prevented, in the case of the Shannon, by the Local Government Act, 1955, which was amended to that effect at the Committee Stage in the Dáil.  In the case of Athlone bridge the local inquiry showed that the proper solution on engineering and economic grounds is a fixed bridge.  The proviso in the Act of 1955, however, obliged the Minister for Local Government to make a bridge order providing for a new opening span.  This would be more costly and difficult to provide. <Col N="206" /> The Westmeath county council and other local bodies have protested against the position thus created and have urged the enactment of the legislation now before the Seanad.  County councils concerned with other Shannon bridges where there is a <i>prima facie</i> case for a new fixed span also favour the proposed legislation.</P>
    <P>The Bill introduces no new principle in the matter of navigation rights.  It was at one time assumed that the bridge order procedure under Part IV of the Local Government Act, 1946, enabled a bridge to be constructed even if it involved a curtailment of navigation rights.  The original intention of subsection (1) of section 40 of the Local Government Act, 1955, was to put this beyond doubt.  The words excluding the River Shannon were inserted at the Committee Stage in the Dáil.  The restriction is an unreal one, because navigation is already limited on the Shannon by fixed bridges at its entrance and by narrow locks with high cills.  Some of the so-called &ldquo;opening&rdquo; bridges, including Athlone, have not been able to function as such for many years, but they have afforded sufficient clearance to the navigation using the river including pleasure launches.</P>
    <P>In commending the Bill to the Seanad, I can assure them that every consideration will be given to rights of navigation and that there will be no question of a fixed span being provided at a site where the clearance is not adequate for navigation purposes.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned, a bridge order had already been made in the case of Athlone bridge, providing for a new opening span, although a local inquiry had shown that a fixed span would give the same clearance to navigation as the existing bridge had afforded since 1942, when the opening span ceased to function.  Special provision is therefore made for this case in section 2 of the Bill, which proposes to amend the Athlone Bridge Order by providing for a fixed span instead of an opening span.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I should like to stress the urgency of the Bill.  Severe weight restrictions have been imposed <Col N="207" /> in the case of some of the Shannon bridges and reconstruction work is urgently necessary.  The enactment of this Bill will enable work to proceed at once on the design and construction of a relatively simple new span at Athlone, and will enable the necessary steps to be taken for the provision of new permanent spans (fixed or open, as the evidence warrants) at the other sites requiring urgent attention.</P>

      <P>I welcome this Bill. I think it is most necessary that some of the bridges over the Shannon at the present time should be repaired and that nothing should be allowed to stand in the way of repair of these bridges which constitute a great menace to traffic, particularly those bridges where there is a weight limit and a speed limit.  I am fairly familiar with some of these bridges as I pass over them frequently on my way to the west on different routes and I have often thought that they should be widened and made more safe by the provision of fixed spans.  It seems to me that timber structures at the present time, with the weight of lorries and cars, are quite out of date.  I hope the work will be commenced as rapidly as the Minister states.</P>

      <P>This Bill is necessary in order to permit the local authority to erect, as common sense would suggest, a fixed bridge.  Had the Bill of 1955 been allowed to go through as originally drafted, this Bill would not be necessary now; but the then Deputy MacBride insisted on behalf of a pressure group around the town of Athlone, who called themselves the Inland Waterways Association at the time&mdash;and who certainly are not contributing very much to the rates of Westmeath, Longford or any other county&mdash;on putting in an amendment to the 1955 Bill that a swivel bridge be built across the Shannon.  Nobody was in favour of it except the then Deputy MacBride.  He was able to bring sufficient pressure on the Government to induce them to come to the Dáil and bring in an amendment to put an imposition of £100,000 on the ratepayers <Col N="208" /> of five counties in the Midlands.  That is a sufficiently clear indication of the tactics that can be applied by a Deputy who was then a leading light in the Coalition Government.  I objected to it at the time and I had various deputations here from the Westmeath Ratepayers' Associations, especially the Association of South Westmeath, protesting against this imposition.  The people of Athlone and district were up in arms against it.  They can now thank that former Deputy for the inconvenience of having a baileybridge, which is a temporary structure, across the Shannon.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Bill because it will enable the local authority to go ahead with their bridge programme.  Not very long ago, I had a letter from Athlone Urban Council urging that this Bill should be implemented at short notice and urging the representatives of the area to speed its passage through the Houses of the Oireachtas.  Navigation on the River Shannon is a dead duck. It is time Mr. MacBride and his adherents recognised that.  Anyone who wants a mast on a boat that will not pass under a fixed bridge should be obliged to carry a saw with him.</P>

But I should like to say that good roads lose much of their value when they are frustrated by bad bridges, and I should like to ask the Minister when he has done this task of constructing a bridge across the Shannon, could he turn his mind effectively to the bridge across the Barrow in New Ross.  For what seems to me to have been endless years now, we have had to crawl across that bridge at under 10 m.p.h.  It is deplorable&mdash; since this is a main tourist road&mdash;that this road should be frustrated by a thoroughly bad bridge.  I would urge the Minister to do all he can to speed up the rebuilding of that main bridge. It is an eyesore.  It is a danger.  It is a frustration to anyone who wants to make reasonable speed from Dublin to Waterford or from Wexford to Waterford. So, I hope the Minister will not stop at the Shannon but will proceed very soon to cross the Barrow as effectively as the Shannon.</P>

      <P>In so far as the Barrow Bridge is concerned, I understand that Wexford Co. Council have already had some preliminary survey made by a consulting engineer.  I cannot say anything more except that if the matter is brought to our attention by the local authority, we shall try to facilitate the reconstruction or replacement of the bridge, if it is desirable or necessary.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Minister for Local Government (Mr. Blaney) Neil T. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Blaney)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to extend the duration of the Rates on Agricultural Land (Relief) Act, 1953, for a further period of three years commencing on the 1st April, 1959. The 1953 Act provided for the making by county councils of the following allowances by way of abatement of rates to occupiers of agricultural land holdings in rural areas&mdash;(a) a primary allowance of three-fifths of the general rate in the £ on the land valuation up to £20; (b) an employment allowance of £17 for each adult workman at work on the holding during the whole of the preceding calendar year, subject to the limitation that the total of the employment allowance shall not exceed the produce of the general rate in the £ on the valuation over £20.  The 1953 Act applied to the financial years 1953/54 to 1955/56.  An amending Act in 1956 continued the allowances on the same basis for a further period of three years up to 31st March, 1959. The effect of this Bill will be to continue the allowances for the next three years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Legislation dealing with the relief of rates on agricultural land dates back for more than 60 years.  The agricultural grant was first given under the Local Government (Ireland) Act, 1898. <Col N="211" /> The grant has been given each year since, but the basis of its distribution and the amount of the grant were altered on a number of occasions.  Prior to 1946 the amount of the grant was always a sum fixed by each successive Act.  Under the 1946 Act, it was provided that the grant would be the sum needed to give relief on the following basis:&mdash;(1) a primary allowance of three-fifths of the general rate in the £ on the land valuation up to £20; (2) a supplementary allowance of one-fifth of the general rate in the £ on the land valuation over £20; (3) an employment allowance calculated at the rate of 10/- in the £ on the land valuation over £20, subject to the limitation that the allowance should not exceed £6 10 0 for each adult workman at work on the holding during the whole of the preceding calendar year.  The agricultural grant was continued on this basis until the passing of the 1953 Act, which increased the employment allowance, abolished the supplementary allowance, and established the method of distribution which is being continued by this Bill.</P>
    <P>The amount of the agricultural grant has increased from £1,870,000 in 1945/46&mdash;the last year in which the amount of the grant was fixed in advance&mdash;to £4,647,000 in 1952/53&mdash; the year prior to the last revision of the method of distribution&mdash;and to £5,519,075 in 1958/59.  In that year the agricultural grant afforded farmers relief to the extent of 44 per cent. of the rate levy on agricultural land.</P>
    <P>The total payable in 1958/59 was divided as follows:&mdash;Primary Allowance, £4,278,595; Employment Allowance, £1,224,988; amount paid to certain municipal authorities, £15,492, giving a total of £5,519,075.</P>
    <P>The employment allowance is given to rated occupiers in respect of a workman who was at work on the holding during the whole of the calendar year prior to the financial year in which the claim for the allowance was made, and who was otherwise qualified under the Acts.  There is also provision that if two or more men are successively at work on a holding, or are employed in such a way that at all times during the <Col N="212" /> calendar year there is one man at work, such workmen may be regarded as one man at work for the purposes of the employment allowance. It is also provided that every doubt, question and dispute in relation to employment allowance claims shall be determined by the local authority, whose determination shall be final and conclusive.</P>
    <P>The present Bill embodies no new principle.  As I have said already, its object is to continue until 31st March, 1962, the system provided for in the Rates on Agricultural Land (Relief) Act, 1953.</P>

      <P>There is just one question I should like to ask the Minister. He has said that &ldquo;every doubt, question and dispute in relation to employment allowance claims shall be determined by the local authority whose determination shall be final and conclusive.&rdquo;  As I understand the position, there is, not unnaturally I suppose, a difference of treatment as between one local authority and another in regard to the determination of these disputes.  I am wondering whether the Minister is aware of that situation, or if he has in contemplation laying down any kind of rules or issuing any memoranda for the guidance of local authorities which would give some degree of uniformity in relation to these disputes, so that people in one county would not feel aggrieved as compared with people in another county.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>This question of broken time is one to which I am fully alive and I have on several occasions, both by way of reply to Parliamentary Questions and on the occasion of the introduction of the Bill and its passage through the Dáil, given, as clearly and as precisely as I can, the view that we, in the Department of Local Government, have on this matter.  While still adhering to what has been said, that the local authority will be the final <Col N="213" /> arbiter in any dispute arising on the determination of a claim in relation to an employment allowance, we know that there is a difficulty, in that when a workman leaves, it is not possible to press a button and get a replacement. Where the delay in replacement is possibly the cause of the break, I think I have made it clear, and I have said it on several occasions in the past, that that undoubtedly should be taken by the local authority as a fair and justifiable reason and should not debar that person from making a claim.</P>
      <P>The other position that may obtain also is the question of a workman going off ill.  If he says he is ill, I think it would be quite easy to establish that he is, in fact, ill by the procedure of finding out if he is drawing the sickness benefit from the Department of Social Welfare to which he is entitled.  That would be fairly good and substantial evidence that, in fact, the illness is genuine and that his absence is due to that cause.</P>
      <P>However, generally speaking, as I say, we are quite open to give, in any way we can, a lead to the local authorities who, I might say, in their defence, seem to have had a fear of our local government auditors coming along and possibly surcharging them because, as they read the law, if they give these concessions, they are in fact doing something illegal.  I am not aware of any such surcharges having been made, but I know from talks I have had with various Deputies and Senators that that fear of the auditor does exist, or at least is alleged to exist, in the minds of some of these people who are being very strict in their interpretation of the law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said, I am not aware of surcharges having been made, despite the fears that have been expressed by these people in our local authorities. While the fears may be there, if what I have said in the Dáil and here does not now allay those fears to a sufficient degree to give some sort of reasonable approach in this matter, then I do not know what would relieve the situation, other than the passing of some new legislation to take over the determination of claims by the Department. <Col N="214" /> That, I should think, would be fraught with many dangers and would, in fact, be an interference with the autonomy of the local authority in a matter of this kind.</P>
    <P>We have no evidence that surcharges are being made.  Our views in the Department have been expressed both by myself and by my predecessors on a number of occasions.  Where there is a break and where there is reasonable cause for it&mdash;it is not the fault of the farmer; nobody is trying to dodge; and nobody is trying to claim something to which he is not entitled&mdash;a uniformly reasonable approach by the local authority in deciding such claims should be adopted.  In fact, that approach is being adopted in many counties.  There may be a few counties in which there is overscrupulousness and a fear of the auditor possibly.  Perhaps, what I have said now will remove those fears and this scrupulousness.  If anybody has any other suggestions which would help in remedying the situation, I shall be happy to hear them and if there is any particular case I shall be glad to be informed of it.</P>

      <P>This is a routine motion which appears annually on the Order Paper of the Seanad.  As Senators know, the Sugar (Control of Imports) Act empowers the Government to make an order controlling the importation of sugar.  An order has been made every year since that Act was first passed in 1939 limiting the right to import to the Irish Sugar Company.  The order can have duration <Col N="215" /> for one year only; hence it has to be renewed each year and the necessary confirmating motion passed.</P>
      <P>I mentioned in the Dail earlier this afternoon, as a matter of interest, when a similar motion was adopted there, that since the corresponding motion was moved last year, this country has adhered to the International Sugar Agreement.  That was an agreement negotiated under the auspices of the United Nations in 1953 for the purposes of introducing a degree of stability into the world sugar market.  Its effect was to oblige the countries which were parties to that agreement to import only from those countries which were also parties in circumstances in which the price of sugar fell below four cents per lb. and which imposed on them certain quota obligations designed, as I said, to stabilise market conditions.</P>
      <P>In 1953, we decided not to join because it did not seem to us that there was any advantage in membership. It could operate to limit our freedom of choice in the purchase of sugar in circumstances in which that course was necessary, as indeed it was at that time.  The agreement was reconsidered and revised slightly in 1956 but, again, a decision was taken not to join.  Since then, however, we have encountered certain practical disadvantages by reason of our being outside the agreement, particularly in the last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I mentioned that the agreement requires countries that are a party to it to buy only from these countries which are also parties in circumstances where the price of sugar falls below the stipulated price.  In a limited degree, we have now become an exporter of sugar and because of the operations of this agreement, our exports were stopped <Col N="216" /> for a period last year when the price conditions obliged importing countries to buy only from member countries. We decided, therefore, that the advantages were now in favour of joining the agreement.  A new agreement has in fact been negotiated.  It is not substantially different from the old one in its main provisions and it secures for us the right to continue to export to countries which are parties to it, even in circumstances where the world price imposes certain obligations.  The advantage it was thought we would have in 1953 in remaining outside the agreement has in any event disappeared by reason of the fact that all the main exporting countries are now within it.  The position at the moment is that we are producing the entire requirements of the home market from home-grown beet.  After many years of striving, we have now reached that situation.</P>

      <P>Yes.  There is, of course, a substantial export trade in various products in the manufacture of which sugar is used, as well as the exportation of sugar as such.  It is the practice of the Sugar Company having operated their factories at full capacity during the sugar beet season, to import raw sugar in the other periods for refining. The industry is therefore in good shape.  Indeed, the circumstances are such as to permit it to supply sugar to those exporters who require it at the world price so that they are under no commercial disadvantage <i>vis-a-vis</i> the world markets.</P>
