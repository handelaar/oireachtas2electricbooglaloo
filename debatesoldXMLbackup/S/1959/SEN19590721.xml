    <Title>Bankers' Books Evidence (Amendment) Bill, 1959&mdash;Second and Subsequent Stages.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Traynor) Oscar Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Traynor)</NameTxt>
      <P>The object of this Bill is to amend the Bankers' Books Evidence Act, 1879, in certain respects with regard to which attention has been called to the need for amendment by the Irish Banks Standing Committee and in the report of the Committee on Company Law Reform.</P>
      <P>To come within the provisions of the Act of 1879 a bank must either comply with the definition of &ldquo;bank&rdquo; and &ldquo;banker&rdquo; in Section 9 of that Act or comply with the provisions of Section 11 of the Revenue Friendly Societies and National Debt Act, 1882.</P>
      <P>To fulfil these requirements a bank must either have duly made a return to the Revenue Commissioners pursuant to the provisions of Section 22 of the Bankers (Ireland) Act, 1845, or else have duly furnished to the Registrar of Joint Stock Companies a list and summary as required by the second part of the Companies Act, 1862, with the addition of a statement showing the places where it carries on business.  The list referred to is that required by Section 26 of the Companies Act, 1862 (which has been repealed and reenacted by Section 26 of the Companies (Consolidation) Act, 1908) and is a list of members with a summary of the share capital and balance sheet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 22 of the Bankers (Ireland) Act, 1845, expressly absolved the Bank <Col N="313" /> of Ireland from the obligation of making a return thereunder and, since it is not a Joint Stock Company, it has always been excluded from the privileges of the Bankers' Books Evidence Act.  This was never intended and is due to the fact that the special position of the Bank of Ireland was overlooked when the provisions of Section 9 of the Act of 1879 were being framed.  The other banks, that is to say, those which were in existence in 1882 and are still in business were, to begin with, all entitled to the benefits of the Act of 1879 as they were in a position to fulfil one or other of the requirements of the statutory definition.</P>
    <P>However, on the establishment of the State doubts arose as to whether the provisions of the Bankers' Books Evidence Act continued to apply to banks registered in England and Northern Ireland.  These banks no longer furnish the requisite list and summary under the Companies (Consolidation) Act, 1908, which has been repealed in England and Northern Ireland, and have been relieved by subsection (6) of Section 42 of the Currency Act, 1927, from making the return required by Section 22 of the Bankers (Ireland) Act, 1845.</P>
    <P>The advice I have got is that the Act does not now apply to such banks, including such well-known banks as the National Bank, the Northern Bank, the Provincial Bank of Ireland and the Ulster Bank.  Thus, under the law as it stands, no fewer than five of the principal banks carrying on business here, including the Bank of Ireland, are outside the scope of the Bankers' Books Evidence Act.</P>
    <P>It is primarily to put this right that this Bill has been introduced but advantage is being taken of the opportunity to simplify proofs by specifying by name the eight banks mentioned in the Third Schedule of the Central Bank Act, 1942, the Post Office Savings Bank and the Trustee Savings Banks. This will obviate the necessity for proving that the banks specified are banks to which the Bill applies.  A new interpretation is being given to the expression &ldquo;bankers' books&rdquo; which takes account of modern methods of <Col N="314" /> record keeping and of the fact that the old fashioned books and ledgers have been largely dispensed with in the banking business and replaced by loose-leaf filing systems and cards. The statutory enactments which it is proposed to repeal will be rendered obsolete by the enactment of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Bankers' Books Evidence Act, 1879, was designed to relieve bankers from the great inconvenience of having to attend Court and bring with them the books in daily use in their business. To this extent it is an Act for the relief of bankers, but it is also an Act for the benefit of suitors since it enables copies of entries in a banker's book to be given in evidence and facilitates the procuring of such evidence by allowing any party to a legal proceeding to apply to the Court for permission to inspect and to take copies of such entries for the purpose of such proceeding. The object of the Bill is to make the Act work in the way it was intended to work and I commend it to the consideration of the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGuire</NameTxt>
      <P>There is not very much to be said about this Bill, except to say that naturally we agree with it.  I understand that the banks welcome it very much.  As the Minister said, this Act was made some 80 years ago and as one of my colleagues said, it was a pretty good tribute that the legislators of that time were able to make legislation to last that long. The time has now come, however, when it is necessary to bring this legislation into line with modern mechanised banking and that is the reason for this section in regard to loose-leaf ledgers, which of course were not in existence at the time of the original Act, and also to bring the law into conformity with present day conditions and circumstances, as the Minister explained.</P>
      <P>I understand that a great number of difficulties were created in litigation in regard to proof which this Act will now do away with and it will get over difficulties, which were in fact insuperable, in court.  At the same time, no injustice is being done to litigants which is the most important point. Therefore, we welcome this Bill and the banks themselves welcome it very much.</P>

      <P>What Senator McGuire has stated is true; the Bill is one intended to improve a position that has perhaps, I think I would be correct in saying, deteriorated in the course of very many years.  It is a tribute, as the Senator said, to the legislators of a bygone day that the Act has in fact lasted to this period without the necessity for amendment, but as I mentioned in my opening speech, modern methods have to a very great extent made amendment necessary.  In future, instead of bankers having to bring in the big unwieldy ledgers that were used in former times, it will now only be necessary for them to produce copies of the particular accounts in which the suitors are interested.  From that point of view, it will be accepted as evidence in the Courts.  Generally speaking, it is an improvement, certainly from the bankers' point of view and also from the suitors' point of view.  Therefore, I think it is desirable.</P>

      <P>May I ask a question, on the Schedule?  I am not quite sure why the National City Bank does not appear.  Is that because it is a subsidiary of the Bank of Ireland?  I understand it is a bank which has an existence in its own right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>Actually, I think it is due to an oversight rather than that it is a subsidiary of any particular bank.  There is a list of banks and organisations entitled to have a licence and the National City Bank comes within that category.  As a result of having a licence, it will be included. From the point of view of anyone making an application, he has only to prove a certificate of licence and he is <Col N="316" /> in.  It would be better if this bank had been mentioned in the list of banks. Was the Senator thinking of moving an amendment to include the National City Bank?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>I should be prepared to do so.  I thought there may be some technical reason why it was excluded.  It is a bank whose history is closely associated with the growth of our State.  It was once the National Land Bank.  It may not be worth while making the point, provided they get the privilege; but if the Minister is prepared to accept the amendment, I should be glad to propose it.</P>

      <P>I am not sure that I am correct, but I understood there was a change comparatively recently, that within the last couple of years, the position of the National City Bank has changed relative to the Bank of Ireland. It was a comparatively independent entity until some few years ago. I take it it would not make any real difference.  The bank is in by inference under (b), but if in fact its position in relation to the Bank of Ireland has been altered in the last few years, it might be as well to have that point considered.  That could be done if, in accordance with your suggestion, a Chathaoirligh, the Bill is being taken <Col N="317" /> at 7 o'clock.  There will be time to consider it between now and 7 o'clock.</P>

      <Col N="318" /> Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to provide for the establishment, on a day to be appointed by Order by the Government, of a new Department of Transport and Power.  The need to divide up the responsibilities of the Minister for Industry and Commerce and to create a new Department to take charge of some of those responsibilities, has been discussed frequently in the past.  It is a course which was frequently urged in order to ensure more efficient performance of functions now resting with the Department of Industry and Commerce.</P>
      <P>I think it will be generally agreed that if the change is to be made, it is desirable that it should be made now. As the Seanad is aware, a new Minister for Industry and Commerce has been appointed and as he has to assume the responsibilities of that office in the middle of a Dáil term, with a considerable amount of legislation in progress and much business to be attended to, it is preferable that he should have his responsibility defined quickly, and that a new Minister be appointed to take charge of the functions which it is proposed to transfer to the new Department.  The functions which it is proposed to transfer to the new Department were given in some detail in the Dáil.  These are, briefly, all the services at present administered by the Department of Industry and Commerce relating to marine business, harbours, inland transport, civil aviation, fuel and power.</P>
      <P>These services do not represent a fifty-fifty division of the Department. The dividing line was drawn on a basis involving the least redistribution of staff and the least inconvenience and change in the Department, rather than making an even division of them.  It will, of course, be in the power of the Government, at any time, to transfer to the new Department, or to any Department for that matter, additional functions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="319" /> It was the subject of discussion in the Dáil when this Bill was under consideration that many of the services for which the new Department will be responsible are, in fact, administered by statutory bodies.  That is recognised to be the case and the establishment of the new Department is not intended to imply that there will be any greater interference by the Minister in the administration of those boards than was the case heretofore.</P>
    <P>It is, however, desirable, I think, in relation to policy matters which arise in these important spheres of activity, that there should be a Minister who has got, not merely the responsibility, but the time, to make himself familiar with all aspects of them and to ensure that in each case policy is co-ordinated with the general policy of the Government. In addition, of course, to these major policy matters which are of such great importance, the Minister will have a degree of routine administration work to do which will keep him fairly fully occupied.</P>
    <P>In that connection, I should perhaps correct a statement which I made in the Dáil.  I was asked across the floor of the House to state the number of staff who would be transferred to the new Department and I replied that the figure would be about 400.  That figure is not correct because it did not take into account the meteorological and radio staffs which also come to about 400, so that the total number of officers who will be transferred to the new Department will be about 800, counting in the meteorological and the radio staffs.</P>
    <P>It is not contemplated that there will be any increase whatever in the staffs or any additional cost involved in the creation of the new Department.  I made it clear in the Dáil that, while I was not attempting to forecast the future and while I had no desire to put the new Department into a straitjacket which would restrict its future development, nevertheless I did not see that any need for additional staff was likely to arise in the near future unless some very important new activity, not now foreseen, could be entrusted to it.</P>
    <P>I may mention that the Bill provides <Col N="320" /> that the new Department will be set up on a date which will be appointed by Government Order.  My intention would be that the Government should make that order forthwith as soon as the Bill becomes law.  It would be administratively convenient to have the Minister who is to take charge of the Department aware of his responsibilities at the commencement of the summer recess, and have the period of the adjournment in which to make himself familiar with the working of the Department and the measures, including legislation, which are already in train relating to services which the Department will administer.</P>
    <P>It will, therefore, be my intention to complete this operation and to appoint the new Minister as quickly as possible.  It may be that at some future time when policy matters have become stabilised in relation to these activities, and no new development is foreseen, Ministerial responsibility for this Department can be entrusted to a Minister who has other Departmental responsibilities as well.  I do not think that is likely to arise for many years. Indeed, in all these spheres, developments are taking place or are likely to take place on which the Government and the Oireachtas would like to have the advice of a Minister who is fully familiar with them, and to know that careful consideration was being given to them in relation to the general policy of the Government of the day, apart altogether and separate from the interests of the statutory boards directly concerned with them.</P>
    <P>The appointment of a new Minister is, of course, something that should be done only where the circumstances fully justify it.  I think, from my own experience, as well as the expressed views of other people who have had business with the Department of Industry and Commerce, there can be no doubt that the circumstances justify this division of the Department and the creation of this proposed new Department dealing with transport, fuel and power.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>Before dealing with this Bill, I want, on behalf of the House, to say a word of welcome and congratulation to the Taoiseach.  We <Col N="321" /> have had him here very frequently in the course of his activities as a Minister and he was always very willing to attend and very vigorous in debate &mdash; on the whole, I suppose we all like that because that is why we are here.  We wish him well in the difficult and complex duties which have now fallen to him.</P>
      <P>With regard to this Bill, there can be no doubt at all that the division of the Department of Industry and Commerce should be accomplished.  Everybody with any experience of it, either from the outside or the inside, is, I think, agreed about that.  The manner in which it should be divided and indeed when it should be divided is not a political matter or one which should be made the subject of Party controversy.  This matter, which is of very great importance, does raise the question of whether the best way to proceed to reorganise the Department of Industry and Commerce and divide its functions would not be to look at the Government generally and see whether Ministerial functions are properly divided</P>
      <P>An entirely new Government, an entirely new regime, came into operation in 1922, 37 years ago.  I think at the time the Department which corresponded to the Department of Industry and Commerce was the Department of Labour.  Certain Departments had been set up by the previous Government which were a part of what it is now fashionable to call the resistance movement and were not able to function adequately &mdash; though some of them did great work.  That was 37 years ago. We might be able now to see in greater detail than this Bill reveals what changes are necessary in the organisation of Ministries and the division of Ministerial functions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach himself has had 32 years of active parliamentary work, and for more than 20 years of the 32 years he was in office in this Department, the duties of which were certainly very onerous.  Since he has now decided, from his own experience, that this Ministry is too unwieldy and large, one would imagine that the opportunity should be taken to look into the <Col N="322" /> whole question of the division of Ministerial functions in this small and not very prosperous community.  There is plenty of experience available.  There are people in the other House who have knowledge, experience and goodwill. Perhaps the Taoiseach thought that there was not sufficient time but I should have thought that a Dáil Committee or a Joint Committee would have been able to give views on this to enable something to be done in an entirely unanimous manner.</P>
    <P>My view, and I think it was the view of the Opposition in the Dáil, is that if this is what the Taoiseach wants, to carry out his functions, he should be allowed to proceed on his own lines.  Therefore, I would not propose to hold up this Bill, although certain things ought to be said about it. It is quite clear that other arrangements might be considered&mdash;that other ways of dividing up Ministerial functions besides this way might be considered. This is a proposal to appoint an extra Ministry in a country which has plenty of Ministries, plenty of boards, plenty of officials but falling employment and a falling population.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach said in the other House and repeated to-day that while he does not want to put the new Ministry in a straitjacket, he anticipates it will not cost any more money. I am afraid all our experience &mdash; our experience in this country and anything we can read about other countries &mdash; leads to the conclusion that a new Ministry inevitably means more staff and more expense.  That is the experience in England and it has been our experience here.  The Taoiseach was very careful to guard himself here and in the other House against anything definite.</P>
    <P>It is a good rule that there should be one Minister for one Department. Departments differ just as Ministers differ.  Some Departments are easy, while others are hard.  A not particularly competent or active Minister can take it easy, just as it is true that a competent and active Minister can work very hard in a Department in which another person might do very little.  A good deal depends on the individual.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="323" /> The functions being given over to the new Minister are transport, power and fuel.  That involves control, if the word &ldquo;control&rdquo; is the correct word, or dealing with a number of independent or so-called independent boards.  In theory, these boards are independent.  They are not subject to the Dáil and to the only machinery the Dáil has for dealing with public Departments, that is, the Public Accounts Committee.  Although these boards are not under the control of the Dáil &mdash; I am not saying they ought to be &mdash; although the Dáil cannot ask questions about them, the Minister has power to direct them on policy lines. He has, at the same time, I think, power to prevent them being discussed in the Dáil.  A Minister dealing with these bodies really has the best of both worlds.</P>
    <P>There was some talk in the other House, and the Taoiseach referred to an article written by himself in a journal, with regard to the relation between Parliament and these independent boards.  I have given the matter careful consideration.  I had to consider it long ago when the E.S.B. was first established.  I was asked in the Chair of the Dáil how those boards would be controlled.  I gave what, on re-reading it some years ago, seemed to be a very intelligent reply.  I said I did not know how it could be done, that I thought the problem would arise in more acute form and would probably not be solved.</P>
    <P>Here, more than 30 years later, I find that the problem has not been solved here and it has not been solved in any other country.  It has baffled other Parliaments.  It should be remarked that, even where you have a direct and entire State ownership on socialistic lines, you have no such thing as a genuine Parliamentary control. There has been some talk about Parliamentary Questions with regard to these boards.  That would be ruinous to these boards.  The Taoiseach is aware of that.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Question is a very valuable democratic weapon but it is costly.  Every Parliamentary Question costs a good deal of money. The fact that Government Departments <Col N="324" /> are open to Parliamentary Questions slows them up and is responsible for a considerable amount of delay in dealing with matters.  It is responsible also for the &ldquo;caginess&rdquo; of civil servants because a civil servant has to put it down in writing and, this day 12 months or this day 12 years, somebody in the Dáil might ask a question about what he did.</P>
    <P>It would be ruinous to these boards entrusted with the running of State or semi-State companies, if they should be subject to Parliamentary Question.  So long as Deputies have constituents and elections, their interest and perhaps the interest of Senators are more likely to be small and particular rather than large and general in dealing with policy.  I think the Taoiseach, in his experience, and all of us in our experience, knows there is much more interest in small things than in big things.  The Minister for Education very often gets more trouble about a comparatively small appointment than he gets about the lines upon which schools proceed generally.</P>
    <P>It is true that we have very little information about these boards which this new Minister will now deal with. We do not know as much about them as shareholders can find out about an ordinary company.  Another argument in favour of the Taoiseach's plan or of any plan for dividing this enormous Ministry is that the thing most difficult for any Minister to do in a Department is to disengage himself from day-to-day work of niggling and nagging personal problems and to devote himself to general aspects of policy.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach pointed out that this is a Bill which creates a new Ministry and that there is general power for the Government to transfer functions and services to that new Ministry.  What we are passing here is not a final Bill.  When it becomes an Act, it does not necessarily mean it is the end of this new Ministry.  The Taoiseach has power, I think, to transfer particular functions to the new Minister.</P>
    <P>The great argument for the Bill is that it will give us better services at <Col N="325" /> no greater cost.  It will probably give us better services but what member of this House or what member of the Government would undertake to prophesy that it will not cost us more? It is absolutely certain to cost us more. The Taoiseach was extremely careful not to commit himself to the promise that it would not cost us more and I do not blame him for that.</P>
    <P>I have considerable sympathy with the Ministers of any Government.  They have to carry out three separate functions, each of which is a full-time job, particularly in the case of a Ministry like this.  They have to do with legislation in the Dáil and in the Seanad; they have the administration in their offices; and they have to keep themselves right politically.  These three jobs are very difficult to do at the same time for one and the same person in the circumstances in which our Ministers find themselves.</P>
    <P>One obvious variant of this measure would be to make a Ministry of Communications &mdash; to divorce Radio Éireann from the Post Office and to put in the Post Office a Minister for Communications and with it to put all the other land and sea and air communications in the country.  There is no doubt that the Ministry of Industry and Commerce needs to be divided.  Nobody has more experience of that than the Taoiseach, and I do not think he should be obstructed.  I hope he will not leave this matter so that the net result is a new Ministry and more expense, even at the cost of greater efficiency, falling upon a population which is itself declining.</P>
    <P>If that is so, the effect will be that we are building a pyramid; we are adding to the top and subtracting from the bottom, which has been happening for a long time.  I hope the new Ministry will work out well.  Senators should know that we are merely passing an enabling Bill.  We are enabling a new Ministry to be created.  The functions of that new Ministry may be varied from time to time.  However, this is what the Taoiseach wants.  He has come into a new and very difficult position and if it is what he wants and if he considers it necessary for the <Col N="326" /> carrying out of his duties, we ought to give it to him.  For that reason, I shall not oppose this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OwenSkeffington" hpid="Dr. Sheehy Skeffington Dr. Sheehy Skeffington">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to start by echoing what Senator Hayes has said in welcoming the new Taoiseach to this House.  Senator Hayes has said that he was always available when required.  I would say almost always available, and I should like to welcome him and also to wish him well in his new office.</P>
      <P>The Bill we have before us he has explained to us very clearly and I do not think it is a contentious Bill.  The basic question is: is a new Ministry for Power and Transport required or not? I am confident that the Taoiseach is extremely well fitted to answer the question and I am satisfied if, from his experience as Minister for Industry and Commerce, he feels it necessary and useful to separate certain functions of that Ministry, that it is necessary because I think he thinks in terms of competence and efficiency and that therefore his answer to that question, is it necessary or not, is an informed answer and one which I would accept.</P>
      <P>I do not think the question Senator Hayes raised about cost is really a major one, for two reasons.  If the separate Ministry is necessary for reasons of efficiency and the capacity of one man to do a certain amount of work, then if it does cost a bit more, that cost must be met.  It would be ridiculous to say the new Ministry is necessary but because it will cost a little more, we do not want to have it. That kind of niggling and halfpenny saving in politics is a great mistake. It is the kind of thing you get in the county councils and in many of the ratepayers' associations.  It is extremely shortsighted and the community pays for the incompetence that is preserved by saving a halfpenny here and there on the rates.  I would regard the question of cost, while not irrelevant, as being secondary.  If it costs more and if it is necessary, we must have it and be prepared to meet the cost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second reason why I regard the question of cost as secondary is that I believe the savings which it is quite <Col N="327" /> possible this new Ministry will make will be none-the-less real because they are indirect and will not appear on the balance sheet.  There will be savings and benefits to the community at large.  The more efficient running of a transport system and the more efficient use of power will render more profitable and more beneficial for the community a host of services, factories and so on.  It may not show a balance sheet profit to the Department of Power and Transport, but it will represent a very real gain to the community, and that ought to be our prime consideration.  For these two reasons, I would regard the main question as being: is the new Ministry necessary and not: is it going to cost a bit more?</P>
    <P>I believe the Taoiseach has expert experience as to whether this Ministry is necessary, on which point, if not on all points, I would accept his opinion.  In doing so, however, I would urge him to urge his new Minister, whoever he may be, to use to the full in the community interest the powers that will be given to him in this Bill and in whatever other amending legislation should be necessary.  It would be a pity if a separate Ministry for Power and Transport were to be set up capable of doing a lot but too timid to use the powers which are being asked for now and which I hope we shall grant.</P>
    <P>I should like to think the new Minister will be bold and imaginative in the use of his powers in the national interest, not in any sectional interest and not bound by considerations of Party politics and I say that not in relation to one Party because I am afraid it is part of our democratic process that every Minister is to some extent conditioned by the local effect of a change which may be to the national benefit but may be criticised locally. It is in that sense I hope that the new Minister will be bold and courageous and will plan in the national interest and not in any sectional or local interest.</P>
    <P>I should like to cite an example in that regard.  We had a recent case in which C.I.E. decided to close down <Col N="328" /> certain railways and we were shown that there was a balance sheet saving by reason of the closing of these railways because C.I.E. did not have to maintain the permanent way if they closed the railways.  In fact, as in the case of the Harcourt Street line, much of the transport which went by rail has now been put on to the road and while that does not become an immediate charge upon the company, it is nevertheless a charge upon the community. That kind of planning is not over-all planning but planning for what will appear upon a balance sheet.  I should like to see a more national view taken instead of a local view, which says: &ldquo;We can show a saving of £30,000 here and there if we do not have to pay for the maintenance of the permanent way&rdquo; or whatever it may be.</P>
    <P>Similarly, the Taoiseach in the Dáil, when a question was asked about the abolition of the Howth Tram, said that to renovate the permanent way there would cost &mdash; I forget how many thousands of pounds.  In relation to that, two considerations would arise if the Minister for Transport were to be asked a question in this connection. The G.N.R. had certain obligations in relation to that line which they did not fulfil and for which they were probably paid compensation at the time.  That compensation appears somewhere in the balance sheet.  It was not used as it ought to have been used for maintaining the permanent way.  If it had been used, the Howth Tram would not have gone into that state of neglect.</P>
    <P>The second consideration I would refer to in that connection is this.  I notice that in Douglas, Isle of Man, they have horse trams maintained, even more antiquated than the Howth Tram.  They regard it as a tourist attraction and the horse trams run regularly there.  There was a slight lack of imagination here; you could prove perhaps that there was an immediate loss on the line but there might have been a wider gain had this quaint, outmoded means of transport been kept as a quaint, interesting and picturesque attraction, despite the fact that it might not immediately be economic.</P>

      <P>I am glad to say I have said all I want to say on those two points.  I want to turn to the question of the attitude &mdash; I might say the Government attitude because it is the Government who are asking us to do this &mdash; on the setting up of a new Ministry.  I think I am right in saying the plea is being made that our economy will be made the more efficient, if power and transport are directed by a single Minister.  That is really the main issue here today.  Since we are moving more and more towards the concept of the managerial state, let us make it competent and efficient.  I think that competency and efficiency might be said with justice to be two of the main aims of the Taoiseach and his Government.  I should like to plead that community interest be not forgotten in the managerial state which is just around the corner.  I should like to plead that not a too narrow balance-sheet-minded attitude be taken and that ordinary human beings be considered just as well as technical efficiency.</P>
      <P>I should like the question to be put to the new Minister whom we are being asked to bring into being as to what are the power and transport needs of the Government and the resources of the country.  I should like to see him proposing plans for the use of these resources for the satisfaction of those community needs, no matter what private, local or vested interest might be crossed.  It is in that spirit that I support this Bill and the Taoiseach's speech in favour of it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EdwardMcGuire" hpid="Mr. McGuire Mr. McGuire">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGuire</NameTxt>
      <P>We all know that the Department of Industry and Commerce was an enormous Ministry and one which went from big beginnings to its present enormous size.  Therefore, it is only sensible that something should be done to break it up into more manageable units.  I do not think we shall ever again have a Minister who will have the energy of the Taoiseach when he was Minister for Industry and Commerce, but I doubt <Col N="330" /> whether he was ever able to follow down all the different ways and alleys in which his Department was concerned. I know that even in small ways he was blamed by his officials for many things which I know he never saw or heard of.</P>
      <P>The fact is that the Ministry is too big.  It has really got out of hand.  It very often depends in some of its activities upon the ability and integrity of its permanent officials.  That is all very well.  We have some very good permanent officials and civil servants but they are not all that good.  I think there is a crying need for a break-up of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce. Therefore, I must say that I am in agreement with the proposal we have before us in this Bill.</P>
      <P>There is a general feeling in the country today which is manifested on all sides.  You hear it at all levels and you see it in all forms of print.  It is the feeling that we are getting somewhat frightened at the size of our governmental machine.  Because of the size of that machine, the average citizen is becoming worried about the growth of State overheads which manifest themselves in very high taxation and in drawing more and more not only from private enterprise business but from the private citizen himself who is called upon to produce more and more, not only in the form of taxation but even in the form of savings and finance which is necessary to carry on these State operations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If one embarks upon some new form of organisation in order to expand business or to deal with an expansion of activities, one always has to look round to see whether there is anything which can be cut down or amalgamated.  It seems to me that there are some Ministries at present in existence that do not seem to justify being Ministries. They do not seem to justify the dignity of being called a Ministry at all. Perhaps the Taoiseach will tell us if he has looked round.  I know that he has not had very much time to do so, but perhaps he would look round to see if something could be done to cut down expenses in other directions and amalgamate not only the actual Ministry under one Minister but also amalgamate  <Col N="331" /> certain of the personnel.  I do not know the statistics at the moment but everybody can get them.  There is a growing army of people in what Senator Sheehy Skeffington called the managerial state to which we have very much arrived.</P>
    <P>If this Ministry is to be a success, it is inevitable that it will involve extra costs.  If it takes on extra duties, it is inevitable that it will cost more.  Therefore, it is obvious that we should look round and see where we can draw from, amalgamate, or cut down so as to offset in some way the growth we see all the time in the Department of Industry and Commerce.</P>
    <P>In regard to the new Ministry and the general control by the State which comes under this Ministry, I think we ought to go carefully on an expansion of the State's operations.  It is going so far now that it is really getting too big for the taxpayer and the ordinary citizen in the community to carry on this enormous control.  There are plenty of people who may say that private enterprise has failed and that we ought to go on with more State enterprise but very little of the State enterprise is productive. It is the structure on which to build a money-making and income-making economic machine.  If we are to build upon State bodies which are giving services, no matter how desirable and good, unless they produce wealth for the community, we shall find ourselves awkwardly placed.  We shall be like the family man spending all his resources on his house and on the provision of baths and swimming pools but is getting nothing done to earn money.</P>
    <P>I agree with the proposal in the Bill but I hope that some method will be found to curb expenditure in other Ministries where the expenditure is not really required or is not giving value for money in order to offset what I feel will be the worthwhile expenditure in this Ministry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCole" hpid="Mr. Cole Mr. Cole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cole</NameTxt>
      <P>One must presume that, when it comes to this stage of the Bill, the Taoiseach has made up his mind as to what his new Ministry will be.  It does seem from the items he listed that the new Minister will be <Col N="332" /> in charge of these.  It seems to be more an attempt to relieve the Department of Industry and Commerce of some of its sidelines than an attempt to have a Minister who will be an added asset to the Government.  In other words, taking those items from the Minister for Industry and Commerce will probably give great relief to him.</P>
      <P>It seems to me that the Department of Industry and Commerce might still be a very big and over-weighted job for one Minister.  If it was my position to say who would be the most advantageous Minister to appoint at present, one who would be the most useful to the economy, I would say a Minister for external trade or export.  If we could amalgamate all branches of industry, and possibly agriculture to a certain extent, which export to other countries and appoint a Minister to deal with them, simply and solely, to facilitate exporters and to introduce our exports to foreign markets, such a Ministry would be far more advantageous to the country at the present time and these other items could be divided up amongst the Ministers we have at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I noticed that the Taoiseach when introducing this Bill said that there would be no additional cost.  We all know from long experience of these matters that you just cannot set up a new Ministry without having additional costs.  If we take the very minimum cost, there will be an office for the Minister and his staff, and there will be an office for the Secretary of the Department and his staff, and the very minimum for those would be between £10,000 and £20,000 a year.  If I wanted to, I could easily take the Department of the Gaeltacht as an example and there would be no difficulty in demonstrating conclusively that that has led to the minimum increase in expenditure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, there are more important matters involved.  There are really two main approaches to a problem of this sort.  One is the approach which I associate in my mind with the Department of Industry and Commerce, as it has developed during the past 30 years, and the other is the approach I see in the Department of <Col N="333" /> Justice.  It is remarkable that the policy of the Department of Justice has been one of <i>laissez faire.</i>  The expenditure on the headquarters staff is probably no greater to-day, allowing for the fall in the value of money, than it was 30 years ago.  Yet, the total amount of crime and the total expenditure on prisons has gone down and down.  I suppose the efficiency of the Department of Justice is to be gauged partly on the expenditure on prisons and it is a proof of efficiency.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, we all know that the Department of Industry and Commerce has expanded really beyond reasonable bounds.  Again, if I felt that proper thought was given within that Department to certain of the problems that come along, I might not have such objections to such a large Department.  I am very much afraid that this sort of thing creates the officials' rights to one another, creates a sort of merry-go-round and this new Department is, of course, going to add to the merry-go-round.  There was a new Department established two years ago and the public reaction to the establishment of the Department of the Gaeltacht was not too favourable.  I am afraid that public opinion will not be very much disposed in favour of this Department, either.</P>
    <P>I think that Parkinson's Law&mdash;the name which it got in recent times but which used be called, long before Parkinson wrote about it, empire building &mdash; operates in these matters.  If a civil servant gets into a new Department and wants to improve his own position, he proceeds to increase, as far as he can, the importance of his own work. That goes on all the time and I do not think it happens anywhere more than in the Department of Industry and Commerce.  Before setting up this additional Department, I think the Taoiseach had done this in relation to the Department of Industry and Commerce: first of all, he had the Department itself; then he became aware that there was a certain amount of public opposition to the size of the Department and he proceeded, within the Department, to set up a number of independent entities.  These are a few which I found in the Estimates: the Labour Court, Foras Tionscal, the Fair <Col N="334" /> Trade Commission, the Industrial Development Authority and Córas Tráchtála Teoranta, which is now being put into the slightly outer category which is my third category.  The third category is the category of numerous State enterprises which have been established outside the Department of Industry and Commerce, so that really there has been a triple development in relation to this matter.</P>
    <P>I am not passing judgment on any particular part of that development. What I am passing judgment on is the extraordinary size of the existing Department of Industry and Commerce. It is not the first time I have mentioned it.  There is another difficulty, and perhaps a more important one, that is, that you are getting to the stage where the size of the Government is becoming unwieldy from the point of view of operating as a committee, which is essentially what the Government is, a committee which has to come to unanimous decisions.</P>
    <P>I think most people would say that there are sufficient Ministers.  When one looks around the Ministers, what does one see?  There is one obvious Ministry which is most suitable for conversion into a statutory body, and indeed it could be associated with the new Ministry, that is, the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, which is, in essence, a communications organisation.  Probably most people would say that the most suitable kind of organisation for it would be something in the nature of a statutory board.  Certainly it is scarcely of sufficient significance to be a separate Ministry and since this Ministry is being established, it seems to me that it would fit into it in a fairly suitable way.  This is a Ministry for Transport and Power and certainly from the transport end, it would fit into it.</P>
    <P>There is another point which the Taoiseach made in an addendum to his written brief, that is, that the Minister would be concerned about policy, not that there would be no greater interference with the statutory bodies.  There again, you see, there are two opinions about that.  Most people would agree that the statutory boards should be free from day to day interference. <Col N="335" /> A different problem has arisen and that is the problem referred to by Senator McGuire of what is called the managerial State, and which I think we can call the problem of the managers.  There is no question that in the way matters have developed in our own small community, too much power is now vested in the managers. I am satisfied about that from my own experience.  They are able to make a case for their expenditure to a Minister.  They make their case in a general way.  In particular, in the case of the boards attached to the Department of Industry and Commerce, there has been, inside the Department of Industry and Commerce, in my opinion, no proper examination of the proposals put forward from time to time by these boards.</P>
    <P>We all know that there was the sad case of Ministerial interference which resulted in a surplus of a quarter more power stations than are required.  That is an expenditure of £50 million which is roughly what the power stations stand at in the accounts of the Electricity Supply Board.  A quarter of that, about £12 millions, is surplus to requirements and will be so for years to come.  No amount of juggling with the figures will alter that.  We have had talk about percentage increases and so on, as if it were like the laws of the Medes and Persians, as if the demand for electricity would double every five or six years.  Once rural electrification is completed and as the population is going down, the demand for electricity may not increase at all, at some stage.</P>
    <P>That example of Ministerial interference &mdash; and certainly it was Ministerial interference and so recognised by everyone &mdash; resulted in an excess expenditure at the apex of something like £15 millions.  A loss of that amount is enormous and there is simply no income at all as against that expenditure for the time the power stations are surplus.</P>
    <P>When the Taoiseach speaks about the new Minister deciding major matters of policy, I should like to have a more specific meaning attached to that <Col N="336" /> phrase.  I understand a major matter of policy to be, say, a matter as to whether we should have our first atomic power station or not at a certain time.  I do not know what major matters of policy can arise at present in relation to power, as I understand the term.  One might refer to the fag-end of rural electrification, about which again there was certainly a substantial slip-up in the figures a few years ago, both in the E.S.B. and in the Department, which did not reflect credit on either.</P>
    <P>The original figure said the cost would be £1.8 million, to deal with the oddments left out in the scheduled areas, the octagonals.  This figure of £1.8 million was supplied to the Government of the day.  It was subsequently found that it should be £4 million.  Whatever junior man made the slip, it was picked up by nobody until it reached the Government.  That is disgraceful.  It indicates the greatest lack of attention to what I would regard as proper thought by the people concerned.  Someone told the Government of the day this would cost £1.8 million.  There were certain little extra areas which should be done and it was found that the cost would be that.  It went to the Government at £1.8 million and it subsequently turned out to be nearly £5 million.</P>
    <P>The point I am making is that you do not get more accuracy by prolification. You get less responsibility, because no particular person or group can be pointed to as absolutely responsible. I suppose that in this case, if one wanted to take Parliamentary responsibility, the people responsible would be the Government, in absolute terms; but the Government certainly operate from very remote territory.</P>
    <P>One of the ways of dealing with this problem would be if the Department could start to think a little more like the Department of Justice, more in the manner in which that Department thinks; and if, when they meet a problem, they would try to approach it in the way the Department of Justice approaches it.  There are two ways of approaching it.  I think Senator Sheehy Skeffington is more in agreement with the way the Department of <Col N="337" /> Industry and Commerce approaches the problem.  I am more in agreement with the way the Department of Justice approaches it.  I am extremely doubtful about the conclusion of Senator Sheehy Skeffington that our economy would be made more efficient by the establishment of this new Ministry.</P>

      <P>I have no intention of following Senator O'Donovan in his by-ways of criticism.  Senator Cole, however, had some rather original and unusual views to state on this question of exports and had particular suggestions about it.  While I think his suggestion is a bit impracticable, it might be no harm to point out here the scope which there will be, under a Minister concentrating on all these State bodies, for an improvement in regard to our export position.  That is not so obvious in the case of Bord na Móna and the E.S.B., which are primarily concerned with power requirements, but there is obviously scope for improvement in our export position, both in regard to visible and invisible exports in the case of transport organisations, Córas Iompair Éireann, Aer Lingus and Irish Shipping and the Ports, both air and sea, which they feed into, the sea ports of Dublin and Cork; and Shannon and Collinstown Airports.  There is very little real scope there for providing low cost transportation of goods and people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In that sphere, there is a real challenge to the new Minister and there is scope for improvement in the transportation of people and goods at a more reasonable cost, which can contribute very reasonably to our export position.  That applies particularly to the Port of Dublin, from which the bulk of our exports are sent.  It is obvious that there is scope there for an improvement of the position of congestion around the Port.  There is room for an improvement of the feeds into the Port, both rail and road, and provision for the development of a container traffic in the case of cross-Channel exports.  That also ties in with the difficulties we are having in the cross-Channel freight position.  The latter point is a serious one and I think <Col N="338" /> it can be solved only at Government level, by debate between the two Governments concerned.</P>
    <P>It is in that sphere that the new Department will have the greatest scope for improvement, the sphere of co-ordination of our transport organisation so as to ensure that goods and passengers are transported as cheaply as possible, so that people coming in here can be moved quickly between Aer Lingus and C.I.É. and so that goods going out of this country, either by rail or road, can be fed as cheaply as possible into an air transport system or, if possible, into some improved cross-Channel shipping transport system.  Whether that latter cross-Channel system will take the form of Irish Shipping moving in or not, is a question for decision at Government level, but there is certainly obvious room for improvement in the freight transport position from the Port of Dublin to Liverpool and other English ports where the bulk of our exports go. There is real scope for improvement and development there, by a new Minister in that Department, charged with the responsibility of dove-tailing and co-ordinating these improved transport organisations we have developed here over the years.</P>

    <P>I am quite convinced that this proposed new Department is both necessary and timely.  I have no doubt that the Minister for Industry and Commerce, if he had been appointed after a general election, would have acquired in a short time a knowledge of the working of the Department and the competence to control its affairs to a degree equal to that of any of his predecessors.  One will understand, however, that a new Minister, coming in in the middle of a term when everything is in progress and under an obligation not merely to keep things moving but to go right back to examine matters and the considerations which led up to the decisions taken, would be gravely handicapped, <Col N="339" /> particularly in a Department of that size.</P>
    <P>Apart altogether from that temporary situation which requires and justifies the setting up of this Department now, I am convinced from my own experience that the whole efficiency of the administration of the services entrusted to the Department of Industry and Commerce will be very greatly improved by the change.  I was very conscious of the fact myself that I was relying, perhaps unduly, upon the advice I was getting in policy matters from the boards of these statutory companies and that I certainly was not in sufficiently constant touch with them to understand, not merely all the factors which led to the recommendations they made, but also the direction in which they foresaw their future development.  In the case, for example, of transport policy, as Senators know, a quite substantial amount of time was involved in transport legislation which was introduced a couple of years ago.  Since then, various organisations have been asking me to discuss with them the possibility of changing that legislation.  It was so abhorrent to me to go back over all the considerations and arguments which had led to the original decisions that I found it almost impossible to consider their proposals or even to meet them to discuss them and, as some of their ideas may have been good, they were certainly entitled to get adequate Ministerial attention.</P>
    <P>When I was leaving the Department, I was aware that on the desk of my successor there would be quite a number of big matters on some of which reports had been received which would require his early consideration and a number of them, at least, came within the scope of this new Ministry.  I was anxious to ensure that these matters would go ahead rapidly and I was, indeed, at that time, somewhat concerned as to how that could best be arranged.  I think I would have urged the creation of this new Department now, even if the change in the Government had not taken place.</P>
    <P>I will agree with Senator Hayes that the question of the reallocation of services in the Government Departments <Col N="340" /> should be re-examined from time to time.  I am not at all convinced that a Dáil committee would be very helpful.  I think experience has shown that services are transferred from one Department to another very often because of a realisation by the Taoiseach that a Minister has special qualifications or a special interest in particular work which justifies giving him extra duties.  Indeed, that is a factor which would always be in the mind of any Taoiseach, the reallocation of the services among the Departments, not merely the theoretically best arrangements in respect of these services, but the capacity of the individual members of the Government to deal with them properly.</P>
    <P>The Department of Posts and Telegraphs is one Department which it has been suggested might be changed by the device of setting up a statutory board to administer the postal and telegraph services.  I do not know that we should consider such a very substantial development, unless we were convinced that a very considerable improvement either in efficiency or cost of the service was likely to result. Again, I am by no means convinced of that and indeed one can see circumstances in which the release from immediate Dáil criticism which would be involved might have the opposite effect.</P>
    <P>I find that the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs is a particularly well-occupied Minister.  Admittedly, the greater proportion of his time is occupied with routine administrative matters and policy is only settled on major questions at long intervals.  The question of television, for example, will be a main policy matter before that Department at present but I cannot see that the work of the Minister could be transferred to another Minister without completely overburdening him.  Indeed, I would not agree at all that there is not in that Department, which after all does control the fortunes of a staff of some 20,000, justification for a Ministerial head.</P>
    <P>The Department of the Gaeltacht has naturally been under examination from time to time.  The amount of <Col N="341" /> work which the Minister can do in that Department depends entirely on his interest in it.  The present Minister, so far as I have been able to see, is very heavily burdened because of his personal inclination to attend to quite small matters of detail affecting the lives of some people in the Gaeltacht areas perhaps, but which another Minister might be inclined to leave to his officials.  At the same time, one could hardly contemplate the giving of that Ministry as a secondary and minor matter to a Minister already in charge of another Department.  I presume the Department of the Gaeltacht would be given to the Department of Industry and Commerce where it would be of very minor concern to the Minister for Industry and Commerce and that is exactly what it was intended to avoid when the Department of the Gaeltacht was set up.  It was intended that a Minister with complete access to the Government would be in charge of that Department, who would have no other obligation except the economic and cultural development of the Gaeltacht areas.  Therefore, I think all the considerations which justified the creation of that Ministry in the first place now justify its retention.</P>
    <P>I do not want to open in a general way the question of the Parliamentary control of statutory boards.  Senator Hayes rightly said that this question arose not merely in this but in other Parliaments in the past and that no satisfactory and acceptable proposal has emerged.  I am not at all sure that the fact is not due to a misconception of the character of the problem that is presented.  Indeed one has to decide first if there is a problem that the present system of control is not sufficient.  The aim was to give these statutory boards the commercial freedom of private concerns, to give them the advantages of operating on the same basis as private concerns, keeping them subject to control only with regard to policy through their responsibility to an individual Minister.  A lot of these examinations about methods of increasing the degree of Parliamentary control arise from the desire to have it two ways, subject to Parliamentary control and at the <Col N="342" /> same time, continuing to enjoy commercial freedom.  Certainly successive Governments with different policies have given attention to the matter and they reached the conclusion that it was best to leave them as they are.</P>
    <P>I had better not refer too violently to some remarks made by Senator O'Donovan.  All I want to say in that connection is that the Department of Industry and Commerce grew very large because the policy of the Government required an extension of its activities and the public were pressing for an extension of its activities.  Over the years, the Department has shed many of the services for which it was originally responsible.  It originally had control of a very large section of the Social Welfare services which are now administered by the Department of Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>In my early days as Minister, 30 per cent. or 40 per cent. of my time was occupied with trade disputes which have since been transferred entirely to the Labour Court.  I have never seen to my knowledge any reluctance on the part of the chief executive of the Department of Industry and Commerce to bring in any experts from the Department of Finance and elsewhere to overhaul their administration and see what economies could be achieved or what greater efficiency could be realised. There is now, I think, a continuous review of their operations which has led to some changes and it was that fact which led me to the decision that when setting up this new Department, one should think of transferring complete and integrated sections rather than attempting to transfer responsibilities which would mean a division of a particular section of the Department.</P>
    <P>At a later stage, it may be that it will be found possible to draw the dividing line somewhere else, but on the whole this new Department of Transport and Power will be set up in a way which will mean no interference with the work of the Department and the minimum of dislocation of staff arrangements.  It will not cost any more money.  Senator Hayes said I was cautious in that regard, not entering into a definite commitment. <Col N="343" /> I meant to convey that, assuming everything goes on as at present, the functions of the Department of Industry and Commerce in respect of Transport, Fuel and Power are not to be increased or altered in any way; no extra cost will be involved.</P>
    <P>The present Minister for Industry and Commerce has chosen to carry on without a Parliamentary Secretary. I had a Parliamentary Secretary.  He had an office and secretariate.  Indeed, the only change in that regard is that there will be in that office a person who has the status of a Minister instead of that of a Parliamentary Secretary.  Perhaps I should qualify my statement that no extra cost will be involved by saying that no doubt the senior officer of the Department will in future rank as a Departmental Secretary.</P>
    <P>Some of the matters mentioned were perhaps not relevant.  I should say, in relation to repeated suggestions that the E.S.B. have installed excessive generating capacity, that the Board themselves have said they could not have met the peak load of last winter without utilising all their installed capacity.  It is true that the Board's capacity has to be designed to meet a peak demand and that at other periods of the year, the demand is less than it is at the peak period.  However, the Board are pressing ahead with some of the new stations which have been sanctioned.  They are convinced they will require them to meet their obligations to the electricity consumers at least on the date originally visualised and possibly a little earlier.</P>
    <P>The rate of increase in electricity demand at present is seven per cent. per annum.  That is so completely in line with the experience of other countries that it is quite reasonable for the Board to plan their future installation of generating capacity on the assumption that it is likely to continue. Apart from that consideration, surely it is far better for us to be in the position that we can meet any demand for electricity that industry may have to make rather than that we should have to delay our industrial development while the Board are building up the capacity to meet it?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="344" /> A number of big concerns established recently require a great deal of electricity.  It was a comfort to everybody concerned to know that they could go to the E.S.B. and be quite certain that their requirements would be met the day they wanted, without any difficulty or hesitation on the part of the E.S.B.</P>
    <P>However, these are not matters, perhaps, which are relevant here.  I accept, in relation to the E.S.B., that the policy decisions which have to be made are generally of a major kind. We had to decide to turn over to peat production.  We had to decide to build up generating capacity based on native resources.  We are coming within sight of the point at which native fuel and water-power will fully be developed. Then there will be the question as to how to go on from there when creating new capacity after that period.  As these plans have to be made five or six years ahead, it will not be very long before these questions are calling for decisions.</P>
    <P>In other boards, I think large policy decisions arise more frequently, particularly boards of a more commercial type.  The aim of the new Minister, as I see it, would be to ensure that their development is proceeding in accordance with the ideas entertained when they were set up &mdash; that they are, in fact, doing the work they were intended to do and that their efforts are being coordinated in such a way as to obtain the maximum possible benefit for the country.</P>
    <P>We have always had some little problem of co-ordination in these boards.  It was the function of the Minister to ensure that it would be properly effected.  I can see for the years ahead for this Minister for Fuel, Power and Transport the same kinds of functions to perform.  In all these directions, I should like pressure of the right kind coming from the Minister rather than visualise the Minister sitting in his office and waiting for the directors of the boards to come to him with ideas for his consideration.</P>
    <P>In our circumstances, we must be organised to overcome and remove the inertia which inevitably tends to develop in these larger organisations, <Col N="345" /> if they are not under continuous compulsion from the top to consider new possibilities and new fields of activity through which they can contribute to the development of the country.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That Section 1 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardMcGuire" hpid="Mr. McGuire Mr. McGuire">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGuire</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister or members of the public were asked what was the main feature of the Budget this year, they would say it was the reduction in direct taxation whereby income tax has been reduced by 6d. in the £ and the figure at which surtax becomes payable has been raised.  Speaking for people engaged in industry and commerce, we welcome this small but acceptable reduction.</P>
      <P>In trade and industry, we regard income tax as the most important factor either for or against the development of industry.  The first thing I should like to feel happy about is whether that reduction is the result of a definite policy to reduce income tax as has been advocated as being the most important incentive to development and the prerequisite for development. That has been stressed again and again by economists and by leaders of industry and commerce throughout the country, and this is the first step we have had in this direction for a very long time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to think this represented a definite policy on the part of the <Col N="346" /> Government, both now and for the future and that this is a token of future policy.  Unfortunately &mdash; and I do not say this in any nasty way &mdash; there is a feeling that it was done on this occasion because of the British Budget.  Those of us who know our Catechism will remember &mdash; I forget a lot about it but I do remember this &mdash; there is a difference between perfect and imperfect contrition.  Perfect contrition is sorrow for sin because it offends God and imperfect contrition sorrow for sin because of the fear of hell or the loss of heaven.  I would describe the Government's action in relation to income tax as an act of imperfect contrition.  It was something they had to do out of shame.  I hope I am not right in that.  I should prefer to think of it as the beginning of a new policy in relation to direct taxation.</P>
    <P>In case my own voice should not be strong enough, being the voice of only one person, I should like to quote the Chamber of Commerce official journal which is the voice of business people in this country.  I think not only this Minister but all other Ministers will agree the Chamber of Commerce and the chambers generally have gone out of their way to thank the Government for any concessions that have ever been given and, in my opinion, they have sometimes thanked them for things they never got.  In fact, they have been over-polite not only to this Minister but to Ministers of all Governments. The business community at all times have not been kicking up enough row to get justice and the bare necessaries for building up a strong economy upon which this and every other Government have professed to rely.</P>
    <P>The Government's White Paper said that we rely upon private enterprise in this country and so on but up to now it has been the &ldquo;so on and so on&rdquo; that gets everything.  It is these State bodies, including C.I.E., for whom money is made available in unlimited quantities, but very little comes the way of private enterprise.  In this connection, I should like to read the comment of the Chamber of Commerce Journal on the Budget of June, 1959.  The Chamber of Commerce <Col N="347" /> made certain proposals to which I may refer later on other sections of the Bill. With regard to the proposals generally, the Chamber of Commerce Journal comments as follows: &mdash;</P>
    <P>To some few of these the Minister has agreed, and with our customary politeness we thanked him for the consideration he has shown.  In addition to sixpence off the standard rate of income tax and a higher starting point for surtax, both of which concessions will help to induce certain wealthy taxpayers to stay on his books instead of moving over to Mr. Heathcote Amory's, he has agreed to a 2% wear and tear allowance...</P>
    <P>And here is the point &mdash;</P>
    <P>...but too much that he has done is so trivial that we cannot but look with wonder and anxiety on the Budget as a whole.  Is this the product of statesmanship?  Is it seriously intended to approach the problems of national survival as matters of urgency?</P>
    <P>...we have been given no evidence of any sense of the urgency of concentrating as strongly as possible on stimulating economic growth.  More investment, more employment and more rapidly growing national income will do far more to benefit the citizen and the Exchequer than a whole host of these pennyworths of concessions. To get the capital to do the work that is needed we have to remit more and more of the taxes at present levied on industrial profits, so that the concerns may expand.</P>
    <P>That is the comment of the Chamber of Commerce and their view may be summarised by saying that we are doing too little and, I hope, not too late.  We have definitely shied away from what I regard the main factor in the creation of a strong private enterprise economy in this country. We give subsidies, protection, grants and so on, but we never give to industry the one thing it wants, that is, to be allowed to earn profits, keep them and plough them back.  I do <Col N="348" /> not even advocate that income tax should be such that, when people draw high salaries, they should be allowed to spend them wildly.  You might maintain the present figure of income tax on distributed profits but there is no excuse for not doing something about undistributed profits which must be ploughed back.</P>
    <P>If business people go to a bank &mdash; and I know very few who do not &mdash; to get an overdraft, there is no way of paying off that overdraft, except by some system of having undistributed profits untaxed or taxed at lower rates.  All that happens at present is that you are allowed the interest on your bank overdraft, but what will you do about the capital?  There must be a lower income tax rate on undistributed profits, or you can have a reduction in income tax generally on the standard rate which reaches not only beyond the narrow confines of industry itself but out into the spending power of the public and the incentives they get for earning money when they are able to handle it, use it and save it according to their own individual capacities and ideas of thrift and so on.</P>
    <P>In the White Paper, the Government expressed their intention of relying mainly upon private enterprise for economic expansion.  It has been pointed out on all sides by economists that lower taxation is essential, if private enterprise is to prosper.  I know the answer which has been given in the past by all Ministers when they were asked to reduce the tax.  They all say that it cannot be done this year. The only reason they did it this year was that they were pushed by Great Britain.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach, when Minister for Industry and Commerce, stated, as does the White Paper, that the Government are willing to take any reasonable risks to supply capital and to take monetary, social, and industrial risks in order to build up a strong economy here.  I think that many risks have been taken in many fields but very few risks have been taken in remitting 6d. off income tax and the surtax relief. The accommodation which has been made costs only £1,200,000.  This is <Col N="349" /> being provided for by extending the figure for errors of estimation from £1,000,000 to £2,500,000.  Here we see that the risk taken is one of the order of £1,200,000.  Every time we met here during the past few months, we spoke in millions about other things in respect of which it is problematical whether they will be remunerative, not to think of saying they are the things upon which we mainly rely.</P>
    <P>I would suggest there is very little risk in making a real gesture on this whole question of the rate of taxation. Might I quote for the House what the Vice-President of the Austrian Federal Chamber of Commerce, Paul Forster, had to say about what happened in Austria when he was speaking recently in New York?  Mr. Forster, the document says, pointed out:</P>
    <P>......that the income and wages taxes had been reduced in 1958 which left 800 million Schilling per year in the pockets of the taxpayers. These tax reductions &mdash; Austria lowered her income and wages taxes three times during the last few years &mdash; were always followed by an increase in tax revenue.</P>
    <P>Why cannot we do that here?  It is a business proposition and it has worked in Austria and why can it not work here?</P>
    <P>I could go on quoting but I think it would be rather boring.  I think there is nothing more boring than to listen to a man giving continuous quotations. I could, as you know, quote the case of Western Germany where the same thing happened after the last war.  They used their taxation system to give an incentive to people at all levels of the economy.  In this country we hear it said that private enterprise has failed. How could it succeed when it is throttled?  It is weighted down at all angles.  Even when businesses do prosper behind the protective barrier, they are throttled by taxation in the end and never able to build up an economic background of capital on which to live and expand.</P>
    <P>I shall quote again the case of Sunbeam Wolsey.  The Chairman of that company pointed out that in the last ten years they have paid out £1,000,000 <Col N="350" /> in taxation.  They have shown that they can make money and use capital, but it is taken from them and given to all sorts of problematical people around the country for businesses which very often we find winding-up after three months and causing disappointment not only to the economy but to the people who are led to believe that, through them, the economy would thrive.</P>
    <P>The reason I am stressing this is that I feel it is the biggest thing in our whole life and that we have never tackled it from the time we got self-Government, never put our finger on the basic thing on which the whole economy can be built.  Taxation, direct taxation is something which has never been tackled here and that is the reason why our economy is on the downgrade, in spite of the millions we have invested in the home economy. The Minister has undoubtedly taken what was described in one paper as a limited Budget risk on this occasion in order to reduce direct taxation and, as the Central Bank said, it is being taken in the confidence that the national outlook will be improved and the revenue ultimately strengthened.</P>
    <P>There are times when you must make a really bold gesture to get a really bold return.  You have to make a strong gesture to get strong results, as the Chamber of Commerce says. Fiddling concessions, such as taking sixpence off here and putting on three-pence there&mdash;when it should really be 2/6d. or something really dramatic to have an impact on our economy &mdash; are not enough.</P>
    <P>We need outside people and outside money and we need not be ashamed of that.  There is nothing unnational about advocating that we want the know-how and that we cannot generate it ourselves.  I have spoken about our home manufacturers and our home people but we want the help of people outside and we want their money, and the only way to get the people here is by having an economy in which taxation is low, and dramatically lower than in England.  It is no good saying that taxation here is nine-pence better than it is in England, or that it is no worse than England's.  All <Col N="351" /> the big industries in England are whining about taxation but at least they have the background, they have the meed of industrial wealth and industrial knowledge and know-how.  We have neither the wealth, the tradition nor the know-how.  In order to offset our late start in the field and our lack of raw materials, the only weapon we have is the weapon of taxation, and direct taxation at that.</P>
    <P>At this stage, I should like to ask the Minister if it is possible to tell us when we are to get the report of the Income Tax Commission.  I do not have any faith in that Commission.  I think the Minister has enough date, and his Department has enough date, on which to make changes in the income tax code and I doubt from what I hear&mdash;and I have not got any inside knowledge, except for a few leakages&mdash;if anything very big will come from that Commission because their terms of reference, first of all, were very limited.  I think we should tackle the question of direct taxation and make the taxation code such that it would encourage people to work hard and allow them a large degree of the money they earn.  The people in business should be encouraged to keep a large degree of their profits ploughed back into their industries.  As that is another aspect of the distributed profits everybody should be prepared to face that fact until we build up our industrial economy, and later on we shall be able to distribute largesse to everybody.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Minister for Finance (Dr. Ryan) James Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I should like to say that in the White Paper on Economic Expansion, it is pointed out that the Government believed that one of the necessary incentives to expansion of industry was a reduction in direct taxation.  When that was being issued, we put it in deliberately and seriously and we intended to make every effort to reduce direct taxation as soon as and as often as possible. That is as far as that is concerned. Whether that is contrition or attrition, I do not know.  We shall do it again if we can, but I cannot say, at this stage, if we shall be able to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="352" /> Also in the White Paper, the Government said they believed in private enterprise but that in certain cases, where private enterprise cannot be got for certain undertakings, State enterprise must be resorted to.  We should be delighted if private enterprise took over C.I.E., but they are not likely to and projects like C.I.E., can be handled only by State enterprise and whatever money is necessary must be found for them.  I do not think Senator McGuire is altogether fair in saying that everything goes to them.  There are a couple of Bills coming, this week, I suppose, to the Seanad, dealing with enlarged grants for private enterprise, to cover a new factory or the extension of an existing factory; and various concessions and grants of that kind are being provided. I think that at least a great deal is being done for private enterprise and it is hardly fair to say that nothing is being done while everything is being done for State or public companies.</P>
    <P>With regard to distributed and undistributed profits, that question has been raised several times here.  We have this advantage, that the British tried that and dropped it again.  They had a higher tax on distributed profits than on undistributed profits.  I am informed that they dropped it with the approval of business men generally in England, because people in business there were paying higher taxes on distributed profits and not so high on undistributed profits&mdash;and when, in a few years, these undistributed profits came to be distributed as profits, they had to find money they had not provided for in their original accounts.  They felt that the whole system was a nuisance, in a way, and they were very glad to get rid of it.</P>
    <P>In passing, I might say that business here has an advantage over business in England.  The amount paid by businessmen here on profits is 8/4d. in the £ and in England it is 9/9d.  Perhaps that is not a sufficient margin for a new country, as Senator McGuire pointed out, that has not the traditions and some of the advantages of English business, but, at any rate, that difference is there.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Income Tax <Col N="353" /> Commission, they have made two interim reports.  One of them has been heard of by everyone; it dealt with P.A.Y.E.  We have decided to adopt that and to bring that system into operation as soon as we possibly can. It will take some time, of course.  They have submitted now a second report, which I have not read fully yet and, therefore, I cannot say very much about it.  I think that Commission will do very useful work, at least in suggesting certain reforms in the system of taxation here.  I should like to say that, as far as I can read their proceedings and their work, I feel they are certainly working very hard.  They deserve every credit from the Government and from the people, for giving so much time and for giving their brains to this very difficult subject.  I should like, therefore, to express my appreciation of their work.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardMcGuire" hpid="Mr. McGuire Mr. McGuire">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGuire</NameTxt>
      <P>As this is the Committee Stage, it is nice to be able to get up again, when you have something to say.  The first thing I should like to say is that I am always rather annoyed when I hear people say, for instance, that private enterprise could not run the railways.  Of course, it could run the railways.  It is fashionable to say that the railways failed here under private enterprise.  I have always said this again and again, that they did not fail under private enterprise. Private enterprise was not allowed to work since 1914 on the Irish railways, when they were very wealthy, very strong and very efficient and a gilt-edged investment.</P>
      <P>What happened?  When the trade unions got into action and made wage demands, there was a Railway Tribunal set up, during the 1914-18 war, by the British Government, which did not allow the railways to translate their costs into their prices&mdash;and, of course, it did not work.  I could not run a private enterprise business if I were not allowed to have my prices include my costs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They had the Railway Tribunal sitting on them all the time, from 1914 up to the day they had to go out of business.  Incidentally, all the shareholders <Col N="354" /> lost all their investments and savings and all their goods, through no fault of their own and through no fault of private enterprise.</P>
    <P>It always rather annoys me to hear that only the State can run it.  I grant that only the State can run it under these conditions, because the State can always afford to run everything at a loss.  But we cannot afford to have everything run at a loss in the country. Private enterprise did not fail the railways. It was not allowed to function on a business basis.  Even today, it could do so, if it were allowed to function on a business basis and allowed to run only the amount of railway that would pay.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Minister that grants and subsidies and all sorts of things have been given to private enterprise, but that was just my very point.  I think it was the wrong way to do it. I say take away all the grants, take away all the sops and supports and let private enterprise function by taxation. If the direct taxation is lowered to such a degree, we shall then have an area of operation in which we can have our costs right.  At present, the most important thing, especially in view of the Free Trade Area, is to do away as quickly as we can with these protective barriers.  The protective barriers we set up&mdash;as much in my particular business, in clothing, as 135 per cent. and 90 per cent. preferential &mdash;surely will not be of any use in a Free Trade world, such as we heard about yesterday at the Conference in the Mansion House.</P>
    <P>The only incentive, the best prop and the best thing the Government can do in the future here is to forget about all sops and props and get around to lowering taxation.  It is definitely the answer to the whole thing, but it is fobbed off all the time when you mention it.  Every businessman, every banker, every chairman of a company, and every economist knows it, but we will not do it.  It is said that it cannot be done this year and that we might not be able to do it next year.  It seems to me that we will have to do it now and that we are getting the last chance.</P>
    <P>We were told yesterday at the <Col N="355" /> European Movement Conference, that we had an idea that we could get rid of tariff barriers gradually as undeveloped areas and be able to participate in the Free Trade Area and so on in due course.  We now learn there will not be any breaking-down period, that we have to go straight in and not with an economy made up of barriers.  I suggest that the right weapon, the sort of industry to be built if we are to live in the new Free Trade world, is the one in which taxation will be used as a weapon for creating a strong industrial economy. Then we may have the right degree of capital to run our own economy and we shall be able to run our own businesses and be able to produce at the right prices.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that Section 5 is intended to apply the provisions of the Finance Act, 1922, to grants for universities, colleges or schools, to assist them in the teaching of the natural sciences.  Is that correct? That is to say, money granted for the trust fund will be exempt from income tax.  I was wondering why this refers to the natural sciences in particular and how one defines a natural science in relation to a university, college or school.</P>
      <P>If the intention is that a rich person or a corporation should be encouraged to assist schools or colleges or a university, would one not imagine that the assistance should be a general one&mdash; that is, for any educational project, as distinct from the natural sciences? It would appear to me that the words &ldquo;natural sciences&rdquo; will give the Revenue Commissioners some trouble, but I presume that in some overriding way the Revenue Commissioners have power to define, for the purposes of this section, what natural sciences are.  I must say I should hate to be asked to define it myself.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The idea of putting in the sciences was that it was expected that business firms would make subscriptions for research and so on.  That is why it has been included.  We had some discussion on that definition of the &ldquo;natural sciences&rdquo;.  I think that if we put in &ldquo;science&rdquo; alone, it would be much more restricted.  That is my understanding of it.  &ldquo;Natural science&rdquo; brings in such a thing as mathematical physics.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I can understand that business firms might be desirous of granting money for the purpose of pursuing a particular kind of research, but one must also envisage the kind of rich man interested in education generally.  I put it to the Minister that the whole problem of education at the moment, which the most advanced scientists realise&mdash;such as Arts professors and literary people&mdash;is to provide us with people who are not merely scientists but who are educated as well. One would imagine that, if anyone wanted to give a sum of money under a deed or create a fund for education in general, he should be encouraged.</P>
      <P>I appreciate the Minister's point that you are thinking of certain types of firms but you might have people with a restricted point of view who might want to assist in education generally in the modern things, in classics and philosophy, which are very important and which everybody now acknowledges to be important from the point of view of science.  The most advanced scientists are very strong in their view that scientists should have a liberal education, if that can be accomplished. For example, why should an endowment, say, of a school of engineering, which at one time, when the Minister began his university career was only one subject, be included?  Engineering now consists of civil engineering, mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, and I am told there is a fourth type in the offing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter attracted my attention and I went to look for a definition of natural science.  I may be wrong, but I could not find a definition here.  In the circumstances here the natural sciences are not as neat as all that.  I think the generic term comes from natural philosophy, that is to say, mathematical physics, now called, in modern parlance, applied mathematics, in which, I take it, experimental physics is included.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>And I suppose chemistry, botany, zoology and geology.  Then we come to geography. Is it one of the natural sciences or is it not?  To my mind once you proceed to make groups, biology, biochemistry, you come to the different types of engineering, as Senator Hayes pointed out.  My point purely is: are we going to have some of our taxpayers arguing with the Revenue Commissioners as to whether, having given a subvention to a particular project, they are or are not within the section?  It seems to me that it would be desirable in the case of such a term as &ldquo;natural sciences&rdquo; that there should be some specificness about the paragraph of the subsection of the section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>What I should like to see&mdash;perhaps it is too much to ask the Minister to do it now&mdash;is that it would be &ldquo;for the purpose of assisting such university college or school&rdquo; full stop, rather than assist them to teach particular things.  After all, what we are concerned with and what the scientists want to impress upon the Minister is the assisting of university colleges or schools, in general terms, not in particular terms. The amount the revenue would lose would not be very great and certainly the encouragement to corporations or individuals to grant money for educational purposes is very desirable.  That is what the Minister has in mind and I rather feel it should be done without <Col N="358" /> the restriction of the &ldquo;natural sciences&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We wanted to give a bias towards the provision and expansion of industry by encouraging the teaching of the sciences.  I agree with Senator Hayes that all the education we can get in the other subjects would be useful, but, as I say, we wanted to give this bias.  These things have a habit of expanding and maybe it will come in time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not my point.  This is a proposal for legislation and I think legislation should be specific and accurate.  This discussion reminds me a bit of what happened to a person I knew who went into a Dublin nursing home to have a baby many years ago.  She was asked where was her glucose and she said she did not have any glucose.  When she went into the nursing home to have her next baby, she took with her a 7 lb. jar of glucose and the nurse said: &ldquo;Glucose?  You might as well have brought sawdust.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I suggest that this paragraph is a fashion of the moment.  If we are to be specific, let us define it specifically. I am all on the side of Senator Hayes: if you like, have a fund for research. In so far as the teaching of the natural sciences or the elementary aspects is concerned, in that sense, it would be far better to have a general provision for research and not just the fashion of the moment which we see in this proposed Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator realises that research is already provided for and that this is just an expansion of that research that is already provided for?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that but I do not understand why it should be the teaching of the natural sciences. As regards what is already provided for, I cannot understand why it should be selected now in this specific way. Of course, as I say, it may be pandering to some fashion of the moment but fashion is to be deprecated, particularly in long-term legislation, and I think I have given a very good illustration of the kind of thing that happens in relation to long-term <Col N="359" /> legislation based on the fashion of the moment.  Perhaps, as we say, it might be considered by the Minister.  Certainly we do not want to press it at the moment but there is the question of the specific definition of the natural sciences and the other question, which is more general, that you either define that specifically or make a general provision, one or the other.</P>

      <P>I just want to say a word about Section 10.  I was talking earlier about the necessity for encouraging foreign capital here and apparently the question of double taxation has been an impediment in the past.  This morning, in the post, we got notice of double taxation arrangements with Switzerland and South Africa.  The one to which I should like to refer and of which I have some personal knowledge concerns Sweden.  Apparently the Swedish Government have been trying for some time past to make a double taxation arrangement here.  I know of several desirable projects for this country that would emanate from Sweden, if such arrangement were in existence.  Apparently there has been some very long delay, though why I do not know.  I gather that such an arrangement does not exist.  What is happening about Sweden?</P>
      <P>I may say that one of the projects was in relation to afforestation.  We have not so much capital that we can afford to spend sufficient of it on afforestation, which is a long-term project.  A very big Swedish family want to get an interest in this country for afforestation purposes.  I gather that the matter has been held up for the want of a double taxation agreement with Sweden.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is right.  It was amended in some respects in the Dáil. He had the option to pay in one year but it could be spread over six years. Now, where hardships would result, where it would bring him into the surtax group, he can spread it out a little longer.  Furthermore, where he has children in respect of whom he is eligible for relief, he has the option of saying: &ldquo;I would prefer to pay over three or four years while the children are eligible for relief.&rdquo;  Therefore, he has a certain option of varying the six years up or down.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very hard to be a rich person and there must be considerable difficulties attached to being a rich person, difficulties which have entirely escaped me up to the moment. This is a Bill of 82 sections and it is a wonderful example of legislation by reference.  It must be extremely difficult for any person to find out what precisely his rights and his liabilities are under the income tax code.  Section <Col N="362" /> 82 describes how the parts of the Bill are to be construed and the last subsection, subsection (8) reads:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Any reference in this Act to any other enactment shall, except so far as the context otherwise requires, be construed as a reference to that enactment as amended by or under any other enactment, including this Act.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Supposing some unfortunate citizen or, should I say, some extremely fortunate citizen, wants to find out what his rights and liabilities are, has he not an extraordinary task?  I do not know whether the Income Tax Acts could be consolidated.  In America&mdash;I am not sure about this; it is not my business&mdash;they pass a new Act every year so that you can find all the information you require within one volume, but you cannot find it here without extraordinary references and cross-references.  I was interested in this legislation in relation to educational endowments and it referred me to the 1922 Act, the 1957 Act and the 1958 Act, and then I found out that there was the 1942 Act as well.</P>
      <P>If you have any substantial income, you have to employ an expert and I am told by business firms that as well as employing experts on income tax, they also have to employ experts on customs duty.  If you import any considerable quantity of goods, it pays you to employ a special person to do nothing else but wrestle with customs officers.  The customs officers can be very charming people but they are bound up in this extraordinary code. Therefore, you have to pay the tax, plus the cost of finding out what you have to pay, or rather, plus the cost of finding out what is the minimum you must pay.  In other words, the Minister for Finance is indirectly an employer of labour.  Apart from the civil servants who help him and apart from the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Finance, there are other people, accountants, income tax inspectors and various other people who are employed helping citizens and sometimes, I suppose I should say, impeding citizens in grappling with those Acts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="363" /> We are always saying we object to legislation by reference, but this is the most fantastic example of legislation by reference we have ever had. What I was told about it turned out to be true: &ldquo;The Finance Bill will not take very long because it is too technical.&rdquo;  Could anything be truer? Technical and all as it is, there are unfortunate people who have to know what it means and it leads to the employment of large numbers of experts.  Perhaps we should not be sorry for that.  All I want is to have the code simplified for the ordinary person who is liable to income tax&mdash; and it applies to a great many more people now than before.  I am not arguing on the merits of the Bill but in relation to the form of the Bill, the complexity of its cross-references and the difficulty of understanding what it really means.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeOBrien" hpid="Professor O'Brien Professor O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to add a word or two to what Senator Hayes has said.  I have been asked by some members of the accounting profession to complain to the Minister that the Finance Acts are not readily accessible in convenient form and I have been told that it is very difficult to come by the 1958 Finance Act in a convenient form.  I have been asked to request the Minister to ensure that this Act will be available soon for chartered accountants, solicitors and other people who wish to consult it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This arises out of what Senator Hayes has said and perhaps I might add this.  The very complexity of the legislation in itself serves a useful purpose. There would be a great deal more unemployment amongst the B.Comms. from University College, if it were not for all the work which chartered accountants do in trying to interpret the various Finance Acts every year.  I have actually been attacked for my attempts to simplify the income tax code by these professional people saying:&mdash;&ldquo;If you had your way, there would be no jobs for us.&rdquo;  I am all in favour of this Bill. The more complex it is, the better.  The more sections and the more reference to other Acts the better but I would ask the Minister to ensure that the <Col N="364" /> professional interpreters of this legislation will have copies available for interpretation.</P>

      <P>The second report from the Income Tax Commission I have not had very long and I must confess that I have not read it very fully.  It deals with Schedule A tax and a few <Col N="365" /> other odds and ends of that kind.  The inclination seems to be to tie things up, anyway.  They mean to report further. I think they are doing very good work. They are working very hard, indeed. It is a very complicated subject, as was mentioned by some of the speakers. They seem to be doing very well in getting a grip of the subject.</P>
      <P>There are 82 sections in this Bill, as Senator Hayes pointed out, but practically all of them give relief of some kind or another to some section or other.  There is practically no new penalty provided at all in this Bill.  It is very different in that way from last year's Bill.</P>
      <P>With regard to the point raised by Senator O'Brien, last year's Act is not yet out in a convenient form.  It is in a long white form.  We have not reached yet the tidy form in which Acts are published.  There seems to be a good deal of translation involved.  I gave an undertaking to the Dáil to try to get things hurried in that respect.</P>

My income tax is not very involved; I <Col N="366" /> do not get my income from many sources.  Yet, I never understood income tax law and I had to get an expert to do it.  On one occasion, the expert disappeared with my papers.  I was told that the best thing I could do was to go to O'Connell Street and tell my tale.  I was not Minister at that time.  I asked for a man.  I gave him my name and address.  He looked up my forms fairly hurriedly and told me to come back, that he wanted to talk to me about this.  I went back in fear and trembling.  He asked me some questions.  He said to me: &ldquo;Look, I think you paid far too much money.&rdquo;</P>
