    <Title>Referendum (Amendment) Bill, 1958&mdash;Second and Subsequent Stages.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Minister for Local Government (Mr. Blaney) Neil T. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Blaney)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill makes provisions for a new form of ballot paper to be used at a constitutional referendum; for facilities for voting by certain persons employed by local returning officers and for giving voters a summary of the proposal which is the subject of the referendum on the Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1958.  The Bill also includes provisions designed to secure uniformity where the poll at a constitutional referendum and a Presidential election is taken on the same day.</P>
      <P>The necessity for a new form of ballot paper arises from Section 15 (5) of the Referendum Act, 1942, under which the proposal on which a constitutional referendum is held must be stated on the ballot paper in the same terms as nearly as may be as it is stated in the Bill containing the proposal. I am advised that to comply with this provision it would be necessary to set out on the ballot paper virtually the whole text of the Bill to amend the Constitution.  It would obviously be quite impracticable to do this with an extensive Bill such as the Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1958.  It is proposed, therefore, in Section 1 of the present Bill that the proposal which is the subject of the referendum should be stated on the ballot paper by citing the short title of the Bill containing the proposal.  The opportunity has also been taken to have a bilingual from of ballot paper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 2 and the Second Schedule of the Bill provide for the necessary <Col N="1352" /> changes in Section 15 of the Act of 1942 and in the questions to be asked by a presiding officer of an incapacitated voter wishing to have his ballot paper marked.  In the case of a referendum on the Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1958, <i>ad hoc</i> provisions for dealing with incapacitated voters are included in Section 5, to which I shall come in a few moments.</P>
    <P>Under Section 3 of the Bill it is proposed to enable a local returning officer to authorise persons in his employment, such as poll clerks and presiding officers, who are prevented by the circumstances of their employment from voting at their normal polling station, to vote at a specified other polling station in their constituency, which in practice will generally be the polling stations at which they are employed.  There is a corresponding provision in the law relating to Dáil and local elections. If the poll at a Presidential election or general election is taken on the same day as a poll at a constitutional referendum, an authorisation of the local returning officer will, under Section 4 of the Bill, operate to enable the person to whom it is given to vote at the specified other polling station at that election also.</P>
    <P>Under Section 28 of the Referendum Act, 1942, provision is made to secure uniformity of polling places, hours of poll, and of procedure generally where the poll at a constitutional referendum and a general election is taken on the same day. Section 4 of the present Bill extends these provisions to the case where the poll at a constitutional referendum is taken on the same day as the poll at a Presidential election.  The section does not provide that the constitutional referendum and a general or Presidential election shall be held on the same day.  It merely lays down the procedure to be followed if that does occur.</P>
    <P>It was found possible to secure the agreement of all Parties in the Dáil to a statement containing a summary of the principal proposals in the Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1958, and it is proposed in Section 5 to incorporate this statement <Col N="1353" /> in the polling cards to be issued by local returning officers to voters, including postal voters, at a referendum in relation to that Bill.  It is proposed to provide that copies of the statement may be displayed at polling stations, and to adjust the rules governing voting by incapacitated voters so that they can have the summary contained in the statement read to them if, after being told the short title, i.e., &ldquo;Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1958&rdquo;, they do not understand the import of the question: &ldquo;Do you approve of or do you object to that Bill becoming law?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In addition, copies of the Bill will be made available for inspection and purchase at post offices (about 2,300 in all) throughout the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to make just a few points on this Bill.  I believe the Bill has been changed substantially since it was first issued, because, as issued, it deprived the voter completely of any information. He was merely asked: &ldquo;Do you approve of the Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill?&rdquo;  A big step forward has been made by bringing in the agreed Appendix, but a few points occur to me in this connection. First of all, if I understand the Minister correctly, the necessity for this amendment arose because he felt it impossible to include a summary of the proposals on the ballot paper without printing the whole Bill.  Surely that difficulty could have been got over by agreement between all Parties on a summary of the principal proposals of the Bill.  In fact, you got that agreement on the Appendix and I cannot see why the Appendix could not have been agreed in the original form of the ballot paper as a proper statement of the proposals to the voters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to hear what the Minister has to say on that, but a more serious objection, in my view, is that the changes, the very drastic changes, that have been made in this Bill are purely <i>ad hoc</i> and apply only to the present amendment of the Constitution, the Third Amendment, but they give the Government, or any future <Col N="1354" /> Government, absolute <i>carte blanche</i> to apply the Bill in its original form to all future amendments of the Constitution. In other words, as I read it Section 5 goes dead once the Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill is over.  So all the safeguards, all of the Appendix and the necessity for the Appendix, even the necessity of making a copy of the full text of the Bill available to the public&mdash;all that goes by the board when the referendum is over.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand why such very desirable safeguards, such safeguards as were agreed, and fought to agreement in the Dáil, could not be incorporated by way of permanent legislation. I hope we may on the Committee Stage amend Section 5, so that the provisions set out here apply to all future referenda&mdash;that you must have this agreed summary available and you must go through this procedure.  Alternatively&mdash;and I think it is a better alternative&mdash;we could scrap this whole Act, once this is over and get back to the 1942 Act, as amended in 1946 which, in my view, is a much sounder and a fairer approach to holding a referendum. You also give the people a chance of knowing what they really are voting on.  I believe we should have either of these alternatives, my preference by far being for the first, but the second has worked out here as a good second.</P>
    <P>I am not saying this solely to the present Government.  There may be future Governments with very big majorities, especially if this amendment of the Constitution is passed. They will be here and we are giving them <i>carte blanche</i> now to drive a coach and four through the Constitution, because they can bring in any amendment they wish and they can drive it through both Dáil and Seanad by their huge majorities and then all they need to do is to bring the first form of the ballot paper to the electorate. All they need ask the electorate is: &ldquo;Do you approve of the Tenth Amendment of the Constitution Bill?&rdquo; That complies with the constitutional provisions.</P>
    <P>I submit we are taking a very dangerous step here and I cannot see that there can be any objection to <Col N="1355" /> amending this in Committee to ensure that Section 5 is not merely <i>ad hoc</i> but applies to all future referenda on the Constitution, unless it is changed by another amendment of the 1942 Act. Otherwise, we are bound by the operative sections of the Bill which leave us in the very bad position that we were in when this Bill first reached the Dáil.  Surely it is a tribute to the work of the Opposition and to the common sense of the Government that they came together and agreed on how to put this in a fairer and clearer way to the electorate.</P>
    <P>The other point I want to make, and I do not wish to take up the time of the House, is the necessity&mdash;I know I cannot advocate it on the present Bill to any great extent but perhaps I may make just a passing reference to it&mdash; of further amending the 1942 Act to ensure adequate safeguards for our Constitution, whether against the present Government or the Government of 1970 or 1980.  Such safeguards will ensure that before any Government attempt to bring in amendments to the Constitution, they will, first of all, set up an adequately constituted commission to go into the question completely and impartially and to give a detailed report on it as a basis of legislation for amendment of the Constitution.</P>
    <P>We are setting a very bad precedent at present.  We are bringing Party politics into the amendment of our Constitution.  Whatever happens the present amendment of the Constitution, the Government or any succeeding Government should take steps to ensure that our Constitution is safeguarded and that there is written into the 1942 Act by way of amendment the proper, impartial, non-Party approach, that should in future be taken to amending the Constitution.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>An amendment to this Bill was passed in the Dáil whereby it is possible to have the Presidential election and the referendum on the same day.  I hold this is unfair and, as Senator Quinlan says, is introducing Party politics.  I know there was agreement on the point, but I think it unjust and improper when there are two political candidates for the Presidency, that an election should be held on the same day to amend the Constitution.  When the Constitution was passed, the cry was that it was above Party politics &mdash;that the people should forget Party and vote for the Constitution, judging it on its merits.  Now the Constitution is enshrined as our safeguard.  Is it proper or right that a political election should be held on the same day as a referendum to amend the Constitution?  Is it right that the full Party circus on both sides should be taken out and the whole propaganda campaign fought on the same day in which two Party candidates are contesting the Presidential election?  I hold it is improper, unjust and politically dishonest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardMcGuire" hpid="Mr. McGuire Mr. McGuire">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGuire</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say a word on how we on this side of the House feel about this Bill.  It is purely a machinery Bill.  We remember that at the beginning of this debate&mdash;I notice it was dropped later &mdash;it was asserted that we were opposed to having a referendum at all and that we were trying to prevent the people from voting on this referendum on the subject of the removal of P.R.  In practical refutation of this assertion, we do not oppose this Bill.  What we are opposed to very strongly, and what we have voted against very strongly, is the subject of the referendum. Therefore, we have concentrated all our efforts on the Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill and have put everything we have into showing that we think the subject of the referendum is wrong and that the idea of removing P.R. and replacing it by the single non-transferable vote is wrong.  It is a very bad thing; we have resisted it in every possible way and we shall continue to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1357" /> We do not oppose this referendum being held.  If the subject has to be decided upon, we are in favour of the machinery being set up in this Bill. The Opposition Parties in the Dáil take credit for the very good precedent that has now been established in this Bill of giving the electorate a reasonable explanation of what they are being asked to vote upon.  Anybody who has listened to the debate in this House or the other House will concede that the electorate are faced with a very knotty and deep problem.  It would be pathetic if this Bill had gone through in its original form and the people had been asked merely to put an &ldquo;X&rdquo; against something with deep implications inherent in the proposition upon which the referendum was taken.  We do not oppose this Bill.  It is as good as we can get as a machinery Bill to carry out the referendum on the subject, but we think the referendum should never have been held at all.  The subject should never have arisen and there is no necessity for it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall deal with the points made in the order in which Senators spoke.  The general tone of Senator Quinlan's remarks seems to be directed, in the first instance, towards showing that there was no real change in the actual terms of the Referendum Act of 1942, as amended in 1946.  He departs from us in that he feels there was no necessity for the provisions contained in Section 5, which are merely <i>ad hoc</i> so far as the referendum is concerned.  I outlined, during the various stages of the Bill in the Dáil, the law as I saw it, and said I had been advised that the law would require a statement to go on the ballot paper.  First of all, this statement would have to be an authoritative statement; and, secondly, because of the nature of the Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill, I am very definitely advised that practically the entire text of the Bill would be required on the ballot paper.  I think offhand that would entail about 13 pages.  I do not think it could be regarded as feasible that a ballot paper should have 13 pages of text attached to it.  Indeed, even if that <Col N="1358" /> were done, it would add nothing to the knowledge of the voter.  Rather than having 12 hours for voting, we would likely have to run the election for a week in order that every voter would have time to read the entire text of the Bill in the polling station before marking his or her paper.</P>
      <P>I have already paid tribute to the agreement we got in the Dáil, which made it possible to put in this <i>ad hoc</i> section.  In passing, I might say that on the Second Stage of the Bill, I invited the Opposition to come to such an agreement, rather than that I was forced into it by them.  I invited them to make their suggestions and, in fact, privately outside the House, I went to them myself to seek the agreement.  We were not forced into it, and while I pay tribute to the Opposition in the Dáil for their ready agreement and co-operation in this matter, it should not go on the record of this House that we on the Government side were brought to that position by the Opposition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardMcGuire" hpid="Mr. McGuire Mr. McGuire">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGuire</NameTxt>
      <P>There was good co-operation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Undoubtedly; but I want to straighten the matter and let it be known there was that co-operation on all sides, rather than any suggested coercion from the other side of the House.  The suggestion has been made, and indeed it was made in the Dáil also&mdash;before we got the agreed statement&mdash;that if there had not been any statement, or if we did not get this type of statement in the future for any future referenda, the people would be unlikely to have a knowledge of what they were voting for.  I do not think and I did not think when I spoke on this matter, in the first instance, that there is any likelihood that anything could possibly be put across the people that will not have been put to them from every angle.  Over the weeks which have passed, and the weeks that have yet to come before this referendum is taken&mdash;and I think that would apply in all cases to the taking of a referendum&mdash;the Parties and public generally will have discussed this <Col N="1359" /> matter to such a degree that indeed I doubt if the question of any statement, whether on the ballot paper or on the polling card, as we propose here, is at all necessary.  I doubt it because of the interest that has been around and the publicity that has been given to the discussions in this House and in Dáil Éireann.</P>
      <P>As an instance of what I mean, let us look at the hours taken in discussing the Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill in the Dáil.  The total number amounted to 96 sitting hours.  There were 50 hours on the Second Reading, 36½ on the Committee Stage, one and three-quarters on the Report Stage and eight and three-quarters on the Final Stage.  Important though this third amendment may be, it is nevertheless but a small part of the entire provisions of our Constitution, as enacted back in 1937, and the total time taken to discuss the Draft Constitution in the Dáil in 1937 was 68¼ hours.  We have alrady had 96 hours' discussion in the Dáil on just one part of the Constitution.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not debating the merits or demerits of the Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill.  I am merely dealing with the Senators who feel that the provisions for taking a referendum are such, and can be such in the future, that our people will not know possibly what they are voting for.  I am pointing out, irrespective of the agreed statement contained in and covered by certain <i>ad hoc</i> provisions in Section 5, that despite that, and had the fact never existed at all, I hold that the publicity and the debates and discussions have been so wide and lasted for so long that our voters must be credited with sufficient intelligence to realise what they will be doing when this vote comes to take place.  That is why I say that 96 hours were spent on a small part of the Constitution when only 68¼ hours were spent on the Draft Constitution in 1937.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Donegan mentioned the unfairness of having these two votes held on the same day.  I went to some <Col N="1360" /> pains in my introductory speech to point out that this Bill which I am piloting through this House does not provide that they shall be held on the same day.  It merely makes certain provisions in the event of the two occurring on the same day.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>As a matter of interest, just to show the minds of various people, despite how their allegiances may differ, here is a quotation from a speech made on 11th December, 1958, in the debate on the Third Amendment of the Constitution.  We had Deputy Everett talking about the likelihood of there being a clash of the two dates for the Presidential election and for the proposed referendum, and he said at column 1985, Volume 171:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I would ask the Government to consider these matters before putting the people to the expense of a referendum. Furthermore, if we are to have a referendum, why not have it on the same day as the Presidential election?  This would be better than spending £80,000 or £90,000 for this referendum and then having to spend a further sum of this magnitude for the Presidential election. Alternatively would it not be feasible when holding the referendum on P.R. to find out whether the people want a President or not?&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That was in last December, but the point really is the one which I have made in the first instance, that I am not really dealing with the fixing of these two events on the one day, but I am making the provision necessary for taking the two events if they fell on the same day.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it a fact that the Government are merely waiting until the Bill passes to announce that the two events will be held on the same day, in which eventuality the matter cannot be debated?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as that is concerned, I think the Senator has raised something there.  It just occurs to me that, to some degree, the wishes of the two Houses should be known before these things are announced.  In other words, I think we should not jump the gun.  Despite what all Deputies and Senators may think on this question of waiting until the two Houses have passed these Bills, I think it is no harm to point out that if so much time had not been taken&mdash;not in this House but in the other House&mdash;it would have been possible to have had this referendum well in advance of the Presidential election; and well in advance would have been a much better arrangement than to have it within a week or a few days of it.  In my opinion if you went down the country as a politician and said: &ldquo;We are having the referendum on Monday, and the Presidential election on Friday,&rdquo; then I think it likely that if you appeared in that district looking for votes in a general election, the people would probably run you out of it.  That tallies more or less with Deputy Everett's view here.  In relation to Senator Donegan's remarks, in this Bill I am merely taking very reasonable precautions, lest the two should be held on the one day, so that we may have a sensible arrangement and so that there will be uniformity of practice in the use of polling stations, presiding officers, staffs, and so on.  The suggestion by Deputy Donegan that the holding of the two on the same day would bring politics into it is a matter on which no comment is necessary.  Any of these matters is really the essence of politics and it would be a bad thing for the country if politics should disappear. Candidly, I do not think there is a danger in the world that politics will disappear.</P>

      <P>The question of Party <Col N="1362" /> politics as against politics is one which is too subtle for me to appreciate fully. Politics to me are politics and this second tag we have attached to that word in recent times is merely an attempt to suggest that Party politics are something different.  I do not see the difference.  If we are to have politics, we will have Parties.  Without Parties, we cannot have democracy. Therefore, we have Parties and Party politics.</P>

      <P>The only thing I want to get clear from the Senator's question is as to which matter he considers contains the contaminating politics he fears.  Is it the Presidential election or the referendum?  However, I hope I have answered satisfactorily the points raised by Senators, but if not, they will, on the later stages, have an opportunity of getting fuller information on the points they want to put across. Perhaps some Senators may wish now to ask some question which I have not covered, and I shall try to cover it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to put two questions to the Minister.  Does the Minister not consider that it would be far better that an amendment of the Constitution should be approached on a non-Party basis, that our Constitution <Col N="1363" /> is too sacred to become the plaything of Party politics?  Secondly, I would appreciate it if the Minister would explain why Section 5 cannot be made permanent.  It seems that just a few alterations would accomplish that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall take the latter question first, as to why we would not consider making Section 5 permanent. In order to have Section 5, it is necessary to have the agreement that we were lucky and happy to get on this occasion.  It may not always be possible to get such agreement. Secondly, it may not always be necessary to have an agreed statement, because you could envisage, in relation to certain amendments to the Constitution, the title being self-explanatory and not requiring any summary or synopsis of its contents. Would it not be superfluous, to say the least of it, to have this title, which title would appear on the ballot paper, and then to put it elsewhere on the ballot paper saying that this was the proposal?  You would be duplicating and it would not make any great sense.</P>
      <P>We were lucky and happy to get agreement on this occasion, but I do not and cannot foresee that in the case of all other proposals the same facility would be available to whatever Government might be in office at that time.  It is also worthy of note that, from our experience of the operation of Section 5, we will have learned something, just as we have learned something from the years that have passed since the earlier Acts became law.  It may well be that some future Government and some future Minister will bring in a section as an alternative to Section 5, which may be a very great improvement.  That may be as feasible as is this Section 5 and this amendment of the Referendum Act we are now bringing through both Houses of the Oireachtas.  In the Dáil, dealing with the same suggestion by Deputies there, I had this to say at column 179, Volume 173, of the Dáil Debates of 25th February, 1959:&mdash;</P>

      <Col N="1364" />&ldquo;With reference to the application of that practice to all future referenda, which seems to be the Deputy's wish, I can only say that I still have the same objections as I had on the Committee Stage.  While we undoubtedly have got agreement in this instance, if we were to make this part of permanent legislation, governing all future referenda, we might not so readily, if at all, get agreement as to the form of the summary.  It is solely for that good reason&mdash;I consider it a very good reason&mdash;that we are leaving this as an <i>ad hoc</i> arrangement.  As well as that, we shall gain some experience of how this <i>ad hoc</i> arrangement works.  As a result of that experience, we may possibly incorporate it as a permanent feature in this kind of legislation.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was my answer to the same type of question as the Senator has asked, and nothing has happened since then to change my mind.  I still feel the same way about this <i>ad hoc</i> Section 5 in the Bill.</P>

      <P>First of all, we should pay tribute to the Minister for the great effort he made to get agreement on this.  It would be ungenerous of us not to do that and I do hope that when this is over, the Minister will consider substituting some type of permanent legislation for the <i>ad hoc</i> arrangement we have here.  When the Minister suggests that where the amendment would be trivial, the title would convey all the information, surely we are back to the 1942 Act, <Col N="1365" /> because that would have satisfied the 1942 Act and would have satisfied the requirements of the ballot paper at that time.  I should like to ask the Minister if he will give some assurance to the House that we will get some type of permanent legislation.  We have wiped out the relevant section of the 1942 Act and we have not put permanent legislation in its place.  I, for one, would hate to see that left over until a new Government comes in with a majority of at least five to one in both Houses, after the Third Amendment to the Constitution Bill has been passed.</P>

I do not want to be taken as opposing this agreement or opposing the Bill, which is a machinery Bill, but I should like to make it clear that I do not approve of the position in which the electors are being put an omnibus question.  Not one question is being put, but three, and it could very well be that some of the people voting would be inclined to answer &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; to the first question, and &ldquo;No&rdquo; to the second question, and &ldquo;No&rdquo; to the third, but there is no choice in the matter.  They have to take the three questions together and answer &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;No&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The three questions are: first, do they approve of the single member constituency instead of the multi-member constituency as at present operating; secondly, do they approve of the non-transferable vote instead of the transferable vote; and&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I do not intend to discuss the merits on both sides.  We have already done that.  I want to ask the Seanad where exactly we are going in this matter because we are discussing in this section the question of putting the three questions in a lump to the electorate, and the Seanad has already decided that one of the questions is not to be put by deleting subsection (1) of Section 2 of the Schedule yesterday.

      <P>I thought that we would take the Appendix separately.  I should like to endorse every word spoken by Senator Murphy. If we make such a virtue of consulting the people, as has been suggested in this discussion, then we should consult the people adequately, and fully, on the three questions.  They should be put as three distinct questions.  As I said earlier, our representatives in the United Nations have thought that even in other countries, in Africa for example, the people should not be asked multiple questions but should be asked: Do you approve of 1?  Do you approve of 2?  Do you approve of <Col N="1367" /> 3?  Do you approve of 4?  They should be given four alternatives.  Here we have two alternatives and it is unfair to the people that they should be asked this dual question.  Obviously there should be two separate questions. Furthermore, when revising the present machinery Bill, care should be taken to ensure that no such conglomerate questions are put to the electorate in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>First I shall reply to the last point made by Senator Quinlan and Senator Murphy about the Appendix, the question of the agreed statement, the unfairness of putting two and three questions together, that the omnibus question is an unfair procedure and the questions should be put separately.  The main point is that, in so far as the Government are concerned at the moment, we are merely proceeding according to the Constitution, which provides that when a Bill containing certain proposed amendments to the Constitution is passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas, the matter then goes to the people for their final verdict.</P>
      <P>In so far as this matter of separate questions is concerned, I can see a certain amount of what we might call argument in favour, in one way, of putting them separately, but has it occurred to Senators that in a break-down into several questions and having got the people to vote on possibly half a dozen&mdash;mind you, there are three questions mentioned, but there could be half a dozen questions, because the one about the commission could be separated into goodness knows how many&mdash;we could well have a situation arising from our desire to meet the people in a straight and fair manner in the sense of getting each question answered &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo; in which we could have a combination of answers on this one matter we are dealing with, which did not make any sense and all our trouble would have been for naught in respect of telling us to go ahead or to stay back.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from that, there is one point I should like to put to those who, from their remarks, object to the <Col N="1368" /> Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill and are opposed to the matter generally, some in part, and some in whole.  I should like to say that the disadvantages, and there are disadvantages, to the people sponsoring these proposals, are that there could be three different issues, two of which many people might agree with, while disagreeing with the third.</P>
    <P>The normal procedure is that when something exists in a certain form, when someone proposes to change one of its items and when in order to change one, all three must be changed, if a person does not want to change all three, but agrees to change one or two, he will disagree with all three.  So there is a disadvantage, in fact, to the proposers of this proposal to amend the Constitution in the fact that there are three or four questions rather than one straight question.  There is an advantage to those who are against the idea of a Third Amendment of the Constitution in the very fact of there being three questions contained in the one proposal and it is a disadvantage to the Government who are making this proposal to the people. I think that while it may not be the logical straight answer to the argument already made, it should at least be acceptable to them, because, in fact, we are, from our point of view, at a disadvantage in putting it in this manner, in the form of an omnibus question.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is just one point&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Senator does not mind, I shall try to answer the other point before I finish.  The Senator is also sad about the matter of making permanent legislation, and he would like an undertaking from me that the terms of Section 5, or some terms equivalent to Section 5, will be made permanent in the future, will be incorporated in some permanent legislation. Irrespective of what I might think about that suggestion, I would not be in a position to commit myself&mdash;possibly not myself but some other Minister in my position in time to come&mdash; to make that permanent legislation in <Col N="1369" /> the future.  He has mentioned the trivial matters that could be covered&mdash; he assumed they might be trivial&mdash; with regard to being self-explanatory in the Titles in the future, but I do not quite agree.</P>
      <P>For instance, we could have &ldquo;The Abolition of Seanad Éireann&rdquo;, but I do not agree that is a trivial matter and again, just for the purposes of argument, we could have &ldquo;The Abolition of the Presidency.&rdquo;  I do not think that is a trivial matter, either.  Both of those are possible situations that somebody, not feeling so kindly disposed to the Seanad as I and my colleagues are at the moment, might wish to bring about in the future.  In such an event, that would not be regarded as a trivial matter and I think, with the <i>ad hoc</i> provisions of Section 5, the Title as set out at the moment in present legislation would, in fact, be adequate without any summary and, even if a summary had to be devised, I do not think there could be an agreed summary. But, if it were necessary, or if it were felt to be necessary, it would be completely and absolutely surplus to have another statement.  No matter how you would summarise it you would have to say in the same words &ldquo;Abolition of the Presidency&rdquo;, or &ldquo;Abolition of the Seanad&rdquo;.  Those are some examples and there are others that could be trotted out.  These are obvious cases of matters that can be covered by Titles only, and are self-explanatory in that form, but are themselves not of a trivial nature.</P>
      <P>The only other point I wish to deal with is that raised by Senator Murphy and I think, in answering Senator Quinlan, I have answered his point about the omnibus question.  We are merely following the procedure laid down in the Constitution, that of putting our proposals in the form of a Bill to both Houses of the Oireachtas and, when those two Houses have finished with the Bill, in whatever form it finally emerges, the actual proposals contained in it should then go to the people for their decision.  It is their decision&mdash;not ours&mdash;that really counts.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Minister on the difficulties connected with the omnibus question and the fact <Col N="1370" /> that it does act to a slight extent against the Government, but surely, in the very same sentence, the Minister admits that they are not consulting the people?  The people are merely being asked to rubber-stamp what the Government have done.</P>

      <P>I understand from the very involved explanation given by the Minister, in regard to what I would call the portmanteau question, that it is impossible to put this serious question fairly to the people without its putting its proposers at a grave disadvantage. Therefore, the implication to me is that it must be put unfairly to the people. Putting this portmanteau question in one &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo; form is unfair, and the proposers of the abolition of P.R. are acting unfairly in doing that. That is the only inference I can draw from the Minister's statement.</P>

In view of the very nature of the terms involved in the proposals, a combination of answers could be given to certain combinations of questions which would make no sense to anyone.  Therefore, we take this as an omnibus question in which all these are intertwined, intertied and related, and the answer then will be either for or against a changing of the system.</P>

      <P>Without going into the fact that there could be six or seven questions, if we wanted to bring this to its logical conclusion, it is well to remember that there are two main questions, the non-transferable vote and the single seat constituency.  I can visualise that some of the Senators opposite might like to have the single seat constituency, but to have the transferable vote with it.  If the proposals were put to the people in the form of two questions, dealing with those matters, the people might vote for the present multi-seat constituency and the non-transferable vote, and I am quite sure that nobody opposite wants that result.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DominickMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that Senator Ryan has brought this question down to earth by making the point that there are two matters involved in it. As we know, from the amendments put down by Senators to the other Bill, even in this House there are people who apparently would like single seat constituencies with the transferable vote.  Surely it is unfair to those Senators, and to people who think like them, that they should not get an opportunity of answering those questions separately?  I do not see that it is impracticable to put those questions separately and I believe it would be very easy to have them answered separately.  If that were done, the result would clearly show the will of the people, and Fianna Fáil have been making a great point that it is the people who are to decide. Let the people decide on these two questions.  Let them have the opportunity of saying &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo; to those two main questions rather than bulk them together and <Col N="1372" /> tell the people: &ldquo;You will have to say &lsquo;yes&rsquo; or &lsquo;no&rsquo; to them together.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGuire</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the sub-section that provides that members <Col N="1373" /> shall be elected on the system of the single non-transferable vote.  The whole debate to my mind, so far, has shown what I said on the Second Reading to be true, that the decision to try to establish a system of election on the single non-transferable vote was taken first and that the arguments were found later.  This is clear from the confused, limited and often contradictory case that has been made by the sponsors of the Bill.  I propose to give just a few of the many examples of confusion and contradiction that are apparent.</P>
      <P>In order to prove that P.R. has not worked satisfactorily in this country, the sponsors of this Bill have been arguing that P.R. has not worked in other countries.  They have produced a series of examples from all over the world that have no relation to the kind of P.R. operated here.  We have been told that there are some 300 varieties of P.R. and last night Senator Lenihan told us that no P.R. system in the world is like ours.  Surely there is confusion and contradiction here.  If, out of all the 300 systems, we have a unique one, it seems to be rather futile to spend so much time in this debate arguing that P.R. did not work in those other countries where it bears no relation to our own P.R. system.  If the P.R. system here is unique, it seems to me it is wrong to suggest also that the P.R. system here is an English system.  If the P.R. system which we have is, as Senator Lenihan tells us, unique, then it must be Irish.</P>
      <P>Secondly, there is the fact that it was solemnly enshrined in our Constitution. I say that unique system was solemnly enshrined in our Constitution by referendum and all through this debate we are being told how important and solemn a thing it is for the people to decide an issue in a referendum.  The people decided in the enactment of the Constitution that P.R. was to be the system of election and they decided, in doing so, that it was our Irish system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Surely these are examples of inconsistency and, I suggest, waste of time. When I made the case on the Second Reading and illustrated how the straight vote system had not worked democratically in England or in <Col N="1374" /> Northern Ireland, the Minister in his reply suggested that if I thought that way, it would be advisable for me to go and lecture the English people on their system.  That is very inconsistent on his part because we have been told by the sponsors and supporters of the Bill of all the wrong things that are happening in France and Italy and South America.  If the Minister is to be consistent, it would seem to me that for us to suggest to his own Party that they should go on a lecture tour to tell the people of Italy and France about this subject would be just as relevant as that he should suggest that I make a tour of England.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to make a tour of England or America.  I am here as an Irish Senator and I shall do my duty, so far as I see it, in opposing the removal of P.R. here.  I do not propose to concern myself with whether or not the English do wrong.  I think they do, or it may be right for them, but it certainly is not right for us and I am going to confine my efforts, such as they are and limited as they are, to my own country.</P>
    <P>As it happens, I do go to England quite a lot and I happen to know a number of political people.  Strange to say, they are not Conservatives and they are not Labour.  On several occasions, I have been asked to speak on the subject of P.R. in a certain constituency in England, but I refused to do so.  I said it would be quite wrong for me to go to another country and start criticising their system of government which is a matter for themselves. I have gone to meetings there and listened to the speeches, but although I was several times asked to go on the platform and say a few words, I declined to do so, and, I think, rightly.</P>
    <P>Another example of confusion&mdash;it may be due to seeing the same thing in different ways, which I suppose is quite human and natural&mdash;was this. Senator Mullins, in a very painstaking effort, traced the history of British elections since the beginning of the century.  I was not quite sure what he was trying to prove, but, to my mind, he did prove that the straight voting system operated in England and which <Col N="1375" /> it is proposed to bring in here, eliminated small Parties and Independents, so that in Britain they are eventually left with only a Labour Party and a Tory Party and a negligible number of Liberals, in spite of the fact that the Liberals got a considerable number of votes.  I do not think there is a single Independent in the House of Commons, unless those who are rebels from the two big Parties and who will inevitably vanish at the next election.  A.P. Herbert recently put his name forward as an Independent candidate, but I heard him say on television that he was a realist and that he would be wasting his time going up, that his only chance was to go up as a candidate for one or other of the Parties.  Therefore, he withdrew his candidature.</P>
    <P>To my mind, Senator Mullins proved one thing&mdash;I do not know whether it was what he was trying to prove&mdash;and that it is that as a result of the single non-transferable vote, England had got just two big Parties, one completely Right and one completely Left.  They have this swing from nationalisation to denationalisation, this swing from the public ownership of council houses to the enunciation that people should own their own houses.  You have these amazing Right and Left swings which achieve anything but the stability we are told this type of vote would achieve here.</P>
    <P>The sponsors of this Bill see nothing wrong in eliminating small Parties and Independents.  They more or less blatantly said that.  That is the difference between us and the supporters of this Bill and this sub-section. They see nothing wrong in that and we do.  We think it is a most dangerous and undemocratic thing to wipe out small Parties and Independents.</P>
    <P>As I am on the English system, I should like to revert once more to the effect the single vote has on the creation of safe seats.  There is no doubt at all about it.  This system creates a very large number of safe seats.  It means, in practice, that a large number of the electorate never get a chance of doing anything about their representation, either Party representation <Col N="1376" /> or individual representation.  It is well known both in the Tory Party and the Labour Party that people are allowed to have safe seats for life.  The electors are reduced to rubber stamps.</P>
    <P>Let us deal with the case of Northern Ireland.  Ministers of all our Governments and their individual supporters have expended many words, hours and a lot of travel time in reviling the system which prevails in the North.  On this question of safe seats, the position there is interesting.  Senator Mullins usually does not attach much importance to this question of safe seats.  He always rather questions the accuracy of the number of safe seats created by this form of voting.  I should like to quote something already quoted from <i>The Indivisible Island</i> by Frank Gallagher, in which he says:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In the ten local elections in urban areas since Partition, the average of uncontested seats in Northern Ireland from 1923 to 1955 was 59.6 per cent.  The average in local elections...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>&mdash;which I presume will come here if this goes through&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;...in rural areas was the amazing percentage of 94.9 per cent., that is 95 seats in every 100 in the local government bodies in the rural areas never have been contested in almost a generation.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Can anybody say that is a good system? I agree with the strictures we have directed towards the system of government in Northern Ireland, but it is very inconsistent and blind to turn around now and say we will adopt that system, thereby cutting the ground from under all the arguments we have been using for so many years.  It is really astonishing that such a proposal should be brought seriously forward and presented to us, as it has been, in such a way that we on this side are made to feel that we are resisting progress, stability and democracy.  Once you establish the safe seat for any Party, it means, in effect, that the candidates for those seats are selected by the Party.  You might as well not have the electorate at all.  You might as well turn it over to the Party Whips.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1377" /> There is another point which I do not think has been referred to.  We are told that one of the most important things we shall have as a result of the single non-transferable vote is an obvious and clear alternative Government. I suggest that is not true at all. Unfortunately, wrong arguments in this case will come home to roost.  The Government are taking a very serious and dangerous step in pushing this Bill through.  They may have very red faces when the next election comes. They laugh at it now, but it is practically mathematically demonstrable that there may be an Opposition so small that it may not provide an alternative Government or a shadow Cabinet of Ministers or Parliamentary Secretaries.</P>
    <P>Suppose the Opposition were composed of 40 members or less, representing three or four different Parties, or at least two Parties, Labour and Fine Gael.  Where will you get an alternative Government there?  This whole thing was designed to do away with small Party Government and Coalition Government.  The fact is that the only shadow alternative Government it will inevitably create is a Coalition Government.  You would require about 20 to fill the ministerial positions and the positions of Parliamentary Secretaries, not to mention the Party Whips and other essential officials.  This is one of the most dangerous things that will emerge.  It will be too late when that happens, and it will not be any consolation for us to say that we told you so.</P>
    <P>Finally, I should like to say I do not think our system of P.R. is perfect. We have been faced, as the sort of logical conclusion of supporting P.R., with having only one constituency in the whole country.  We are not arguing that.  We are not out-and-out proportionalists in a purely mathematical frame of mind.  We stand for the system we have at present, with all its faults and limitations.  We know it is not perfect, but we think it is the best thing.  The Taoiseach himself said in the past that it is quite a good form of election.  We think it is the best form of election and that the one now being proposed is a bad form of <Col N="1378" /> election, in itself, and very bad for this country.</P>

      <P>I have listened to this question being debated for several months in the Dáil and Seanad.  Out of all these debates, there is one thing which seems very clear to me, that is, that the most undesirable feature which the Opposition see in this measure is that it forces prospective coalitions to make their bargains before an election, rather than afterwards. One Leader of an Opposition Party in the Dáil complained very bitterly about this and claimed that the Opposition groups had a right to make a deal; that we had not the right to prevent them but that this straight vote would prevent them. The leader of another principal Party here in the Seanad complained that the idea was to force bargains beforehand, as he put it&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;to force bargains to be made before elections, thus giving the individuals the power to blackmail the other Parties.  Running through all this is the same idea, that the coalition groups do not want to be forced to bargain before elections. They want to wait until the electors have elected their candidates &mdash;no matter on what policy or on what plea&mdash;then the bargains would be struck afterwards.  Another opponent of the change, in the Seanad, complains that by means of this proposed change, we would force Parties to make pre-election pacts in every constituency, as he put it.</P>

There was no complaint about the bargaining after the elections.  This gentleman wanted Fianna Fáil to continue to refrain from coalescing but to be there as convenience so that the others would coalesce.  As he objected to bargains before the elections, he could not ever get a coalition formed unless there was bargaining at some time, and if it was not before the election, it would have to be afterwards.</P>

      <P>P.R. when it runs its full course in a country, and when its evil influences are not fought in the same way as they were fought here by a very intelligent electorate and appealed to by a very intelligent Party, tends to create this multiplicity of small Parties.  That is admitted by everybody&mdash;by the Leader of the Opposition in the Dáil and by the various groups here&mdash;and no one of these small Parties can, of themselves, form a Government, except by an extreme tolerance on the part of all the other Parties in the Dáil.  Therefore, they must get elected by the people on the assumption that they are going to form a coalition and they do not tell the people&mdash;they cannot tell the people&mdash;ahead of time what the Coalition Government's policy is going to be, whether it is nailing the Union Jack to the mast, or nailing the Republican flag to the mast.  No one knows of the compromises or how they are going to work out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No one knows when the blackmailing starts after they have formed a Government, or of the threats that the Government will be overthrown, if one small group or another does not get its way.  No one knows, or can foretell, what will happen in such circumstances. If the small groups themselves cannot tell, what chance has the electorate who are appealed to to vote <Col N="1380" /> for them on various pleas during an election period?  They have none and, in fact, it could be said that the result of P.R., the type of government it creates, is the unknown coalition of rather small groups and the type of Ministry it creates, in the control of various Government Departments by the unknown nominees of these various groups.</P>
    <P>We know that in the coalitions that operated, the nominees of the small Parties behaved like the independent princes, running their own little bailiwick without consulting their colleagues in the Government and often announcing policies that their colleagues in the coalitions had never heard of.  The Leader of the Government, the Taoiseach, could not carry out, or deprived himself of his powers of carrying out, his constitutional function of selecting the Deputies to hold the positions of the various Ministries, and of keeping to himself the right to dismiss them, if they did not function, as he thought, well.</P>
    <P>When it is boiled down, P.R. has worked out disastrously in a number of other countries and would work out here in the same way, but for the opposition of Fianna Fáil supporters throughout the country and the Fianna Fáil Party.  It works out most undemocratically.  Democracy, if it is to be real and true, should give the people some rights to decide policy, some right to decide who is to control their destiny for the period of five years.  The average voter has no chance in the world to give these decisions when there are nothing but small Parties offered.  The Parties themselves cannot tell what the coalition's policy is going to be, so they cannot definitely and clearly indicate to the voter to whom they are appealing for support what the policy is to be.</P>
    <P>It can be said that P.R., instead of operating so that people can rule, functions in a manner that enables the leaders of small Parties to rule. It is not government of the people, by the people and for the people, as true democracy should be, but it is government of the people by small Parties and for the small Parties.  The <Col N="1381" /> number of small Parties we have here do not go to the trouble of becoming any bigger because they find they can jog along nicely without killing themselves.  They can get nine or ten seats and that guarantees them a couple of Ministries in a Government. That is all right for the small Parties and the leaders of the small Parties, if their ambition lies that way, but it is very bad for the country.</P>
    <P>If we are to have real progress, we should have real and practical debates between a Government and their alternative, whether that alternative is the large Party or a traditional group of small Parties recognised as being the alternative Government. But we cannot get that if the people are confused by a great number of small Parties, each shouting loudly and demanding the implementation of policies which, when they are all added together, are impossible to implement within any reasonable period.</P>
    <P>The system of election that forces a number of these small groups to come together, if they are willing to come together, under a single banner or to keep traditionally together so that people will know that, if they are elected, they will form a Government, is a good electoral system.  We cannot debate in the Dáil and the Seanad all the points of interests of 3,000,000 people.  There must be some way of debating at a lower level certain of the items that come up for political decision.  The fewer and the more major the type that come ultimately to be debated in Parliament, the better for national progress.</P>
    <P>It can rightly be claimed that if there is a system of election that will tend to create here two Parties, each of which is broadly representative of the various sections of the community, as they are in Britain, Canada, New Zealand or the United States, then those Parties would debate at constituency level, club level or county level within their organisation and resolve many difficulties that should be resolved dealing with a number of complaints and satisfying many individuals who have a right to have their complaints heard and dealt with, <Col N="1382" /> or have explained to them the difficulties of having their complaints dealt with satisfactorily or the difficulties in the way of a satisfactory solution.  The straight vote system tends to create that general type of organisation and that is why we are proposing it.  We believe it will be helping our country and that we are bound to make more progress than we could possibly make under P.R. if it is allowed to run riot in Ireland, as it ran riot in other countries.</P>
    <P>We have had the experience of the proportional system running riot in other countries.  We do not have to rely on the evidence we can produce here.  No one can deny that P.R. did in fact create the weaknesses of which Hitler took advantage to impose upon the German people the dictatorial régime he imposed on them.  No one can deny that Mussolini came into power in a similar way.  No one can deny that a few months ago the system of government they had in France collapsed because of the weaknesses of the proportional system.</P>

      <P>I do not intend to debate this matter because I think it is quite obvious to any person that there is a fundamental difference.  One of the very healthy effects of the straight vote system is that it will force the smaller groups to make their bargains beforehand.  They will not afterwards be in a position to blackmail.  I am sure there are other Senators who want to speak and I do not want to take up any further time.  I feel the people will understand what is involved in this referendum.  The Seanad itself has given a demonstration to the voters which shows that the people may consider themselves very lucky in getting an opportunity to decide this for <Col N="1385" /> themselves.  But for the fact that Fianna Fáil have such a majority in the Dáil, the people would never get that opportunity.  We believe very strongly it is the people who ought to decide what their system of election is to be.</P>
      <P>Recently during the debate on this amendment in the Dáil Fine Gael objected to the system of election being frozen, as they put it, in the Constitution.  The system of election was deliberately frozen into the Constitution by Fianna Fáil in 1937, but it was pointed out that if it did not work out fully satisfactorily, there was another clause in the Constitution which gave the people a right to amend the Constitution and to change the electoral system.  When we froze it into the Constitution, we did so because we did not want to allow purely temporary majorities in the Dáil and Seanad to tinker with the electoral system.  The system of election is of such vital importance that the people themselves should be called on to take a hand in deciding what it is to be.</P>
      <P>We are proposing to freeze this change in the Constitution so that it cannot be amended and played about with for purely temporary Party advantage, by a temporary majority in the Dáil or Seanad.  The people will appreciate the opportunity they are being given and when they come to vote, they will express their confidence in the proposals Fianna Fáil are making to amend the Constitution. They will get rid of a system of election that very adversely affected three of the greatest nations in Europe, and substitute for it, a system which has operated successfully in three or four of the most successful democracies for over 100 years and for 200 years in some of them.</P>

      <P>I could take five or ten hours at least in tracing all the absurdities that have crept into this debate during the past few days, but I want to be brief.  First of all, it is as well to emphasise to Senator Lenihan and others that what we have here is our own.  It is an Irish system, devised for Irish conditions and it has worked well under Irish conditions.  Let us not forget that and, if we want classification of the electoral systems, the only feasible classification is, one, the Irish system&mdash;the one we have, the one we are proud of&mdash;and, two, the Belfast system.  That is the only classification that conveys meaning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I take grave exception to what Senator Lenihan has suggested about lunatic candidates.  That was one of the flags he waved, and it is a flag that was waved by the Minister as well.  We all take grave exception to that.  In my home constituency of Cork, who are the lunatic candidates, according to Senator Lenihan's classification?  First of all, you have two candidates for Fine Gael, Mr. Birmingham and Senator <Col N="1388" /> Barry.  I need not tell anybody in this House that Senator Barry is one of the most respected citizens we have in Cork and I resent, and I think the House should deeply resent, anyone referring to Senator Barry as a lunatic candidate.  The candidate on the Fianna Fáil ticket who had the lowest poll for two years was Donal J. Daly. Again, I think the Fianna Fáil Party should resent having him classified by a Fianna Fáil spokesman as a lunatic candidate.  After all, they saw fit to appoint him a director of the Sugar Company in August 1958.  Is it that they appoint only lunatic candidates to such posts?</P>
    <P>I just could not grapple with Senator Lenihan's weird distortion of the P.R. system.  Is it possible that he does not understand it?  I sat for hours listening to him, and I think the best way to deal with him on that subject is through the columns of the newspapers.  In the newspaper reports, the people will see the muddled thinking that is activating the supporters of this Bill, but I would point out that by changing the system, we are heading into very dangerous waters.  Less than 50 per cent. of our people are living in rural areas, so that now the stage is being set when it will be good politics for a Party to lean towards the urban section of the community, and play one section of the community against another.</P>
    <P>The proposed change sets the stage for class warfare, so that by appealing to the urban sections and by prescribing all sorts of hairshirt remedies for the farmers&mdash;such as they have got in the last year or so&mdash;a Party can seek to secure the support of the less intelligent section of the urban vote. Such a Party, if it can get 40 per cent. of the votes in an urban community, under the single seat, non-transferable vote system, is almost certain of winning in 95 per cent. of the urban constituencies.  If that happens in 85 to 90 per cent. of the urban constituencies, such a Party can be returned with a majority in Dáil Éireann and take over the Government. It can thumb its fingers at the rural sections of the community, something that no Party has been able to do up to this.  Thank God, P.R. <Col N="1389" /> has made our Parties appeal to all sections of the community and has not encouraged them to play-off one section against another.</P>
    <P>However, with the proposed change, 40 per cent. of the vote in urban constituencies will give a majority to a Party in Dáil Éireann, and that Party can afford to show antagonism towards rural Ireland.  In that event, 40 per cent. or 60 per cent. of the constituencies can give a majority and that is less than a 25 per cent. minority.  That is the Frankenstein monster that is being brought into Irish political life.</P>

      <P>A lot of play has been made with conditions in the North and I think I could quote no greater authority to the Government Party than the present Chairman of their own Parliamentary Party, Deputy Joseph Brennan who, when speaking at the inter-Parliamentary Union meeting held in London, in September, 1957, spoke as an Irishman. We applauded him; we were all with him.  The Leas-Cheann Comhairle was present also.  The motion down for discussion was &ldquo;The Control of Parliament over Government,&rdquo; and Deputy Brennan spoke against Partition.  We have been told here that all we need is a Government, and we can forget about Parliament, but that was the motion under debate. Deputy Brennan, as reported on page 814 of the report of the inter-Parliamentary Union, stated:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Take a region of say, 1,250,000 people, divided into a heterogeneous&rdquo;</P>
      <P>&mdash;that is, the Unionists&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;and a homogeneous group,&rdquo;</P>
      <P>&mdash;that is, the Nationalists&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;as I have mentioned, the heterogeneous group consisting of 60 per cent. of the total&rdquo;</P>
      <P>&mdash;the very same figure as was given here by Senator Lenihan from the Government Benches&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;and the homogeneous comprising <Col N="1390" /> the remainder, i.e., 40 per cent.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The heterogeneous group is 60 per cent. and the homogeneous, or the Nationalists, he puts at 40 per cent.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It may be possible for the heterogeneous group to get 77 per cent. of the parliamentary representation&rdquo;</P>
    <P>&mdash;that is, the Unionist group; they may possibly get 40 seats out of 52&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;and the other group only 23 per cent.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is, 12 seats out of 52.  That is what the position is at present.  That shows that it takes twice as many votes in the Six Counties to elect a member of the Opposition as it takes to elect one of the Unionists.</P>
    <P>Deputy Brennan's conclusion&mdash;I commend it to the Government and to Senators on the other side of this House&mdash;is as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Would not this, if it were possible in such an instance, be a negation of democracy and of parliamentary representation and control?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Deputy Brennan holds it would be a negation of democracy and of parliamentary representation and control. Well spoken, Deputy Brennan!  We all applaud him and hope he will say the same thing here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps, then, the Government Party may not feel so complacent about this beautiful device of the single seat constituency. I refer the House to the inevitable splits that take place in large Parties. Mr. Kennedy Roche outlines them in his letter of January 30th, 1959, in the <i>Irish Times</i> where he lists the movements in the past&mdash;movements in which splits took place.  We start with the Irish Confederate split in 1640; Grattan's Patriots split after 1783; O'Connell's Repeal Movement split; the Fenians split at various times. In our own time, we have had the tragic and unfortunate split in 1922. Every big national movement in the past has split.  Remember, they split facing the straight vote and knowing <Col N="1391" /> the division of effort it entailed.  Can we guarantee that Fianna Fáil will not split?  Let Senators ask themselves that question sincerely and honestly. Remember, if Fianna Fáil do split, you are here creating the ideal system to drive it forever into the political limbo.  That will be brought about by the non-transferable vote.</P>
      <P>Senator Lenihan talked about the young men, the young men who will be selected in the Party conventions. You will have your convention and you will select a candidate to contest the constituency.  How will you do it?  There will be at least three proposed. Immediately, you will find yourself in difficulties.  What will you do?  Will you take the candidate who polls the highest vote, or will you, as you do when you are selecting a rate collector, a lord mayor, a Party official, eliminate the third man and vote again as between the two remaining candidates?  If you do that, you will be using the principle of the transferable vote, because those who voted for the third candidate, in the first instance, will now have to make a choice as between the first and second. You will be using their No. 2 vote.</P>
      <P>Of course, there is nothing wrong or undemocratic in that.  In fact, it is the only common-sense practice to follow.  Even in electing the captain of a hurling team, that is the principle adopted.  Just because there are eight and one of the eight gets eight votes; another, seven; another, six; another, five; another, four; another, three; another, two; another, one, you do not just pick the man with the eight votes.  In fact, that is not the way it is done in our councils, either. Then why should we adopt it as the system in our national council?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Lenihan has demonstrated the thimble-rigging in relation to the third candidate in a constituency.  The Taoiseach illustrated it very clearly at column 885.  Remember, he was presupposing then that the major crime had been committed against the Irish nation and we were down from the three seat constituency to the one seat constituency where gerrymandering can <Col N="1392" /> take place.  We may not do it by areas, but if we adopt any procedure that deprives substantial blocks of voters of representation, that is gerrymandering just as heinous and odious as what goes on across the Border. No amount of <i>ex cathedra</i> statements by the Taoiseach to the contrary will get away from that fact.  The Taoiseach says: &ldquo;Let us not hear anything more about the mathematical accuracy of the existing method.&rdquo;  It would be laughable, were it not so tragic, to find the Taoiseach, and others, picking on the minor faults in the present system, while, at the same time, glossing over completely the major crime that is being committed, a crime which will deprive 60 per cent. of the voters in a constituency of any representation whatsoever.</P>
    <P>Let us have fairness; let us have honesty; let us, above all, have decency in politics.  Let us admit that the example comes from across the Border.  That is why we should really call this the &ldquo;Belfast system&rdquo;, though I notice in the Official Report it has been changed in many places to the &ldquo;Balfour system&rdquo;.  But that is just as good a name&mdash;I am not complaining about it&mdash;because, after all, &ldquo;Bloody Balfour&rdquo; was no friend of this country, any more than the people who want to adopt the Belfast system.</P>
    <P>I am sorry Senator Ryan is not here.  He would need to learn something about research trust funds.  It is not because a trust fund was left by Sir Robert McDougall that the funds have to be used to propagate the ideas of Sir Robert McDougall. The aims of that trust fund could not be more praiseworthy.  Senator Ryan read them, but he could not see the implication.  It is clearly stated:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The purpose is to advance and encourage education in connection with the art or science of government, or other branches of political or economic science, and to encourage the study of methods of government, or civic, commercial, or social organisations.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>A most laudable objective to which to devote a trust fund.  In the interests of decency, let Senator Ryan not continue <Col N="1393" /> his native sniggering at such a laudable and benevolent trust fund. We have heard a good deal about the Kellog Foundation.  It also is praiseworthy. There had been Macra na Tuaithe, and others.  Does that mean that they and the others have to teach people how to eat wheatflakes?</P>
    <P>As the arrangement is to finish at 1 o'clock, I do not wish to say any more now except to protest at the implication last night by Senator Ó Maoláin that in some way I contributed last Thursday to preventing a vote being taken.  I was out in the Lobby at 7 or 7.15 p.m. when Senator Hayes and Senator Ó Maoláin had a consultation.  We were all anxious for a vote that night.  Senator Ó Maoláin did not want it and he just said he would talk it out.  In other words, we were told there was not to be a vote and we were free to talk and do what we could to educate the people.</P>
    <P>In voting on this measure, I feel that we in this House have done our duty, but it is only a beginning.  We have to get it to the newspapers; we have to get it to the people; we have to get it to the debating halls.  We have to ensure that this catastrophe cannot happen Irish life, that a 40 per cent. minority in our cities can impose their will upon rural Ireland to destroy everything we hold dear in this nation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>I was a little disappointed that the Minister was not more explicit on the matters with which we are concerned in this sub-section, namely, the removal of the electors' power to express a preference between candidates before them or, in other words, the actual question of the transferable or the non-transferable vote.  I want to cite the example of the Six Counties at present in which, in any constituency, if a Sinn Féin candidates and Nationalist candidate stand for the same constituency, they are cutting each others' throats, as it were.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>You cannot know, furthermore, the relative strength in a constituency in the North&mdash;the relative strength of Sinn Féin and Nationalist.  You cannot <Col N="1394" /> know their relative strength and support, unless they are prepared to split the anti-Partition vote by standing one against the other, Nationalist versus Sinn Féin, Sinn Féin versus Nationalist.  Sinn Féin tries, by what I might call a kind of patriotic blackmail, to persuade all the Nationalists to step down in their favour and out of their way&mdash;which seems a manifest injustice and which would not be necessary if they had the single transferable vote there, even with the single seat constituency.  With the transferable vote, all could stand for election and the electorate could publicly discriminate between them without weakening the non-Unionist vote.</P>
    <P>That seems to me an example that is very clearly before us.  It is an example of the kind of injustice that is being brought about by abolishing the transferable vote and removing a power which our electors now have&mdash; and which those in the North have not got&mdash;the power of expressing a preference as between two tendencies which might have some points in common as well as expressing a preference as between Parties.  I should like to hear the Minister on that point.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFitzsimons" hpid="Mr. Fitzsimons Mr. Fitzsimons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to add my voice in support of this Bill, and particularly Section 2.  I have been associated with public life since 1918, when we had the straight vote system. As a young man, I participated in the 1918 elections and I have been associated with elections which were held in all the years since then.</P>
      <P>We have had something like 14 general elections under the P.R. system since 1922.  I feel the Government are quite justified in giving the Irish people an opportunity of effecting a change, if they consider they want it. I daresay there will be no hard words in this contest, as has more or less been pictured by the Senator who has just spoken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Irish people are asked to determine whether or not they approve of this proposal, they will give the matter a lot of thought and then give their decision.  Anybody who <Col N="1395" /> has taken an interest in the political affairs of this country during the past 40 odd years, and particularly any person who has been associated with any of the various political Parties in this country during that time, is well aware that the leaders of Cumann na nGaedheal, Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil had a certain appeal for certain sections of the Irish people.  It can be said, in relation to the Fianna Fáil Party, that the Leader of that Party had a very strong appeal for a vast volume of the electorate.  Viewing the whole political picture to-day calmly, surely the Government are quite justified in letting the Irish people decide whether they want a change?</P>
    <P>We may make up our minds that were it not for the great respect for and loyalty to our political leaders since 1922, the respective major political Parties would not have got the support which, in fact, they did get down through the years.  The majority which Cumann na nGaedheal or Fine Gael got in days gone by, or the majority Fianna Fáil got, might not have been possible, but for the fact that we had outstanding leaders who were respected by both sides.  I believe the Government are quite justified in giving the Irish people an opportunity of deciding for or against this question.</P>

      <P>Are the Irish people not being asked to decide it? They will be given that opportunity, I take it, in the month of June.  Since 1922, we have had the P.R. system of election in this country.  Were it not for the troubled times we have been through since then, I believe that the question the people are now about to be asked about changing our electoral system would have been asked of them in days gone by.  Consider the period from 1922 to 1932.  Having just got self-government, it is probable that no Government in this country at that time would ask to have a change made in our electoral system. Then we had the economic war and the outbreak of the Second World <Col N="1396" /> War.  At such a time, no Government could ask that such a change should be made.  In 1948, the first Coalition Government came into office.  They could not very well make up their mind on whether or not they would be justified in asking for a change. Now we have a Government with a large overall majority, who feel they can give the people the privilege, mind you, of deciding whether or not it is necessary to have a change in our electoral system.</P>
      <P>I am convinced that when the people accepted the Constitution in 1937, they believed it would be reviewed within the ensuing 40 years. That time has now come upon us and the Irish people are privileged and honoured to have that opportunity. In their wisdom, I believe they will accept the recommendation of the Government and vote to have the change made from P.R. to the straight vote system of election.</P>
      <P>There can be no doubt that, were it not for the leaders we had here over the years, we would not have enjoyed the stability of government that we have been so fortunate to have.  The Government are quite correct in giving the people the opportunity to vote on this question.  I am certain that the people, in their wisdom, will not be so pessimistic as some Senators have been for the past few days.  The Irish people are not fools.  They will vote for the right thing, be it for or against this measure.  I believe the right thing will be the amendment of the Constitution, as is at present proposed, and the non-transferable vote in single seat constituencies for this country.</P>
      <P>The Government are doing the right thing.  As is very obvious from this debate, the Irish people are being given a chance to decide for themselves whether or not we should alter our system of election to that of the straight vote and single seat constituency. In my opinion, that change is due.</P>

It seems to me that to have one Deputy for each 20,000 of the population is to commit us to having too many Deputies and I think even the figure of 30,000 per Deputy as a maximum will give us too big a Dáil.  The result of accepting my amendment would be to reduce the number of Deputies.  At present, as I read it, and in relation to our present population, this sub-section would give us a Dáil ranging from 96 to roughly 145 members, perhaps 146 or 147, as at present.  Under my amendments, the size of the Dáil could not go beyond about 116 and might go as low as 83.</P>
    <P>I do not think 116 as a maximum number of Dáil members is too small. I think it is a quite big enough.  I notice that in Britain, while we have at present one Deputy for about every 30,000 of the population, they have one M.P. for only every 70,000 or 80,000 of the population.  Furthermore in the British House of Commons, the amount of committee work required of M.P.s is considerably greater than the amount of committee work required of Deputies under our system. The number of committees is greater, and the responsibilities of those committees are greater, and the amount of active time spent by M.P.s in committee is considerably greater than it is in relation to the Dáil.  Even for that reason alone, it ought not to be necessary for us to have quite such a high proportion of Deputies per head of the population.</P>
    <P>My suggestion is that if we have one Deputy for every 25,000 or, at most, 35,000, it would be quite sufficient and the Dáil would be big enough.  I think I speak for quite a number of people in the country when I say that many people think 147 Deputies too many.  Clearly there is a minimum figure beyond which the Dáil should not fall.  The minimum figure as proposed by me here would be 83 and it is possible that might be too small, but under the terms of my <Col N="1401" /> amendments it would be possible to have a Dáil of 116 members.  My submission is that that would be entirely adequate for the work required of our T.D.s.  It is possible that they might have to attend individually a little more strictly than they do at present. In this House, we do not run into the same difficulties as they appear to in maintaining a quorum.  It is possible that that burden might be placed upon them a little more heavily if they were fewer, but I do not think that a reduction to 116 members would be a hardship on the nation, even if it did require a little more active service from some T.D.s</P>
    <P>It may be legitimately held that a Dáil of that size would not give enough scope for a fair-sized Opposition, but it is clear that the scaling down&mdash; although under this Bill it might weigh more heavily upon the Opposition&mdash; would be roughly proportional. Although the Opposition would be smaller in number, so, too, would be the Government Party.  You ought to be able to find within a Dáil of 116 members enough to form a Government and a reasonable Opposition, unless the Opposition is really to be virtually wiped out under the provisions of this Bill.</P>
    <P>I do not want to say any more on that.  I just want to request that our ratio of Deputies per head of the population should be brought down a bit.  Even if we only have one T.D. for every 35,000 of the population, which is the maximum figure I suggest, we shall still have two members of the Lower House per head of the population more than they have in Britain.  Our proportion will be twice as big as they have found necessary in the House of Commons.</P>

      <P>On the face of it, this amendment would seem to be attractive. No doubt, the electorate feel that a reduction in the number of Oireachtas representatives would be economical.  Whether it would be an efficient reduction and economical is something to which we should have to give further consideration.  We must realise that the usual Cabinet must be drawn from a figure of half 147, or perhaps a little more.  That poses <Col N="1402" /> difficulties for the Leaders of Governments or the Leaders of Parties who take part in Government.</P>
      <P>Let us frankly face the fact that the standard of public representation here is not particularly high.  That difficulty will be increased by this legislation. In spite of what Senator Lenihan has said, if this legislation does anything, it will reduce the quality of those elected as public representatives.  If we can retain P.R. and increase the number of representatives from each constituency, I would agree that we could do with less than 147 and come down perhaps to the figure mentioned by Senator Sheehy Skeffington; but if you reduce the number to 116 under the single seat constituency and you have to draw a Cabinet from 60 men, many of whom are docile and perhaps of low quality, you reduce the efficiency of the Government you elect.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Sheehy Skeffington has raised a fundamental question concerning representative Government in this country.  For weeks past, we have had a great deal of talk on the other sub-sections.  I do not think any issue is of greater significance for the future of parliamentary Government than this.  I do not think it is a small matter.  It is not merely a question of whether 25,000, 30,000 or 35,000 people should elect a Deputy.  We have to look ahead and see whether the country will continue the present system of election or choose the single member constituency. I think the country will decide to continue the present system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must look to the future and see what sort of Parliament we may get from any system of election.  Our Parliament here has grown up.  Heaven knows, it was a miracle it stood at all. I think we are all agreed on that.  We are in the position to-day that we can say democracy is sound in the country. But I am not so satisfied that our democratic institutions are so secure. We must make our contribution to ensure to the fullest of our ability that they will be made more secure.  I am against the proposed system of election because I think it will weaken our parliamentary institutions, but I shall leave that. <Col N="1403" /> I am opposed to this amendment because if we are to reduce the number of parliamentary representatives in the vast, thinly populated areas of the country, these areas will have no parliamentary representation at all. The future of this country may be approached in one of two ways.  If you are a countryman, as I am, you may desire to see the people of the country survive, increase in numbers, develop their industry, their culture and their way of life, believing that it is best for the nation that it should be so; but I am afraid the other point of view is dominating political thought to-day.  If it is not dominating it in a positive way, the development taking place reveals an attitude of mind prepared to permit the supremacy of the view that an urban civilisation is the more desirable.</P>
    <P>We must strike out against that concept now.  I shall not raise my finger to produce any situation that may leave the people of the country with fewer representatives than they have at present.  If we are to cut the number of Deputies, then, in the main, it is rural Ireland will suffer.  It does not matter whether you have the single member constituency or not.  If there are fewer of them, the Deputy will be further away from his constituents than at present.  Some Deputies may say that at times they are too near their constituents.  We know that all sorts of duties and responsibilities are put on them which, in a way, ought not be part of their function.  But that is the trouble in parliamentary Government.</P>
    <P>There is this notion, as I said earlier, that Parliament can do everything for people.  Many of the things for which they seek aid from their parliamentary representatives, they might do for themselves, but that is another matter. If you separate these people from their parliamentary representatives by cutting down the numbers, then parliamentary Government will suffer and the people in the country, in the backward places, will suffer.  We will not keep the people in the backward areas and they will not be cultivated and, <Col N="1404" /> in consequence, our production and standards must fall.  We can do that if we want to, but if we are to do it, let us do it with our eyes open.</P>
    <P>A great deal could be said, and perhaps a great deal should be said, in regard to the subject of our personnel in the Dáil, their sense of responsibility and in regard to the attitude of the country&mdash;and indeed, perhaps of the Executive&mdash;to the members of the Dáil.  What will command the respect of the people for our parliamentary institutions is, in the main, not only the success of our parliamentary institutions for the purpose for which they were devised and constructed, but the quality of the people who represent the electorate in Parliament.</P>
    <P>That is a matter that could not get too much attention or too much thought.  When Senator Sheehy Skeffington speaks of reducing the number of Deputies in the Parliament, we have to look at the Parliament as at present constituted. In the main, I suppose we can say that there are not so many professional politicians in the Dáil.  There are not very many people living on the pittance they receive as Dáil Deputies.  Many of them had a way of life before they came into Parliament and a number of them have built up something for themselves over the years.  I consider that very desirable.  The kind of person who is most suited and most competent to do parliamentary work, and to serve the country and its people, is the person who has a stake in the country himself.  If he is a commercial man like Senator McGuire, or Senator Burke, or on the land, like myself, or engaged in some other way of life, like Senator Hayes, or Senator O'Donovan, or Senator Lenihan, or others in this House, he is able to talk the language of the people because he is living amongst them; he knows what it is to go into the fairs or the markets, or into court to fight his case.  That is the sort of person we must aim at trying to have in the Parliament of the future.</P>
    <P>If that is the type of mind that we want to get to serve the people, we <Col N="1405" /> have to look at Senator Sheehy Skeffington's proposal.  If you increase the number of people who are to be served by a Deputy, you might as well make up your mind that he will have to concentrate all his time serving his constituents.  The demands which the electorate make to-day on Deputies are very considerable.  I do not know any Deputy who can meet all the demands made on him, or give all the services he is required to give. I do not know if there is one; if there is he would probably be very successful in an election.  If there be such a man, he is a man who must devote all his time, every day, thinking and planning how he is to give this sort of service, and he will not have much business of his own to look after.  If he has a business of his own, then he will neglect it and if he neglects it, he will not have it for long.  Then, you can get another type of representative and I do not think that the attitude of the people to that type of representative is the attitude that people ought to have to our parliamentary representatives. Mind you, we have to concede the fact that people are critical of our parliamentary representatives to-day.</P>
    <P>I think there is a great deal of unfair thinking and sloppy talk about our parliamentary representatives.  It is terribly unfair to a great many of them.  They are just ordinary human beings, with the same defects as all human beings, but man for man, and woman for woman, they compare very favourably in their standards with their counterparts in other countries, where they have traditions for as many centuries as we have for decades. When you come to this point, and when you examine some of the criticisms and some of the charges which are levelled against our parliamentarians, and when you think of the way in which they are rewarded for their services, it is, in my judgment, a humiliation to say that these people are being rewarded at all, certainly in the monetary sense.</P>
    <P>The position is that a Deputy receives something over £600 a year, and we know of all the talk that goes on about that sum being free of income-tax.  There is not a rate collector <Col N="1406" /> in my constituency who is not paid more than our parliamentary representatives; there are probably one or two dozen in the county council who are paid more.  When you think that there are men in the Dáil, decent, sober men, who have gone into debt to serve their constituents, you realise that it is not at all as it should be.  It is bad for the supremacy of our parliamentary institutions; it is bad for their stability and it will bring about a situation in which we will not be able to attract into political life the type of man we want.  I want to see a continuance in political life of the farmer with a few acres, or with many acres, but whether he has few or many, he will not have any unless he is put in the position that when he does his parliamentary work, he will not be out of pocket.</P>
    <P>That is the truth to-day.  There are many people in this House who are defeated political candidates.  I am one of them myself.  I would stand as I fought and I would go down under the same conditions as when I failed to be elected and I would not take back a single word, or a single action, and I am sure, whatever side we are on, that is the attitude of us all.  How can a man have principles unless he is prepared to stand for them and to take the risk of being defeated, and if he is defeated under such circumstances, is that cause for rebuke?  It is, in the minds of some people.  I think there is altogether too much silence on the part of people in public life in regard to these criticisms of our people in Parliament.</P>
    <P>We are now given the opportunity to discuss this question in a calm atmosphere. If this matter were raised in the other House, it would be very difficult for people to talk about themselves. We do know what they have said in the other House about their own business and conditions.  I must say this, that I do not think any of the Executives have given enough thought to the status of the Deputies in their Parties.  I do not think that they have given enough consideration to the position in which many of them find themselves and I do not think they have looked far enough into the future to see the consequences of not doing that now. <Col N="1407" /> There are a few young men in this House, in both Parties.  They are politicians. That is nothing to be ashamed of.  We were all young men and we did not think we were politicians, or that we were ever going to be politicians, and we did not go into the cause we tried to serve as politicians, budding or otherwise, but we did try to serve. There was no point in the people of our generation taking the risk that had to be taken then, if we were not to have followers and a succession of people to raise the flag, as we were prepared to do.</P>
    <P>Our parliamentary institutions can stand only on the basis of young men coming along to serve.  The prestige of our Dáil and Seanad, especially our Dáil, is to a great extent dependent on the calibre, education, allegiance to principles and the clear understanding of principles we find in the young men who are coming in now from this and other generations to serve.  Such men will not go into Parliament if it is to be a labour of poverty and if it is to be degraded by every one who cannot get into it, or perhaps has not the courage to stand for it.  Parliament will not be well served by such people doing everything, by the written and spoken word, to degrade and denigrate people who are there.</P>
    <P>Senator Sheehy Skeffington has raised &mdash;I shall not say inadvertently, because I am quite certain he never does anything by inadvertence&mdash;an issue of fundamental importance.  I am quite certain he knows the implications of the amendment he has put down and we should welcome the opportunity he has given us to say what we think on this question.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to express my admiration of the courageous remarks Senator Baxter has just made.  What he has said is particularly pertinent to the type of ill-founded public criticism we find to-day of our institutions of State and of the people who participate in their working. I agree with him in his defence of these institutions and of the Deputies who do the practical work <Col N="1408" /> involved.  I believe that Dáil Deputies are in many cases ill-rewarded in every sense for the services they render, day in and day out, to the community.</P>
      <P>As Senator Baxter has said, the amendment is wrongly founded in that it will lead to a reduction of the representation in our rural areas.  The rural areas are the bulwark, the stabilising influence, of this community and anything that would effect a reduction in the strength of the voice they can bring to bear on the councils of State would be a bad thing.  Successive Governments have recognised that in the various electoral Acts since before and after the Constitution by weighting the constituencies in favour of rural areas. We all know that the provision in relation to the numbers in each constituency means that the rural areas have a representative for every 20,000 and urban areas one for every 30,000. The acceptance of Senator Sheehy Skeffington's amendment would mean that many areas in the West and South would have a smaller representation than they otherwise would have.  For that reason, I oppose this amendment vigorously.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LouisWalsh" hpid="Mr. Louis Walsh Mr. Louis Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Louis Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with Senator Baxter and Senator Lenihan in opposing this amendment.  The present representation in County Donegal is seven Deputies and if this amendment were accepted, the population being 122,000, the representation would be four Deputies.  In the City of Dublin, with a population of 539,000, it would mean a representation of 21 Deputies.  The area of Dublin City is one-forty-third of the County of Donegal.  The representatives from Dublin City represent an area of approximately a square mile and are saved travelling expenses in going round the constituency.  The rural Deputies would be in a very unfortunate position as compared with that of an urban Deputy.</P>
      <P>Senator Baxter has pointed out the importance of rural Ireland in the economy of our country.  In the booklet issued by the Department of Finance, <i>Economic Development</i>, page 208 sets out:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1409" />&ldquo;The immediate potentialities of increased agricultural production are very great.  The realisation of these potentialities in any large degree would, by increasing the purchasing power of the farming community, raise generally the demand for goods and services, leading to expansion of industry and additional employment.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If that is the case, we are entitled to say that those who live directly on agriculture will enjoy a fuller life and the living conditions of their community will be improved.  There is a danger, however, that the steady fall in the rural population will mean that they will not be adequately represented in the Oireachtas and the vital importance of their interests and the overall economic position will not be properly emphasised.  It is essential that our agriculture remains competitive in a world market.  Our purchasing power is derived largely from the work of our farmers and it will be necessary to continue increasing the investment in the soil as is suggested in the Government White Paper.</P>
    <P>The logical conclusion of Senator Sheehy Skeffington's argument, basing representation entirely on population, is that, as Dublin University constituency is approximately 5,000 as against 20,000 in the National University, Senator Sheehy Skeffington should put down an amendment whereby representation of Trinity College should be one Senator as against three or four in the case of National University.  However, a provision in that regard is enshrined in the Constitution and no attempt is being made to alter that. This amendment would militate seriously against the interests of rural Ireland, having regard to the increase in the population in the urban areas.  If the commission would give a larger representation to the population in rural areas, it would be best for the country ultimately.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Any of us who know the work of Dáil Deputies, irrespective of their Parties, will agree that Deputies are overworked and underpaid. This amendment has nothing to do with the remuneration of <Col N="1410" /> Deputies, but it has to do with the work of Deputies and as its adoption would mean that they would be even more overworked than they are, I oppose it.  I agree with what Senator Baxter has said, but I would stress one aspect of the question which he did not mention, that is, the difficulties of people who have no other income or means of support except their Dáil allowance.  It is bad for democracy if you have a situation in which good people cannot afford to seek election to Dáil Éireann or, if they secure election, cannot afford to sit in Dáil Éireann. That is a terrible situation and it is very bad for democracy.  I do not know what can be done in regard to the overworking of Deputies.  Probably the Deputies and the Parties are themselves largely to blame because of the kind of competition that has been built up between them through the years in dealing with every sort of complaint, and every sort of inquiry from their constituents.</P>
      <P>A feeling has grown up in this country that a person cannot get his rights, his entitlement, unless he makes an approach to a Deputy, or Senator, or some public representative. I do not know why that is so, and from what I know of the constituencies across the water, it does not seem to be the case in Britain. Here we have a situation in which nobody thinks he can get his rights in regard to an old age pension, or anything like that, without making representations to a Deputy to write to a Department.  We have all had experiences of that sort.  I do not know whether or not Deputies could form a trade union of their own, or at least agree that that sort of nonsense should stop.  There is no need to approach a Deputy or a Minister to make representations for a person's rights.  Quite clearly, he will get them in the normal course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps the Parties could assist Deputies by providing more secreterial service, but, again, only the larger Parties, probably, could do that.  It is a fact, and those of us who know anything about it cannot deny that Deputies are overworked with those <Col N="1411" /> sort of inquiries and representations which, in many cases, are unnecessary. If this amendment were passed, it would, to some extent, cause them to be even more overworked than they are at the present time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>If Senator Sheehy Skeffington's amendment were adopted, it would mean approximately 30 fewer Deputies in the Dáil.  Some of the fears expressed by those who oppose the amendment of the Constitution were, that Fianna Fáil or whatever Party had an overall majority, would get an inordinately high proportion of the seats, and that the Opposition would have such a small proportion of the seats that they would be unable to form the nucleus of an alternative Government.</P>
      <P>If the total number of seats in the Dáil were reduced by 30, it is quite clear, that if those who oppose the change are correct, the Opposition would be still smaller and their chances of forming a Government, their chances of being a nucleus of a Government, would be still smaller.  Consequently, it seems to me, that if Senator Sheehy Skeffington believes in the danger of the stronger Party being too strong, and the Opposition groups being too small he must realise this will make the position even worse.</P>
      <P>There is another point.  Under this proposal, it would be considerably harder for an Independent Deputy to be elected.  The smaller the constituency, the smaller the electorate, the better chance there is for a strong local personality to be elected, regardless of his politics.  This would make it much harder and that would be a bad thing. The same goes for minority groups or small groups who may be members of a minority.  There may be a minority group concentrated in a locality and if that locality is made bigger, the number of votes required to elect one of that minority group will be higher. Thus it will be hard for that minority to have a Deputy elected.</P>

      <P>The difference between Senator Sheehy Skeffington's amendment, and the Bill as it stands, as <Col N="1412" /> Senator Ryan pointed out, is somewhere about 30 seats.  Under the Bill as it stands, the seats in the Dáil would run, given the present population, somewhere between 100 and 150. Under Senator Sheehy Skeffington's proposal, the number of seats would run between 83 and 116, according to his calculations.  The principal result the country wants from an election is a Government that can run the affairs of State.  If we reduce the numbers on the Government side of the House to 50 or 60, it will be very difficult to get a panel of Ministers.</P>
      <P>Senator Barry joined Senator Sheehy Skeffington on other occasions in bemoaning the fate of Oppositions&mdash;that they would be wiped out&mdash;but on this occasion he pointed out, very rightly, that the Government might have only 60 members under Senator Sheehy Skeffington's proposal and that that was too small a number from which to select 12 or 13 Ministers, or whatever number there would be, plus a number of Parliamentary Secretaries.  It is for the reason that we want a substantial number of Deputies in the Dáil in order that a fair Government can be selected from the half who get the majority, and in order that a fair number will be left in opposition, to form an effective Opposition, that we favour having more seats per 10,000 of the population, than they have in very highly populated countries.  In Britain, they have one seat for every 80,000 which gives them a Parliament of 600 members or more.</P>
      <P>We require minimum representation to do effective work and to elect a Government, and it has been generally agreed for a number of years, that around the 20,000 or 30,000 mark is the correct population figure for a constituency.  That gives us somewhere around 130.  It has given us, over a number of years, from 134 to 147 seats. It may work out that way in the future. I do not think it is too many for the work which Deputies have to do and it is not too many, certainly, to give a fair selection of Deputies to become Ministers.</P>

      <P>I have felt that in raising this matter I am taking <Col N="1413" /> an opportunity, which does not often come to us, of expressing an opinion as to the optimum size of the Dáil.  In fact, the present clauses before us, and which I am seeking to amend, repeat the figures which are in the existing Constitution.  I felt that this was a good opportunity to test the opinion of the House, to give an opportunity of deciding that, on the whole, our Dáil is a bit too big, by about 30 members.  I cleave to the view that it might well be a better Dáil, if there were about 116 rather than 147.</P>
      <P>I could not help wondering while Senator Baxter was speaking, whether if the Leas-Chathaoirleach had been in the Chair, he would have allowed Senator Baxter to refer at such great length to the pay of T.D.s I felt that perhaps you, Sir, were a little kind to him in that respect, because, of course, that matter is quite irrelevant to my amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>I have every sympathy on that point.  I share Senator Baxter's view on this question of paying T.D.s properly for work well done, but that has nothing to do with my suggestion.  One might even say that the argument would go the other way&mdash;if there are fewer T.D.s each of them could be paid more, with the same amount of money available.  My amendment has nothing to do with the rate of pay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I share Senator Baxter's preoccupation, furthermore, with the necessity of maintaining the prestige of parliamentary Government.  I should be critical of it in some ways, but, in general, I share his view that we have nothing to be ashamed of in relation to our parliamentary representatives, or the way in which the Dáil works. However, I think the prestige of the Dáil rests more upon the quality of the T.D.s than upon their quantity.  I do not think it follows that a reduction in quantity, for which I am asking, necessarily means a reduction in quality.  It is clearly conceivable that it might even improve the quality, if the quantity were slightly reduced. After all, the reduction for which I am asking is not an enormous one; <Col N="1414" /> it is a reduction of about 30 seats.</P>
    <P>It is said, rightly, that many T.D.s do a lot of practical work.  That is quite so, but so do the members of the House of Commons.  I would stress the fact that a lot more committee work is demanded of them and, of course, their travelling, on the average, is more difficult than ours.  Dublin is a good deal nearer to the most outlying constituency than London to the more outlying constituencies in Britain.  Even so, they find it sufficient to have one M.P. for every 80,000, whereas we are asked in some cases to have one T.D. for every 20,000&mdash;four times as many.</P>
    <P>Senator Lenihan put forward the view that the two figures in the sub-section are there so as to allow a representation of one T.D. per 20,000 in rural areas and one T.D. per 30,000 in urban areas.  I am afraid he has not adverted to sub-section (2) of Section 4 of this Bill, which lays it down emphatically that &ldquo;the population of each constituency, as ascertained in the last preceding census, shall, so far as it is practicable, be the same throughout the country.&rdquo;  There is no question of allowing it to vary from constituency to constituency.  Therefore, his contention is ill-founded.</P>
    <P>Senator Louis Walsh said that T.D.s have a big area to cover, particularly in sparsely populated country areas. The area they will have to cover in the single seat constituency&mdash;if the Bill goes through and the amendment we passed yesterday, rejecting the single seat idea, is not maintained&mdash;will be considerably reduced.  In other words, it is the intention of the Party with which Senator Walsh is connected that the area served by an individual T.D. shall be very seriously reduced by the present Bill.  Therefore, I do not feel that his argument about the size of area to be covered is a valid one.</P>
    <P>He may say&mdash;and I think it is a legitimate point&mdash;that if I am eager for equity of representation, I should remember that the number of graduates who elect the Dublin University members is small&mdash;it is roughly about 5,000&mdash;as compared with the figure he gave for National University&mdash;about 16,000, I think&mdash;and, therefore, that <Col N="1415" /> I should be eager for the same change there.  There may be some value in that.  However, I would remind him that all the other Senators except the 11 appointed ones, were sent here by a total electorate of about 1,000 or 1,200 and, therefore, what is sauce for the goose might well be sauce for the gander.</P>
    <P>What I am asking in this amendment is that there be about 31 fewer Deputies.  I do not think a Dáil of 116 good Deputies would be ineffective or too small.  It would be a better Dáil, and in many respects it would be capable of working even better than the present one.  I was a little surprised to hear Senator Ryan shedding tears for the appalling effect this amendment would have (a) upon Opposition Parties, (b) upon representation of Independents, and (c) upon representation of small minorities. I am afraid those were crocodile tears.  Frankly, I do not believe that Senator Ryan has any concern for how well minorities will be represented.</P>

      <P>I was not shedding tears for them; I was saying that, if Senator Sheehy Skeffington is sincere in being concerned about the representation of minorities and Independents, this amendment of his will do the opposite to what he would like the Bill to do.</P>

      <P>I accept that.  Probably I was being a little unfair.  The point is that, no matter what the effect of the whole Bill is, the effect of my amendment could not be to exaggerate the effect of the Bill, as the effect of my amendment upon Opposition, Independents, minorities and so on, would be exactly proportional to its effect upon the Government representation.  In other words, the reductions under my amendment would be exactly proportional. I realise that he was arguing <i>ad hominem</i>, but I do not think his argument holds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Briefly, then, I believe that the best maximum figure for Dáil membership is not 150, as it would be under the provisions of the Bill, but somewhere nearer to 120.  That <Col N="1416" /> would be quite sufficient and would not in any sense lower the standards of the Dáil.  On the contrary, it would raise those standards.  I should like the opinion of the House tested on that point.</P>

      <P>I am very much in agreement with the excellent sentiments put forward by Senator Baxter. I note the very relaxed and impartial atmosphere which prevails here now. It shows that we can work together and discuss a problem impartially and on its merits.  I hope we get a great deal more of that work.  The issue raised by Senator Sheehy Skeffington is a major one, on which a decision should not be taken lightly or quickly. In fact, there should be very careful investigation and examination before a decision is taken.  We have to ask what our representatives are for and that opens up a vast field.  We have to see whether Deputies and Senators could be shorn of a great deal of the routine work they have to do at present. On the other hand, we could examine as to whether much more valuable use can be made of their time than is made at present, whether we can develop really effective committee systems and so take a more modern approach to our work, a much more effective and efficient approach and one in which, I have no doubt, we could co-operate together far better than has been the case in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a number of vital issues involved.  This pinpoints the necessity, after some 30 years of self-government, for having a calm and detached look at how we are getting on and where we are going.  We need not be ashamed or self-conscious about having to do that.  The American Government, which has been held up to us, has done that at least nine times during the past 70 years.  It is a regular feature of political life there.  They have an impartial and detached investigation of government.  They even probe into the very philosophy of government itself. The most recent example of that was the Hoover Commission.  The issue before the House now is a very large and important one.  It is one to which we cannot give an immediate answer.  It is like the issues raised <Col N="1417" /> in the proposed change from the multi-seat constituency and the transferable vote to the single seat constituency and the non-transferable vote.  My whole objection to that is that we just do not know where we are going because we have not examined into the case fully.</P>

    <P>The change involved here may appear to be a slight one but it appears to me it would be better to revise our constituencies at least once in every ten years&mdash;the lifetime of two Parliaments. The practice across the water is that under the House of Commons (Redistribution of Seats) Acts, 1944 and 1949, a boundary commission is set up which must report at intervals of not less than three years and not more than seven years&rdquo;.  Therefore, in suggesting that our constituencies should be revised at least every ten years, I am not making an impossible request.  In the circumstances of our country there is a factor which does not obtain across the water; we are losing something between 40,000 and 50,000 people by emigration every year.  In 12 years, therefore, we might lose 500,000 or 600,000 people.  That is the equivalent of 30 constituencies. For that, and other reasons, I think a slightly shorter interval between revisions would be better.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been generally accepted for a long time that a constituency revision once in every 12 years is sufficient, but the clause in the present Bill, in fact, enables revisions to be carried out more frequently, if that is desired.  The clause reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;A constituency commission shall be established from time to time when determined by the President. but not less frequently than once in every 12 years.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>If the Government advises the President to set up a commission once in every five years, that can be done.  It is a permissive clause.  It compels the Government to hold a revision at least once in every 12 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are, of course, changes in population from the country to the town.  In my constituency, the rural population has gone down because of the mechanisation of agriculture and, <Col N="1419" /> simultaneously, the population in the towns is going up.  Unfortunately, industrial expansion is not proceeding sufficiently rapidly in parts of the country to absorb those who are no longer wanted on the land.  But that is not an Irish phenomenon.  In the United States of America, 7,000,000 disappeared off the land in ten years. However, that has nothing to do with the argument here.  I was led into it in reply to Senator Sheehy Skeffington's reference to emigration.</P>
    <P>The existing clause will allow revisions to be held more frequently than 12 years, but it compels the Government to have such a revision at least once in every 12 years.</P>

      <P>It is merely to request that in the following sub-section which is sub-section 4º of Section 3, one word shall be changed.  The sub-section reads at present:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The members of a constituency <Col N="1420" /> commission appointed on the nomination of the Chairman of Dáil Éireann shall have been selected from the members of Dáil Éireann who are determined by him to be in opposition, and on a basis and in a manner determined by him.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The second use of the word determined is legitimate, but the first use of it seems to me to be wrong.  It is not the Chairman of the Dáil who determines whether an individual shall be in opposition or not: it is the individual Teachta Dáil.  I think what is meant here, and I think the drafting was a little clumsy, was that they shall be selected from members of Dáil Éireann who are deemed by him to be in opposition and on a basis and in a manner determined by him.  My amendment is to change the first word &ldquo;determined&rdquo; into the word &ldquo;deemed&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I am strengthened in my view that the original drafting is not a happy one by noticing the two Irish words that are being used.  The first word that is used is the verb &ldquo;cinnimh&rdquo; which means, according to my copy of <i>Dinneen's Dictionary</i> (1904 edition, page 138), &ldquo;to fix&rdquo; or &ldquo;to appoint&rdquo;. The Chairman of the Dáil is not &ldquo;fixing&rdquo; or &ldquo;appointing&rdquo; these people to the Opposition&mdash;the definition runs: &ldquo;to fix, to appoint, to decide, to resolve, to agree, to decree, to determine or to assign&rdquo;.  I think it is clear from that definition that in relation to the word &ldquo;determine&rdquo;, &ldquo;cinnimh&rdquo; means to determine only in the sense of fix, appoint, decree.  The Chairman of Dáil Éireann does not decree or fix or appoint or assign people to the Opposition.</P>
    <P>If we turn the word &ldquo;determine&rdquo; into &ldquo;deem&rdquo;, as my amendment suggests, we get the Irish word &ldquo;measaim&rdquo;, which, according to <i>Dinneen's Dictionary</i>, page 476, means &ldquo;to think, to deem, to judge, to consider, to regard, to value, to esteem, to estimate, to suppose&rdquo;; that clearly is the meaning of the spirit of this clause.  I think there has been a certain amount of drafting clumsiness there.  We would look silly if we left the word &ldquo;determined&rdquo; there in the first place, and for that reason I move to replace it by the word &ldquo;deemed&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>The Chairman has to decide.  He is the person to whom it is given to make the decision as to whether or not a Deputy is in opposition, generally in opposition.  If the Chairman were called upon to decide in relation to the Seanad, there would be some difficulty from time to time in determining who should be treated as a member of the Opposition for the purpose of giving them rights. This clause is designed to give the members of the Opposition the right to have three members selected from them to represent their interests.  As a number of Independents are selected who do not want to put themselves down as being either pro-Government or anti-Government, or attached to the Opposition or attached to the Government, it was thought wise to leave the determination to the Ceann Comhairle. I expect he would determine that a person was in opposition only if he had an interest in being declared in opposition for the purpose of getting advantages under this clause in having a say in the selection of the three people.  I do not think it would be improved very much or at all by substituting &ldquo;deemed&rdquo; for &ldquo;determined.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I am afraid I am not really convinced by the Minister's argument.  I do not feel that he has met my case.  I do not feel that the function of the Chairman of the Dáil is to fix or assign these people into opposition.  What is his function in relation to this Bill, is to consider or regard them as being in opposition. Now, it is the second meaning that is conveyed best, I think, by the word &ldquo;deemed&rdquo; and by the verb &ldquo;measaim&rdquo; in Irish, whereas their allocation, fixing, appointing, or decreeing is conveyed by the first use of &ldquo;determine&rdquo; and by the Irish verb &ldquo;cinnimh.&rdquo;  We are leaving something rather clumsy in this Bill, if we do not make this change.</P>

      <P>I should congratulate Senator Sheehy Skeffington on the work he has done on this amendment.  He has endeavoured to make a distinction between the two <Col N="1422" /> things the Ceann Comhairle has to decide.  He has gone to <i>Dinneen's Dictionary</i> for the purpose of discovering the difference between two particular Irish words.  The Senator has got the correct definitions from Dinneen.</P>
      <P>This sub-section is compelling the Ceann Comhairle of the Dáil to determine something&mdash;not to give an opinion on something.  They are two different things.  I may think that Senator Skeffington is in opposition: &ldquo;measaim&rdquo; is the Irish word he wants to use.  But if I am put into the position that I have under my hand and seal to declare for some particular statutory purpose that he is in fact in opposition, well, I am determining that, it seems to me. Therefore, clearly the word &ldquo;determine&rdquo; in both cases is the correct word.</P>
      <P>There is something more involved than merely having an opinion.  There is having an opinion, in the first instance, and in the second instance, putting that opinion into operation for a particular purpose.  The Ceann Comhairle may very well be wrong. Anybody may be wrong in particular instances.  What he is asked to do here is to declare and determine that, for the purposes of this commission, particular people are in opposition. He must, in the first instance, have an opinion that they are.  Here he is asked to determine it, but not to state his opinion.</P>

      <P>In this section, we are dealing with a fundamental change in the constitutional procedure in relation to the determination of constituencies.  The only country in the world that I know of that has a commission like the commission proposed to be established under this Bill is Ceylon.  In Ceylon, there is a delimitation commission consisting of three people appointed by the Governor-General.  Oddly enough, Ceylon happens to be at the end of a great mass of land, like Malta, Gibraltar and Tasmania, which were referred to by Senator Lenihan last night.</P>
      <P>A great deal of misunderstanding has developed in the country about the proposed commission.  We are used to the appointment of commissions to inquire into and to determine matters in a more or less democratic way, but this proposed commission is anything but democratic.  There are many people, even people who are actively interested in politics, who are under the misapprehension that this commission will be like the Liquor Commission, the Commission on Income-Tax and the Commission on Irish, to which it will be possible for them to make submissions. It does not seem to be understood that there is no indication in the Bill that the people whose interests will be affected by the findings of the commission, the people who will be placed in the various constituencies, will have any say, good, bad or indifferent, by either written or oral representation. There is no assurance that that democratic procedure will be adopted and, from the Bill, it does not appear that it is intended that that procedure will be adopted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Emphasis has been laid on the principle that the people ought to be the judges in the matter of this amendment of the Constitution.  Undoubtedly, they should be, and the people have already enshrined that principle in the Constitution.  The people should know that under this Bill they will not be able to approach their Dáil representative to say that they do not think they should be in a particular constituency and would prefer to be in another constituency, because the whole procedure <Col N="1424" /> and the ultimate determination of the boundaries will lie with the commission, subject to the provision in sub-section 2º of Section 5 under which two-thirds of the members of the Dáil present and voting may amend the report.</P>
    <P>There have been instances of towns and boroughs being brought into other constituencies or counties under the Local Government Act, 1879.  That procedure created annoyance which has persisted to the present time. When the import of this provision in the Bill is fully realised, I do not think that the people will be satisfied with it.</P>
    <P>This provision is notable for the upset it causes to other parts of the Constitution which are already well settled.  First, it is making an inroad into the legislative power of the Dáil and Seanad.  The commission will be the body that shall determine the boundaries, whereas, under the Constitution, the sole and exclusive power of making laws for the State is vested in the Dáil and Seanad. Under this amendment of the Constitution, it is not intended that the Seanad shall have any power whatever in regard to this aspect of electoral procedure.  The Seanad will have no say and the Dáil will have a say only to the extent that not less than two-thirds of the members present and voting can amend the report of the commission.  That is undemocratic and out of harmony with the Constitution.  It illustrates how ill-conceived this Bill is and that it is a matter of indifference to the Government what effect it will have on well settled procedure in the Constitution, or on the relationships between the people and the Oireachtas, or between the Oireachtas and the Government.  This section is handing over legislative power to a seven-man committee, subject to a veto by Dáil Éireann and Seanad Éireann has no part in it.</P>
    <P>Serious as that is, it is not as serious as the effect which the provision in regard to the appointment of a judge as chairman will have on the judiciary.  An independent judiciary is one of the safeguards provided in a democracy.  The independence <Col N="1425" /> of the judiciary rests not only on the fact that their tenure of office is not terminable, save for misbehaviour, but also on the respect which the people have for the judicial organ of State, the respect which people have for judges, whether of the High Court, the Supreme Court, the Circuit Court or the District Court.  Undoubtedly, there would be a great deal of controversy about any report which the proposed commission would issue.  If the Bill is passed in its present form, the controversy will centre around the member of the judiciary who is its chairman. That is a most unwholesome thing as far as the independence of the judiciary is concerned.  In view of the practice that judges shall not speak on political matters and shall not take any active part in politics, it is not right that they should be drawn into so highly controversial a political matter as the setting out of constituency boundaries.  That is altogether wrong in principle and unwholesome, and is likely to undermine the status of the judiciary and the respect for it in the minds of the people.</P>
    <P>It is provided in the section that minor matters relating to the commission shall be determined by law.  I do not know whether that law will have any effect upon the extent to which the report of the commission could be debated in the Dáil.  That is a matter, of course, that could be determined by law.  A Government with a large majority might well consider that it was in the public interest to stifle criticism.</P>
    <P>Apart altogether from these objections in principle to this commission, as I have already pointed out, I do not think the commission will function properly in circumstances which it is not difficult to foresee.</P>
    <P>It is provided that the commission shall be constituted of seven people, one of whom will be a judge of the High Court or Supreme Court, three members of the Opposition, and three members of the Government Party.  It is also provided that the quorum for meetings of the commission will be <Col N="1426" /> four, and that the commission may act notwithstanding vacancies in their membership.  That means that the safeguard, about which there has been so much discussion, of having a judge as chairman will be abolished.  Indeed, that safeguard may not exist at all because, when the commission is constituted, and a judge of the High Court or Supreme Court is appointed as chairman, there is nothing to prevent him from resigning.  Neither is there anything to prevent the commission from functioning while he might be ill and, since the commission is to report within six months, it is quite conceivable that the person who was appointed chairman could be ill for a period of six months, and that the commission would be fully entitled to act, notwithstanding the illness of the chairman.  Therefore, the safeguard which is to be provided is one which the ordinary circumstances of life can nullify at any time.</P>
    <P>Apart from that, judging by what one can imagine would go on in that commission, it is quite conceivable that the judge appointed as chairman might place his resignation in the hands of the President.  In those circumstances, you would have a commission consisting of six people unable to agree with one another.  Then you would have the provisions of sub-section (3) of Section 4 becoming completely inoperative.  If the commission cannot agree upon a report, and cannot present their report within six months, would the Minister say what will happen in that set of circumstances? Will the Government appoint another commission and have another go at it?  If that is to be the case, it seems to me to be a most haphazard constitution to give so important a body as this in the fundamental law of the land.  Indeed, it shows very little respect for the people to ask them to enact so nugatory and imprudent a provision as this.</P>
    <P>We have heard a great deal about democracy during the discussion on this Bill and about the interests of the people being properly safeguarded, but in this section there is a provision that no court shall entertain any question as to whether the commission has been <Col N="1427" /> properly constituted or any question as to whether the determination or revision of boundaries of constituencies has been properly carried out.  That is contained in sub-section (6) of Section 4. but I have not yet seen any justification for excluding from the courts these questions as to the propriety of the conduct of the commission and as to the propriety of the constitution of the commission.  It seems to me that this exclusion savours of a fear the Government have that there will be certain matters which will be open to question, and which they do not want to be brought out into the light of day in public court.  I do not know of any other justification for that.  That provision is one which must create a great deal of disquiet and suspicion as to the reasons for it.  As I have said, the ideas incorporated in this section are, to my mind, most undemocratic and I do not intend to repeat myself on that.</P>
    <P>Since the Government are so enamoured of the British system of elections, and since they have such a high regard for the democratic manner in which it enables democracy to survive and thrive in Britain, it seems to me that when they were offering the people the British system, they might have gone the whole hog, and offered them the same safeguards and the same advantages as the British Government offered their people in relation to the fixing of the boundaries of constituencies. One of the great things about the British Constitution is that, in the circumstances of Britain and the British people, the system has worked and, in relation to our Constitution, in which P.R. is enshrined, it too has also worked in our circumstances.</P>
    <P>The British, when they were dealing with the redistribution of seats in the Redistribution of Seats Act, 1944, also set up commissions.  They set up four commissions, one each for England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, and one of the things they provided for in that Act was that a commission which would delimit or mark out boundaries of constituencies would not have on its membership Members of Parliament.  That was an attempt to get a commission that would, at any <Col N="1428" /> rate, have the appearance of impartiality to the public.  The chairman of the commission in each case was the Speaker of the House of Commons and the other members to constitute the commission were to include the Registrar-General of Births, Deaths and Marriages, and the Director-General of Ordnance Survey.  It is not the personnel of the commission which is important for the purposes of my argument. What is important is that the commission is intended and is made to act in a democratic manner.</P>
    <P>It is also provided that a commission set up under the British Act must publish its proposals, with regard to the changing of constituency boundaries, in newspapers circulating in the areas affected by the proposed changes.  It is also provided that members of the public may then make representations to the commission, after publication of the proposals.  To me, that seems to be a great deal more democratic than the procedure suggested in this Bill and, if we are to have the British system of single member constituencies, with the single non-transferable vote, and a commission, we might as well have had the lot, and had a provision enabling people to exercise their right to make representations to the commission. For some reason that has not been disclosed, that has not been done.</P>
    <P>The British Act goes even further in that it provides that if a commission thinks fit, it may cause a local inquiry to be held in respect of any constituency or constituencies.  That is not provided in this Bill and I do not see in the circumstances that the commission must report within six months, any law can be enacted which would enable the things that persons in British constituencies can do to be done by people in constituencies here. For that reason, I think, in the first place, that the commission will not work.  In the second place, I think it is most undemocratic and has no regard whatever for the rights of the people whose interests will be vitally affected by the changes to be made by this commission.  Therefore, I oppose the Section.</P>

      <P>I entirely agree with Senator O'Quigley.  This commission, <Col N="1429" /> in my opinion, is far from democratic.  It is different from any other commission we had in the past. If P.R. is abolished, there will not be so much need for gerrymandering, but if the referendum is defeated, there is no doubt that there will be the greatest need for gerrymandering, if Fianna Fáil want to rivet themselves in power and we could have the same gerrymandering of constituencies as we had here in 1947.</P>
      <P>This commission is above the courts, and we wonder why.  We should be jealous of, and guard, the rights and functions of our courts in any true democracy and we claim to be a true democracy&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I hold that this section is unjust and unfair because I do not agree that politicians should be the people to fix these constituencies. I agree with Senator O'Quigley when he says the English system is better with people such as the Registrar of Births, Deaths and Marriages and somebody from the Statistics Office&mdash; or whatever it is called in Britain&mdash; acting on these commissions <i>ex officio.</i> One point the Senator did not mention is that when the job is done, the results come back to the House of Commons and the House of Lords and there is an opportunity for a full discussion.</P>
      <P>I do not want to transgress the rules of order by anticipating other sections, but there is legislation proposed in sections which we shall reach later, clearly setting out the intention of the Government to ensure that there is no other official debate on the activities or the results produced by the commission, once the work is done.  No court can consider it; there will be no debate in either the Dáil or Seanad.  That is unfair and unjust and I submit should not be carried out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Senator O'Quigley that a member of the High Court or the Supreme Court is not the proper person to act as chairman of the commission.  Imagine the dilemma of a person who may have been at one time a member of a political Party. I say this in no slighting manner against members of the judiciary, who may have been at one time members of a political Party and who are faced with a choice.  The position I envisage is that when such a person has complied with all the requirements in the following section, Section 4, and has addressed himself to the geographical and administrative features of the area and finds there are two or three ways in which he can produce a single seat constituency, does he not find himself in a very invidious position that he knows quite well that if he does it one way, he suits the Party of which he was a member 20 years ago and if he does it the other way, he suits the Party which he opposed 20 years before?  What is the man to do?  He <Col N="1431" /> is fair-minded and his reaction might be to make quite sure that he would not suit his own Party.  If he feels very keenly, however, that his Party was, and is, the right Party for the country, the temptation is to fix that constituency, within the law and within the instructions he has got, to suit the Party in which he was or is interested.</P>
    <P>We all know that all members of the judiciary here are appointed largely on&mdash;I would not like to say a political basis&mdash;a basis related to the services given by the members of the Bar to political Parties.  I do not see anything wrong with that; it is done in America.  It is one way of doing it, but we cannot avoid the fact that it is done here.  We see it every day and we know this is a fact. From reading Deputy McGilligan's speech in the Dáil, I know that in the High Court and in the Supreme Court, there are people from our side and our Party who have been appointed there.  There are some from the other side.  I think he mentioned a Fianna Fáil ex-Senator, a man who stood twice for election for Fianna Fáil.  I submit we have the same sort of person.  Also, we have two Fianna Fáil ex-Attorneys-General two people who acted as public prosecutors under Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <P>When these people become members of the judiciary, I agree completely that they accept the responsibility of being non-political and of being fair in their judgments.  But do not the Minister and House agree with me that it is not fair to place a man, no matter to what Party he originally belonged, in the invidious and frightful position of fixing a constituency boundary when he knows quite well from his previous political experience what will suit one side and what will suit the other?</P>
    <P>Taking a practical example; suppose he has to fix a constituency where there is a town, where some local authority always had a majority for one Party, and that town consists of two-thirds of the electorate and he wants to include that town in one constituency or another, suppose there is a candidate for one Party living in the <Col N="1432" /> town, while the candidate for the other Party lives outside it.  Obviously, he knows if he fixes it in a certain way, it must help an individual candidate who will stand and probably stand for the next ten years, if he is a young man.  That is a temptation and a load we should not put upon these men.  We should leave it, as the British have left it, to the head of the Statistics Office and to people such as those who fix the constituency boundaries in England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales.</P>
    <P>The provision for the election and the appointment of a member of the Constituency Commission is, in my view, unfair.  It provides that the President may remove a member after consultation with the Council of State and after consultation with the Taoiseach, if he happens to be a Government nominee, and with the Ceann Comhairle, if he happens to be an Opposition nominee.  I submit the word &ldquo;consultation&rdquo; means nothing here.  All it means is that the President meets these people and has a discussion with them, and then says: &ldquo;I am going to remove Deputy A or Deputy B.&rdquo;  On one occasion, I held the view that a member of the Milk Costings Commission should have been removed because he came outside and spoke about what was happening inside, and as a result, pressure was exerted on other members of the commission. In this case, I do not think that would be a valid reason for removal. A person may be removed only for incorrect conduct while acting as a member of the commission or, while still a member of the commission, for incorrect conduct outside it.</P>
    <P>A commission must be inviolate.  The word &ldquo;commission&rdquo; means that it has full power.  In the case of the Milk Costings Commission, the argument was put forward that you could not limit it in the time it would take to produce its findings.  This commission is limited in its time; therefore, it is not a commission at all.  A member may be a nuisance and may create trouble for the other members, but if you remove him, it is not a commission. A commission must not be subject to dictation from outside.  If a member is in the position that he <Col N="1433" /> knows he can be removed by forces outside the commission, then it is not a commission at all and that procedure would be unjust and unfair.</P>
    <P>Under sub-section (7), the quorum is fixed at four.  The commission consists of six members and a chairman.  While it may sound far-fetched, I submit that, in certain circumstances, the entire three members representing the Opposition could be removed and the commission could still function with the chairman appointed from the High Court by the President and with three Government nominees.  The commission could produce its findings and nobody could say &ldquo;boo&rdquo; to it.</P>
    <P>Is it right that we should put through legislation which leaves the Government in the position that they alone can fix the constituency boundaries? In such a situation, if I know the judiciary of this country, the chairman of the commission would resign, but he could be replaced by a man more amenable, and in such a situation, the Opposition would be unable to make its opinions felt and would have no hand in the fixing of the boundaries.</P>
    <P>The framework of this section will bring up once more the town versus country complex.  When you fix the constituency boundaries in this manner, you get a political flavour. That will mean having a solid block of votes in a constituency which should be in another constituency.  If the members of the commission act as I think they will, we shall have the town versus country complex again, and it would be a very bad day for Ireland if we allowed it to proceed.</P>

      <P>I spoke on only one occasion, the Second Reading. In the course of my remarks, I mentioned why this body was being set up and I pointed out that the Government were endeavouring to be extremely careful and fair to avoid any criticism that politics were being introduced.  To prevent that criticism, they proposed the appointment of a commission above reproach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also referred to the remarks of the Leader of the Opposition in the other House in connection with this commission. <Col N="1434" /> I deplored them because I thought they were a very bad headline for the Dáil and Seanad.  I deplore the fact that members of the legal profession appointed by the Government, as it is the right of the Government to appoint them, should be referred to in such a derogatory manner as the Leader of the Opposition referred to them in the Dáil and as the Senators who have spoken here to-day referred to them.  I was a member of this House when another member, who certainly was never a supporter of Fianna Fáil, was appointed a judge.  I refer to the former Senator Kingsmill-Moore, who was appointed a judge by Fianna Fáil.  Is he &ldquo;a lickspittle for Fianna Fáil&rdquo;?</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanODonovan" hpid="Seán Ó Donnabháin Seán Ó Donnabháin">
      <NameTxt>Seán Ó Donnabháin</NameTxt>
      <P>I referred to the remarks of the Leader of the Opposition in the other House.  I want to give a further quotation from those remarks.  At the beginning of his speech, he indicated it would be practically impossible for anybody to divide a constituency or a county area by any system which would make it favourable to one or other of the existing political Parties.  I quote from column 1021, Volume 121 of the Dáil Debates.  Deputy Costello said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I want Deputies&mdash;&mdash; to realise that we have in this country conditions entirely different from those that exist in England or America. In Ireland we have a homogeneous public opinion.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>&mdash;some of us have expressed that view here already&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;In England you have a concentration of Labour due to industrialisation and, due to historical reasons, you have a concentration of people who traditionally vote Conservative. Bournemouth, and I think Sussex County, can always be relied on to vote Conservative.  In the East End of London and in parts dotted all <Col N="1435" /> along the map of Great Britain it can always be said: &lsquo;That area is Labour&rsquo; or &lsquo;That area is Conservative&rsquo;. It is that which has enabled the two-Party system to exist in Britain.</P>
    <P>We have not had that here.  We have a homogeneous public opinion and there is no way of saying that in Kerry, such an area votes for a particular Party or that that area can be relied on to vote for a particular Party.  Neither can it be said of an area in Donegal, the Midlands or elsewhere.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Surely those remarks show the members of the Opposition in the Dáil, and the members of the Opposition here, that it is extremely difficult for any commission which is set up to divide the constituencies in a partisan way. Geographical conditions must be taken into account and such things as the inlets of the sea and the outlets of rivers. Surely to goodness, any sane, thinking person will not insinuate that there can be wholesale wrongs done to any Party, or to any section of the community, by this commission?  It was, to my mind, an extreme attempt to be fair and above reproach that a judge of the Supreme Court should be appointed with six representatives, three from whatever Party constitues the Government for the time being, and three from the Parties the Ceann Comhairle deems to be in opposition.</P>
    <P>I understand that ordinarily the Department of Local Government revises the constituencies, and the number of seats, and that the Department of Local Government puts the revision to the Houses of the Oireachtas.  There is a departure from that procedure here and, to my mind, the departure is to set it above reproach, by having such an independent commission to decide the matter.  The commission is deciding problems that certainly do not allow for any great injustices to any section of the community, or to any area of the country.</P>
    <P>The Leader of the Opposition in the Dáil also criticised this system of appointing a judge, and I must be <Col N="1436" /> allowed again to point to the deplorable attitude adopted by that gentleman. He deplored having a judge appointed as chairman of the commission. That, I think, was a bad lead and if we can take a lead from that, as representing the seriousness of the arguments which have been put up against this Bill, and against this commission, we can take it that the Opposition have a very bad case.</P>
    <P>I shall repeat the quotation here, at column 1030 of the same volume, where the Leader of the Opposition says&mdash;he is putting words into the President's mouth&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;He may say, &lsquo;Thank you, gentlemen, I have consulted you. That is all I have to do.  I will appoint CD,&rsquo; who is a tool of the Government in power, who is what the late Kevin O'Higgins would have called a legal careerist, who got his job on the bench because he was the lickspittle of a political Party.  That is the system supposed to give us impartiality and supposed to create public confidence in this white sepulchre, the commission set up under this Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I deplore that attitude and I think it is a very bad line of approach.  It is uncalled-for that that line should be taken in either House of the Oireachtas.  I think that in no case could any criticism be made that any member of the judiciary, appointed by either Government, has acted in any way that could be criticised while he held such office.  We appoint the judiciary to interpret the laws as we enact them and to administer justice. It is unfair to suggest that members of the judiciary, from the District Court to the Supreme Court, are unfit, or improper people, to decide these things.  Members of the judiciary have to inquire into litigation between citizens and in criminal courts and they have acted on tribunals set up by the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>This is such a simple thing compared with the duties involved where matters of life and death have to be decided by the members of the judiciary and this simple effort to avoid criticism of the scheme, to have it supremely fair, has <Col N="1437" /> been subjected to this uncalled-for criticism by members of the other House, and by members of this House. I think all the points raised on all the sections of this Bill, and the alternatives suggested, have been justified in debate, but for the Opposition to come along with this venom to criticise the members of the judiciary is, I think, a disgrace to this House, as well as to the members of the other House.  That is strong language.  Members of the Fianna Fáil Government have appointed opponents who were in the Oireachtas.  There may be others but two come to my mind&mdash;Mr. Justice Kingsmill Moore and Judge Fionan Lynch, who was an old colleague in 1916, and was appointed as a judge by a Fianna Fáil Government.  Is the criticism to be taken seriously that there was something wrong in appointing them?  It is the right of the Government to appoint them as judges. I do not know, at any rate, that criticism has ever been levelled against them for doing their job unsatisfactorily.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>I claim that we are entitled to criticise this commission and also to criticise the Government for the setting up of this commission.  Listening to Senator Ó Donnabháin, one would think that the Fianna Fáil Party were a conscientious Party that would not stoop to anything underhand. Unfortunately, they have not proved themselves such in the past, and as far as we are concerned, we cannot trust them in the future.</P>
      <P>He stated that in an endeavour to be very careful, this commission was being set up, that it was above reproach. In my view, it is just a case of whitewashing to try to make everything seem all right.  Remember that a commission can be a cover for anything. The Senator also stated that he deplored what the Leader of the Opposition had stated about judges in the other House.  He claimed that judges are as human as anybody else. As the majority of them are Fianna Fáil, both in the High Court and the Supreme Court, we all, to our grief, know how human Fianna Fáil can be at times.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He stated that no commission, if it <Col N="1438" /> were set up at the moment, could divide constituencies into favourable areas for any Party.  Senator Ó Donnabháin stated that.  I do not intend to go back over all the gerrymandering that was done in 1947, but I shall give one or two examples.  Sligo-Leitrim was a Fine Gael constituency and returned at one time five Fine Gael candidates out of seven.  Dublin South-West was a predominantly Fianna Fáil constituency.  At the time I speak of, there were six seats in Sligo-Leitrim for an electorate of 69,000. Although everywhere else in the country the Taoiseach was trying to make smaller, three seat constituencies, he amalgamated Sligo and Leitrim and made it a five seat constituency.  In Dublin South-West, you have a three seat constituency with an electorate of 29,000.  In other words, it took over 14,000 votes to return a Fine Gael Deputy in Sligo-Leitrim, whereas a Fianna Fáil Deputy could be returned in Dublin South-West with a little over 9,500.  If that was not gerrymandering by a political Party, I do not know what gerrymandering is.</P>
    <P>We also know what happened in my constituency.  The town of Athlone was put into County Longford for certain reasons.  We know also that Youghal was taken out of Cork and put into County Waterford in order to beat a certain individual, a prominent member of the Fine Gael Party, at that time.  As regards gerrymandering in the North, under their system of election, in Derry, where you have 29,000 Nationalists and 18,000 Unionists, the Unionists return 12 members to the local council and the Nationalists only eight.</P>
    <P>It is only right that we should question the composition of this commission. There are three members from the Government side to be nominated by the Taoiseach and three from the Opposition to be nominated by the Ceann Comhairle. There is to be an independent chairman who is to be nominated by the President, and to make it look better, they have provided in the Bill that the President must have the advice of the Council of State.</P>
    <P>The chairman of this commission <Col N="1439" /> has extraordinary powers, powers that were never given to the chairman of any commission in the past.  The Council of State, we are told, are to advise the President.  That is more whitewash.  This Council of State has 14 members; nine of them are Fianna Fáil and the politics of the other five are not too well known.  In any case, Fianna Fáil have a further advantage there.</P>
    <P>Let us deal with the group from whom the chairman is to be selected. One member of the Supreme Court has been a Fianna Fáil Deputy and an Attorney-General for a number of years.  Another was selected as a Fianna Fáil candidate and was not elected by the people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>After listening to the remarks of Senator Seáan Ó Donnabháin, I shall pursue it. Another member was selected as a Fianna Fáil candidate.  He was not elected by the people, but he was Attorney-General for the Fianna Fáil Party afterwards.  Another member was a member of the Seanad for the Fianna Fáil Party and another has been a State prosecutor under a Fianna Fáil Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now let us come to the High Court. One member ran for election for Fianna Fáil and was not elected by the people.  Another was a Fianna Fáil Senator for a time, and all the others were either public prosecutors or Attorneys-General under a Fianna Fáil Government.  One of those members is to be appointed by the President and it is only fair to ask: would he forget <Col N="1440" /> his love for the Fianna Fáil Party and for the Taoiseach, even though he is a judge of the Supreme Court or the High Court?  I doubt if the Nationalists in the North would be satisfied, in the event of a constituency commission being set up by the Governor-General, if the Governor-General were to select a judge of the Northern Court as chairman of the commission.  In any case, a judge is not the best person to be chairman of this commission.  His job is to deal with judicial matters and no matter what is said here, this is a political matter. It is only natural to expect that people who were Fianna Fáil politicians in the past but who are now on the Bench, would be likely to think exactly as the Taoiseach is thinking at the present time.</P>

      <P>I did not expect that there would be such a heated discussion on this section because, having read the section, I for one could not devise a better method of appointing the commission envisaged. Scrupulous care is being taken under this section to give fair representation to both sides of Dáil Éireann on this commission with an independent chairman. I do not know of any better way of appointing the members of this commission.  However, no matter what method of appointment would be adopted under this Bill it would be adversely criticised by the members opposite.  If you could appoint six saints on this commission, presided over by an independent chairman, they would still oppose it.</P>

      <P>Yes.  It appears to me that some of the members opposite take a very poor view of the judiciary.  As Senator Ó Donnabháin <Col N="1441" /> has already said, a very bad lead was given to them by the Leader of the Opposition in the Dáil.  I shall not go into this matter any more fully than that.  It is very undesirable to refer to the judiciary in the way it had been referred to in this House to-day.  Remember, the fact that a man has been associated with a political Party does not take from his integrity or his efficiency.  From the way some people have spoken here, one would think that the fact of a person belonging to a political Party is something to damn him for all time.  Why should we take up that attitude?  It is, to my mind, the worst form of inferiority complex, and the sooner we get away from it, the better.</P>
      <P>In his contribution to the debate on this section, Senator L'Estrange took up an extraordinary attitude when he said that nothing was good in Fianna Fáil.  That was an extraordinary statement for a Senator to make.  Everything Fianna Fáil does is wrong, according to him.  While listening to him, I was reminded of the parable of the Pharisee and the Publican.  The Pharisee could see no good in the Publican, and that is the attitude Senator L'Estrange has taken up in this House to-day.</P>

In the first place, I think it would be highly unlikely that the chairman would resign, because a member of the High Court or the Supreme Court, if appointed chairman of such a commission, would regard it as part of his judicial functions to preside over that commission.  After all, very often in the ordinary course of events, members of the High Court and the Supreme Court have been appointed by the Oireachtas to various functions which could be regarded as semi-judicial and, in fact, they regard them as part of their duties and perform <Col N="1442" /> them conscientiously and according to their judicial judgment.</P>

      <P>The same can be said of this, that this is a semi-judicial function.  A judge of the Supreme Court or the High Court, as the case may be, would be appointed in a semi-judicial capacity and, no doubt, it would be his duty to preside over the deliberations of the commission in a just and impartial way.  Now if the judicial chairman of the commission were to resign, there is nothing in the section to prevent the appointment of a successor.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator L'Estrange went, more or less, off the rails in his approach to the section.  He mentioned the question of gerrymandering and purported to give us some examples of gerrymandering that took place in the past during the period of office of a Fianna Fáil Government. The matter of the distribution of the seats was, at the time, the function of Dáil Éireann.  If the Senator will throw his mind back, he will remember that the members of Dáil Éireann in 1947, in the full light of day, went into this whole question. <Col N="1443" /> What is the use of talking about gerrymandering when the public representatives of the people went very fully indeed into the whole matter?  We heard no reference to gerrymandering from any responsible Deputy, as far as I can remember.</P>

      <P>I should like Senators to produce some evidence of that.  The members of the various Parties in the Dáil approached this matter with open minds.  They approached it objectively and I do not think there was any disposition on the part of Deputies on any side of the House to encourage gerrymandering.</P>

      <P>I shall not discuss that now; I am not in a position to go into all the details.  As I said before, no matter what the personnel, this commission will be faulted.  Fault will be found with it, but I do not believe the members opposite are at all sincere, nor do I believe those who criticised the commission in the Dáil were serious in their criticisms.  In the course of the debate on the Second Reading, the Tánaiste referred to this section and said it was not the last word and if the members of the Opposition could point to a better system of appointing the commission, or would put down amendments to the section, their suggestions would be sympathetically considered.  Were there any amendments put down to the section?</P>

      <P>I do not think there were.  This is a fair method of appointing the commission.  The Government Party will get fair representation; the Opposition Parties will get equally fair representation.  I do not see how we could get a better, or a more impartial chairman than a member <Col N="1444" /> of the judiciary&mdash;a member of the High Court or the Supreme Court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DominickMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>This section deals with the appointment of a commission and it seems to me rather beside the point whether or not the commission can be regarded as impartial.  To my mind, they will be designed as the rubber stamp to the proposals drawn up in the Party rooms of Fianna Fáil. The position now is that the Department&mdash;in other words, the Minister for Local Government&mdash;brings forward proposals for the revision of the constituencies and these are criticised and debated in the full light of day in Dáil Éireann.  What is proposed is that the Minister will put his proposals to this commission and within six months, the commission will be obliged to put a rubber stamp on those proposals. Does any Senator imagine that, in that short space of time, a commission of seven could examine all those proposals in detail?  Will they have sufficient local knowledge to criticise them objectively and put forward alternative proposals?  What is being set up here is a facade in the form of a commission to rubber stamp the proposals drawn up by Fianna Fáil for the new single member constituencies.</P>
      <P>It is really unfair to ask that a judge of the High Court or the Supreme Court should preside over a commission of this sort.  I do not in any way doubt the impartiality or ability of those judges to deal with matters of law in courts of law.  What one of them will be asked to do here is to preside over this commission, get the proposals from the Department of Local Government&mdash;which, of course, would have been drawn up already by the Fianna Fáil people&mdash;and say in a matter of six months, whether they are approved or not.  I think it is wrong that a judge should be put in that position.  It is unfair to him.  He is not being asked to act as a judge to interpret the law and deal with a matter in a court of law; he is being asked to deal with a political matter, that is the reallocation of constituencies, in a short period of time.  It is really debasing the judiciary to bring a judge into it at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us look now at the composition <Col N="1445" /> of the rest of this commission.  Three of the ordinary members of the commission are appointed by the Taoiseach and the other three are appointed by the Ceann Comhairle of Dáil Éireann. I know the people on the other side will tell me that the Ceann Comhairle of Dáil Éireann at the moment is not a Fianna Fáil Deputy, that he is a Labour Deputy.  That happens to be the position at the moment.  However, the tendency is for the Party in power to have as Ceann Comhairle a member of their own Party.  In other words, we will have the rather ridiculous situation that the Taoiseach, a member of Fianna Fáil, will appoint three to act on this commission; and the Ceann Comhairle, a member of Fianna Fáil, will appoint the other three&mdash;three whom he would deem to be in opposition.</P>
    <P>One may say that the Ceann Comhairle, before making any such appointment, would consult with the Leader of the Opposition and would make an appointment of those recommended or proposed by the Leader of the Opposition.  That, However, is not in the Bill; the Bill does not say that. The Ceann Comhairle might appoint three innocuous members of the Opposition&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am glad to hear that.  However, there is the possibility that there might be three who would be regarded as harmless or not too questioning of the proposals of Fianna Fáil for the redrawing of the constituencies. For those reasons I oppose the section.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>As Senator Ó Ciosáin pointed out, the Opposition members put down no amendment to this section.  It has been before them now for a good number of months.  If they had been really concerned about the section, they had plenty of time to put forward amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was interesting to hear Senator O'Quigley taking the line he did about the judges, in view of the line his leader took in the Dáil.  Senator O'Quigley was concerned lest we might pull these <Col N="1446" /> innocent judges into political controversy. Deputy Costello thought they were all Party lickspittles, that they could not be dragged down any further.  As Senator Ó Donnabháin pointed out, Deputy Costello had no hesitation in saying what he thought about them.</P>
    <P>The experience of our people and of members of the Dáil and Seanad over the years has been that, by and large, and indeed without exception, the judges have acted honourably as between citizen and citizen and as between the State and the private individual. It was in view of their record in that regard, and in view of the suspicions which might be aroused throughout the country if we continued the old system of fixing boundaries by the Dáil, that the Government decided to put into this Bill to amend the Constitution that the chairman would be a member of the judiciary.</P>
    <P>Senator Hayes asked whether the judges were consulted.  I do not think they were.  I have not heard that any of the judges were consulted in this matter. In a lot of other Bills we pass here, we assign certain duties to judges.  I have never known them not to accept the duties imposed upon them by the Oireachtas.  I feel certain that a member of the judiciary, of the Supreme Court or High Court, will accept the rather onerous job of presiding over this commission and I feel, too, that he will carry out his functions in a manner which will give general satisfaction.</P>
    <P>This commission will not work behind closed doors.  It will not issue some secret decisions, which will be implemented in secret.  Everybody throughout the country is interested in the question of the constituency in which he and his family will be voting. The judge, the chairman of the commission, is helped by the six members of the Dáil.  The result of their work will be reviewed by a lot of people who take a very active interest in the constituency boundaries.</P>
    <P>I do not want to discuss the next section in detail because we have not come to it, but it is clearly set out in that section that the boundaries must be drawn on a fair and equitable basis in accordance with the provisions of <Col N="1447" /> the section.  Whether or not the commission carries out its work fairly will be a matter open for discussion throughout the country and in the Dáil. If the Dáil by a two-thirds majority decides that the commission has acted unfairly, they can reject the report of the commission.  The reason why we put in two-thirds as the number requisite to reject the proposals of the commission was that if it were a simple majority, it might be alleged that the Government of the day, having a majority, could keep on rejecting the reports of commissions until such time as it got something that suited its own political book.</P>
    <P>I do not know how Senator Murphy can say that the judge who undertakes this task will be a mere rubber-stamp, who will put his name to a scheme of boundaries drawn up by the Minister for Local Government and his advisers.  The chairman will have to take responsibility for the document to which he puts his name, and I am sure the Department of Local Government will assist him by giving him all the data it can in relation to constituencies. Heretofore, the Dáil took the decision as to constituency boundaries, without the aid of any commission; the procedure was that officials in the Department of Local Government drew up an approved scheme, submitted it to the Minister and, if he approved of it, he then put it before the Dáil.</P>
    <P>The last time boundaries were revised was in 1947.  There were, I am sure, allegations of gerrymandering; I would be very surprised if there were not some allegations of that kind in such a debate.  But, by and large, it was agreed that the scheme was as good as could be got.  Like all the other works of man, it was not perfect; but it was as good as could be got. There was a dispute between Wexford and Mayo as to which constituency should have an extra seat.  The Government, in order to make certain that there could be no allegation of unfairness, left the matter to a free vote of the House.  I forget how the matter was decided.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Quigley and Senator Ó Ciosáin asked what would happen <Col N="1448" /> should the chairman resign?  The President has power to appoint a chairman in the first instance.  He also has power to fill any vacancies that may occur.  A query arose in relation to the quorum being four and in relation to the fact that the chairman, plus the three Government members, could carry on the work, even though the three Opposition members resigned because of some allegation of unfairness. If such allegations should arise, we would hear all about them.  The matter could be debated and, in the last analysis, it is the people themselves who will be the judges as to whether there was foul play practised against political opponents.</P>
    <P>I agree thoroughly with what Deputy Costello said in the Dáil about gerrymandering.  He said it was impossible in our circumstances; we have the same type of population all over the country, and no political Party could have any surety from year to year as to the way the population of a certain area might vote.  The people might vote for Fianna Fáil one year, for Fine Gael next year, and for some other Party the year after.  I think it would be impossible to gerrymander. It is most important, however, that not only should fair play be done in a matter of this kind, but it should be quite apparent to everybody that fair play has in fact been done.</P>
    <P>We have made our proposals.  I think they are reasonable proposals.  I believe the vast majority of the people will hold that we have at least made an effort to outline a scheme which will give fair play to all.  Not everything in relation to the commission has gone into this Amendment of the Constitution Bill, but it is provided in Section 6 that &ldquo;subject to the provisions of this article, any matter whatsoever relating to constituency commissions, or their members, may be provided for by law&rdquo;.  That sub-section contemplates that there will be a Bill brought forward, if necessary, to settle details in relation to commissions.  If such a Bill is brought forward, then Deputies and Senators will be in a position to put in amendments to ensure that the provisions are in keeping with the basic fair play promised in the constitutional amendment itself.</P>

      <P>There is a peculiar piece of English in sub-section 7º of the section, which reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The quorum of a constituency commission shall be four, and a commission may act notwithstanding vacancies in their membership.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;A commission in their membership.&rdquo; I note that that is tied up with a phrase in the Constitution.  I take it that it is tied up with a phrase regarding a commission which sits if the President is ill.  Article 14 (3) of the Constitution provides: &ldquo;The said commission may act by any two of their number.&rdquo;  I note that, in the interpretation of the Act, the plural includes the singular and the singular includes the plural.  However, I cannot see why you should have a phrase like &ldquo;the commission may act notwithstanding <Col N="1450" /> vacancies in their membership.&rdquo; I think it is quite plain that it should be in &ldquo;its&rdquo; membership.</P>

There are many ways of getting over the obstacle.  You could say &ldquo;vacancies in the membership&rdquo; or you could say &ldquo;The commission may act, notwithstanding vacancies in the membership.&rdquo;  Here, it is specifically &ldquo;a commission.&rdquo;  In the earlier part of it, the reference was to &ldquo;the commission&rdquo;.

We rather specialise in the appointment of statutory bodies in this country.

      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, Sir. These two amendments relate to the second sub-section of Section 4, the last portion of which reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;...the commission shall proceed to determine or to revise the boundaries of the constituencies on a fair and equitable basis, having due regard to geographical features and established administrative and territorial divisions and, subject to those considerations, in such manner that the population of each constituency, as ascertained at the last preceding census, shall, so far as it is practicable, be the same throughout the country.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The effect of my amendments would be to remove the words &ldquo;so far as it is practicable&rdquo; and to insert the words, &ldquo;to within a tolerated variation of five hundred either way&rdquo;.  The purpose of the two amendments, which must be taken together, is to remedy a defect in the present wording which seems to me to be insufficiently precise.  The aim of the sub-section is, clearly, to make representation bear a uniform relationship to population throughout the country.  The phrase, &ldquo;so far as it is practicable&rdquo; seems to me, however, to be unwisely vague.  I think you must tolerate a certain variation, but I <Col N="1454" /> should like to see that variation kept within precise bounds.  If the ordinary size of the constituency is to be about 25,000 or something of that kind, then, I do not think any constituency should vary by more than 500 persons either above or below that average figure. That is the purpose of my amendments; in other words, to employ more precise terms than the phrase &ldquo;so far as it is practicable&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I do not know if Senators have quite realised how complicated it may well prove to be in certain areas to draw the boundaries of constituencies so as to ensure that the population of constituencies throughout the country &ldquo;shall be the same&rdquo;.  I suggest that it will be very difficult to draw such boundaries.</P>
    <P>The origin of the word &ldquo;gerrymander&rdquo;, I believe, came from America, where the appearance of the drawn constituency was said to look like a salamander, and somebody said, making play upon the candidate's name, &ldquo;It looks more like a &lsquo;Gerry&rsquo;-mander to me.&rdquo;  I am afraid some of our constituencies, without having the meaning of corruption that the word &ldquo;gerrymander&rdquo; conveys, will have very peculiar shape.  I do not mean peculiar shape politically; I mean just on the administrative side.  If one tries to divide up Dublin or, indeed, any county so as to provide for the same population in every constituency, there will be some pretty queerly-shaped constituencies.  I do not know whether that fact has been sufficiently adverted to by people discussing this Bill so far.  Of course, one of the great advantages of the multiple-seat constituency is that if there is a variation of population all you need to do is to say there will be one more seat or one seat less in that constituency, and you can have as a constituency a normal administrative unit like a county or a portion of a city.  But, when the constituencies in Dublin, for instance, or in Cork, are redrawn in order to try to have in every constituency practically the same population, in accordance with the desire of this sub-section, the arrangement, the drawing, the shape <Col N="1455" /> of these new constituencies will be very peculiar indeed.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that there is any intention on the part of the Government to arrange for gerrymandering or anything of that kind.  I do not accept that suggestion.  But I do believe that if it is made very precise that constituencies have to be, within a tolerated margin of 500 each way, that is to say, within 1,000 persons, identical in size, then you render it extremely difficult for anybody in future to attempt anything like gerrymandering. Whereas, if you leave it vague, and just say &ldquo;so far as it is practicable&rdquo;, you could argue a lot about that phrase and say, &ldquo;That is not practicable but this is.&rdquo;  I suggest that by adopting my amendments, it is made more precise, the meaning is made more precise, and it is made less likely that there will be any attempt to overload certain constituencies with a certain type of voter, and to underload certain other constituencies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Sheehy Skeffington disclosed the reason for the language in this sub-section when he pointed out that if you were to have precisely the same number in every constituency, some of the constituencies would have pretty queer shapes.  The commission has not only to produce constituencies having as far as it is practicable the same population, but they also have to advert to other very important considerations. They have to have regard to the local administrative convenience of the people and they have to revise the boundaries of the constituencies on a fair and equitable basis, having due regard to the geographical features and established administrative and territorial divisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the constituencies were being revised in 1947, it was difficult sometimes to get a constituency to coincide with a county or county borough.  In the case of Clare, the Minister had to propose to the Dáil to take in a parish or two from Galway and, in the case of Wexford, to take in a parish or two from Carlow.  If we were to say to the new commission that the overriding consideration is equality of population in every constituency, many more <Col N="1456" /> counties and county boroughs would be broken up.  Take, for example, County Louth and County Monaghan. I do not know what the populations are, but suppose it worked out that in County Louth the population was sufficient to give three seats within the county boundaries on the basis of 25,000 per seat and you found that in County Monaghan you could not work in three seats, unless it was on the basis of 23,000 per seat.  It is more important from the point of view of the convenience of the voter, the convenience of administration and the preparation of registers that, if possible, County Monaghan should be given three seats and County Louth three seats, despite the difference of more than, 1,000 votes per seat.</P>
    <P>We come then to the question of County Wicklow.  County Wicklow will be a headache for the commission. It always was.  There are mountains running through the county.  It may be that in West Wicklow, there is a population of 21,000 and in East Wicklow, across the mountains, there are, say, 50,000, which would work out, if you split East Wicklow into two, at 25,000, whereas, in West Wicklow, there would be only 21,000.  It is very difficult to cross the mountains.  There are very few passes through them and, if you put a parish or two across the mountains into West Wicklow, it would be very inconvenient indeed.  I think it would be very wrong for us to tie the commission to the very narrow limits suggested by Senator Sheehy Skeffington.  One of the things the Senator may be certain of is that people will take an interest in what is going on, and I think the commission itself is so arranged that if the chairman departs from a fair and equitable basis of distribution in the revision of the constituencies, the commission's report can be turned down by the Dáil. I think the checks and balances and the terms of reference are as complete and comprehensive as are necessary.</P>
    <P>To go as precisely into the matter as the Senator suggests might lead us into difficulties, and I do not think it is necessary in order to ensure that the constituencies will be revised on a fair and equitable basis by the commission.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has told us that he does not think the limits suggested by my amendment would be wide enough, but I should like to ask him, if that is so, what kind of outside limits would he consider likely when the commission has to draw up constituencies so that &ldquo;the population of each constituency shall be the same throughout the country, so far as it is practicable&rdquo;?  My suggestion is that they should not vary by more than 1,000, that is to say, by more than 500 either way.  The Minister indicates that they may not be the same in all cases, though they are required to be the same.</P>
      <P>Though the phrase in the sub-section is qualified by the wording &ldquo;so far as it is practicable,&rdquo; the Minister tells us they are, in fact, going to differ by more than 1,000.  Some of these constituencies may, in fact, have only 20,000 inhabitants and, therefore, that would be quite a departure from the idea that they are all going to be the same.  The question I want to ask the Minister is what sort of tolerated variation does he anticipate?  What is the order of magnitude of the maximum variation that he anticipates as proving necessary in certain cases?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not answer that. All I know is this: that the commission will have to have regard, due regard, to the geographical features, and established administrative and territorial divisions.  They will have to have regard to those and I think that the tendency will be, if they can divide a county into three or four or five constituencies neatly, they will do so, even though it does mean some difference in population between the constituencies. They will have to have regard to the administrative convenience, to the convenience of working the constituencies.</P>

      <P>I should like to point out to Senator Sheehy Skeffington that sub-section (3) of Section 2 provides for a variation between 20,000 and 30,000 of a population.  The average between them, therefore, would be 25,000.  If the Senator's amendment were passed, we could only have a variation of 500 either way, and that would negative sub-section (3) of Section 2 which has been passed already, and which allows of a variation between 20,000 and 30,000 in a constituency.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator O'Donovan is under a misapprehension, because it is quite clear, under sub-section (3) of Section 2, that it would be possible to decide to have the population in each constituency fixed at any one number between 20,000 and 30,000.  You could decide that it shall be 22,000 or that it shall be 27,000. What this sub-section says, and I quote, is: &ldquo;...the population of each constituency...shall, so far as it is practicable, be the same throughout the country.&rdquo;  My question is, does this qualifying phrase &ldquo;so far as it is practicable&rdquo;, cover differences of 5,000 or 6,000 population in constituencies? If so, I would just make two final points.  The first is that this demonstrates the unfairness of the scheme we are being asked to introduce, when you compare it with multi-seat constituencies, and, secondly, it would leave me distinctly uneasy as to what kind of constituency we are finally going to get.</P>

      <P>In Part II, Section 4. 4º, lines 13 and 14, to delete &ldquo;and no minority report shall be presented.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This amendment relates to sub-section (4) of this same section which reads as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Commission's report shall be signed by the chairman or other member so directed by the commission, and no minority report shall be presented.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My amendment&mdash;and the same amendment was put down by Senator Quinlan and Senator O'Brien&mdash;recommends the deletion of the words &ldquo;and no minority report shall be presented&rdquo;.  The object of the amendment is quite clear, but the object of the insertion of these words &ldquo;and no minority report shall be presented&rdquo; is far from clear.  If there is a difference of opinion on any commission, it is quite normal for the member, or members, dissenting to be able to publish their opinion as a minority report and to have it incorporated as a minority report with the majority report.  That is the universal practice in regard to all commissions.  I think I could say it is almost universally the case with every Government commission that has been set up that there has been a minority report of one kind or another.  In the Council of Education you had two or three minority reports, which were duly signed and printed and circulated with the official report of the council.  I could cite other <Col N="1460" /> examples, but there is no need to do so.  The almost universal practice, therefore, is that a minority report can be brought in.</P>
    <P>Even in the Supreme Court, it is quite usual for one or other of the judges not merely to dissent from the majority judgment from the Bench, but to give his own judgment, his own minority judgment, and to give it just as publicly and with just as much carrying-power, as it were, before the public as in the case of the majority judges.  It is not considered to be improper in judicial circles for that to be the case; it is not regarded as in any way impairing the prestige of the Supreme Court or the High Court; and I am at a loss to understand why the minority members of this commission, if there be any, should be specifically precluded from publicly bringing in their minority report.</P>
    <P>I am, of course, aware that if there is minority opinion on this commission, nothing can prevent them from making public their feelings and beliefs, but I see no reason why they should be prevented from doing so officially.  I see no case at all for desiring to smother any tendency there might be to issue a minority report.  What, in fact, are the framers and sponsors of this Bill afraid of in precluding any potential minority on such commission forever in the future&mdash;it is not just this first commission but any such commission &mdash;from giving their views?  I do not think that this gives a very good notion of the sponsor's respect for minority opinion when it exists, and I feel that while it is clear that minority opinion should not be allowed to overrule majority opinion nevertheless it ought to have the right to be as publicly and as officially expressed.  Therefore, I move that these words be deleted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan2" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is nothing unique in this sub-section.  Senator Sheehy Skeffington has said that in the Supreme Court minority judgments are often given and that they give judgments other than the one adopted by the majority of the court, but in fact under Article 26 of the Constitution, <Col N="1461" /> where a Bill is referred to the Supreme Court to decide whether or not it is repugnant to the Constitution, the Constitution specifically lays down that a minority judgment will not be given.  To the best of my recollection, the same applies to the judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal, so that, whereas sometimes in some commissions and some courts minority reports and judgments are given, in many other cases they are not given.</P>
      <P>It is quite obvious that this commission may think up several solutions to the problem of any particular constituency, all of them quite good solutions, but one solution must be adopted.  I do not see what purpose would be served by having possibly two or three minority reports as well as the majority one.  This report will be placed on the Table of the Dáil and it will be confusing to have the Dáil in the position of having to consider whether they approve or disapprove of the report, if in fact it means they must consider whether they approve or disapprove, not of one but of two or three reports.  Members of the commission will all be members of the Dáil and if they feel they have a better solution than the solution incorporated in the majority report, they can raise it in the Dáil and if the Dáil considers it is a better solution than the majority one, it is open to the Dáil to adopt their point of view.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnOQuigley" hpid="Mr. O'Quigley Mr. O'Quigley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Quigley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am entirely in sympathy with this amendment.  It does seem strange that there should be provision in the Constitution, which this Bill proposes to insert, against the issue of a minority report, when the factual position can be, and probably will be, that the view of the minority will be freely expressed in Dáil Éireann, once the report of the commission itself has been presented to the Dáil.  There seems to be no good reason for attempting to achieve something which will not be achieved in any event.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Ryan has just referred to the fact that there may be circumstances in which the commission would have several good solutions to a problem. If that be the case there is no reason <Col N="1462" /> why the commission, which has deliberated on the matter over a period of six months, should not give the benefit of their deliberations to the Dáil in the form of a minority report.  It is true, as Senator Ryan has said, that there is provision in the Constitution against the Supreme Court indicating more than one opinion on the constitutionality of a Bill, but there are very good reasons for that.  I think that provision was put in by amendment in 1941 by the Legislature&mdash;it was not in the original 1937 Constitution&mdash;and it is there because there are good reasons why dissenting judgments should not be given in a case of that kind.  But there is no reason in a case of this kind for having this provision when dissenting opinions would, in any event, be expressed.</P>
    <P>Earlier, the Minister for External Affairs chided us and, indeed, taunted us with the accusation that we had not put down any amendments to this part of the Bill dealing with the commission and said that it had been indicated in the Dáil that any reasonable amendments put down would be considered. I think this is an eminently reasonable amendment and I see no reason why the Minister should not accept it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is little I can say on this amendment.  It is one of those self-evident ones, because I cannot see why, if this commission is to be as fair and as impartial as has been suggested in the debate, there should be anything to fear from having minority reports.  Why not get the views of the minority?  It is said these will be expressed in any case, so why not give them in black and white and leave them on the records, together with the majority view?  After all, there is the provision which requires a majority of two-thirds of the House for a change.  What have we to fear therefore?  I think this amendment, more than any other, should be a test of the good faith of the Government in approaching this matter.  I ask: Are the Government prepared of their own volition to take this amendment back to the Dáil?  The Bill is going back in any case since the two main provisions have been deleted.  Let them, therefore, take it back to the Dáil and insert this most reasonable amendment. <Col N="1463" /> There is nothing more I can say until I have heard from the Minister why this very reasonable course should not be taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I think everybody will agree that it is a rather complicated matter to divide the Twenty-Six Counties into 140 or 150 seats or whatever the number may be.  Undoubtedly, if different individuals were given the job, they would do it somewhat differently.  Perhaps the six members of the Dáil would have six different opinions about minor details.  The design of this amendment of the Constitution is to give the Government and the Dáil a means by which there can be a fair and equitable distribution and revision of the seats, and by which the decision as to the boundaries will be taken by a commission that is independent of the Government and the chairman of which is in a very independent and influential position.  In one way, you could regard the six members of the Dáil as his assessors to give him advice.</P>
      <P>In the sub-section we have just passed&mdash;sub-section (3) of Section 4&mdash; we have empowered the chairman of the commission to present to the President a report setting out the boundaries of the constituencies, which he must determine if there is not a majority or unanimity in the commission. We give him that right because we want a method by which he can come to a conclusion.  This is not like the normal proposition put up to a debating society.  A conclusion has to be arrived at.  It is difficult to revise the boundaries&mdash;it is a complicated affair&mdash;and we give the chairman of the commission the right, in the last resort, to make a recommendation.  His recommendation will carry the day, if it is not turned down by a two-thirds majority of the Dáil.  I explained that the reason his recommendation would carry the day, if not turned down by two-thirds, is that it gives that part of the House not voting for the Government a better chance than if the chairman's report could be turned down by a simple majority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Ryan pointed out that while a minority of one, two or three members cannot make a formal report to <Col N="1464" /> the Dáil, they can of course put in amendments to the report of the chairman if they do not agree with it.  They are members of the Dáil.  They can put in amendments to the report and if a majority of two-thirds concur in their criticism, the report can be turned down.</P>
    <P>This again is one part of the Bill that has been under discussion for a great number of months, and in spite of that, there has been no amendment to change sub-section (3) which gives the chairman the power to make the report although there is not a majority of the commission in favour of the report. We think it is a clear-cut way of solving a difficulty, if the commission does not agree.  It is the best method we could think of to meet this situation, and I think any reasonable person will agree with us that it is a workable solution and that it is not unfair to anybody.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Ryan said he does not see the purpose of having a minority report, but I think that that can be related to the fact he mentioned that, under sub-section (2) of Section 5, Dáil Éireann is to be given the right to amend the report if it so desires.  For the purpose of amending it, Dáil Éireann ought to be in full possession of the facts, ought to have full knowledge of the facts, and to have not merely a majority report but also a minority report.  If you suppose that they might be likely to amend the report, then you are supposing that it is possible for Dáil Éireann to take a different view from the majority report.  Consequently, you are conceding it as possible that Dáil Éireann might share the views of those who would be likely to draw up a minority report.  That is the implication of the power granted under the subsequent sub-section to Dáil Éireann to amend the report by a two-thirds majority, if it sees fit. Therefore, the purpose of allowing the minority report to be printed would be in order to allow the Dáil to judge whether or not it wants to exercise the power here vested in it to amend the majority report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is unfair to say: &ldquo;We give you the power to amend the majority <Col N="1465" /> report but we will not tell you what the minority report is, and will not even allow it to be published.  We expect you to find that out from the speeches of the members of the minority when they go to the Dáil.&rdquo; That is not the orderly or methodical way of setting about it.  Therefore it seems to me that it ought to be regarded as perfectly legitimate that (a) there should be a minority report, and (b) it should be presented side by side with the majority report.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that there is anything disreputable in the conception of a minority report.  It could be perfectly conscientious without necessarily being right.  It is quite possible that you could have a conscientious minority report, with which the majority of the Dáil or the ordinary citizens would not agree, but I do not think that that would be a disgrace in any sense.  I do not think that it is essentially disreputable to indicate that there is a minority as well as a majority view.  Let us not be afraid of printing the minority report side by side with the majority report.  Let the Dáil and the people judge it on its merits.  The Minister has said that the constituents will judge.  Let them judge with the full knowledge of the facts, printed and placed clearly before them.</P>

      <P>Nothing the Minister has said has in any way justified the decision to suppress the minority view on this, but it does seem to be very much in keeping with the whole character of the Bill as suppressing minorities everywhere.  Here we have the thing taken to the extreme&mdash; where even a minority report of the commission is suppressed.  That speaks for itself.  Personally, I again challenge the Minister to show the good faith of the Government in this by, of his own volition, adopting this very reasonable amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not as if, as was suggested by the Minister, there were five or six equally good solutions to this problem. That is not what the disagreement will be about.  The disagreement will be: will the town of Youghal be included in East Cork or in Waterford?  That is the sort of problem we shall have to <Col N="1466" /> face.  If there is any attempt at gerrymandering&mdash;and I hope there is not&mdash; the minority should have the opportunity of expressing that in their report, and have that report fully prepared and documented.</P>
    <P>Remember that a minority report, drawn up as a reasonable document, has to give reasons for the changes it proposes in a majority report.  It is not just a question of redrawing all the constituencies, with every river boundary and every townland, and all the rest. It will be primarily concerned with the location of our towns and you can appreciate how important and vital that is, when you consider the fact that we have got to carve up the country into at least 140 constituencies.  In fact, it would be far better if the whole thing were given over to some established, non-political men in that field, who would go ahead and carve it, according to some principle or other.</P>
    <P>I did not have an opportunity of speaking on one point earlier.  Due to the question being put at 6 o'clock, I yielded, but I want to make a point on the question of having confidence in this commission.  I would have far more confidence if we had some official, such as, say, the ex-director of the Statistics Office, as chairman, somebody whose business it is to deal with facts and figures and who has done so all his life and has a reputation for absolute impartiality.  Such is the man I certainly should like to see in this position.</P>
    <P>I might conclude on one other point which harks back to the last one, but possibly I will be given indulgence because of the fact that I yielded at 6 o'clock.  I disagree very strongly with Senator Donegan on the question of the political appointment of judges.  I think the time has come, in this advanced State, when that, too, should be handed over to the Local Appointments Commission.</P>

      <P Just="Center">and</P>
      <P>In Part II, Section 4, to delete sub-section 6º.</P>
      <P>This amendment does seems to me in many ways to be the most important amendment.  What I am asking for is the deletion of the sub-section which says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;No court shall entertain any question as to whether the commission has been properly constituted or any question as to whether the determination or revision of the boundaries of constituencies set out in their report has been properly carried out.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I am asking for the deletion of this clause for the following reasons.  First of all, I mentioned this on the Second Stage as what appeared to me to be a vital point, and yet no speaker on any side of the House has made any further reference to it.  There was no ministerial comment, there was no comment by any speaker on the Government side, and no comment from any other speaker at all.  Yet it seems to me to be a vitally important principle. We are asked so subscribe to the view that this commission shall be above the courts, that no appeal from its findings shall lie with any court in the land, as to whether it has been properly constituted.  We must accept that, we cannot test it, and we cannot appeal or determine whether its work has been properly done.  These questions cannot be tested in the courts.  It is to be, in this very odd way, placed above the courts both as to its constitution and its workings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I pointed out on the Second <Col N="1469" /> Stage, Article 46 of the Constitution lays down certain conditions for the amending of the Constitution.  Article 46 also makes it quite clear there are certain ways in which we cannot amend the Constitution, and one of those ways is to amend the Constitution and incorporate in the proposal to amend the Constitution some &ldquo;other proposal&rdquo;.  I suggest that this is another proposal.  This is a proposal to remove from the courts power of decision, or power to act as an appellate court, powers which are at present vested in the courts.  I assume that to be the case, because clearly if this clause does not remove from the courts power at present vested in them, then this clause has no function at all.  We are aiming then, to remove from the courts power of decision and power of being an appellate body, which the courts have now, and would continue to have, if we did not pass this sub-section.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, Article 46, Section 4 of the Constitution states:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;A Bill containing a proposal or proposals for the amendment of this Constitution shall not contain any other proposal.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This is legislation to amend the Constitution in relation to the way in which we elect our Parliament.  It is in effect an electoral amendment.  It is a way of changing our electoral methods, and the Constitution specifically says that &ldquo;a Bill containing a proposal or proposals&rdquo;&mdash;and it is clear there are several proposals here in relation to our electoral system&mdash;&ldquo;for the amendment of this Constitution shall not contain any other proposal.&rdquo;  Yet this sub-section contains what is clearly another proposal, a proposal that the courts shall be deprived of some of their existing powers.</P>
    <P>I regard this as extremely important. I am disappointed that no spokesman for the Government thought it of sufficient importance to comment upon it.  I suggest that it is extremely unwise of the Government to persist in asking for this sub-section, for the very simple practical reason that even if they are convinced that this clause does not make the Bill repugnant to the Constitution, <Col N="1470" /> nevertheless it will be possible if this clause remains in the Bill, for any citizen, as I understand it, to make application to the courts to find out whether or not this Bill is rendered repugnant to the Constitution by this very sub-section.  If that were to happen, it is quite clear that, during the time the courts would have to decide whether or not by reason of this clause the Bill was repugnant to the Constitution, it would not be possible to hold the referendum.  I agree with Senator Mullins when he says there is no real hurry about the referendum. He said at column 892, of Volume 50 of the Seanad Debates of 19th February, 1959:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Senator Sheehy Skeffington asks what is the reason for the haste. There is no reason for the haste.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I agree that it does not matter very much whether we take the referendum in 1959, 1960 or 1961, but, in case some members of the Government do not agree with him on this point, and are anxious to hold the referendum reasonably soon, I put it to the Government that they might consider the advisability of dropping this sub-section which, in my view, deprives the courts of powers which they have, and which would enable any citizen to question the courts as to the viability under the Constitution of this Bill. Therefore, I move the deletion of this sub-section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>As a non-legal person, may I say that the view expressed by Senator Sheehy Skeffington commands my sympathy.  In every society there are various bodies from, say, the urban council up to the highest form of council, Parliament.  Similarly, in the case of the courts you have District Courts, Circuit Courts and eventually the Supreme Court.  The essence of the approach in the Constitution is the separation of the powers, not of course to the extent that exists in the United States but the essential separation which means that the courts are not alone to be independent of the Government but are to be in existence as an appellate body in relation to the Government.  Article 34. 4. 4º provides:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1471" />&ldquo;No law shall be enacted excepting from the appellate jurisdiction of the Supreme Court cases which involve questions as to the validity of any law having regard to the provisions of this Constitution.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The proposal here is to put something new into the Constitution.  Not being a lawyer, I certainly cannot tell whether that is strictly legal or not, or whether the Oireachtas may put something into the Constitution by means of a Bill such as this.  Of course, I admit, if this Bill is passed by the people, it will thereby appear to get a certain validity.  Let us split this sub-section into two parts:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;No court shall entertain any question as to whether the commission has been properly constituted,&rdquo;</P>
    <P>&mdash;that could stand.  Then there is the completely separate point which I consider the more serious:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;or any question as to whether the determination of the boundaries of constituencies as set out in their report has been properly carried out.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There is no reasonable doubt that this commission is a subordinate body, relatively speaking.  It is not in the same position as, say, the Oireachtas, or the Supreme Court, to take two bodies that exist already under the Constitution.  Therefore, as regards the first part of the question, whether the commission is properly constituted, although it is a serious matter politically, from the legal point of view that provision could be left in.  However, as regards the second part, it is not reasonable to take away from the courts, and particularly from the Supreme Court, its appellate jurisdiction as provided for in Article 34. 4. 4º.  The Constitution has a global provision in it which is being taken out by a side-wind in a provision for the election of Deputies to Dáil Éireann.  I am extremely doubtful about the propriety of this procedure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The idea of this provision is to ensure the independence of this commission which if not a judicial body in the normal sense, is a semi-judicial body presided over by a judge <Col N="1472" /> of the High Court or Supreme Court. There is already an implied provision in the Constitution for dealing with any misbehaviour by a judge or by the President.  Article 35.4.1º provides:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;A judge of the Supreme Court or the High Court shall not be removed from office except for stated misbehaviour or incapacity, and then only upon resolutions passed by Dáil Éireann and by Seanad Éireann calling for his removal.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Under Article 12. 10. 1º, there is the provision:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The President may be impeached for stated misbehaviour.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>These provisions in the Constitution still stand and the Oireachtas will have power to deal with misbehaviour on the part of the chairman or on the part of the President in the appointment of the chairman.  The idea in this sub-section is to have this commission in as judicial a status as possible.  In other words they will be in the position of being dealt with by the Oireachtas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is in order to preserve the complete independence of that judicial commission that this sub-section is there.  There is also the following provision in Section 5. 2º:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;If, within the next 14 days on which Dáil Éireann has sat after the report is laid before it, a resolution amending the report is passed by Dáil Éireann and supported by not less than two-thirds of the members present and voting, the report shall be amended accordingly.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is similar to the provision whereby the President can be impeached. The commission will be enabled to act in an independent judicial capacity; the President and chairman are answerable for their actions; and then there is the two-thirds majority stipulation in regard to the amendment of the report of the commission.  Therefore, the supremacy of the Oireachtas and the <Col N="1473" /> independence of the commission are preserved at the same time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>May I draw the attention of the House to Article 26 of the Constitution which relates to the reference of Bills to the Supreme Court:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;This Article applies to any Bill passed or deemed to have been passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas... expressed to be a Bill containing a proposal to amend the Constitution...&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Therefore, the Bill which is going through this House makes reference to the Supreme Court and a court consisting of not less than five judges will consider every question referred to it.  In other words, this Bill may well be referred to the High Court on this very section if the President so sees fit.  I shall be very surprised, if this Bill is referred to the Supreme Court, if the Supreme Court does not hold that this provision in this Bill cannot be written into the Constitution.</P>

      <P>Whatever the merits of this phrase which it is sought to delete, it is quite clear that the commission is in no way subject to appeal to the Supreme Court.  In relation to the independence of the commission, I did not really understand Senator Lenihan.  The High Court is Independent, but there is an appeal.  In some cases, the Chief Justice sitting for certain purposes may have an appeal against his decision to the Supreme Court and there is no suggestion at all in that state of affairs that the Chief Justice is not independent in the exercise of his functions.  The independence of the commission will not be impaired in the slightest if it is subject to appeal to the courts in the ordinary way, that is to say, if proceedings for instance were taken on appeal for the purpose of allowing the court to determine or examine and give a judicial interpretation of the meaning of sub-section (2) of Section 4, where it says:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;...in such manner that the population of each constituency as ascertained at the last preceding census, <Col N="1474" /> shall, so far as it is practicable, be the same throughout the country.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There may be arguments for and against this, but most certainly, Senator Lenihan has not explained in any way why this provision should be introduced in this proposed amendment of the Constitution.  It is quite clear that the independence of this commission would not be impaired in the slightest if its decisions were subject to appeal to any court.  There is no doubt at all about that.</P>

      <P>I was not quite satisfied with the point made by Senator Lenihan, when he said that, after all, if a judge behaves improperly he can be removed by a two-thirds majority of the Dáil, and so on.  He did not tell us what we can do if the commission is not properly constituted. Supposing the Ceann Comhairle or, as he is called in this Bill, the Chairman of the Dáil, does not properly constitute the commission, what redress have we?  I did not hear Senator Lenihan tell us anything about such <Col N="1475" /> redress, and all this clause says is that, at any rate, we can have no recourse to the courts.  Senator Lenihan has told us that we might have the judge removed from office, if we are dissatisfied with him, but he does not tell us what we can do about the commission if it is not properly constituted.</P>

      <P>The commission which is being set up to revise the constituencies must have its work brought to a clear-cut conclusion.  It must meet every 12 years, and we must see to it that the report of one commission, revising constituencies, is capable of being implemented before another 12 years have elapsed.  We know that certain lawyers are very quick to take delaying actions.  Even though they will not be put to any practical effect, they are obstructive and it is necessary to make certain that when this commission reports, and its report is adopted by the Dáil, it will go into operation and will not be open to unnecessary obstruction.</P>
      <P>After all, the courts have to take it for granted when the President signs a Bill which is deemed to have been passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas&mdash;the courts have no say in the matter&mdash;they have to accept the certificate that it has, in fact, been passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas.  In this matter which affects the Dáil only, when the Dáil finally approves, or accepts, the reports of the commission, it is only right and proper that the courts should regard that act of the Dáil as having been legally concluded. There is no other way out, in any event.  It has to be brought to a conclusion.  It is necessary for the constituencies to be clearly and legally defined, and that the matter should not be capable of being dragged out over a number of years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The chairman of the commission will, of course, be a judge of the Supreme Court or the High Court. There is no reason why he should not <Col N="1476" /> be able to give a binding decision on a matter of this kind, a binding decision, subject to ratification or rejection by the Dáil.  There has been a lot of criticism of the judge being brought into the matter at all.

Then, if the people want to have a general election and want to elect new T.D.s, the constituencies will have been defined in a proper, legal manner.</P>

    <P>There is no reason why the courts should try to go behind the certificate of the Ceann Comhairle that this matter has been properly dealt with by <Col N="1478" /> the Dáil and by the commission, any more than the courts should go behind the certificate of the Ceann Comhairle or the President that a Bill has been passed or deemed to have been passed by the Dáil in the ordinary way.</P>

      <P>I should like to make this very short statement.  I took down the Minister's words when he used them.  He said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Leader of the Opposition denounced as a political lickspittle anyone who might be appointed as chairman of the commission.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Minister read out the words which the Leader of the Opposition used in Dáil Éireann, which were roughly this:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The President may say to himself: &lsquo;I will appoint CD.&rsquo;&rdquo;</P>

      <P>There are two questions to which I feel I have not had an answer yet.  I asked Senator Lenihan to tell me what redress we had if the commission was not properly constituted.  He told us that we had redress if it did not do its work properly, because one could sack the judge.  Arising out of that, I asked what redress we had against the improper constitution of the commission. I have not had a reply from either Senator Lenihan or the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1479" /> I have not had a reply from the Minister as to my suggestion that this clause is <i>ultra vires</i> the Constitution, because of Section 4 of Article 46 which says that if you are trying to amend the Constitution by a proposal or proposals, the Bill shall not contain any other proposal.  This is another proposal&mdash;that the courts be deprived of some of their existing powers.  I should like to hear from the Minister his view as to that contention.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>One answer to what Senator Sheehy Skeffington has just asked is that he had a proposal here this afternoon and kept us for a considerable time in debating it.  In my opinion, it was a distinctly different matter from that which was before the House.  It was a separate proposal, that is to say, having constituencies on the basis of 25,000 to 30,000 instead of on the basis of 20,000 to 30,000. That was surely a distinct matter.  He sought to incorporate it in this measure to go before the people.  He succeeded in putting himself in a minority of one and it was rightly rejected.</P>
      <P>As regards the question of the constitution of the commission, it is quite clear that the President, in discharge of his function in appointing the chairman, can be impeached in the Oireachtas.  It is quite clear that the judge can be dealt with also under the section whereby any Supreme Court or High Court Judge can be dealt with by the Oireachtas for stated misbehaviour. I am certain that the judge acting as chairman of this commission will be acting in discharge of his duties and, for any misbehaviour in the discharge of his duties, he can be dealt with and discharged from office by way of petition in the Oireachtas.  For that reason, I think the safeguards are already there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Ceann Comhairle, of course, can be removed at any time by a motion in the Dáil if the majority feel that the Ceann Comhairle has misbehaved himself in any way in the discharge of his duties.  I think that is as far as one can go, having regard to the principle that this commission must be an independent body.  This will be a specific sub-section of an article in the Constitution <Col N="1480" /> and the whole idea behind the commission is to put that commission on a high judicial plane.  It will be presided over by a judge of the High Court or a judge of the Supreme Court and, in the discharge of its limited function, it will be in the same position as the Supreme Court.  No Supreme Court judge can be discharged from office except by the specific constitutional provision of a motion supported by two-thirds of the Dáil.  For that reason, I think Senator Sheehy Skeffington has missed the point.  The idea of the sub-section is to put the commission in this independent judicial capacity, almost on a par in its limited function with the Supreme Court in its much broader function.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely Senator Lenihan makes confusion worse confounded by his intervention at this stage.  The High Court is an independent court and there is no suggestion that, because there can be appeal from the High Court to the Supreme Court, that is in any way an impairment of the independence of the High Court. There is equally no suggestion, so far as I have heard in this debate, that this commission will misbehave and there is, therefore, need for appeal for that reason.  Whatever the arguments may be for or against an appeal being available, for or against putting this proviso into the Constitution, it is quite clear that what we are discussing here is not the misbehaviour of the commission.  It is a question whether the court should have power to inquire into what the commission does, independently altogether of misbehaviour.  They might, in the phrase the lawyers use, misdirect themselves.  But that is not misbehaviour. The power of the Oireachtas to deal with the President, and the power of the Dáil to deal with the Ceann Comhairle, are completely separate things.  The issue here is whether this body should be, or should not be, subject to the courts.  The fact that the body is presided over by a judge does not mean normally that it is independent of the courts; and the fact that its decisions may be questioned by the courts does not, of course, mean that it is not independent.  It can discharge its functions as it seems good <Col N="1481" /> to itself, but the discharge of those functions may afterwards be inquired into by a judicial tribunal.  That does not mean there has been misbehaviour, or any lack of independence.  Really, I think Senator Sheehy Skeffington was unfortunate in asking Senator Lenihan to explain, because Senator Lenihan has only made matters worse.</P>
      <P>The same argument applies to the Minister's point that legal proceedings are obstructive.  If one takes the view that legal proceedings are obstructive, then one should not have any legal appeals at all and there should be no lawyers.  If you take the point of view that because a clever lawyer can put a point of view which will bring you to the Supreme Court, and it takes that court years to determine the matter, that is obstructive, then that is an argument against courts altogether.  It is an argument that someone should be able to say summarily what the position is.  We are in the fortunate position, and I hope we will remain in it, that nobody can tell us summarily what the position is.  We are glad of that, and we do not regard the courts as obstructive.  That is a foolish idea.</P>

      <P>Senator Hayes said we were in a fortunate position.  This is no ordinary legislation. The Oireachtas in the past has passed legislation which subsequently, on appeal to the courts, was held to be <i>ultra vires</i> the Constitution.  We are not proposing here that the people should enact ordinary legislation. We are proposing an amendment <Col N="1482" /> of the Constitution and every clause in this is an amendment of the Constitution.</P>
      <P>When reading this first, I was rather perplexed by the way in which it was set out because we start off &ldquo;Whereas it is proposed to amend Article 16 of the Constitution&rdquo; and then we say &ldquo;Be it therefore enacted by the Oireachtas as follows&rdquo; and we go on to say &ldquo;Article 16 of the Constitution is hereby amended... as respects the Irish text by&rdquo; and certain things follow.  What we are doing is changing the Irish and English text of the Constitution and inserting this Schedule as a new sub-section in the Constitution.  I cannot, therefore, follow Senator Sheehy Skeffington's point that this is not an amendment of the Constitution.  The whole thing is an amendment of the Constitution.  It does not contain any extraneous matter.</P>

      <P>On a point of explanation, I did not say this is not an amendment of the Constitution.  I said the Constitution itself in Article 46, to which I refer the Senator, specifically says there are ways in which one can amend the Constitution and there are ways in which one cannot amend the Constitution.  It says that if you try to introduce another proposal in a Bill to amend the Constitution, then that is not amending the Constitution in the proper way.  I think the Senator should read Article 46.</P>

The whole thing is an amendment of the Constitution.  That is my point.  Another point is that I read in the paper the other day where an appeal was taken from the Labour Court, a court set up by ordinary legislation, to the High Court and it was rejected on the ground that it should never have come to the High Court.  I do not see then why the question of appeal should come in here.  I cannot follow the argument that an amendment of the Constitution is <i>ultra vires</i> the Constitution.</P>

    <P>In Part II, Section 5.2º, to add at the end of the sub-section &ldquo;provided that Seanad Éireann concurs with the amendment, or amendments.&rdquo;. <Col N="1484" /> This amendment is deemed to be a safeguard in relation to the work of this commission.  It is proposed that it should require a two-thirds majority of Dáil Éireann to reject any of its recommendations.  I wonder whether the Government would consider it advisable to add to that that it should also have a majority in Seanad Éireann?  What has the Minister to say to that?  It seems to me a reasonable suggestion.  It seems to preserve the relationship between Dáil and Seanad Éireann, acting in consort.  I am aware, of course, that any concurrence will be governed by the provision in the Constitution which limits the delaying action of the Seanad to 90 days.  Still, I think it would be well that the link between the Seanad and the Dáil should be preserved as a safeguard in this legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OwenSkeffington" hpid="Dr. Sheehy Skeffington Dr. Sheehy Skeffington">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support this amendment.  It seems to me that to leave the Seanad out of this completely is not quite fair, and is not in accordance with the spirit of the Constitution at present.  Under Article 16 (2) (4º) of the present Constitution, it is provided not that Dáil Éireann shall revise but that &ldquo;the Oireachtas shall revise the constituencies&rdquo; and any alterations in the constituencies, and so on.  Therefore, the present Constitution prescribes that such changes shall be decided by the Oireachtas.  Yet this Bill asks us to forget about the Seanad, and provides that only the Dáil has the right to amend in this respect.</P>
      <P>I think Senator Quinlan is quite right to propose the incorporation of the phrase which would deem it necessary to have the consent of the Seanad also.  The Dáil is not the only House in this Parliament.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;which, in that year, sought to adjust the constituencies in accordance with constitutional <Col N="1485" /> provisions.  In that contribution, Senator, Hayes made the point that the Seanad, although technically it had amending powers in regard to that Bill, should not use these powers on the basis that the Bill was peculiarly one for the Dáil as it concerned the constituencies and the system of election to Dáil Éireann alone.  I think that that very sensible view propounded on that occasion by Senator Hayes has been followed by the Government throughout this amending proposal here.</P>
      <P>With regard to the commission, the six members, apart from the judge, are to be selected from Dáil Éireann on the nomination of the Taoiseach and the Ceann Comhairle.  The six members are to be selected from Dáil Éireann, and rightly so.  Surely the members of Dáil Éireann are best acquainted with constituencies?  Surely the members of Dáil Éireann best know the political facts concerning constituencies?  Surely the members of Dáil Éireann are the most realistic and practical people to deal with a matter that concerns them?</P>
      <P>Similarly, in this sub-section we are discussing, the amendment of the report, supported by not less than two-thirds of the members, again, of Dáil Éireann, can be dealt with in the Dáil.  Rightly, I think the Seanad is not included.  It would be inconsistent if the Seanad were included in that sub-section, in view of the previous sub-section setting out that the six members of the commission shall be selected from Dáil Éireann alone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is consistent with the whole approach that this question of the commission's delimiting constituencies is particularly a matter for the Dáil itself. It is a peculiar function for the Dáil to deal with a system of election to its own House.  Any insertion of Seanad Éireann at the end of that paragraph would be inconsistent with the general tenor of the constitution of the commission in that the six members from the Dáil will be impartially concerned with election to the Dáil and the question of constituencies in relation to election to that House.  It is not a function of the Seanad to interfere in that regard.  It is one in which it <Col N="1486" /> would not be suitable for the Seanad to have any place or function.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Professor Hayes Professor Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the findings of the commission, when accepted by Dáil Éireann, become law or will they have to be put into a Bill which must come before both Houses of the Oireachtas?  Perhaps, with regard to the allusions of Senator Lenihan to the Bill of 1947, I may tell this story.  I agree that it was my view that the rearranging of Dáil constituencies was a matter for the Dáil and that, if the Dáil passed it, then, while the Seanad had a constitutional right &mdash;which I did not say I wanted to abandon&mdash;it would be simply for the Seanad to agree.  I told that outside this House to the then Minister for Local Government who is now the Minister for Health.  He assured me he would speak for only five minutes.  I felt that the matter would be finished within about 15 minutes.  He came into this House and spoke for nearly an hour and attacked the Labour Party as being like the Russians.  A Senator who, like himself, was given to making long speeches then spoke for another hour and we spoke the whole day on the Bill for the revision of Dáil constituencies&mdash;although the Leader of the Opposition had been of the opinion, before the matter began, that it might take 15 or, at the most, 20 minutes.</P>
      <P>It seems to me that, if you give the Seanad power in this way by providing that Seanad Éireann concur with the amendment or amendments, it might mean that the provision in respect of the 90 days would not apply.  If this amendment were inserted in this present form, you would have to have a resolution in Dáil Éireann.  I am not sure that, if you inserted these words, the result would not be that if the Seanad did not concur, the Dáil could go ahead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The real point is whether the commission's report, being accepted by the Dáil, becomes law in that way or whether it would have to be passed in legislation in the ordinary way. With the insertion of these words, the refusal of the Seanad to pass the legislation might result, I think, in its not being subject to the 90 days' <Col N="1487" /> provision, which would be very serious.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>The section following the sub-section which Senator Quinlan proposes to amend states:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Immediately after the last of the next 14 days on which Dáil Éireann has sat after the commission's report is laid before it, the boundaries set out in the report, or, where the report has been amended by Dáil Éireann, in the report as so amended, shall become and be the boundaries of the constituencies, provided that any alterations in the constituencies shall not take effect during the life of Dáil Éireann then sitting.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>If the amendment of the report is supported by not less than two-thirds of the members of the Dáil, present and voting, the report shall be amended accordingly and, as amended, shall become operative after 14 days.</P>
      <P>The normal argument for bicameral institutions is that if you have a single Chamber with a simple majority, it may be tyrannical.  We have the Second Chamber here in order that the work of the Dáil shall be reviewed. There was a period when there was only one Chamber&mdash;the Seanad was not in operation&mdash;and there was legislation passed to provide that more than a simple majority was necessary in certain cases, in relation to judges, and so on.</P>
      <P>In this case a simple majority cannot reject the report of the commission; there must be a majority of two-thirds, so that in the normal way, with a Government Party comprising 50 or 55 per cent. of the Dáil, they would have to get a number of Deputies from the other side of the House to concur in rejecting the report.  In view of the fact that that safeguard is in the Bill, that the report of the commission cannot be thrown out simply by the Government Party, I do not think it is necessary to bring in the Seanad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That procedure also shortens the period between the presentation of the <Col N="1488" /> report by the chairman of the commision and its coming into full legal effect.  The important thing is that there should be clear-cut decisions on all these matters and that they should be taken at reasonable speed.  From the point of view of ensuring fair play, there is no reason why the Seanad should concur with the Dáil if the Dáil rejects the report of the commission or amends it by a two-thirds majority.</P>

Quite rightly, we have painted from here the picture of the future if this Bill becomes law, which we hope and pray it never will.  We see a Government sweeping into power with at least 100 to 120 seats out of 140, so that it is not the slightest brake on that Government to have a two-thirds majority to pass legislation. There is the other safeguard that there are three members of the commission drawn from the Opposition but, again, these three members are effectively muzzled by the provision that there cannot be a minority report, so that the whole thing adds up to a glorified control by one Party.</P>

In such case, the Seanad, being a body detached from the Dáil, should be the desirable institution to investigate such charge.  There is no use in investigating it in the Dáil. The Government in future, if they get the single seat constituency and the non-transferable vote, will not be troubled in the slightest about a two-thirds <Col N="1489" /> majority.  Therefore, if we are concerned with the future, if we are concerned with safeguards which are the very life-blood of a democratic system, we should be jealous as a Seanad of our powers and of the contribution we can make and of the balanced views and judgments we can bring, especially when it is a case of disagreement in the other House.</P>

      <P>Earlier this evening Senator Ó Ciosáin claimed that there was no allegation of gerrymandering when the 1947 Electoral (Amendment) Bill was going through the Dáil.  I hope he will not ask me to read them but I got the report and flagged the various allegations made by various Deputies, specifically by the late Deputy Martin O'Sullivan and Deputy Bennett of Limerick, who was quite specific.  The report might nearly be worth reading where he talked about the area beyond Killmallock being lumped in with Limerick City.  The suggestion that there was no allegation of gerrymandering interested me.  There was a specific suggestion.  There was a free vote of the House on County Wexford and the Minister himself brought in amendments to the Bill to meet Deputy Martin O'Sullivan.  I am not saying that in the debate that year, 1947, there were widespread allegations of gerrymandering&mdash;there were not&mdash;but there were enough to be able to flag them through the volume.  I just want to place that on record since the Senator suggested that there was none at all.</P>

      <P>Earlier this evening Senator Ó'Quigley referred to this section and made what appeared to be a sensational discovery, that this section was a sinister device on the part of the Government to amend the Constitution by law.  I am surprised that Senator O'Quigley is not here to develop that them.  Senator O'Quigley has studied numerous Constitutions.  We have been solemnly informed that he studied no fewer than 89 Constitutions of various countries but, if he had taken the trouble to study our own Constitution, he would have found that there are at least 23 Articles which, having laid down certain principles and so on, end by saying that they &ldquo;shall be determined in accordance with law&rdquo;, so that this section which says that, subject to the provisions of this Article, any matter whatsoever relatting to constituency commissions or their members may be provided for by law, is in line with 23 or 24 Articles in the Constitution and is in no way unusual.  If any attempt were made to introduce a Bill which was inconsistent with the sections laying down the principles then, plainly, it would be repugnant to the Constitution and could be dealt with by the Supreme Court.</P>

    <P>I move amendment No. 12:&mdash;</P>
    <P>In Part I, Section 7. 1º, líne 41, to delete &ldquo;15mhadh lá d'Aibreán, 1961,&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;lmhadh lá d'Eanair, 1962,&rdquo;;</P>
    <P Just="Center">and</P>
    <P>In Part II, Section 7. 1º, line 40, to delete &ldquo;15th day of April, 1961,&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;1st day of January, 1962,&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This amendment is intended to give Parties more time to gear themselves to the changed conditions that will develop in political life if the amendment to the Constitution is passed. This amendment seeks to change the date mentioned in the section, 15th April, 1961, to 1st January, 1962.  In amendment No. 13, I propose the insertion of the words &ldquo;and Seanad Éireann&rdquo; so that an early election can only be held provided both Houses agree, that is, any election under the proposed system.</P>
    <P>If you want an election, of course, the power of dissolution is there at all times, but, if a decision to dissolve is taken before the date set here, and if the Dáil and Seanad do not agree to make the Order changing the date here, then that election is to be held under the old system.  In other words, the proposed amendment here gives a chance to the Parties to gear themselves to the changed position if the amendment of the Constitution is passed.</P>
    <P>In that way, I think it is a very fair and reasonable amendment and, above all, it prevents the development of the exploitation of a snap election called, say, within a year or so at the very first moment the new constituencies are arranged.  The amendment prevents that, unless the Dáil and the Seanad both agree with the change.  I am not satisfied that the change should be left to the Dáil alone.  I think it <Col N="1492" /> would be very unwise and very foolish to give away the rightful power of the Seanad.</P>

      <P>I should like to hear what the Minister has to say on both these amendments.  The first change is a minor one, but the second is a major one, that the concurrence of the Dáil and Seanad should be obtained to setting the date on which an election is held under the new system, if that is introduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I think we have debated this long enough.  The Dáil is particularly interested in this matter and, if the Dáil thinks that the date should be brought forward, we believe that the date should be brought forward.  As set out in the section as it stands, the date, 15th April, 1961, is put in because it is usual for a new register to come into operation on 15th April each year.  The 15th April, 1961, is two years away from this date, and we think it is long enough away to give all the political Parties, including our own, time to make preparations for holding the next general election under the straight vote system.</P>

      <P>The Minister says it is solely a function of the Dáil, but I think that is a new development in political life.  We have had two items already claimed as being solely functions of the Dáil.  If this exception is made, it means that the Government can declare an election at any time under the new system, and the date here, 15th April, 1961, is not really worth the paper it is written on unless some adequate safeguards are put in to ensure that no snap election will be held under the proposed new system and that, if an election is to be held, within the next year or two, it will be held under the existing system.</P>

      <P>The idea is that we should take the Report Stage of the Constitution Amendment Bill from 3 p.m. to 6 p.m. on Wednesday next, 18th March, and that after tea, we begin consideration of the Central Fund Bill and continue until 10 o'clock.  It is proposed that we then adjourn until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday when we shall resume consideration of the Constitution Amendment Bill, taking the Report and Final Stages and concluding them before the luncheon adjournment at 1.30 p.m.  It is suggested that we meet again at 3 p.m. and resume consideration of the Central Fund Bill.  I should like some understanding as to when, on that night, it will be possible for the Minister to conclude the debate and I suggest that the Minister should be allowed to conclude not later than 10 p.m., if that would meet with the approval of the House.</P>

      <P>I think it is unfortunate that Senator Ó Maoláin used certain words in the particular atmosphere when he was putting the proposal.  I am not able to speak for <Col N="1496" /> everybody here by definition.  By definition, of course, I am not, and I can say no more than that I will do my very best to see that that arrangement is carried out.  I made it to-day myself.  There is one point about it, however.  The Central Fund Bill gives the Seanad an opportunity of discussing certain matters which it is given no other opportunity to discuss, except on the Appropriation Bill.  The Dáil, of course, discusses the Estimates; the Seanad does not, and while it might be desirable that the Minister should get in at 10 o'clock on Thursday night, I do not see any method by which one could be certain that will happen.  I think what I said this afternoon is&mdash; I have not got it before me now&mdash;that if it was decided to resume on Thursday at 3 o'clock on the Central Fund Bill and if the debate could not be concluded on Thursday, if it is thought necessary, it could be concluded on Friday morning.  Personally, I am not enamoured of that suggestion, but it might be the only possible alternative.</P>
      <P>It might be possible for the Minister to get in at 10 o'clock on Thursday night, but I am not sure.  My own contribution to that debate will be small and so I am speaking personally, but I want to be quite clear that I am not giving any guarantee that I can control everybody on this side of the House.  I cannot; I am glad I cannot do it, if that is any satisfaction to anybody.</P>
