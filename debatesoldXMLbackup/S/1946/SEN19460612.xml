    <Title>Hire-Purchase Bill, 1946&mdash;Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass) Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to protect the interests of that section of the community which acquires goods under hire-purchase or credit sale agreements.  It is not desirable, as I am sure the Seanad will agree, and it is not proposed in the Bill, to interfere with the legitimate activities of traders and finance companies in the field of hire-purchase, but it is desirable to prevent the development of possible abuses.  The hire-purchase system serves a useful purpose <Col N="2096" /> in enabling persons of modest means to acquire and to obtain the use of, earlier than would otherwise be possible, such articles as furniture, bicycles, radio sets and the like.</P>
      <P>In so far as they assist in the acquisition of motor vehicles, machinery and other types of plant, hire-purchase facilities encourage commercial and industrial expansion, particularly by smaller concerns. Before the war, hire-purchase and credit sale transactions had in this country and in other countries been increasing steadily in volume, and in 1938 goods to the value of £1,500,000 were acquired under hire-purchase agreements, and there is every likelihood, when the supply position is again normal, that that figure will be exceeded in future.</P>
      <P>The hire-purchase system has become an important factor in the social and economic life of the country and as such, it must in the community's interest, be kept free from abuses, in so far as that can be achieved by legislation.  While a number of complaints have been received from aggrieved persons, there is no evidence so far that any widespread abuses in the hire-purchase system have developed in this country.  Nevertheless, the existing law is unsatisfactory in certain respects and this Bill is designed to prevent abuses in the future rather than to cure abuses which have already occurred.</P>
      <P>I should add that the expansion of the hire-purchase system has created similar problems in other countries, and in the enactment of these proposals, we will be keeping abreast with the practice already established in other countries.  One of the unsatisfactory features of the manner in which hire-purchase transactions are carried on at the moment is that the person who acquires goods by that means frequently has no idea of the cost to him of the hire-purchase facilities, and he is only aware of the fact that by paying instalments for a certain period he will eventually acquire the ownership of the goods.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A person may, because of that lack of knowledge of the cost of hire-purchase facilities, be induced to pay more <Col N="2097" /> for these facilities than he would agree to if he had full knowledge of the facts.  The Bill seeks to remedy that position by providing that the person entering into a hire-purchase contract as a hirer of goods, will be furnished, prior to the making of the agreement, with information as to the cash price of the goods as distinct from the hire-purchase price.  That arrangement will also apply in respect of credit sales exceeding £5 in value.  Hire-purchase agreements are at present covered by the law of contract, and a hirer who wishes to return the goods to the owner may find that under a minimum payment clause in the agreement which he has signed, he has contracted to pay the greater part of the total hire-purchase price of the goods whether he continues the hiring of the goods or not.  The Bill proposes to remedy that position by enabling the hirer of the goods, if he has taken reasonable care of them, to terminate a hire-purchase agreement before the final payment is made and to return the goods to the trader from whom he obtained them by giving written notice and paying half the total purchase price on the amount due at the time of the termination of the transaction, whichever is the greater.</P>
    <P>The payment of at least half the total purchase price affords reasonable compensation to the owner of the goods, the trader with whom the transaction was made, who is also under the Bill, entitled to recover any installation costs incurred by him in the deal.  To ensure that no person through ignorance of the law, will be prevailed upon to forgo the right of returning the goods, it is provided in the Bill that any agreement containing a contracting-out clause will be void.</P>
    <P>A common feature in hire-purchase agreements is a clause giving the owner of the goods, that is to say, the trader, by whom the goods are hired, the right to enter the hirer's premises and to seize the goods without further ado in the event of the hirer defaulting in the payment of the instalment.  The effect of such a clause is that the person who has paid a considerable portion of the cost of the goods may, <Col N="2098" /> owing to his inability to pay an instalment, lose possession of all the goods without obtaining any credit for what he has paid.</P>
    <P>It is presumably unavoidable that from time to time persons who have obtained goods on the hire-purchase system, should, owing to financial troubles, have to return the goods, but that is a different matter from permitting a trader to seize all the goods without compensation merely because an instalment is not paid.  The Bill provides that any clause in a hire-purchase agreement providing for the entry of an owner on a hirer's premises to seize goods is void, and further, where one-third of the hire-purchase price is paid, the owner of the goods can regain possession only through the court.  Where an application for recovery comes before the court it will have power, if it thinks fit, to postpone the return of the goods in order to enable the due amount to be paid or to transfer the ownership of part of the goods to the hirer and return the remainder of the goods to the owner.</P>
    <P>Where there is more than one agreement entered into by the same person, the Bill provides against the appropriation of instalments paid by the hirer under all the agreements in such a way as to deprive the hirer of the goods of his special rights under each separate agreement.  Another possible source of abuse in regard to hire-purchase agreements is that the anxiety of persons in poorer circumstances to avail themselves of hire-purchase facilities provides traders with an opportunity to dispose of inferior quality goods to persons in such circumstances buying them under hire-purchase arrangements, who when they find that the goods are unsatisfactory may also discover that the agreement they signed precludes them from suing the owner of the goods for breach of warranty.</P>
    <P>There are sections in the Bill which provide that the same conditions as to warranties, quality and the like will apply to hire-purchase transactions as to ordinary, commercial transactions for cash.  The Bill also aims at reducing law costs by providing that proceedings for the recovery of goods may be instituted in any district court if <Col N="2099" /> the hire-purchase price does not exceed £25.  At present, proceedings cannot be taken in the district courts save in the Dublin area.  It is proposed that Section 53 of the Courts of Justice Act, 1936, shall not apply in certain cases, thereby securing that proceedings in the district court against the hirer must be taken in the district in which the hirer lives or does business.</P>
    <P>The Bill is not a long one and I assume that the Seanad, like the Dáil, will find little difficulty in approving of it in principle.  It is probable that effective discussion of its provisions will take place in Committee, when the various sections can be considered and debated separately.  The change in legislation which the Bill proposes has already been effected in the law in other countries and it is, I think, desirable that it should now be made here.  Although hire-purchase transactions declined considerably in volume during the war years because of scarcities, it is to be assumed that they will return to pre-war dimensions, at least, and, probably, exceed pre-war dimensions when the period of scarcity ends.  As I have said, the evidence available does not indicate the existence of widespread abuses here, but we cannot ignore the fact that widespread abuses are possible and did develop in other countries.  It is desirable that we should take the necessary legislative steps to prevent such abuses from developing and that is what this Bill is designed to do. We must, however, ensure that, in taking steps to prevent abuses, we do not, at the same time, create conditions which would make it impossible for hire-purchase trading to be carried on.  Hire-purchase trading is, I think, recognised to have social and economic advantages&mdash;and this Bill has been framed with the dual purpose of preventing possible abuses while, at the same time, facilitating the development of legitimate trade in that form. I recommend the Bill to the Seanad and I feel sure that, when we come to discuss its provisions in detail in Committee, it will be found that the sections are reasonably adequate to deal with known abuses and that the enactment of the measure will tend to <Col N="2100" /> put this form of trading on a better basis and enable it to develop without any bad consequences.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with virtually everything the Minister has said with regard to this Bill.  Speaking generally, I think that it is a good Bill. It is not a Bill the discussion of which on Second Reading would serve any conceivable object.  The principle of the Bill will, probably, meet with approval from every side of the House. The details of the measure are not of such a nature as could be dealt with in general terms.  In Committee, I shall raise a few points, but they are minor points which I do not propose to refer to now.</P>
      <P>I have had a limited experience of hire-purchase trading.  I disliked it and it was only after I was definitely convinced that, properly handled, it served the community, I agreed to it at all.  Most traders would prefer to sell for cash and have done with the transaction.  Hire purchase adds to the trader's troubles and, if there had not been a genuine public demand, I do not think that it would have been adopted.  It should be borne in mind that it is not suited to every class of trading.  I have been informed that some traders have been proposing to sell articles of clothing on 12 months' hire purchase.  I think that that is bad and will, inevitably, lead to trouble.  If they are ladies' goods, the wearer may get tired of them or may not like the colour.  In the nature of things, those goods cannot be returned.  The provisions of this Bill, which would, probably, be excellent as applied to a radio set, might be extremely unsuitable if applied to a lady's dress or a pair of shoes.  I mention that as illustrative of the fact that, no matter how much you try to foresee conditions in matters of this kind, you will not be able to meet all the difficulties.  If applied to articles such as I have mentioned, hire purchase might be extremely unsatisfactory and traders are to be found in every country who are prepared to go in for such innovations if they see that they can make money out of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no doubt that this is a class <Col N="2101" /> of trading which is open to abuse from both sides.  In my experience, the worst difficulties did not arise in the case of people with low incomes.  One is just as likely to meet with serious abuses in the case of people with plenty of money who could pay for the goods if they so desired.  The abuses, from the point of view of the trader, are well known.  The worst abuse was tempting people to go beyond their means and to enter into another agreement before the first agreement was completed, so that the unfortunate hire purchaser never got out of debt.  I am extremely glad that that abuse is to be made impossible under this Bill. That was, probably, the worst abuse which was inclined to develop here and it was extensive in Great Britain. Most of the provisions of this Bill have been in operation in Great Britain for some time.  I made inquiries and I found that they had created no difficulties there.  I know that the Bill is not identical with the English Act but it is similar to it.  I think that we should take advantage of the experience of Great Britain, where it is available, in these matters, because conditions are very much alike in the two countries.</P>
    <P>There is another abuse which this Bill will not abate and which it may aggravate.  A hirer who knows that he should get an agreement over a long period, because of the small amounts he can afford to pay, enters into a 12 months' agreement because the rate is cheaper, and then proceeds to extend it to 18 months.  The trader is almost helpless in that case, and I am not sure that he will not be more helpless when this Bill comes into operation. That is a point I may raise in Committee. Speaking generally, I think that all classes of traders who wish to do a <i>bona fide</i> trade will welcome this Bill.  When I refer to a &ldquo;<i>bona fide</i> trade&rdquo;, I mean a trade in which the trader wishes to sell at the cash price and, in the case of hire-purchase, merely wants an addition to cover the expense involved.  If there were a large number of defaulters, if a large proportion of customers were to take advantage of the provision for return of their goods even after six months, what would happen would be that the net cost of hire purchase would rise <Col N="2102" /> and, as is always the case, the good payer would pay for the bad payer. I do not know that anything can be done by legislation to avoid that.  I welcome the Bill which, I think, is one to be dealt with on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LouisODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to refer to the good points of the Bill.  There are just one or two small criticisms I would like to make on it.  It gives a certain amount of protection to the hirer but I do not know if it gives him quite enough protection.  There is a provision there that the owner must tell the hirer what the cash price of the article is before he enters into the agreement, and also that he must put in the agreement the cash price as well as the price to be paid in instalments. I doubt if that is a sufficient protection, for this reason: people who indulge in hiring out goods or selling goods by instalments always mark their goods at higher prices than they would be sold at in shops that sell for cash.  There is also the practice that people who sell furniture and other goods very often mark the prices higher than those they really sell them at.  They are very often sold at a much lower price than the price marked, and if a man goes into a shop where the prices are marked on the articles it is not necessary for the vendor to tell him what the price is because he will see it marked on the article.  I do not think there is sufficient protection there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like that a judge hearing cases of that kind would have power to inquire as to whether the price for which the article was sold was a reasonable price, whether the cash price or instalment price was reasonable and if the judge came to the conclusion that the man was overcharged that he would have power to reduce the price to that at which the article could be procured in another establishment. There are other minor points on which I will probably move amendments if I think it necessary.  I am glad the Minister thinks that the hirer can be sued in his own district, but I am not sure that the Bill is sufficiently definite on that.  Under the ordinary law of contract the debtor is sued where the contract is made and I do not know <Col N="2103" /> that the repeal of that section of the 1936 Act would be sufficient to guarantee that the hirer may be sued in his own district.  I will look into that point before the Committee Stage. Otherwise I think the Bill is a very good one.</P>
    <P>When I saw the provisions about further transactions I was hoping that the Bill would contain a provision which would prevent the vendor from hiring out to the same man a different article while any sum was due on the original purchase.  That is where all the trouble arises, particularly when you have people who come around the country canvassing people to purchase. They get the purchasers into a net and the purchasers find that in a certain time some instalment is due but it cannot be paid.  Then the vendors say: &ldquo;We will give you more time&rdquo; and they will sell them another article for a certain price and make the instalments so much.  The unfortunate farmer or his wife will buy a second or even a third article and then find they are not able to pay any of the instalments at all.  I was hoping that some provision would be made that would prevent that multiplication of purchases because it is one method by which the small purchaser can be involved to his destruction.</P>
    <P>Hire purchase of course is really a method of lending money at exorbitant interest.  There is no doubt about it and I am glad that there is to be some supervision through this Bill anyway. There are other abuses however carried on in another way.  I know there is a certain organisation established in this country and while they do not sell goods they give tickets for the purchase of 5/- or £1 worth of goods.  First of all the fee to become a member of the organisation is 3/6 and after you pay the 3/6 you get a book of five tickets at £1 each.  You are then entitled to go into certain shops and buy £1 worth of goods.  The ticket is sent to the company, but the company do not pay £1 to the shopkeeper. They only pay 15/- or 16/- and that debt has to be paid at the rate of 1/- per week for each £1.  I think that works out at 66 per cent.  There may be other companies like that who lend <Col N="2104" /> money so that goods can be purchased, purchased really on the hire-purchase system and I wonder if anything can be done in respect of transactions like that.</P>
    <P>That may be wandering outside the provisions of the Bill, but I am merely throwing out the suggestion that it might be considered because there are difficulties in the way of people who get goods under hire purchase in relation to the payment of instalments, etc.  I would like to see a bank established in this country which would completely wipe out the money lender. I believe that if such a bank was established the amount of free money that would be given in this country for its establishment would astonish people.  There are numerous people willing to pay in hundreds and thousands of pounds never expecting to get a penny of it back in order to take people out of the clutches of money lenders.  If you had a bank established in that way it would prevent some of these lending companies from getting people into difficulties.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Fearon</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not very much to say on this Bill, but I would like enlightenment on Section 2.  The section states: &ldquo;This Act shall apply in relation to every hire purchase or credit sale agreement not being&rdquo; so and so and so and so.  Does that apply, for example, to the purchase of houses by hire-purchase arrangement? Or does it apply to borrowing money? Does it, for example, apply to that curious form of activity, the burial society?  It seems to me from the reading of the Bill that it could be applied to all of these and if it was applied to all or any one of these it is going to involve all sorts of complications in subsequent legal proceedings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is all I want to say on that at this stage and I do not want to develop it further now except to say that anyone who has followed the history of this Bill in the Lower House and who has studied it and who is a person well disposed towards humanity must be glad of this measure.  Anyone who knows of the misfortunes of people who suffer from hire purchase abuses due to the operations of people who are <Col N="2105" /> prepared to deliver goods in a perfectly plain van and remove them from the purchaser's house again in a perfectly plain van, must welcome this measure. I would like enlightenment however as to its application to the three cases I have mentioned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephJohnston" hpid="Professor Johnston Professor Johnston">
      <NameTxt>Professor Johnston</NameTxt>
      <P>There is not very much I would like to say on the Bill except to say that I welcome it. I think, in fact, the Bill carries out one of the minor recommendations of the Banking Commission and one about which there cannot be very much controversy. The clause in the Bill which requires that the owner should clearly state the cash price as well as the hire-purchase price is I think an admirable one.  Any vendor with that knowledge and bearing in mind the rate at which the payment of principal and interest would take place could, with the help of a little arithmetic, calculate the rate at which he was borrowing the money to pay for the goods.</P>
      <P>The whole system of hire purchase seems to involve the principle of the purchaser borrowing from the hirer the capital sum needed to pay for the goods and the repayment of that capital sum with interest, spread in equal instalments over a period of 12 months or more.  The hirer, on the other hand, may possibly finance the transaction himself or may be in touch with a financial institution or bank and may in turn borrow from that institution the money which ultimately finances the whole proceedings.  One of my principal objections to the practice of hire purchase is that the effective rate of interest at which the money is borrowed is concealed from all except the most acute and mathematically-minded purchasers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The usual form of procedure is that an article which you might acquire for £100 in cash is offered to you on the hire-purchase system for 5 per cent. more, spread over 12 months.  It looks like borrowing £100 at 5 per cent., but in actual fact the purchaser only has the use of the equivalent of £100 for half the period in question and is, therefore, paying 5 per cent. on £100 for six months, which is equivalent to 10 per cent. per annum over the <Col N="2106" /> whole £100.  I do not know if the Bill specifically provides for that form of deception, but if it does it should be made clear what the effective rate per annum is at which the purchasers are borrowing the money.</P>
    <P>While I admit there are certain things, such as the more expensive forms of consumer goods, like pianos, wireless sets and motor cars, to which it is legitimate to apply the principle of hire purchase, I think it is not a system of purchasing which ought to be encouraged.  It would be a serious thing if it developed out of proportion to the other ways in which goods are bought and sold.  One of the causes of the disequilibrium in American economy before the collapse in 1929 was that people were paying far too great a proportion of their total incomes in the gradual payments for these goods.  The Banking Commission rightly pointed out that, in times of comparative prosperity, people are inclined to enter into commitments which they are quite unable to fulfil in times of adversity.  Those financial strata of society which are not so wise are entitled to protection.  Those people are capable of entering into commitments which, in view of general circumstances, are not financially sound.</P>
    <P>Therefore, while not interfering too much with the freedom of individuals, even to make mistakes, it would be in accordance with the best public policy that we should lean against this kind of thing as far as possible.  It has reference to many aspects of the public welfare, not only the welfare of individuals who make unwise commitments of this kind, but also from the point of view of our economy as a whole.  If, during a general depression, too large a section of the working classes is committed to paying monthly instalments for pianos and what not and then there is not enough left to provide the necessities of life, that is bad for the workers and bad for the producers of those necessities of life, and causes a general disturbance and dislocation of the whole economy.  While we ought to facilitate reasonable and equitable forms of hire purchase, it is desirable <Col N="2107" /> that legislation should issue a warning against over-indulgence in this kind of luxury.</P>
    <P>Apparently, the fact that, under the existing system, 10 per cent. or more is quite a usual rate of interest for the money that buys these goods is not commented on or appreciated as widely as it ought to be.  We hear a lot about extortion under the banking system, when the banks charge 5 per cent. to creditworthy borrowers.  In this particular instance, the banks are probably acting as wholesalers of credit and the hiring firms are acting as retailers and peddle that credit at a much higher rate.  I would rather see people who can do so go to the banks and obtain the money there at 5 per cent., in order to buy these goods, than be paying the higher rates of interest to the hire-purchase firms.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the introduction of this Bill.  One may have doubts as to whether the principle of instalment buying is good or not, but there can be no question that, if it is carried on under conditions which are patently dishonest, it will have ruinous consequences on a very large section of the people.  In the past, not only in this country but in very many countries in which the system operates, there have been unscrupulous vendors who have taken advantage of the cupidity of their customers to do serious damage to the homes of those who had recourse to instalment buying.  It would be wrong, however, to suggest that everybody engaged in this trade is dishonest.  In the main, the traders who have adopted this method of facilitating their customers are perfectly honest and fair and not unreasonable in their charges.</P>
      <P>One might question the whole principle of instalment buying, since it is a pledging of the future by people with limited means.  Admittedly, it has been a boon to those starting life with limited cash resources and who are obliged to furnish a home for themselves and their families.  They could not have done so with any degree of comfort, if it were not for the fact that they were enabled to pledge their future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2108" /> This Bill is not a new experiment. To all intents and purposes, it is a carbon copy of a Bill which was enacted in Great Britain in 1938.  As far as I remember the British Act became law on the 29th July, 1938, and came into force on the 1st January, 1939. Owing to the war, however, there has not been much chance of judging the operations of the Act in Great Britain, because immediately after the outbreak of war there was an Act in Britain known as the Courts Emergency Powers Act which prohibited seizures and limited the activities of traders, even of those permitted by the Act.  Consequently, it is not possible to say how far the Act has been successful in Great Britain, or what effect it has had on hire purchase or instalment buying.</P>
    <P>With regard to the abuses of the system, I think it is well known that there are certain types of traders who employ tally men, or agents, some of them the most unscrupulous in their habits, to induce people to buy goods which, in fact, the purchasers did not need and should never have bought. People have been induced to buy radios and gramophones, and I am informed to buy pianos which were not necessary in the circumstances of the families concerned at prices substantially above the prices at which these goods could have been bought if they were purchased for cash.</P>
    <P>The Minister has already referred to the methods by which these hire-purchase agreements were enforced.  There was the power, exercised sometimes in a very unsatisfactory manner, of seizing the goods and taking them back after a very substantial sum had been paid in respect of the hire-purchase agreement.  It must always be borne in mind that goods sold under the hire-purchase system still belong to the traders until the last instalment has been discharged.  Consequently, he has the right, and it is a right which is exercised to seize these goods in default of payments.</P>
    <P>So far as Dublin is concerned, a certain amount of difficulty arose out of the fact that the traders selling the goods were not the financiers of the system at all.  I was very much surprised some years ago when a friend <Col N="2109" /> of mine entered into a contract with a very reputable firm in Dublin to buy certain household goods, the cost of which ran into £200 or £300.  I found that the agreement that he was asked to sign was not a contract between himself and the trader, but a contract with a London finance corporation.  In case of default, the agreement would be enforced not by the trader selling the goods, a very prominent Dublin firm, but by a London finance corporation.  The effect of that is limited now, to a very substantial extent, in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Someone mentioned, I think it was Senator O'Dea, the dangers of a long term agreement.  Well, I think it must be obvious to anybody that it is a very risky thing for a person undertaking to buy a considerable quantity of goods without ready cash to meet the purchase, to enter into a contract covering, say, three years.  In view of the fact that so many things may occur during that period, it is hard to say in advance how the obligations of the contract would be met three years hence.  I remember reading recently a reference by a newspaper to one of these sales which had a long life.  The story went like this: a young man went into a store and said to the cashier, &ldquo;I want to pay the last instalment on the perambulator.&rdquo;  The smiling cashier handed him his receipts and asked, &ldquo;How is the baby&rdquo;, and the reply was, &ldquo;Oh, I am feeling fine, thank you.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Reference has been made by Senator Johnston to the rate of interest represented in hire-purchase contracts.  He drew attention, very properly, to the fact that the rate of interest is concealed, but I am afraid it is concealed to a much greater extent than has been suspected by Senator Johnston.  Some years ago I examined a contract which was being made for the purchase of furniture in a certain Dublin warehouse. The rate of interest appeared small at first sight, but, on working it out, I came to the conclusion that, in fact, the effective rate of interest over the whole period was 38 per cent.  But that is not the whole story.  In most houses specialising in hire-purchase <Col N="2110" /> trading, the cash price itself marked on the article is a bogus price.</P>
    <P>It is not the cash price which would be effective in a non-hire purchase concern. I will endeavour to give the House one instance of that from a personal experience.  Some 12 months ago, I was walking down a Dublin street in company with a craftsman working in a Dublin furniture factory.  We stood at a particular window to examine articles of furniture offered for sale in what might commonly be described as a hire-purchase agreement house. These are the figures which were brought to my notice by the craftsman who, as it happened, had made the furniture. We were looking at a suite of furniture, the cash price of which was £40.  That is to say, the cash price marked in the hire-purchase premises was £40.  The craftsman who made the furniture informed me that the ex-factory price of that suite of furniture was £18.  It was sold by the manufacturer for £18 to houses engaged in hire purchase and houses which were not engaging in hire purchase, and on further investigation I discovered that the cash price in the non-hire-purchase firm was £30.  So, here, we have the picture, the factory price of a suite of furniture, £18; the retail price in a shop doing a cash business only £30 and the cash price in a firm engaging extensively in hire purchase, £40.</P>
    <P>But, bought under a hire-purchase agreement, the price is 25/- a month for three years, working out at £45. It would appear therefore that what the customer was actually paying to the hire-purchase firm was £5 for the use of £40 worth of credit, spread over a period of three years.  What, in fact, he was paying was a profit of £15 more to the hire-purchase firm than he would have paid to a cash price firm in respect of a commodity the factory price of which was £18.</P>
    <P>These aspects of the problem are not dealt with in the Bill, and I am not sure whether they can be dealt with in a Bill of this kind.  Reading the debates in the Dáil, I gathered, however, that the Minister has in mind the introduction of other legislation <Col N="2111" /> later in the year relating to price fixing, in which, as I understand it, he hopes to make provision for a review of overcharging of the character I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>I do not think we ought, therefore, to endeavour in this Bill to make provision for a review of prices as such in respect of hire-purchase agreements, but we ought to urge the Minister when he is introducing the Bill dealing with price fixing to keep in mind especially the conditions under which the cash price is marked on goods sold to hire-purchase customers.</P>
    <P>There is one more matter I want to mention&mdash;it has been referred to by another speaker&mdash;and that is the requirement of the Bill in relation to the marking of the cash price of the article offered for sale.  Under the Bill, the trader is required to mark the cash price unless the goods are sold from a catalogue or something like that, but he is not required to mark either the net or the aggregate hire-purchase price.  You go into a trader and you say to him: &ldquo;What is the cash price of this suite of furniture?&rdquo; He says: &ldquo;It is £40.&rdquo;  He does not tell you, and he is not obliged to tell you, the total sum you will be required to pay if the goods are purchased under a hire-purchase agreement.  He will tell you that he is selling them on the basis of 25/- a month for three years. Of course, if you take out your pencil and are fairly accurate with figures, you will discover the total sum you are required to pay, but I think an obligation should be inserted in the Bill requiring the trader to tell the customer not only the cash price of the goods, but the aggregate hire purchase &mdash;that is, the totality of the hire-purchase instalments.</P>
    <P>There is nothing else, I think, I require to say at this stage because, in the main, this is a Bill which can best be considered in Committee.  I would like to say this that the House ought, so far as it can, give a warning to the public that this Bill is, in fact, no safeguard for the person who makes a foolish contract.  The man who enters a shop with a song in his heart and without a penny in his pocket to buy <Col N="2112" /> a suite of furniture or a piano which he does not want, will have no protection if he fails in his instalments.  The goods must still be returned at a great loss to him or he will suffer other hardships. One difficulty arises in that connection in regard to the case of the person who has paid a substantial sum in respect of an article purchased under a hire-purchase agreement.  If he has paid a certain sum, he is entitled to keep part of the goods&mdash;at least the court is permitted to order that part of the goods will remain with the hirer.  That may be simple enough, in the case of, let us say, a bedroom suite, but it is not quite so simple where one article only is concerned, let us say, a piano or a motor car. There is not much use in telling the hirer he can keep a part of the piano, because a part would not be any use to him, and neither would a part of a motor car be any use to a hirer, so that this provision is effective only where the commodity purchased consists of a variety of articles which can be split up in the event of failure to carry out the contract.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Foran</NameTxt>
      <P>Like everyone who has spoken up to now, I welcome the Bill but it does not go far enough to deal with this evil of hire purchase which is eating into our economic system.  Hire purchase will grow and will flourish so long as the cost of living is beyond the average income of the wage earners and the middle-class people of the country.  I can visualise a very serious development of hire purchase in the country and this effort in a small way to control or regulate, or in short, to protect people against themselves is to be commended.  Hire purchase has got into the hands of ruthless, unscrupulous and brutal people in the country. You have only to read the evening paper to see the appeals that are made every day to the most gullible section of the community, newly-weds or about-to-be-weds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>You see inducements to them to come in and equip themselves with furniture and incur expenses far beyond their present means, or beyond anything they are likely to have in the immediate future.  Senator Johnston put the thing very properly when he said that people are induced to go in and take <Col N="2113" /> on the hire-purchase system grand pianos, costly radios and gramophones that they could never possibly afford and maintain themselves in reasonable comfort and pay the instalments required to keep these things.  It has a very serious effect on the health of people if they incur liabilities for the discharge of which they must sacrifice nourishment.  I have no respect for the banking system but, compared with the rates charged under hire purchase, the rates of the banks are generous to a degree.  I have no belief in this alleged benefit to the community of hire purchase.  I think that the system is responsible for a great deal of harm. The amount of good it does is much out-weighed by the evil and harm which it creates.  All sorts of devices have been developed to induce people to enter into these arrangements. Some persons go around from house to house with what is known as a purchase cheque.  The recipient of these cheques is handed over to a trader who agrees to cash the cheque and give the issuer of it a rake-off in the shape of a percentage and commission.  I do not know whether or not these things were investigated prior to the introduction of the Bill.  In my opinion, this hire-purchase arrangement, so far as it applies to furniture and equipment for the home, is a menace.  It should be curtailed, regulated and controlled and, so far as this Bill moves in that direction, I welcome it but I do not think that it goes far enough.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to deal with only two points which are more properly Committee points.  By dealing with them now, we may avoid difficulty later.  In Section 8, there is a provision by virtue of which the hirer is bound to give notice to the owner of the whereabouts of the goods.  I suggest that there should be a further provision&mdash;that the hirer should not be entitled to move the goods out of the jurisdiction without the consent of the owner.  It will not be of very much assistance to the owner of the goods if he is informed that they have already passed out of the jurisdiction of the courts.  The second point I want to make has reference to residence.  It is difficult sometimes to find the residence <Col N="2114" /> of the hirer.  A hire-purchase agreement is made when the hirer is in a particular residence.  Later he defaults and, when the owner tries to collect from the residence, as given in the agreement, he finds that the hirer has gone away and cannot be found.  I can see that there would be some difficulty in dealing with that point.  The goods might, of their essence, be such as would be movable&mdash;for instance, a motor car.  It would not be possible to provide that the hirer should give notice of a change in the position of the goods.  But there should be some method by which the hirer would give notice before removal from the address in the possession of the owner.  With the general provisions of the Bill, I think we are all in agreement.  We agree that steps should be taken to remedy the civil of unscrupulous owners of goods working on the foibles of our people to get them to undertake on the &ldquo;never never&rdquo; system contracts which they will find it difficult to fulfil except at the expense of providing in a proper way for their families. While I am wholeheartedly in agreement with preventing that excess, I do not subscribe to the general denunciation of all those who deal in hire purchase, such as that in which Senator O'Dea engaged.  There are good and bad firms&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I find myself completely in disagreement with the view expressed by Senator Foran, that the development of hire-purchase trading <Col N="2115" /> is an unmitigated evil.  People can, of course, make mistakes and enter into commitments which they cannot carry through, and get into difficulties.  But, subject to the elimination of possible abuses, as proposed in this Bill, I think that hire-purchase trading has useful social consequences.  A very large number of people in this country and other countries have been able to raise their standard of living by reason of the existence of hire-purchase facilities.  It is, I think, a feature of a developing economy and is, generally, most active in times of prosperity, not in times of depression.  I should say that a very large number of individuals in this country, because of hire-purchase facilities, own bicycles, radio sets and other equipment which they could not otherwise have acquired.  Of course, as Senator Johnston said, a bank will lend money on cheaper terms.  That may be theoretically true but, in practice, it is not of much use.  The average domestic servant in Dublin who buys a bicycle on the hire-purchase system would not get accommodation from a bank if she went there to borrow the price of a bicycle.  While one could contemplate the development of finance houses which might give accommodation of that kind, the fact is that that accommodation does not exist.  Where that form of financial assistance has tended to develop, abuses have been associated with it also.  We are not proposing to stop the system of hire-purchase trading but we impose upon it certain restrictions which will prevent the development of the type of abuse which experience has shown we might expect. We do not propose to go further than that.  We do not propose to give persons who buy goods on the hire-purchase system a greater measure of legal protection than that which the person who buys goods for cash now enjoys.  Any person entering into a commercial transaction is expected to protect himself.  When Senator O'Dea talks about goods being sold at unreasonable prices the point he makes there is not a peculiarity that exists in relation to the hire-purchase trade alone.  A person who buys for cash <Col N="2116" /> may pay more than the value of the goods, too.</P>
      <P>The hire-purchase trade is a feature of normal trading conditions.  It tends to disappear when goods are scarce and to expand when goods are plentiful, and when competition between traders results in the adoption of every method to increase the sale of goods. I do not think there is any obligation upon us to take everybody by the hand when they are buying anything, to see that they do not make mistakes, to see that they do not pay too much for goods or that they do not buy goods that they do not want, or which they cannot afford.  We must allow for the exercise of a certain amount of individual judgment and it is one of the consequences of individual judgment that mistakes will be made.  We can, however, prevent people from being defrauded by the misrepresentation of goods as to their quality.  We can prevent them from entering into unfair agreements and ensure that they will appreciate what they are doing.  That is what this legislation is designed to achieve but I do not think it is necessary that we should go any further than that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I disagree with Senator Sweetman that we should place an obligation in law on the hirers of goods to maintain the goods under their control, or keep them in the country, or make their address known to the owner of the goods.  In respect of these matters the owner of the goods will protect himself. He will have, in the agreement he makes with the hirer of the goods, whatever clauses he thinks are necessary in his own interest and there is nothing in this Bill which prevents him from having such clauses or which renders them void if they are so inserted. It is, however, proposed in the Bill that if he puts in the agreement a clause under which the person signing it contracts-out from the protection of the legislation that that clause is void.  If he puts in the agreement a minimum payment clause, that is also void, but in respect of these other matters it is a normal feature of hire-purchase agreements to contain clauses which give the trader all the protection he requires.  It is <Col N="2117" /> the trader's own job to protect his interests in the agreements.</P>
    <P>My view is that there is a genuine public demand for hire-purchase facilities and, subject to the limitations proposed, the extension of hire-purchase facilities can have desirable social and economic consequences.  I do not know whether I should follow Senator Johnston along the road he travelled as to possible repercussions upon the general national economy of the further development of the hire-purchase trade.  In so far as the hire-purchase trade is made possible by bank credit then presumably it is in the powers of the banks to prevent an unhealthy development of hire-purchase facilities.  What happened in the United States was that banking control of the hire-purchase trade was either improperly used or was inadequate and a situation developed which ultimately contributed to the dimensions of the American financial crash. I do not think there is any obligation on the Government in a Bill of this kind to impose any limitation upon the extent to which hire-purchase trading is engaged in by the community or as to the extent to which the banks may facilitate or assist the hire-purchase trade.</P>
    <P>Senator Duffy is not quite correct in saying that this Bill is a copy of the British Bill.  As presented to the Seanad, it is considerably wider in its scope than the British legislation. Legislation on these lines was enacted in Britain in 1938 and we had the assistance of people who were familiar with the operation of that legislation in Great Britain in the preparation of this Bill.  Of course the experience of the British legislation is incomplete. The outbreak of war led to its virtual suspension and the circumstances of the war were not such as to give a fair picture of the possible effects of the Bill upon the abuses which it was intended to remove.</P>
    <P>I do not think it is necessary that we should legislate to prevent people entering into a second hire-purchase transaction while a first one is still incomplete.  Apart from the general principle that people must be allowed to use their own judgment in their <Col N="2118" /> own interests, the imposition of a limitation of that kind might work very harshly.  It may be pointed out that the application of this Bill is not confined to bicycles, wireless sets or suites of furniture.  The Bill applies to any class of goods that may be purchased under the hire-purchase system.  Many traders buy motor vehicles by that method and ordinary citizens, commercial travellers, for instance, buy motor cars under the hire-purchase system.  Indeed, it is not unusual for small industrial firms to buy plant and equipment under hire purchase.  All these transactions are covered by the Bill and in many cases to prevent people entering into a second transaction while the first one was still alive would be a very serious limitation of their liberty of action. The Bill does not apply to houses, to money lending, to tontine societies or any of the other transactions to which reference was made or about which queries were addressed to me.  As is clear from the definition of a hire-purchase agreement in Section 1, it applies only to agreements concerning sale of goods.</P>
    <P>As most Senators have pointed out matters which have to be considered in relation to this Bill are points of detail and they can be discussed more adequately in Committee.  I am glad to understand from the speeches made that the principle of the Bill is approved. The only possible objection to the principle of the Bill would be based upon the theory that the buyers of goods under the hire-purchase system should protect themselves and that there is no obligation on the State to enact special legislation for their benefit.  That theory has not been advanced either here or in the Dáil.  I would have to answer that contention by explaining that however sound it might be in general theory, in practice many people who undertake hire-purchase transactions do not protect themselves and evil social consequences have followed therefrom.  We think that it is not unreasonable that the State should legislate for the protection of such citizens.  Many people run into transactions for the purchase of bicycles, suites of furniture, etc., without ever <Col N="2119" /> reading the agreements they have signed, and it is necessary to ensure that these agreements do not contain provisions which are so unfair to them as eventually to lead to hardship in many cases.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, we must not go too far in the other direction of relieving people entirely from their personal responsibilities, and subject to the provisions of this Bill, it is safe and sound in practice and in theory to require persons buying goods in this manner to satisfy themselves that they are getting good value, that the goods serve the purpose for which they require them and that they are not entering into transactions which they cannot carry through.  There were no other points raised to which I wish to refer now. There were some points of detail but I have no doubt they will be raised again in Committee.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Being of opinion that solitary confinement as a form of disciplinary punishment in prisons, particularly if continued for lengthy periods, is inhuman and therefore indefensible, this House considers it should be resorted to only in rare cases and with the specific sanction of the Minister for Justice, that in any case it should not be extended beyond 48 hours on any particular occasion or be permitted more frequently than once in any period of three months and requests the Government to submit proposals for amending the prison rules accordingly.</P>
      <P>I think it will be appreciated that this motion is drawn in rather restricted terms.  Its purpose is to secure from the House an expression of opinion that solitary confinement as a form of prison punishment is indefensible, irrespective of the class of person to whom it is applied; that it should be resorted to only in rare instances and then should have the specific knowledge and sanction of the Minister for Justice.  Perhaps I should indicate at this stage what I mean by solitary confinement and draw attention to what it entails for the person to whom it is applied.  As I understand it, it involves the locking up of a prisoner in his cell for 24 hours in the day.  He has no contact of any kind, except with prison officials; he has no exercise outside his cell; he has no visitors; he is denied access to the open air; he is not entitled to receive or send letters and he has no newspapers.  I understand these things are regarded as privileges and, because they are privileges, they are taken away from the prisoner sentenced to solitary confinement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first question I want to ask is whether, in fact, there is authority for punishment of this character and, if so, <Col N="2121" /> what it is and what limits are placed upon its exercise by the prison authorities. The Prisons (Ireland) Act, 1877, makes provision for the punishment known as close confinement or solitary confinement, within specified limits.  It provides first that the prison governor may impose solitary confinement for a period not exceeding 24 hours and, further, that the justices&mdash;now, I think, the visiting committee&mdash;may, after investigation, order a maximum period of 14 days' solitary confinement.  I am sure most members of the House who reflect on what is involved will agree with me that this is a serious form of punishment.  The more sensitive the person concerned may be, the more injurious this will be to his mind and health.  Let us always bear in mind that there is a statutory limitation on its application.</P>
    <P>My motion when it was drafted had no connection whatever with any recent incidents or with any other incident relating to solitary confinement or prison conditions.  Had this motion been debated when it first appeared on the Order Paper, it is possible the discussion might have taken a line that is not so easy to follow now, having regard to the discussions which have taken place elsewhere on another motion relating somewhat remotely to the same question.  I was concerned, however, with the broad principle of this form of punishment, and what is involved, and at the same time I was concerned to ascertain how that punishment is inflicted and under what authority it is imposed for lengthy periods.  Under our own statute&mdash;the Prisons Visiting Committees Act of 1925 which is the only Act, I think, of an Irish Parliament dealing with the subject&mdash;provision is make for visiting committees to order solitary confinement. Again, however, their powers are limited.  They may order solitary confinement for not more than 14 days, and this punishment can be inflicted by the visiting committee only in cases of repeated offences and after a sworn inquiry.</P>
    <P>I think there can be no argument, therefore, as to the reality of the limitations which are placed upon the prison governor and on the visiting <Col N="2122" /> committees to order solitary confinement as a form of punishment within the prison.  Actually, the matter was raised years ago in the case of the Thomas Ashe inquiry.  On that occasion, it was admitted by the deputy governor of Mountjoy Prison, who was then on oath, that punishment can only be inflicted after trial and sentence.  I have the feeling, however, that there has been a departure, so far as the present prison practices are concerned, from that interpretation of the law.  There is the right conferred by statute on every prisoner to a certain minimum number of hours open air exercise every day.  The Prisons (Ireland) Act of 1826 provides as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Each prison must have a yard of sufficient dimensions to enable prisoners to have the benefit of fresh air and exercise.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Then it goes on to provide:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That all prisoners shall be permitted to air themselves&rdquo;</P>
    <P>&mdash;quaint language in a British statute&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;in the yard for at least two hours every day.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>When it says &ldquo;every day,&rdquo; I assume that it means every day, whether it is a week-day or a Sunday.  This right to exercise in the open, in the fresh air, in the prison grounds or yard, as not a privilege.  It is a right conferred by statute, and it should not be taken away lightly.  In my submission, it cannot be taken away except under powers conferred by statute.</P>
    <P>How have these rights conferred by statute been interfered with in recent years?  At a recent inquest, the prison doctor swore on oath that the person in respect of whose death the inquiry was being held, had been kept in solitary confinement for three years.  He added further that the person concerned had not been allowed out in the fresh air for four and a half years.  Now, I cannot follow the line adopted by the Department of Justice in this matter.  These prisoners are either entitled to exercise or, as the statute says &ldquo;to air themselves&rdquo; for two hours a day, or they are not.  If solitary confinement has been ordered for three years there must be some statutory authority for that act.  I <Col N="2123" /> would like to know the authority.  I have been unable to find any.</P>
    <P>There is another case, the case of a living man whose words can be tested. I want to say in passing that I am much obliged to the Minister for Justice for permitting me to see the conditions in Portlaoighise Convict Prison, and that I am very deeply grateful to the governor of the prison for the facilities he afforded myself and and a colleague visiting the prison to talk to the prisoners, to ask them questions and to find out, as far as we were able, the facts in relation to the conditions of imprisonment.  I am making no complaint in regard to the conditions under which prisoners are detained.  I am concerned merely at this stage with stating what I have discovered to be the facts in relation to the punishment of solitary confinement, and to ask the Minister by what authority, under what regulations and under what statute these conditions are imposed.  The case that I want to refer to is the case of a prisoner who was convicted of murder in the Special Criminal Court under certain circumstances which need not be detailed now.  The prisoner in question was reprieved and given a life sentence. The sentence commenced on the 24th July, 1940, in Mountjoy Prison&mdash; not in Portlaoighise&mdash;and, from that period until the 2nd June, 1943, the person concerned was kept in solitary confinement.  That is to say, this man was exposed to all the rigours of solitary confinement to which I have referred, including deprivation of the right to exercise in the fresh air, for two years, 11 months and four days. I will be told, perhaps, that it is his own fault, that he refused to wear prison clothes, but that is not the whole story.  No question of prison clothes and no question of breaches of discipline arose in Mountjoy Prison but he was kept in solitary confinement in Mountjoy Prison from 24th July, 1940, until 29th July, 1940.  That is to say, he was kept for five days in solitary confinement in Mountjoy Prison immediately after a death sentence had been reprieved.</P>
    <P>There may be good grounds for this <Col N="2124" /> action.  I do not know&mdash;I am not arguing the merits of the case.  The prisoner concerned was condemned to solitary confinement in Mountjoy Prison for five days.  The prison governor had no power under the statute or the regulations so to order. The visiting committee would have power to order that the prisoner concerned would be kept in solitary confinement for 14 days after an inquiry and after an investigation on oath, but not otherwise; further, it would have to be shown to the visiting committee that there were repeated breaches of prison discipline.  It is not good enough to go to the committee and say: &ldquo;This fellow is an impossible cur; he must be tied up.&rdquo;  That is not sufficient.</P>
    <P>The visiting committee can order 14 days' solitary confinement or any lesser period they think fit, only when they are satisfied that there have been repeated offences against prison discipline. I want to know whether the visiting justices in Mountjoy have done this.  If it is desired I will mention the name of the prisoner&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>This man was transferred to Portlaoighise Convict Prison on 29th July, 1940.  When he entered the prison a row commenced immediately with the prison authorities because he refused to wear prison clothes.  I am not concerned with that aspect of it. He was immediately ordered solitary confinement.  There can be no doubt about that; the allegation was made by the prisoner concerned in a cell in Portlaoighise Prison on Saturday in the presence of the governor and the chief warder, and was admitted by both to have been a fact.  That is to say, it was admitted by the prison authorities he was in solitary confinement in his cell, locked there 24 hours per day from the 29th July, 1940 to the 2nd June, 1943, a period of two years and 11 months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, Sir, I have drawn attention to provisions of the Statute of 1877 and I want to be told under what statutory authority a prisoner can be kept in solitary confinement for more than 14 days.  If it is argued that the person in question could not be allowed to leave his cell because he was not properly dressed, I must reply that he was dressed as effectively in May, 1943 as <Col N="2126" /> he was in July, 1943.  But the solitary confinement ceased to be applied to him on 2nd June, 1943, so that whatever case there is, whatever grounds there were for admitting him to exercise in a large cell in conjunction with other prisoners in July, 1943, they were valid in May, 1943.  That is a matter on which there can be no arguments as to the facts.  The facts are admitted.</P>
    <P>They are asserted by the prisoner; they are admitted by the prison authorities.  I do not blame the prison authorities&mdash;I am not complaining once about them.  Obviously, they are carrying out instructions, but what I am concerned with is this.  If the Minister has given these instructions to the prison authorities, I want to be told under what statute or law, or regulation, under what Order, under what instrument of any kind, does he purport to act when he instructs the prison authorities at Portlaoighise to keep any person in solitary confinement for two years 11 months?</P>
    <P>I want to pass from that aspect and from that complaint for a moment, because, personally, I do not want to get into any argument in relation to this matter with the Minister for Justice and I regret that there should be any conflict of view as to the wisdom or the unwisdom of this practice of keeping men for lengthy periods in solitary confinement.  I would prefer to discuss the matter objectively and while I do not profess to have been able to make a very close investigation of the authorities which have considered the matter in its broad relations I did consult one of those authorities and I would like for the information of this House to make reference to it.  I first want to refer to a statement made several years ago by Major Arthur Griffiths who is the author of a book entitled <i>The Chronicles of Newgate.</i>  He was the inspector of prisons in Britain for a period of 18 years.  He is, therefore, not speaking theoretically.  He was not merely one of these Fabian writers at whom perhaps the Minister might sneer, nor one of these kind-hearted friendly people who have always a good word for the bottom dog.  He is an experienced <Col N="2127" /> prison official and this is his statement:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Solitary confinement has neither conquered nor appreciably diminished crime even where it has been applied with extreme care.... Cloistered seclusion is an artificial condition quite at variance with human instincts and habits and, the treatment, long continued, has proved injurious to health, including mental breakdown.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I ask the House and the Minister to ponder those words written not by a philanthropist but by an experienced prison official.  Not merely, however, was this authority prepared to rely on his own observation and knowledge of prisons and prisoners and of the effect on prisoners of solitary confinement but he allowed himself to inquire what was being done abroad, what was the experience of solitary confinement and, from a number of observations on its historic background, I should like to quote this sentence.  He was writing about Auburn Penitentiary in the early 19th century and he said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;There, every prisoner was kept continuously in close isolation.  He saw no one, spoke to no one and did no work.  Within a short period, very deplorable results began to show themselves.  Many persons became insane, health was generally impaired and life greatly endangered.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Is it any wonder, therefore, that the legislators who considered those conditions 120 years ago should, in a British Act of 1826, impose rigorous restrictions on the exercise of authority to impose the penalty of solitary confinement? It is a rather strange reflection that the British authorities of 120 years ago were far more humane in treating murderers, sodomists and criminals of all kinds in their prisons than we are in this Christian island in the year 1946.</P>
    <P>This motion was originally intended, as I have stated, to deal only with the question of solitary confinement and its implications in relation to existing conditions.  There is, however, on the Order Paper an amendment which <Col N="2128" /> seeks an inquiry into the laws and regulations governing prison treatment. I may say at once that I am quite prepared to accept the amendment in substitution for my motion.  I should like, therefore, to say something on this subject of prison treatment generally.  So far as I can gather, there are no complaints of any kind regarding food in Portlaoighise Prison. It is, perhaps, an exaggeration to say that there are no complaints.  There are some complaints&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHearne" hpid="Mr. Hearne Mr. Hearne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hearne</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>Everybody is entitled to his opinion but I consider that the catering arrangements&mdash;if that is the proper description&mdash;are not unsatisfactory. I am making no complaint on that score.  I should like, however, to make one slight correction.  When the Minister was speaking in the Dáil, he made reference to the food supplied and the hours at which it was supplied in Portlaoighise Prison.  I think that he fell into an error.  He said that breakfast was at 8.40, dinner later, supper at 4.30 and there was a special supper at 7.30.  I understand that there is no special supper at 7.30.  Additional food is served at 4.30 which can be held in reserve and consumed by prisoners, if they think fit, at 7.30 but there is no special service of food later than 4.30. Complaint was made by a couple of prisoners that the amount of food supplied at 4.30 was inadequate and that the whole amount, including that for the special supper, was consumed at 4.30.  That is not a matter with which I need deal.  I merely draw attention to the fact that the Minister seems to have been misinformed in regard to it.  So far as the majority of the prisoners in Portlaoighise are concerned, I do not desire to say more but I do feel that I must say something regarding the condition of seven persons who are living under extraordinary conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know whether or not the Minister feels complacent in regard to <Col N="2129" /> the matter.  I do not think that he can and I should urge him very strongly, in his quiet and sober moments&mdash;no offence meant&mdash;to reflect what the consequences may be, not, indeed, for the persons concerned but for the country at large.  These seven prisoners are not permitted to exercise in the fresh air, so that that provision of the Act of 1826 is null and void so far as they are concerned.  Such &ldquo;privileges,&rdquo; as I think they are described, as the reception of visitors and letters are not extended to them.</P>
    <P>I think one of the worst features of their incarceration relates to something that, in my opinion, is inhuman in its application to ordinary men.  I refer now to the fact that, because these men are under special observation, a prison warder switches on the electric light in their cells every 15 minutes throughout the night.  Let us remember that during the past weekend these men were locked up from 4.30 on Saturday evening last until 10.30 on Monday morning.  That is to say, they were allowed no exercise and they were not allowed to leave their cells during the whole of Sunday&mdash; from 4.30 on Saturday evening until 10.30 on Monday morning.  They were allowed out from 10.30 until 12 o'clock but as it was Whit Monday and a bank holiday, there was no evening exercise, with the result that between 4.30 on Saturday and 10.30 on Tuesday, these men were allowed to exercise in a larger cell and in association for 1½ hours only.</P>
    <P>I can imagine, and I am sure most members of the House will realise, the amount of strain under which people suffer who are locked up in this fashion, and I would respectfully submit that it is hardly even refined cruelty to find that all through Saturday and Sunday nights the lights were switched on in their cells every 15 minutes.  Not merely that but if any one of the prisoners under special observation takes no notice and goes on sleeping there is a knocking and kicking at the door, and if he still does not respond and turn over the cell door is opened and he is quickly made turn over, and that every 15 minutes.  I wonder is there any <Col N="2130" /> justification on any grounds for a performance of that kind.  We will be told of course that these men are not permitted in the open air because they are not properly dressed.  Certainly they are not dressed in the orthodox fashion in which we see men walking about but they are dressed more effectively from the point of view of cover than Mr. Gandhi was when he met the British Ministers in Delhi a few weeks ago, and they are as effectively and fully dressed as most men who go around in kilts on a Sunday morning playing a band.</P>
    <P>It is said, of course, and has been stated to me, that one of the reasons why they cannot be allowed out even to go to Mass is that their dress is immodest.  It was, however, stated in the presence of the prison officials that some of the prisoners asked the priests who visited them whether their dress was immodest, and the priest said &ldquo;no&rdquo;, so I think that the immodesty argument falls to the ground.  It may be that the other argument that their dress is not sufficiently warm to protect the body from cold would be a good argument in winter, but it is certainly no argument at all in summer. The dress is not cold, and there is no risk of ill-health in permitting these men to exercise in the open air in their present dress.  The only argument that I can understand by which the practice of the authorities is defended is that it is a breach of prison regulations.</P>
    <P>Prison regulations of course are not sacrosanct.  Section 13 of the Prisons Act of 1856 gives discretion to the Minister to dispense with the obligation on convicted prisoners to wear prison clothes.  I want to say this in respect of all classes of prisoners, irrespective of their social standing, mental capacity, or the crime they have committed, that to me it seems a most outrageous survival of barbarism to expect men to wear the prison garb that is prescribed for them.  I do not know when it was invented, but it is the most abominable kind of dress one can imagine.  I am making no special case for any class of prisoner.  I refer to the convict dress as worn by all kinds of prisoners in Portlaoighise, and I consider that it should have been <Col N="2131" /> abolished long ago.  There is no case for it.  Actually, as I understand it, the original grounds for prescribing uniform dress for convicts was that in the old days, 150 years ago, many of them did not have clothes.  They did not have clothes that could be worn in prisons just as thousands of people in this country in the famine years going to the workhouses when they were first established, did not have clothes they could wear there, and they had to be given workhouse clothes or uniform.  So the uniform then is a survival of the period when criminals were regarded as the scum of the earth.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCampbell" hpid="Mr. Campbell Mr. Campbell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Campbell</NameTxt>
      <P>Would Senator Duffy tell us what is abominable in respect of the clothes worn?  He said they were abominable, and I would like him to give some details to the House as to the way they are abominable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to go into details, and I should imagine that a big proportion of the members of the House are familiar with the clothes worn by convicts.  The cloth itself is a rough, drab grey, and the clothes are ill-fitting.  They are made, I presume, to some standard size, and if you do not happen to be that standard so much the worse.  The whole attitude is that a man is transformed from an intelligent being to an ignorant lout by the appearance of the clothes he wears.  I do not know whether the Minister and Senator Campbell consider there is any need to have that particular degrading type of clothes used in prisons.  I understand that in Mountjoy prisoners are permitted to wear their own clothes. Whether there is any case for their wearing prison clothes such as the convicted prisoners wear in Portlaoighise, I do not know.  Personally I would like to hope that it would be abandoned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the health of the prisoners to whom I refer, I would say that in the main they appear all right, physically, except in one case, but I have grave doubts as to whether it can be said they are all right mentally.  I think that what I quoted from Major Griffiths a few moments ago has particular application to some of the men <Col N="2132" /> concerned in Portlaoighise and I have a suspicion that in one case in particular it is especially true.  I do not want to deal with the matter further, beyond saying that, in my opinion, the conditions under which they live are are having a deleterious effect on their mental condition.</P>
    <P>I notice that, in 1917, the General Prisons Board made an order applicable to prisoners in Mountjoy, that is to say, prisoners committed for offences created by the Defence of the Realm Acts or Regulations.  Article 9 of the directions posted in the prison says that any such prisoner may be allowed to wear his own clothes, if sufficient and fit for use.  He may be allowed to have supplied at his own expense such books, newspapers or other means of occupation, other than those furnished by the prison, as are not, in the opinion of the governor, of an objectionable kind; and so on.  It seems to me that, even in 1917, there was a recognition of the fact that certain types of prisoners&mdash;which would really mean certain types of human beings&mdash;do not respond to the punishment for penal prisoners and that another method must be found to deal with them, if they are to be kept in incarceration.</P>
    <P>I mentioned earlier that the statutes laid down some provisions in relation to the treatment of prisoners and I want now to draw attention to the fact that these statutes are interpreted more fully by prison rules.  I gather that it is very difficult to find the prison rules.  A question was tabled in the Dáil on the 5th June, asking the Minister whether he would lay copies of the prison rules on the Table of the Oireachtas.  To that the Minister replied that he regretted there were not in the Department of Justice any spare copies which could be placed in the Oireachtas Library, but he understood that the volumes of Statutory Rules and Orders were available for inspection in the National Library.  On inquiry at the National Library, I was told they were not there.  Since I made that inquiry, the Minister has given a list of the Statutory Rules and Orders which are in force and with that list it may be possible to locate them in the National Library.  Up to last week, <Col N="2133" /> however, I was not able to locate any copies of the prison rules and orders in the National Library.  I may say, however, that in the reply which I have quoted the Minister went on to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;A reprint, in consolidated form, of all the rules has been prepared in the Department and is at present with the parliamentary draftsmen for revision from the drafting point of view.  I hope to lay the result before the Dáil within a month or so.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It will be satisfactory if we can see the rules, as then we will know the authority under which the prison governor, the visiting justices and visiting committee and the Minister himself purport to act when inflicting punishment which, in my submission, is now inflicted without authority of any kind.  In passing, I would mention that, so far as I am aware, there has been no report on prisons published by the Minister since 1938.  I understand there is a statutory obligation on the Minister to publish an annual report.  If so, it has not been complied with.</P>
    <P>While I am on this subject, there is one other matter to which I would invite the Minister's attention, namely, the manner in which discrimination is exercised regarding the imprisonment of persons convicted, that is, by the Military Court, where a sentence of death is commuted.</P>

I am not quite sure how <Col N="2134" /> far that goes, whether it really means that the proposer of the amendment considers that all that is needed is that we should look into the prison rules and the statutes under which the rules are made, to see that they are all right and have them put into modern language rather than in the language of 1826.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>

What I have in mind is that the inquiry, if held, should have in view not merely a reformation of the present system but something substituted for the present prison system.  Personally, I think it is a most undesirable practice to tie up a large body of men in any kind of prison for long periods. It leaves the system open to all kinds of abuse.  We should seek a totally different approach to the form of punishment which is to be prescribed where persons are convicted of having broken the law.  This has been the subject of discussion elsewhere and, if I may, I would like to quote a very brief statement sent to me yesterday by a lady who is deeply concerned in prison reform.  The statement covers most of what I would like to say on that point and, with your permission, I would like to read it to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to move the following amendment:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To delete all words after the word &ldquo;that&rdquo; where that word first occurs and substitute the words &ldquo;an inquiry into the laws and regulations governing prison treatment is desirable Seanad Éireann requests the Government to appoint a commission to consider and report what changes, if any, should be made.</P>
      <P>I had, perhaps, two main reasons for handing in this amendment.  In the first place, I did not like the wording of the motion which seemed to me to place far too much emphasis on one aspect only of the question of possible prison reform.  Secondly, I do not like the wording of the motion in so far as it virtually says that solitary confinement is inhuman and, therefore, indefensible, but that the Minister may be inhuman and indefensible for 24 hours.  I am perfectly certain that was not intended.  I give that as an illustration of why, first of all, I conceived the idea that if this matter was to be debated it should be debated on a very much wider aspect.  Now, the terms of the amendment are not perfectly satisfactory because they had to be related to the motion.  The amendment would probably have been worded quite differently if it had been brought forward apart altogether from the original motion.  Another reason for putting down the amendment was this: that I have felt for many years that our whole prison system requires examination, and that many reforms could be made which would be to the advantage not only of prisoners but of society generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, the death in prison of a hunger striker, to which considerable reference has been made by Senator Duffy, has awakened interest in prisons and in prison systems, an interest which has been long dormant.  This regrettable occurrence raises several questions. Some of them, perhaps most of them, are of acute difficulty.  To my mind they are clearly the responsibility of the Executive of the day.  The question of the treatment of political prisoners and the question, what class of prisoner is to be regarded as a political prisoner, are not questions which, to my mind, <Col N="2138" /> can be settled by any regulation. These will always be questions which will have to be settled by the Government in power at the time and in the light of the circumstances of the time. If the public do not approve of the action of the Government in a particular case the only remedy is to vote against the Government on the first available opportunity.  It seems to me that in this country, and in every other country, the treatment of political prisoners will, by the very nature of things, always be a political issue.  I cannot see how it can be otherwise. What may be regarded as a serious political crime under one set of circumstances may be regarded as a patriotic act under other circumstances.  Acts which our people, rightly or wrongly, believed to be patriotic when this country was ruled by Great Britain, when it was struggling for its independence, would be suppressed with the utmost vigour of the law if directed against our own elected Government.</P>
    <P>My amendment does not deal with the recent events at Portlaoighise Prison except in so far as every prison would come under review if a commission were set up.  I do not propose to discuss any further that particular case.  It was the subject of a somewhat bitter debate in the Dáil.  The Government has accepted full responsibility, and I cannot see that any useful purpose would be served in discussing it again in this House to which the Government is not responsible for its executive acts.  I would like, however, to see the interest which has risen in this case focused on the whole problem of penal reform, because I believe if that were done permanent good may come out of it.</P>
    <P>My interest in this problem did not arise suddenly this year.  After the Treaty was signed I felt that one of the problems which should be tackled in the early years of the State was that of our prisons.  I felt that we had a large number of persons with experience of prison conditions whose character and integrity could not be questioned, and that that was an opportunity that should not be lost.  I discussed the matter with the late Michael Collins.  In connection with the Constitution, <Col N="2139" /> I saw him once or twice every week.  I believe that, if he had lived and were in power, a commission would have been set up years ago. The Civil War, and other difficulties which I do not want to discuss now, prevented anything being done around that period, but I think the time has now come when action might be taken. A commission appointed now could get to work in the autumn.  There is still a large number of persons alive whose evidence would be of value.  If it is put off indefinitely, the value of their experience may possibly be lost.</P>
    <P>It may be said that this is not the time.  It may may be argued that the criticism of the Government in connection with Seán McCaughey has been so bitter that to act now would be a sign of weakness.  I respectfully disagree&mdash;I think it would be a sign of strength and wisdom, and might direct the mind of the public from the purely political issues involved to the real problem which is that of the wisest and best treatment that should in the interests of the community at large be given to prisoners whether their crimes be regarded as political or not.  This is not a party political issue and should not be allowed to become one.  The Taoiseach stated in the Dáil that, if there was an impartial examination and a comparison with the systems in other countries, it would be found that the prison system here compared favourably with that in any other civilised country.  Possibly he is right&mdash;I am not going to dispute his statement, but there are very many people in the country who do not believe it might apply in certain States of America or New Zealand.</P>
    <P>The kind of commission that I would like to see set up should certainly be open-minded and impartial, but it would not be for the purpose of reporting on whether our prisons were or were not as good as in any other country, but rather to examine the whole problem of the treatment of persons who had been deprived of their liberty because they had broken the law.  The public generally knows very little about prisons and there are people who believe prisons to be <Col N="2140" /> places where terrible tortures are inflicted on the unfortunate inmates by callous officers.  I have also met people who believe or say they believe that prisons are more or less luxurious establishments in which worthless offenders are petted and pampered at the public expense and the undoubted fact that a number of persons go back to prison, time after time, is quoted as proof.  Neither of these points of view is true but they do illustrate the general ignorance of the prison system.</P>
    <P>I am not sure if the term &ldquo;prison system&rdquo; is not really a misnomer. There is, of course, a system in the sense that there are elaborate rules and regulations applying to all prisons. With certain modifications, these are what we took over from the British Government.  The Acts of Parliament which govern our prisons are British Acts, most of them passed many years ago.  This does not mean that they are necessarily bad or necessarily unsuitable, but I imagine it does add to the suspicion which is more or less widespread.</P>
    <P>The fact is that the prisons here are manned by our own officials. My own experience of prisons is rather limited, but I would have a very large degree of confidence in our present prison governors and I expect that the commission would be guided very largely by officials who have had experience of prison administration for 20 years, as well of course, as by persons who have been in prison.</P>
    <P>If we ask ourselves how our prisons came into being, what they are supposed to accomplish, how far they attain their objectives, very few of us could give rational or satisfactory answers.  The fact is that prisons here and in England have been the growth of centuries and that very little attempt has been made to work out any consistent theory as to the objects for which prisons are maintained or the purposes they are intended to serve.</P>
    <P>In his speech in the Dáil the Taoiseach referred to soft-hearted persons who easily forgot the crimes that have been committed.  He may possibly include me in this category, because I do believe that once the State deprives <Col N="2141" /> a man of his liberty and takes him out of society, it must accept some responsibility for his moral and physical welfare.  But, although I hold this view, I, nevertheless, believe that the interests of society are paramount. The protection of society is more important than the welfare of an individual, and it is largely because I believe that our present methods of prison treatment do not protect society as it could and should be done, that I advocate the setting up of a commission and the consideration of possible changes and reforms.  Every year in Britain and Ireland persons of dangerous anti-social tendencies are released, not because they have been cured or even improved, but because the sentence pronounced by the court has come to an end.</P>
    <P>It is not easy to define in a sentence or two what should be the object of imprisonment.  In a general way, I would say that prisons exist primarily for the protection of society and for the maintenance of order.  The secondary object is the punishment of persons who cannot or who will not obey the laws of the State which are in effect the rules of the society in which they live.</P>
    <P>In a memorandum submitted by the British Home Office in 1930 to a Select Committee of the House of Commons it was stated:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is an accepted principle of modern prison administration that imprisonment is itself the penalty, and that it is not the function of the prison authorities to add further penalties day by day by punitive conditions of discipline, labour, diet and general treatment.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think this is true, and I believe that the real deterrent lies in the fact that even under the most favourable conditions, the convict is deprived of everything that a free man calls and regards as life.</P>
    <P>The old idea sung by Gilbert of making the punishment fit the crime has disappeared &mdash; the object nowadays should be to make the punishment fit the criminal so that that use may be made of the period of imprisonment to change his anti-social outlook and to <Col N="2142" /> bring him into a more healthy frame of mind towards his fellow citizens, so that when he leaves prison he will not become, after a few weeks or months, a danger or at least a nuisance to the public.</P>
    <P>To my mind the main function of a commission should be the consideration of how best our prisons may become a better and more effective protection to the community.  In so doing they will have to consider how far it is possible to train prisoners in citizenship and to help them in the task of self-rehabilitation.</P>
    <P>It is not necessary, or perhaps even appropriate, in moving a motion for the setting up of a commission to discuss in detail the subjects likely to come up for consideration, and if I were to do so I would take up more of the time of the House than would be fair having regard to the limited time available. I propose, therefore, to indicate only a few of the subjects which I think might be considered.  Perhaps the strongest case against the general prison system to-day is that it is not constructive.  It takes criminals of every type and treats them in very much the same way.  It matters not whether a man is a thief, a drunkard, a child assaulter, a political offender, a debtor, a forger, a bigamist or is guilty of manslaughter.  In essentials they are dealt with alike.  A prisoner is in jail because he has broken the law.  Many crimes are clearly immoral &mdash;others are simply a breach of the rules which, rightly or wrongly, society regards as being essential to its stability and its welfare.  It seems to me absurd to treat all offenders alike, with little or no regard to the extent to which their offences are breaches of the moral law.  And, if reform is to be one of the objects of prison treatment, it is clear that different types of treatment will be essential for different types of prisoners.  I could speak at length on this subject but I have indicated what is in my mind.</P>
    <P>Closely allied to this is the question of prisoners with short sentences.  The English Prison Commissioners have reported that the short sentence is an outstanding defect in our penal system <Col N="2143" /> and creates difficulty in prison administration. In 1930, over 21,000 persons were sent to prison in Great Britain for a month or less.  This figure included over 12,000 for a fortnight or less.  I have not any figures for this country nor have I any more recent figures for Great Britain, but I think that the number has been considerably reduced following an Act passed in 1936 in Great Britain which deals with the payment of fines and other sums.  It is called The Money Payments (Justices Procedure) Act.  It is not difficult to see that the presence of a number of persons who have only come in for a few days is an impediment to the development of a sound system of prison training.  It has been suggested that no sentence should be less than three months, as this is the shortest period which is likely to benefit a prisoner.  Whether this is practicable or not, I do not know but I would like to see it examined.  I would like to abolish imprisonment as an alternative to the payment of a fine.  It has a tendency to favour the well-to-do and it also adds considerably to the cost of our prison system.  I would like to see the establishment of a work centre where a person unable or unwilling to pay a fine could be sent and kept until a sufficient sum had been earned to pay the fine.  It might be possible to use such a work centre for persons who, under present conditions, would be committed to prison for non-payment of debts or non-payment of maintenance or bastardy orders and the like.  In 1930, 13,000 persons were sent to prison in England under civil process as debtors and over 2,000 were imprisoned by courts of summary jurisdiction for non-payment of rates or taxes.  I have no figures for this country.</P>
    <P>Habitual beggars might, possibly, also be sent to a work centre for compulsory labour for a period.  I fully recognise that the creation of such a work centre or centres presents many difficulties but it is surely a matter which might be usefully examined by a commission.  Another difficult problem is that of the treatment of persons who have been sent to prison again and again.  Clearly, the present system has <Col N="2144" /> failed in such cases.  Prison authorities say that, when a man is in prison for a second term, the prospect of his returning for another term is increased and that the tendency increases with every subsequent imprisonment.  One possible remedy might be an indeterminate sentence.  I believe that this is possible under the law in New Zealand and I understand that, in some states in the U.S.A., courts are permitted to impose the maximum sentence for the particular crime and that release then depends on the opinion formed by the prison authorities as to the prisoner's likelihood of good social behaviour in the future.  That might be open to abuse in certain cases.</P>
    <P>I am rather inclined to think that the indeterminate sentence may be the best remedy for persons who simply will not conform to the demands of society, as expressed by law.  This is at present the method adopted in the case of mental defectives and it may be that it would be the best way to deal with certain other cases whose presence in society may be a danger, such, for instance, as persons convicted of assaults on children or other sex offences.  The question of release might, perhaps, be dealt with, on the evidence of the governors of prisons, by a permanent committee, consisting mainly of judges, which would meet every three months.  That is, however, a detail.</P>
    <P>But, if the indeterminate sentence is to be adopted, it would require many safeguards and it could only be a success if our prisons were equipped for the effective correction and cure of such persons and if different classes could be wisely segregated and given suitable treatment according to-their needs.</P>
    <P>The problem of solitary confinement which, I think, was over-emphasised by Senator Duffy also requires examination. I was under the impression that the period of solitary confinement was restricted to a very short period under prison regulations, but it appears from statements made in the Dáil that I was wrong.  The effect of solitary confinement varies greatly with different persons.  The Taoiseach stated in the Dáil that he had been in solitary <Col N="2145" /> confinement and I can well believe that, with a person of his education, it might not do permanent harm.  But with persons of a certain type, I can well believe that long periods of solitary confinement might seriously upset their mental balance and render them not fully responsible for their actions.</P>
    <P>Before we talk too wildly about solitary confinement, it should be borne in mind that a great prison reformer, Elizabeth Fry, advocated solitary confinement as a method of getting away from the abuse whereby prisoners of the same sex were huddled together in a room under appalling conditions.  The single cell system was the result of her efforts and those of John Howard.  Of course, a thing which is desirable at one period may become an abuse.  There are many other matters to which I could refer but I shall not take up the time of the Seanad.  I think that I have said enough to show that a commission should be set up to inquire into our prison system.  That might be done now when there is general interest in the matter, including interest on the part of many people who have no sympathy with the particular case.  It could turn what is an unfortunate occurrence into what might be extremely useful.  I honestly believe that the Government would be wise in doing as I suggest. The commission could not get to work until the autumn.  I think I have said sufficient to show that, if a commission were set up, it would not lack useful subject matter for consideration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Campbell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to Senator Kingsmill Moore for giving way to me.  I will be as brief as I can <Col N="2146" /> in connection with this motion and amendment.  I support the amendment moved by Senator Douglas because, like him, I prefer to have the whole matter of prison administration dealt with in a general way rather than in the restricted way suggested in Senator Duffy's motion.</P>
      <P>I have been of opinion for some years that the time was ripe for some inquiry into the question of the prison system and prison administration in this country.  I do not say that because of any recent event that has occurred.  The Minister will recollect that in former years I put that to him. About a year and a half ago, accompanied by Alderman Peadar Doyle, Lord Mayor, I suggested that at some time the Minister might find it wise to go into the whole question of prison administration and the Minister said &ldquo;yes&rdquo; that when things were a bit lighter he might do that.  I think, as a result of this motion, the Minister has good grounds in the immediate future for setting up a commission to inquire into the whole subject of prison administration.  Prison administration so far as I learn of it is much different now from what it was under the old British régime.  I think it was the late Kevin O'Higgins who first introduced some reform in relation to treatment in prisons by the substitution of wire mattresses and indeed of mattresses themselves for the accommodation of prisoners rather than the plank beds that obtained before. In the prisons now the prisoner has this accommodation.  He has a wire mattress, a coir pillow and he is entitled to four blankets and gets additional blankets if required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister himself has introduced some additional benefiting reforms into the prison system.  Indeed, I imagine that the Minister was directly responsible for the riot that occurred in Mountjoy a year and a half ago. Ordinarily the prisoners were locked up at 4 o'clock, but the Minister, with that human and charitable attitude he has towards all humanity, decided that they should remain out until 7.30.  So far as my information goes, that extra time during which they were formerly locked up&mdash;the extra time given them by the Minister&mdash;was given over to <Col N="2147" /> agitation and the result of it was the riot occurred.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCampbell" hpid="Mr. Campbell Mr. Campbell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Campbell</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the Minister is responsible in any way for the defects that may have manifested themselves in the prison system.  That system was taken over, and the last Government, so far as they could, and the present Administration, tried to remedy the defects in that whole system.  There is a vast volume of opinion in existence in pamphlets and otherwise on the treatment of prisoners, and how crime should be dealt with and also on how juvenile crime should be dealt with.  Two very informative pamphlets on these questions have been published by the Statistical and Social Inquiry Society of Ireland.  Both were addresses by Sir Thomas Molony.  One was given in 1920, under the heading, I think, <i>The Prevention and Punishment of Crime,</i> and the other published on the 20th March, 1940, dealt with the punishment of offenders.  Anybody will find there plenty of suggestions and how prisoners should be dealt with and how crime should be dealt with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a few other observations I would like to make but the Chathaoirleach may decide that they are not relevant.  It is only through one's experience that one can give an accurate picture of prison life.  I have been a member of the visiting committee at Mountjoy for close on ten years.  I have seen prisoners from various aspects in that time, and from my experience of the whole period I think prison administration at the moment is one of the most humane you would get in any country in the world.  There are, of course, defects in the prison system.  Some prisons are out of date &mdash;the structures are out of date.  Provision for Borstal boys is antiquated altogether.  Last year I was in Cork attending a wages tribunal.  I had a few hours to spare and I went up to see the Borstal institute there.  I think the building is altogether unsuitable for the work the boys are engaged in and that boys should not be kept in a prison of that type.  Then there is the <Col N="2148" /> question of adequate cooking arrangements. I am not suggesting that the arrangements are not adequate in Mountjoy, but cooking facilities there are, in my opinion, antiquated.  They have big cauldrons in which the food is boiled, and I think the time has come when better facilities should be made available.  Food can only be boiled there and without going into the relevant merits of boiling and roasting I think that prisoners should be allowed to have roast meat on occasions.  I usually spend most of Christmas Day at Mountjoy, and it is pathetic to see them boil the meat first and then half-roast it in the same cauldron.  These are things which a commission might take into consideration. I want to say this, too, that more humane treatment could not be given than in my experience has been operated by the Governor of Mountjoy and his sub-officers.  It is really pathetic to see the efforts they make to be humane to the prisoners.  I have seen prisoners of all kinds in Mountjoy. I have seen them do the ordinary day's work.  I have seen prisoners under sentence of death, I have seen them on hunger strike and I have seen political prisoners incarcerated in Mountjoy.  The ordinary prisoner apparently was very fond of Mountjoy. I meet them alternately in Mountjoy one fortnight and the next fortnight they may touch me out in town.  A fortnight after that and they will be back in Mountjoy again. Yesterday I had the experience of one prisoner telling me that Mountjoy was the best hotel in the country.</P>
    <P>I happened to go to Mountjoy yesterday to make a visit and was told that by a notorious character.  I know that the attitude of the governor and his assistants there towards these people is very fair.  I could tell many funny stories about prisons.  I asked a very high officer there, now transferred to another prison, about a prisoner, once particularly prominent in O'Connell Street in rags, and said: &ldquo;Have you seen that man recently?&rdquo; He said: &rdquo;I met him last week in North King Street, and I suggested that he ought to come up to us and we would clean him up and give him a fortnight's rest.&rdquo;  That is no story, but actually <Col N="2149" /> happened with one of the officials there, and I mention it to indicate the kindly attitude of the prison administration towards those unfortunate people who, probably through no fault of their own but through the social system and the economic system under which we live, are compelled to have resort to criminal activities.  If they got a decent chance in life, they would not be there at all.</P>
    <P>I have seen prisoners under sentence of death.  I made it a point, on many occasions in the last ten years, to spend half an hour with men under sentence of death, the night before they were executed, and these men, at that rather sad stage of their lives, are sometimes very frank.  I remember one prisoner telling me how much he appreciated the kindness of the governor in having his own dinner with him the week before he died.  In order to give him a change from the ordinary prison fare, he had had food brought from his own table.  I hope the Minister will not take punitive action against the governor for that, as it was done out of goodness and kindness of heart.  I have seen warders almost in tears the night before an execution. These are the things that really count.</P>
    <P>Senator Duffy referred to these officials as being very stony-hearted types of persons.  I hope I am not doing him an injustice in saying that.  I mention these points to show the kindness shown to those people in the terrible position they are in.  I have seen prisoners on hunger strike and have noted the concern shown by every member of the prison staff, who prayed that the men might go off hunger strike.  No one likes hunger strikes, whether of long or of short duration. I have been speaking to these men, trying to induce them to take food and have also seen men in the big hunger strike of 1940, when those unfortunate men, Anthony Darcy and Sean McNeela, died.  The Minister for Defence asked me to proceed to Arbour Hill on Good Friday night to see these men.  I did so and did what I was asked to do.  The action that resulted in my visit to Arbour Hill at that time was initiated by Deputy Norton.  Having fulfilled my mission, I <Col N="2150" /> spent a half-hour with those men and noted the efforts that had been made by the prison authorities in the matter, to make them most comfortable in the unfortunate position in which they found themselves.  They were in beds in a large room, well heated, and everything possible was done to make the road easier for them.  My efforts were futile in inducing them to go off hunger strike.  It is no pleasure to see any one dying on hunger strike, whether he be a political or a civil prisoner.</P>
    <P>I mention these incidents because they appear to me to be more important than the allegations thrown around without much foundation. There is not much evidence there that a sadistic attitude is adopted towards those prisoners.  In view of the statements made in the Press and made from platforms recently, I must say that there is no evidence that these prisons are run on the lines of Belsen camps.  Having regard to the facts and to the few incidents I have given here this evening, it is clear that they are run on most humane and Christian lines, although there has been considerable propaganda in recent years in respect to the treatment meted out to prisoners.</P>
    <P>It was my duty, a year or two ago, to give evidence following the riot in Mountjoy Prison.  I gave evidence along with the Lord Mayor of Dublin, Chairman of the Visiting Committee of Mountjoy, and incidentally it was following the riot that Christmas Day intervened.  I gave my experiences on the Christmas Day following the riot, when I asked about 60 or 70 prisoners if they had any complaints to make. Only one prisoner made a complaint&mdash; or, rather, he said: &ldquo;There is no use in making complaints to you.&rdquo;  In a book subsequently published, it was made to appear that that point of view was expressed by all the prisoners, whereas it was in striking contrast to the 69 or 70 who said they had no complaint to make.  That is the type of propaganda one is experiencing in recent times and one can see from what I say how false it is.</P>
    <P>I am glad that Senator Duffy has accepted&mdash;as I think he has&mdash;the amendment proposed by Senator <Col N="2151" /> Douglas.  It would clear the air a lot if there were an inquiry into the whole system of prison life.  I can give only my own views and I have tried to be as impartial as I can.  I have seen no evidence of hostility or harsh treatment. I was in the workshops yesterday and happened to comment to the official who showed me round about &ldquo;the babel of noise.&rdquo;  We could hardly hear one another.  Incidentally, there were a few groups of prisoners here and there standing around, much in the same way as we stand in the anteroom here.  As far as my experience of prison life goes, there is no justification for the allegation of any harsh treatment on the part of officials, nor is there any evidence that the prison is run on the lines of a Belsen camp or anything approximating to that.  I have no political axe to grind in stating these facts.</P>
    <P>Senator Duffy referred to what, I think, he described as the abominable clothes worn by the prisoners.  I do not know how he arrived at that conclusion. The clothes, certainly, have not a Savile Row cut, but I think the clothes supplied to the prisoners in Mountjoy are suitable for the work on which they are engaged.  For one thing, the prison has to be kept clean, and let me say that it is immaculately clean, notwithstanding all the statements that have been made by other people.  That has been my experience, and as a member of the visiting committee I visit the prison very frequently. There is no justification whatever for the allegation that the clothes supplied to the prisoners are abominable.  As I say, they have not a a Saville Row cut.  I think Senator Duffy said that they were all cut to the one size.  They are not; they are cut to various sizes.  I venture to say that there are many people engaged in various occupations in Dublin at the present time who would be very glad to have suits of the material that is supplied to these prisoners.  At the present time, one would probably pay £12 12s. for a suit that would not be made up of as good material.  I venture to say that the material that is used in the clothes in Mountjoy is not of a bad type.  I hold in my hand a <Col N="2152" /> pattern of a suit which I picked up in Mountjoy yesterday.  There is nothing abominable about a suit made from that material.</P>

      <P>The question of close confinement has been mentioned.  I have been for ten years on the visiting committee to Mountjoy Prison.  During that period I have never known a prisoner, guilty of any infraction of the regulations, who has ever been unjustly punished by way of close confinement.  I understand that, last year, 15 sentences of close confinement were imposed by the governor on prisoners in Mountjoy, the sentences ranging from one day to three days.  The visiting committee may impose a sentence of 14 days, but I think the maximum sentence which the governor is allowed to impose on a person in prison is three days.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCampbell" hpid="Mr. Campbell Mr. Campbell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Campbell</NameTxt>
      <P>My information is that, even in the case of repeated offences, the maximum sentence which the governor may impose on a prisoner <Col N="2153" /> is three days' close confinement.  The visiting committee, as I say, may impose a sentence of 14 days' close confinement. The prisoners do not serve a sentence of 14 days' close confinement. Three days is the maximum they will serve.  When a prisoner has served three days' close confinement, he must then return to the ordinary prison regulations for three days, at the end of which he serves another three days of close confinement.  He goes back again under the ordinary regulations and finally serves two days. In other words, instead of serving 14 days' close confinement, he does eight days' close confinement at intervals. That is my information and the Minister will correct me if I am wrong. During my period, the visiting justices to Mountjoy have only imposed two sentences of close confinement.  All the other sentences of that kind were imposed by the governor, according to the regulations and these do not exceed, as I said, beyond three days.</P>
      <P>My information is that there were only 15 cases of that kind last year, and that the period of close confinement in these cases ranged from one day to three days, and that in a prison holding from 350 to 400 prisoners. These figures do not indicate that any very great punitive measures are applied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question, of course, always arises as to what punishment should be inflicted for an infraction of the rules. Is it suggested that the prisoners are to go free?  I have not considered the matter sufficiently to be able to say what punishment should be imposed instead of close confinement.  Senator Duffy may have thought that out.  I have not.  I am simply speaking here from the experience I have gained from going to Mountjoy as a member of the visiting committee.  Discipline has to be maintained in prisons, and if there is any other punishment that might be inflicted for an infraction of the rules instead of close confinement, I do not know what it is.  If there are members of the House who have any suggestions to make on that, perhaps they would make them to the Administration which is charged with responsibility for maintaining these prisons and for looking after the welfare of the prisoners. <Col N="2154" /> If Senator Duffy knows how that matter should be dealt with, I certainly would like to hear him tell us what he thinks should be done.  If there is any other punishment instead of close confinement, that might be a matter for consideration by a commission.  If the Minister were to set up one it might suggest various methods for dealing with infractions of the rules.</P>
    <P>I rose merely for the purpose of giving a few facts and figures in relation to the whole question of the administration.  I have seen prisoners from all grades and conditions of life. From what I have seen, I think that no charge could be levelled against the Administration that any effort has been made to impose harsh penalties on prisoners.  With regard to the statement made by Senator Duffy that sometimes a prisoner might be brought before the visiting committee, and that the governor might adopt the attitude that this was an impossible cur that must be tied up, I must say that I have never seen a manifestation of any such attitude on the part of any of the officials in Mountjoy Prison.</P>
    <P>I am sorry that Senator Duffy should think that that would be the approach of any Irishman, no matter what his creed or politics might be, to any unfortunate man placed in his charge.  I have seen these prisoners in their cells. I have seen them at exercise, and if you like I have enjoyed their conversation on Christmas mornings.  I like to go up to Mountjoy on Christmas morning and spend from four to five hours with the prisoners.  The attitude that I adopt towards them is this: &ldquo;there go I but for the grace of God.&rdquo;  I like to fraternise with them on a Christmas morning.</P>
    <P>I must certainly say that I never at any time experienced harsh treatment or heard any suggestion of harsh treatment of any one in an Irish prison.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>

      <P>I am dealing with Senator Duffy's statement and I am saying to the House that I never saw an attitude like the one he described, in prison.  I am trying to speak on this motion in an objective way in the hope that the Minister will set up a commission of inquiry.  I agree with everything Senator Douglas has said&mdash;there will have to be a new approach to the question of punishment and the reform of prisoners.  Senator Douglas is perhaps more aware than I am of the various methods that could be used to produce that desirable result.  Senator Duffy made a reference to the Minister for Justice's evening meal given to the prisoners in Irish prisons&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am speaking only of Mountjoy.  I do not know of Portlaoighise, but I was in Mountjoy yesterday evening when the evening meal was being prepared.  I tasted the bread and the jam.  It was plum and apple jam, what the ordinary worker cannot often get outside.  Outside you have to do with the ordinary mixed jam.  I examined the empty jar and I saw the bread being jammed.  It was served with cocoa at 7.30 to the prisoners in their cells when they come in from the late exercise which the Minister allows them.  What applies in Portlaoighise must apply also in Mountjoy.</P>
      <P>I want to get rid of the idea that there is any sadistic attitude adopted towards prisoners in the jail I know of&mdash;Mountjoy prison.  I am sorry these references are made in the Press and on the platforms.  I think it is doing the country no good.  I know there are political considerations which I do not want to enter into, but I do not belong to any political party now, and I do not wish to make party capital.  I have given my experience and if the Minister sets up a commission, something good will be achieved.  I think the Minister is anxious to do the right thing by all prisoners coming under the jurisdiction of his Department and I make these comments for the purpose of reinforcing the request made by Senators Douglas and Hayes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kingsmill Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I anticipated it would be difficult to conclude this debate without a certain amount of misrepresentation both within and outside the House and no matter how carefully any speaker chooses his words, there will be a temptation to assign him motives, either party, political or personal, which were entirely foreign to his mind; and for that reason I was both tempted and urged not to intervene in this debate.</P>
      <P>But, when any subject involving crime and punishment is raised in a great deliberative Assembly such as this, there is a weighty responsibility thrown upon those members of the Assembly who happen to be lawyers, and there is an even greater and more special responsibility if they are lawyers who have had some experience of the practical working of the criminal side of the law.</P>
      <P>On the one hand, lawyers are part of the machinery of law and order.  Their training, their bent, their interest and their outlook all combine to make them supporters of law and order, and to law and order they almost universally subscribe.  But there is another side.  The intense and concentrated study which it is necessary for a defending counsel to give his brief, combined with the opportunities, few though they may be, that are vouchsafed to him of having interviews with the man he is to defend, must give him an insight into the mind and character of that person which is denied alike to prosecuting counsel and to the judge. And I affirm that no lawyer worth his salt where an adverse verdict has been brought in and a sentence of imprisonment has been imposed, can avoid speculating, and speculating with anxiety, on the effect that the Procrustean bed of prison discipline is going to have on that man, that human being, that individual combination of body and soul and spirit with whom he has been in contact and whom he has defended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That man, not that criminal class&mdash; it is sheer mental looseness which has slipped into common language, to talk of the criminal class or of the criminal classes.  Each criminal is as much a separate and a God-made combination <Col N="2157" /> as anybody in this House and to subject them all to one unvarying, undiscriminating and undistinguished discipline is a thing which stands self condemned at the very opening.  I have said it is impossible to speak of a criminal class or of criminal classes, but it is convenient to make a rough classification for the purpose of showing how wrong is the common outlook and common rigidity of prison discipline.</P>
    <P>There is, first of all, the professional criminal, the hardened criminal, the old lag, and he forms one class which should obviously be dealt with by itself and in a separate prison.  There is, secondly, the person who from weakness of mind, of character and sometimes of body, has succumbed to his passions or his temptations, perhaps on the one occasion which is not likely to be repeated.  Lastly, you have a third mixed class, a class composed partly of people with a natural taste for risk and adventure who are about as likely to end up as merchant princes and financiers as they are in the dock&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="TheodoreMoore" hpid="Mr. Kingsmill Moore Mr. Kingsmill Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kingsmill Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>Indeed, now that you remind me, I could give you various names from past times&mdash;but in this third class are also idealists who from early surroundings, wrong reading and wrong training have merely become a cog in a machine from which they cannot escape, and have found themselves involved in crime.  Those three classes, I am convinced, should be considered separately and dealt with separately.  I do not wish the House to imagine I am falling into the error of assuming that that class can be exactly equated with the class of political criminal.  I believe that a large proportion, a very large proportion, do fall into that class, but not all that class are political offenders, and I recognise frankly and fully that you may also find in the other classes of professional criminals and the weaklings, people who came to prison because of a particular political offence.  It must be clear that the need in dealing with these <Col N="2158" /> people is a certain amount of elasticity and individualisation.  I look forward to the time when there will be more prisons and smaller and when you may be able to suit the prison to the prisoner&mdash;to send him to the type which is most suited for his offence. The time has long since come when there should be attached to the prison not merely a doctor and clergyman but an expert in psychiatry and mental treatment.  People smile at that.  It is an experiment which has been in operation in England for some time.  At least one report has been produced by the Home Office, which I have read, and I think that there is another.</P>
      <P>It does strike me as strange that a suggestion of that kind should be received with a smile.  It is an excellent example of the rigidity which the prison system is imposing on the minds of those who have to operate it.  That is the chief cause of the troubles which we have had during the past few months.  I have pointed out that all these classes are subject to uniform discipline and uniform punishments.  That is not a quite correct way of stating the position, because there is in the judge who sentences a power of discretion as regards the nature of the punishment.  I do not know whether an attempt is being made deliberately to put me off&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="TheodoreMoore" hpid="Mr. Kingsmill Moore Mr. Kingsmill Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kingsmill Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I was observing that it was necessary to have some kind of conception of the elements which go to the conception of punishment. It is pretty well recognised that there are three&mdash;the deterrent element, the reformatory element and the <Col N="2160" /> element of vengeance.  Senators may be surprised to hear me say that there is an element of vengeance in this, a Christian, country, familiar with the text, &ldquo;Vengeance is mine and I will repay.&rdquo;  But it is true.  Not only is it true but I am prepared to admit that, in present conditions all over the world, it is, to a certain degree, necessary. The punishment awarded to a prisoner represents, in some part, the outraged sense of justice of the community.  Unless that element was observed, there would be a danger that, for the process of law, you would have substituted private vengeance.</P>
      <P>I admit that that element is, to a certain degree, necessary but I am desirous that that element should be reduced to its minimum.  I am in hopes that, by the use of intelligence and elasticity, it will be possible to abolish it almost entirely.  I call attention to that because I do not wish it to be suggested that I am, or anybody else is, indulging in completely false humanitarianism, that I do not accept to the full the necessity of law and order or that I do not endorse entirely the necessity of prison discipline.  That does not mean that I endorse any prison discipline.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that I should be burking the issue if I did not deal with a question which has considerably agitated, perplexed and perturbed the public&mdash;that is, this question of solitary confinement.  It is true, and should be stated, that solitary confinement was first introduced by prison reformers because it was thought it would have a reformatory effect on the prisoner.  It was considered that, in the silence, his conscience might work yeastily and bring him to a sense of his faults.  It was tried out in the Walnut Prison, in Philadelphia, and in the Eastern Penitentiary.  Unfortunately, the experiment showed by its statistics that it was more successful in producing insanity than reform.  I am quoting a neutral authority in saying that.  It and the similar Auburn system in New York fell into disrepute. We thus come to a period by no means marked by human considerations&mdash;the period about 1826 when innumerable crimes were punishable by death, when <Col N="2161" /> floggings were being daily carried out in the army and the navy and when an Act of that year made provision for flogging, for the treadmill, the hulks and transportation.  It was not, therefore, with false or flabby sentiment or humanitarianism that the authors of that Act went into the matter and made a number of rules which are statutory rules, still unrepealed, to deal with solitary confinement.</P>
    <P>One of the rules has been referred to already&mdash;that every prisoner should have two hours' exercise in the open air.  Under another rule, the maximum amount of solitary confinement which could be imposed by the officials of the prison was three days and by a justice, after a sworn inquiry, one month.  That was the attitude in 1826 when it was realised that there were serious dangers in the infliction of punishment of that nature.  That is still the actual limitation of periods in convict prisons, though they are administered under a completely different Act&mdash;the Convict Prison Act, 1854.  In ordinary prisons, the period has been cut down to a fortnight, imposed after a sworn inquiry by the Prisons Board, and 24 hours imposable by the governor.  Subject to what the Minister for Justice may say, the prison rules which were made under the amending Prison Act of 1877 and which, rightly or wrongly, were also applied to convict prisons&mdash;I think the 1894 rules are still of effect&mdash;were made under a statute which stated that no rule could be made which transgressed in any respect the provisions set out in Section 109 of the Act of 1826. The Minister will find in Section 12 of the General Prisons (Ireland) Act, 1877, that no rule is to be made by the General Prisons Board inconsistent with any of the regulations contained in Section 109 of the 1826 Act.  If he looks at the 1826 Act, he will see that it is required that every prisoner, whether in solitary confinement or not, has two hours' exercise.</P>
    <P>The Minister himself has admitted that it is altogether impossible to get hold of these regulations.  On an occasion when I had to consult them in connection with a criminal cause, I had to get a copy specially from <Col N="2162" /> England.  I speak subject to correction. Nor does it matter much, for the only reason I am calling attention to this matter of solitary confinement is to show the attitude of the Legislature as to the maximum periods which could be imposed, and it is not very important to me whether those were three days or a fortnight or a month because it has been recognised now and events have shown that the reformatory effect of this punishment is nil, that its deterrent effect is negligible, but its vindictive or punitive effect may be disastrous.  It is also exceedingly uneven in its operation.  A misanthrope or a philosopher may welcome it.  A man with a well-stored mind like the Minister for Justice, would find it perfectly tolerable, but the ordinary rather garrulous human being who gives and takes much from human contacts may find it intolerable.  Therefore, I accept the view of the Legislature, now 120 years old, that the maximum period which can be imposed as a punishment in any circumstances is a maximum period of a month, and that even so it must be combined with the two hours' exercise.  Now, if that was the view of the Legislature as to its imposition as punishment, we must be scrupulous and eagle-eyed to see that what cannot be done as a legal punishment is not achieved adventitiously, as it were, by a side-wind, and that not only should we avoid making it a reason or an excuse that it is a natural consequence of a prisoner's own action, but we should be certain that solitary confinement for long periods, however it has arisen, must be avoided unless it is the absolute and inevitable consequence of the prisoner's action.</P>
    <P>Now, I concede at once, and without any baiting, that the action of a prisoner may make solitary confinement for him inevitable.  I agree and concede that prison discipline must be maintained but I do not either agree or concede that the circumstances which have been so forcibly brought before us recently or the actions of the prisoner made solitary confinement inevitable or that prison discipline required that it should be brought about. If a prisoner refuses to leave his cell that is his own look-out.  If he exercises <Col N="2163" /> in clothes which are draughty and gets cold, that is his own look-out.  If, on leaving his cell, he always attacks his warders, he should be put in irons and kept in his cell.  But the reason which is alleged why men were in solitary confinement without exercise for periods varying from 21 months to three years is that the clothing was not orthodox.  It is alleged it was not decent and therefore they could not be allowed out.  I am informed, and again I speak subject to correction by those individuals concerned who will have more accurate information, I am informed that what they were was a blanket round their top and another round their middle.  A costume not so very different from that of the old Greeks and Egyptians and from that of the greater part of Asia, a costume which is a great deal more decent than that which photographs show Mr. Gandhi wearing when he was going to the Viceroy's conference.  In one of these Mr. Gandhi wore a similar costume, a kind of blanket material over his shoulders and another around his waist.  In another, he wore a loin cloth.  Is it suggested that any person in Ireland dressed in the way I have described is so indecent that he cannot be allowed out?  I may say, that if that is the reason, it is a puerile reason.  It has been suggested by an easy and swift transition which reminded me somewhat of the tricks of a magician upon the stage, that it was necessary for prison discipline.  Now these are the two reasons&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kingsmill Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister evidently agrees with what I have suggested. I have conceded that prison discipline must be maintained and that it is an essential thing.  I have pointed out that I think it is a very desirable thing that the prison system should be so altered as to make it more elastic <Col N="2164" /> and while it must be maintained it must be maintained by methods not disproportionate to the offence.  Now the offence in this particular case was a refusal to wear the prison clothes. It could be punished by No. 2 diet, by deprivation of letters and by deprivation of visits.  I think these together would form a fairly adequate punishment for a person who objects to wearing prison clothes.  But it was suggested that what was involved was the necessity of creating a state of affairs or if not creating, allowing to mount up a state of affairs in which they were kept locked up in their cells in solitary confinement for these long periods. Now, is that so?  There is punishment for their lack of discipline in the ways I have suggested.  If you think that their costume is going to a fect the risible faculties of the other prisoners employ two extra warders at the expense of the State and give them their exercise in the open air at a time when other prisoners are not exercising.</P>
      <P>Is not that a solution which would appeal to anybody?  Are there not half a dozen other solutions like that? Why were they not adopted?  There is a tendency among people when things go wrong to blame individuals. The governor has been blamed.  The Minister for Justice has been blamed and the Taoiseach has been blamed. They have been accused of inhumanity. May I say this: I have made very careful inquiries from a great number of sources in regard to the Governor of Portlaoighise from people who have been in there, from people who have visited it, from people who were interested in criminal reform some years ago, and who studied the matter in Portlaoighise, and from people who have met him in ordinary social life in the town and the opinion is unanimous that the Governor of Portlaoigishe is an exceptionally humane man.  The Minister for Justice we know; and I do not think we are going to accept readily the suggestion that it was any inhumanity on his part which induced this condition of affairs which could have been solved so easily over that period of three years.  We know the Taoiseach to be a humane man.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2165" /> What is the explanation?  I have rejected the explanation of inhumanity and there is only one other explanation open as to why this thing mounted up like a storm could of a nature such that any peasant could tell you what is going to happen.  It is because of this system which is so rigid and so inelastic that it imposed upon the minds of those who operate it, from the governor to the Minister, a similar rigidity and a similar inelasticity.  The minds of the governor and the mind of the Minister were in prison to the prison system because of its uniform character, without the possibility of relaxation and without the possibility of treating the matter in a way an ordinary business man would deal with trouble which he saw arising in his staff.</P>
    <P>That is the reason why I am pressing so strongly for a commission to be set up to examine this system and see whether it cannot be made more individualised and more elastic.  I believe&mdash;and in fact though I blame no one I blame the system&mdash;that humanity has been made subservient to prestige. I believe strongly that owing to the system, firmness has been confused with obduracy.  I realise that the Minister when he comes to reply, if he takes any notice of what I have said, may perhaps complain not that my speech was too political but that it was too little political, and that in approaching these matters from the point of view of human beings who are being punished for wrong doings, and who must be punished with wisdom and moderation and must be stopped from their excesses, I am ignoring the political element which would be present to the Minister's mind and the political repercussions which might have occurred if he had done as I suggest he should have done, and met the matter earlier by an elastic alteration of the system.</P>
    <P>The Minister may say that I am a political babe in the wood, and if the Minister does say that I will not deny it.  Rather will I accept the name and attempt to make it a reality because it does seem to me that the perfectly legitimate enthusiasms, manoeuvres, <Col N="2166" /> friendships and excitements of political life, especially of Party political life, may tend to obscure the vision for wider things, not merely preventing the wood being seen because of the trees but allowing the wood to get in the way of wider visions of further horizons.  There is a precedent for assuming that things are sometimes hidden from the wise and visible to babes.  I do feel, and I would not be treating the House fairly if I did not say this, that in this case over-prudence and over-wisdom prevented the Minister from seeing this state of affairs mounting up in time to meet it.</P>
    <P>I believe that humanity is a greater thing than the preservation of a mere framework and pattern of prison discipline. I believe that prison discipline should be carried not one inch further than is absolutely necessary and that it should be tempered by understanding of idealism and the stupidity of the person with whom you are dealing; that obstinacy should not be met with obstinacy.</P>

      <P>I am most obliged to the Senator, not for the first occasion.  I was coming on to that, and I wanted to point out that the Minister himself whom I have entirely absolved from any question of inhumanity, did realise that what I am now saying is right, that he made a change in 1943, that he allowed a relaxation by allowing prisoners to meet, but he did not take the further step of allowing them to exercise in the open air as I think they were entitled to by statute.  Therefore, the Minister realised in 1943 that these matters which he rejected as being unsuitable to prison discipline in 1940 were possible three years later.  The only complaint I make is that it took him three years to come to that conclusion which, if he had not been conscientiously blinded by his outlook he might have come to before.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2167" /> I want to ask the Minister to forget that he is the Minister for Justice for a few moments and be that Gerry Boland whom we all know.  I want him to forget that he is here in the Seanad and to place himself, mentally, in his own chair by his own fire thinking, thinking, thinking, as I know he must have thought as to whether a mistake was not made.  I want him to remember that though very different by outlook and traditions he and I are both Irishmen who are interested in the welfare and the future of this country.</P>
    <P>I want him to make the resolve that if he and others were blinded and misled by the fact that our prison system at the present moment is not sufficiently elastic that he will determine that what he must now realise is largely a mistake shall not occur again, and that in order to help him and to help all of us he will employ the best brains and the best efforts that can be made to investigate as to whether we cannot make this system one in which the contretemps that happened will not happen again.</P>
    <P>The past has gone and we have to face the future, a future in which we are going to make more mistakes but let us not make the same mistake now that we recognise it as such.  Let us put into effect at the earliest time without any considerations as to whether prestige is involved or whether it is going to be sacrificed, this commission so that we can do our best as human beings for human beings.</P>
    <P>I do not apologise for reminding Senators that the men in the prisons are their own brothers, closer allied by ties of friendship, blood and traditions, outlook and history than are realised.  I appeal to the Minister and to Senators to pass the amendment to this motion which I am accepting as Senator Duffy accepted it to help us, the Minister, the Government and the prisoners.</P>

      <P>It is a pity that the motion was proposed.  The amendment was proposed by Senator Douglas with a very good motive and he intimated that he would prefer another time rather than the present for the introduction of the suggestions he made.  I understand that probably he would not have brought in the amendment were it not that the motion had been set down. I saw that the Minister listened very attentively to the suggestions he made and no doubt he was giving them very deep and careful consideration.  His suggestions were very good and very fine.  It was difficult to speak on this motion without bringing in outside matters, but it would be very unfortunate that matters would be introduced which would lead to the encouragement of the recent occurrences, which led to a very serious matter.  I do not think that any Senator consciously would like to make statements which would tend to show that he was giving such encouragement, but I think it was a pity that some of the statements made here to-day were made.</P>
      <P>Senator Douglas dealt entirely with the question of what may be considered in the matter of prison reform and I imagine the Minister will give that careful consideration.  If the motion were withdrawn and the amendment postponed for a period of six months, it would give the Minister time to consider whether he could not carry out some of the suggestions put forward in the amendment; and also whether an amendment might be necessary after the lapse of that time or whether he would like to be fortified and strengthened, on the suggestion contained in the amendment, by certain expert advice he may be able to obtain. I suggest that the motion be withdrawn and that the amendment stand by itself and be adjourned for a period of six months.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the House can accept that the purpose of Senator Kingsmill Moore's speech was, in the main, to support the amendment.  My view about this matter is the view I have about any matter that concerns any scheme which we have in operation as part of our machinery of government, when it requires consideration with a view to possible reform. Quite a few members of this House as well as of the other House have very vivid personal experiences of our prison system.  I think that Senator O'Dea, Senator Hayes and the Minister, have had them.  I will always remember my first impression on going into Kilmainham first and when I passed on to Mountjoy.  My immediate reaction was that, if we ever succeeded in getting power, the first thing we had to do was to set out on a scheme of prison reform.  It is true that, in those days, there were a great many political prisoners, but there were many other prisoners also.</P>
      <P>I mixed in the main with the political prisoners, but for a short period I had the privilege of going around amongst the &ldquo;drunks,&rdquo; people on remand, and so on; and it was a very interesting study.  I saw young lads&mdash;I cannot just picture to-day what age they might have been&mdash;many of whom looked as if they never had half enough to eat and never got any real chance in life.  When you went on parade or exercise&mdash;and unless my memory had completely gone, we got that for only one hour out of the 24 and were thus 23 hours in solitary confinement&mdash;I know that, if you left your cell door ajar, anything you valued, no matter how trifling, was taken by some of those little beggars on their way out or on their way in and you did not find it in your cell when you went back.  Some of them were in on punishment, others were going to be tried, but you could not help feeling that, from the point of view of punishment, it did not seem to be a very purposeful scheme and, from the point of view of improvement or reform, it was absolutely hopeless.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am told that the Minister has made improvements.  I have no patience at all with people who tell us that the men in control are not the essence of humanity.  It is simply impossible <Col N="2170" /> to be amongst human beings of the type in prison and not have one's highest sense of humanitarianism stirred very intensely.  No matter how one's humanitarian instincts are stirred, a humanitarian approach has to be made to this problem.  It is really a scientific approach and, with all respect to what we may have done and what changes the Minister and his officials may have brought about, I have no knowledge of any effort having been made towards a scientific study of our prison problems.  I agree absolutely with Senator Kingsmill Moore, when he referred to the necessity for having a specialist on mental disease on some council in relation to the administration of our prison system.  I wonder if the Minister invited, say, the distinguished Father Flanagan of Boys' Town to come and talk with him and go to the prison, and hear his views, what he would suggest.  I have made some inquiries from people interested and my information, in regard to sending people to prison, is that when they go in twice or thrice they are getting further and further from the possibilities of reform.  Quite a number of such prisoners are a definite product of the particular kind of social order that exists at present.</P>
    <P>There is no use in ignoring or blinding ourselves to that fact.  In a way it is the foundation of a fair amount of the mental disease which breeds crime in the country.  If we could make improvements in that direction we would probably have less crime.  To think for one moment that, when those people get into prison, they are absolutely beyond reform would be almost tantamount to this: that one did not believe in the Redemption.  There is a moral obligation on the State&mdash;it is the responsibility of Ministers and of every individual with human instincts&mdash;to make every effort and to struggle to the fullest extent possible by the scientific study of this problem and by every other means available, to reform those who have drifted from the path of rectitude on to the path of crime.</P>
    <P>I have a certain amount of sympathy with the Minister in the position in which he finds himself this afternoon. No doubt, if Senator Duffy had not put <Col N="2171" /> down this motion the amendment would not be before us.  But the question has been raised and has been discussed in a calmer atmosphere than the Minister experienced in the other House.  I do not see why the members of this House should put this matter from them now.  Personally, I see no reason why the House should not be prepared to take a decision on it.  We know that it is the responsibility of the Minister to stand for the maintenance of law and order.  The responsibility for maintaining peace is his primarily.  This House has never hesitated to give him the support that he felt he needed to do that.  The fact that his position to-day is a strong one should enable him to take a decision on this matter.</P>
    <P>It does not make any difference what efforts are made to misrepresent the decision.  There is a wider and perhaps a more urgent problem than the immediate one before us to be considered. There are hundreds and hundreds who have committed offences. I do not know the number in our prisons to-day, but you have them as well as the potential criminals of the future.  That raises a much wider problem than the one we are discussing.</P>
    <P>I urge on the Minister that the right line for him to take, no matter what people may say, is to accept the amendment.  Senator O'Dea suggested that the matter should be adjourned for six months.  I suggest that, if you do that, people will say: &ldquo;You knew that it was the right thing to do to-day but you were afraid to do it because of what So-and-so would say.&rdquo; If it is right to do a thing in six months' time it is surely more justifiable to do it now.  If the Minister accepts the amendment to-day, I believe the effect of it will be, as Senator Kingsmill Moore has said, to broaden the horizon and to lift up men's minds to the fact that there are hundreds of other people in prison about whom there is very little discussion, human beings with souls and minds as well as bodies.  Consideration for them is a matter of prime importance to all of us.  The Minister has as much responsibility towards them as he has towards <Col N="2172" /> the other prisoners.  I hope the Minister will see his way to accept the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCrosbie" hpid="Mr. Crosbie Mr. Crosbie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crosbie</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope very sincerely that the Minister will not be adamant in the remark he made at the beginning of this debate, and that he will consider accepting Senator Douglas's amendment.  I am not very deeply interested in what happened recently in Cork or in the alleged grievances of people who have committed crimes and claim immunity for their acts on political grounds.  I am, however, interested in those who are not, as Senator Kingsmill Moore has said, of the criminal classes.  There is one period in the life of the potential criminal when he or she may be saved, and that is when the first offence is committed. Judges are very reluctant to send first offenders to jail, particularly if they are young people.</P>
      <P>I think that probably the most difficult task that faces a judge is when he has to make up his mind as to whether or not he will send a young offender to prison.  I think the most urgent reform in our prison system that could be brought about would be the setting up of a separate institution or prison for young offenders sentenced to a term of imprisonment.  Under no circumstances should such offenders be allowed to put their foot even for one night inside a prison where there are hardened criminals.  That is my principal reason for supporting the amendment and for urging the Minister, at whatever cost, to accept it and to set up this commission of inquiry.  That commission might, amongst other things, consider that aspect of prison reform as one of very great urgency.</P>

      <P>Senator Douglas, in dealing with the motion, made the remark that if there was any inhumanity to be displayed by anybody it was the Minister who ought to display it because the motion sets out that solitary confinement &ldquo;is inhuman and therefore indefensible,&rdquo; and that it is only the Minister could sanction it.  I am not going to run away from my responsibilities, and I am not going to apologise.  I object to being spoken to from an eminence by <Col N="2173" /> Senator Kingsmill Moore.  I can tell the Senator and everybody else that I take as much interest in human beings, in those who have fallen low, as any man in the country does.  I have always done so.  I never thought that I would be put in the position of being Minister for Justice responsible for keeping people in prison.  I cannot say the amount of personal pain which that gives me.  Nevertheless, I am not going to apologise.  I am not going to shed my responsibility or share it with anybody.</P>
      <P>I am responsible, and if I have any apologise to make for my treatment of these seven or eight people, my apology is that I wavered at all&mdash;that I did not do what the last Government did in similar circumstances.  These are not ordinary people.  They are out to wreck the State.  They are not a bit repentant, not one of them.  They still claim they had the right to do what they did.  They are determined to break up our present system, and I am determined not to let them.  That is my final word.  We are told this is an opportune time for an inquiry. I hold that it is inopportune.</P>

      <P>I know.  I was asked a question in the Dail on this very point three years ago, about 1943.  Why did not somebody put down the motion then?  No one did it.  Why?  Just because this campaign I referred to in the Dáil was not ready for launching, the time was not opportune for launching it.  I am not going to accuse any Senator or member of the Dáil of being a knowing participant in such a campaign, but the campaign is here, lined up and well planned.  It is a campaign with a very definite object, as I explained in the other House at length, and if I were to agree to setting up a commission, I know what would be the result of it at this time. I certainly would do no such thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said in the other House, when I found myself Minister for Justice, I was very reluctant to take up that position, the position in which I found myself.  But, I said to myself &ldquo;I am going to do what I can to relieve the position of the unfortunate people in the ordinary prisons as ordinary <Col N="2174" /> prisoners.  We have heard from Senator Campbell, who has ten years' experience of Mountjoy, what the conditions are there.  All I have to say is that Portlaoighise, where the long-sentence prisoners are kept, is much better than Mountjoy both in lay-out of the prison itself and the space available.</P>
    <P>My responsibility is that I am not going to let the prisoners in Portlaoighise or anywhere else run the prison.  That is the problem at issue. I saw this thing coming when the man referred to was sent down there.  He was hardly out of his condemned cell in Mountjoy when he caused a riot.  Then when he was sent to Portlaoighise, he started a row and it became the question from that moment whether he and his party were going to run the prison or the governor.  I am sorry I gave way at all.  Whatever blame may be attached to me, let me take full blame. I should have insisted on the rules being carried out in respect of these particular people.  We are accused of keeping him for three years in a punishment cell.  Undoubtedly, he was not out of his cell for three years.  It it all very well for Senator Kingsmill Moore to talk of Gandhi in Simla.  So far as I know, it is the sort of dress the Indian people wear.</P>
    <P>What I am concerned with is not to allow a small group of people to break down principles and make it impossible for the governor to run the prison.  I am well used to propaganda about prisons.  I have seen a lot of it in my time, and I know that a lot of lies were told&mdash;if not lies, gross exaggeration amounting to lies.  I have seen it myself in other times, first of all in Frongoch.  I am pleased to be able to say to-day that I was one of the few in Frongoch who refused to sign an exaggerated statement, the publication of which would alarm our relatives at home.  That was in 1916. I was in Belfast Jail and the governor there was a kind, decent man, the father of the present governor in Portlaoighise.  I understand all this thing inside out.  It is not a question of asking for ordinary treatment.</P>
    <P>I am prepared at any time to receive suggestions from Senators for the alleviation of the lot of the ordinary prisoner.  I do not say that what they <Col N="2175" /> suggest is all going to be done, but it will be considered.  As long as I am Minister for Justice I have an open mind.  I would like to have four, five, six or seven different institutions as suggested by Senators Douglas and Kingsmill Moore.  I do not like herding prisoners together in one big institution.  But I cannot produce suitable institutions out of my hat.  In due course, I have no doubt, they will be provided.</P>
    <P>Senator Campbell does not like the way boys are treated in the Borstal Institution in Cork.  I know that.  He was in the Borstal Institution in Cork. Since I came into office about six years ago, I have been trying to get a place for the Borstal boys, but I have not yet succeeded.  I am raising this to tell the House that I feel very deeply in this matter.  Before I came into office I read a good deal about prison life.</P>
    <P>I read O'Donovan Rossa and Oscar Wilde, and I have the deepest sympathy with prisoners and would do anything I could to uplift the lot of these people, but I am not going to let that particular crowd run the country, unless they go to the Irish people as we did and get the right to do it. They have got good men, well-meaning men like Senator Kingsmill Moore who would be the last in the world to play their game, but they have got them on the humanitarian aspect of the matter. If this request came at another period, I would be more disposed to listen to it.</P>
    <P>What is this commission going to do? My Department is open to anyone with suggestions, and if any Senator wishes to visit Portlaoighise or become one of the visiting justices, I have no objection to putting him on the list and let him make his suggestions then.  It is true that it is not every Senator I would appoint, but with certain exceptions, practically every Senator would be considered, it being understood that I reserve the right to turn certain Senators down, some of them anyway. Let me have suggestions.  If they are feasible, I will consider adopting them.</P>
    <P>I know that the public mind is upset. I am well aware of it.  Decent and kind people in the country are very much upset by the publication of these lying <Col N="2176" /> statements, especially from lawyers who ought to know differently.  I am not referring to the lawyers here, but there are statements made about solitary confinement.  I have here a list of the number of periods in 1945 when close confinement was imposed, for all our prisons.  There are five of them&mdash;Mountjoy, Portlaoighise, Limerick, Sligo and Cork&mdash;for the Borstal boys, for want of a better place, but that is not my fault.  There were seven periods of one day with disciplinary diet.  There were three periods of one day with ordinary diet, and four periods of two days with disciplinary diet.  There were 18 periods of three days with disciplinary diet and six periods of three days with ordinary diet.  For five years, the following is a return of the number of occasions on which prisoners have been sent to close confinement.</P>
    <P>The total number of prisoners committed in the five years up to December 31, 1945, was 12,366, and the number of punishments of close confinement was 227, that is 54 for one day, 39 for two days, 133 for three days and one for 14 days, and that was done by the visiting committee.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>It is, and confinement to-day is not like what it was in the old days when prisoners were put in underground dungeons where they were very badly treated.  I know that the governor, during the period when the prisoner referred to was refusing to leave his cell and was inflicting unnecessary punishment on himself, went out of his way, as did the chaplain and some of the warders, and made it his business to spend a good deal of time in the cell to keep the man engaged. The ordinary idea of a man being left to go mad ought to be put out of Senators' minds&mdash;it did not happen. That thing about solitary confinement has been grossly exaggerated.  Portlaoighise Prison is better than other prisons.  There are 30 acres of land and any prisoner who wishes can work on the land.  Any of these people could have done so if they wanted to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>About the legal position, this is no place to argue law.  Those Senators <Col N="2177" /> who doubt if we are acting within our rights can test the matter for themselves. If they are in doubt, let them take it to the courts.  They can seek an injunction against me and have the matter thrashed out, but I say that the law has not been broken and we are not going to allow people out dressed in that condition.  You would have the whole prison in the same state in no time.  There was a question of people losing their sanity.  There was one man who appeared to be losing his sanity.  I had my doubts about it, but he was released anyway. He was put into an asylum.  He escaped several times.  He was recaptured and, finally, I got the Government to let him out.  I think that he is about as insane as I am.  That is a personal opinion.  He acted the part very well.  I was amazed that the health of the prisoners was so good.  I do not say that I was not concerned about those prisoners.  I was very much concerned the whole of the time they were there.  The Taoiseach and I were on the phone constantly regarding them and our conversation always wound up with the question: &ldquo;What else can we do?&rdquo; Finally, like the weakling I am, I said: &ldquo;We will give them this concession and better their conditions.&rdquo; Knowing the people I had to deal with and the crimes they had committed, I should not have done that.</P>
    <P>Senator Campbell dealt with the question of the extra meal.  In Portlaoighise, they get bread and milk. That is left in their cell at 4.30.  Then they go out to recreation.  They come back and have their meal at the final lock-up at 7.30.  Senator Campbell put some of the blame on me for the riot in Mountjoy because we allowed them to mix together.  The reason I was keen on allowing them to associate with one another was that I had experience of people who were not able to fill in their time when locked up.  They had not the reading habit and their minds were not well furnished.  I was able to read when locked up.  My first experience was a lock-up of 23½ hours.  That was a long spell, but I did not mind it as much as others who were not in the habit of reading.  I knew that lack of association would have a bad effect <Col N="2178" /> on such people and we had to take the risk of doing what we did in Mountjoy. We shall have to watch that it does not occur again.  For the three hours they can listen to the radio, read or play cards.  On the whole, there has been an improvement.</P>
    <P>As regards this question of wakening prisoners every 15 minutes, there is a special watch on that particular group. The warders are expected to go round, look in, and see that they are not doing anything which they should not be doing.  The warders do not go into the cells and wake them up.  To do that, they would have to go up to the governor's office, because that is where the keys are kept.  Therefore, that part of the Senator's case is incorrect; the warders do not go into the cells. As regards the question of dress, it is a frieze but I think it is rather drab. I am trying to get some kind of better uniform&mdash;it will have to be a uniform. If they escaped, it would be easier to identify them in uniform.  In a convict prison, there should not be too much class distinction and if we did as suggested, there would be a danger of that.  In Mountjoy, prisoners are allowed to wear their own clothes and many of them do not want to do so. The governor does not get many applications for that privilege.  When people are in one community, I think that there should not be class distinction. I should like to see a brighter form of uniform if we could manage it.  I have been thinking of that for a long time.</P>
    <P>We have been told that no report has been issued regarding the prisons of late.  During the war, these reports were not printed.  The ordinary emergency conditions accounted for that. However, a report is now almost ready and it will bring matters up-to-date. Senator Douglas has urged that the rules should be examined.  They are being examined.  At present, we are consolidating all the rules and they will be published very soon.  Senators will have a better idea of what should be done when they read them.  Perhaps they would put down a motion then or send me suggestions which I could consider and which I might find it possible to accept.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2179" /> I agree that the buildings are out of date, but we cannot rebuild overnight. I am open to receive suggestions and, if any Senator or member of the other House wishes to go on the visiting committee at Portlaoighise, he can do so.  I cannot see any reason for a commission.  Even if I did, I think the present &ldquo;barrage&rdquo; would serve as a very good reason for not accepting the amendment.  I am not accusing Senators of being consciously a party to that, but I do know the way these things work.  I have been there myself.  I shall not agree to the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I find myself in agreement with the Minister.  The Minister and I belong to the same class, and he says that he does not want any class distinction in Mountjoy.  We have both been there and we both understand this matter from the point of view of the prisoner and from the point of view of a Government.  In what I have to say, the Minister will agree with me that I am not speaking as a soft-hearted or soft-headed humanitarian.  I sympathise with a great deal of what the Minister has said.  Whether I sympathised with him or not, I could fully understand his point of view.  But there are other matters to which he might have given consideration.  The motion by Senator Duffy is one for which I, personally, could not vote.  It was for that reason that Senator Douglas and I put down the amendment.  I should like to indicate to the Minister that the motion does involve a condemnation.  It does propose, as the Minister has said, that the Minister for Justice should take upon himself particular functions which, I think, should not be given to the Minister for Justice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Special responsibility with regard to solitary confinement should not be made the specific business of the Minister for Justice for the time being. Not being able to support the motion and not considering that this House or any other House should be asked to decide a specific question such as this, the amendment was put down.  Obviously, we could not declare ourselves on a specific question, because, even <Col N="2180" /> this afternoon, without any heat, we had a radical difference of opinion between the Minister and Senator Duffy on a certain set of facts.  We are not a fact-finding body, and we could not decide this matter.  I shall deal later with the question whether the time for the amendment was opportune or not.</P>
    <P>The amendment would not have been put down&mdash;in the form of a motion&mdash; until the autumn but for the fact that this motion was coming before the House to-day.  If the Minister will consider the amendment&mdash;Senator Duffy and the seconder of his motion are in agreement with it&mdash;he will find that it has certain qualities which should make it less unpalatable to him than he appears to find it.  It contains no condemnation of the prison system.  It makes no charge against the Minister or the prison officials and it does not impugn the prison rules, as they are at the moment.  Most important, perhaps, from the Minister's point of view, the amendment does not mention any specific date.  It simply states that an inquiry into the laws and regulations governing prison treatment is desirable and that Seanad Eireann requests the Government to appoint a commission to consider and report what changes, if any, should be made. No charge of any kind is being made. No doubt is expressed regarding the Minister's <i>bona fides</i> or the <i>bona fides</i> of any member of the staff of his Department or of the prison staff.  Nor does the amendment say, as these amendments frequently do, that the commission should be appointed immediately.</P>
    <P>If the Minister is considering appointing a commission obviously he cannot do it during the Summer.  He cannot do it until the Autumn or later. I think the question of immediate urgency, therefore, does not arise. Now, Sir, I should like to make a case for the moment for this amendment, quite apart altogether from the special circumstances which the Minister has mentioned, and which I will deal with later on.  There is no doubt at all, no doubt whatever, that if there had not been a Civil War in 1922 there certainly would have been an inquiry into the prison system.  There was a certain <Col N="2181" /> kind of enthusiasm, a certain kind of high-spirit at that moment, which would have brought about an inquiry into the prison system among other things, and one of the effects of the Civil War, apart altogether from the human lives that were lost and the material damage done, was the postponement of certain matters of that kind.  I think the Minister will be in agreement with me on that.  In the treatment of prisoners there have been considerable changes and considerable changes are still going on.  The change is slow but both in theory and practice with regard to prisons there has been a change.  The Minister gave us an example himself this evening that when he became Minister he actually increased the hour during which prisoners were free in the prison by, I think he said, two or three hours. That is an example of where the Minister himself effects the change and the Minister's point of view about that state of affairs, I have no doubt, is a sound one.  But, not only is that being done, but there is a constant change in the idea about prisoners, similarly about the treatment of juvenile delinquents and lunatics.  Not so long ago here we had the Mental Treatment Bill which got from people interested in that particular matter very high praise.</P>
    <P>Why should we not devote any attention to the question of prisoners? We should, of course, study conditions elsewhere.  We should not be satisfied with being as good as people elsewhere because our conditions are rather different.  What we want really to have is an inquiry into our prison system to see whether it measures up to what we want for prisons and what we desire to see with regard to the treatment of those who break the law. Now, with regard to that, the Minister's main point is that the people, the members of this House, could go on the visiting committee to Portlaoighise.  That seemed his main suggestion to me.  Well, I should like to suggest that that is a wrong point of view and that only for the recent death in Portlaoighise and that only for this campaign of which the Minister speaks, and about which I have much the same opinion as the Minister, only <Col N="2182" /> for that campaign I should not think the Minister would hold that view. Because I do not want to go on a visiting committee to Portlaoighise at all. I do not want to go on an examination of Portlaoighise.  I am not making any charge about the way it is run and similarly I think the Minister is not right when he confines the whole idea of reform to what his own Civil Service staff would approve.</P>

      <P>With respect to the Minister, surely that is what he means: that we should make suggestions that, if he thinks fit, he will carry out.  I am perfectly certain the Minister would give them proper consideration. I am perfectly certain complaints are considered, but it is not right, I think, to say: &ldquo;I have a staff.  If you have suggestions I will consider them.&rdquo; Surely, it should be possible at this stage, or within the next six months, or even within the next twelve months, to have a commission or committee&mdash; I do not mind what you call it&mdash;which would contain a governor or two governors, if you like, a judge and a lawyer.  The Minister does not particularly like lawyers I am afraid.</P>

Also an ecclesiastic, because there are priests with very long experience of prisons and the Minister could easily find more than one clergyman whose opinion on this matter would be very sound and who would, by no means, be a soft-hearted humanitarian. As a matter of fact in my experience of ecclesiastics, owing to their position, they seldom are soft-hearted humanitarians.  Quite the reverse.</P>

      <P>The Minister is in the position as Senator Douglas said of having available to him people who have experience of gaols from the inside, <Col N="2183" /> but whom now, I should presume, we may call law-abiding, respectable citizens of the community.  It seems to me well worth while to have an inquiry set up and let the people who do want the changes come forward and put them to that commission, and the Minister or the Minister's successor would be fortified by such an opinion. He will not agree.  The whole difficulty in this matter as in other matters of Government is finance.  The Minister did not make that excuse for himself at all.  I make it for him. Now, the Minister is hampered, of course, by finance.  He says he cannot produce a whole lot of separate prisons out of his hat.  Of course, he cannot. That is a conjuring trick: it is just as difficult for him to get them out of the Department of Finance as it is to get them out of his hat, even if the materials were available and tradesmen were running about idle.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a great many matters to be considered.  One Senator who spoke mentioned and the Minister mentioned as to reforms: are the prisons built many years ago at all suitable to the modern ideas on prison treatment?  There is the question of the segregation of separate classes.  I think the Minister suggested this afternoon that prisoners serving sentences for sexual crimes should certainly be segregated, just as Senator Crosbie says that prisoners serving for their first term should be segregated.  All these things would cost money.  All these things would have to be considered separately and the Minister would be fortified and the Department of Justice would be fortified by an expression of opinion from an independent body which would command respect from everybody.  Some of them might save money as a matter of fact. If it is true, and I think it is true, that our prison officials are as enlightened as they have been represented here this evening to be, they themselves can suggest to that kind of commission or to that kind of committee a considerable number of reforms.  With that kind of body you might then come to a solution <Col N="2184" /> of this other question about which there has been so much fuss, namely, what is called or what is miscalled political treatment.  Even that might be considered and might mean another class in the segregation of prisoners.  I agree the time is not opportune at the moment, from the Minister's point of view, but if you pass this amendment all you are saying is that you think it is desirable that the Government should appoint a commission.  You are not saying that the Government should appoint it now.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Dea suggested that the amendment should be postponed for six months.  I appreciate the reason why he made that suggestion, but there is no necessity for it.  Even if you pass this amendment, as far as I am concerned, I certainly will not ask the Minister a question about it for six months and, perhaps, for longer, but the matter is one which should be dealt with.  Just as he is right in not allowing certain prisoners to run prisons I think it is wrong to allow certain people to keep people from doing something which is right.  I think the Minister is quite foolish in taking that attitude.  I think that is a wrong line. There is this to be said about it also: that there are things that one Government can do and another Government cannot do.  In this whole matter the stronger you are, the more you can afford to be lenient.  The stronger you are the more you can afford to yield. It is the weak who unfortunately cannot yield or who if they do yield are subject to very serious penalties.  None of us should allow ourselves to be governed in this particular matter by false analogies or allow ourselves to be hypnotised by certain words used in different times in different circumstances and by different people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For example, the Minister said he was sorry he had been weak.  I am not so sure that he ought to be sorry for that.  He said he was sorry that he had not imitated the last Government. I cannot recollect the precise circumstances there, but, mind you, I am not so sure that the Minister needs to imitate the last Government for many reasons.  His position is a different position from that of the last Government <Col N="2185" /> just as the position of both Governments is different from the position which the British Government had here.  That is a thing we ought to remember.</P>
    <P>I know what the Minister is thinking of when he talked about political treatment.  He is thinking of political treatment as we knew it in the British days, where you first demanded concession A, then concession B, then concession C and then release and where you were used to getting it.  The point was not that you particularly should get it but that your father and grandfather had got it before you.  That is a different state of affairs from the present. The British were trying to do something which they abandoned.  They were not quite sure of their title.</P>
    <P>The real difficulty in relation to political treatment in the old British days and right up to 1932 was that behind the prisoner in jail was an active agitation outside with considerable political backing.  I want to suggest to the Minister that there is no such political backing now and that that has changed the circumstances very radically.  As far as I am concerned I agree entirely with the Minister that people who commit crimes, whether they allege a political motive or any other motive, must suffer the consequences of these crimes, and if they want to be released before they serve their sentence then most emphatically they should not be released.</P>
    <P>But it may very well be that there are some concessions&mdash;I don't like the word &ldquo;concession&rdquo; or the phrase &ldquo;political treatment&rdquo;&mdash;but there might be some scheme devised, because we are only in 1946 in this country and we have to take our own history into consideration, our own remote history and our very recent history.  In all these circumstances we should not be hypnotised by words and if I may say so I think the Minister is misguiding himself when he says he should have acted like the last Government because his circumstances are radically different.  There is no agitation at all outside behind these prisoners as far as I can see and when I become a little bit sentimental on occasions, what I find to be the most miserable thing <Col N="2186" /> about the unfortunate prisoners is that no one appears to care about them until they die and then somebody comes along and tries to make capital out of it.  That to me seems to be a most despicable thing to be doing and I am in complete agreement with the Minister there.</P>
    <P>The attitude of some people in relation to the hunger-strikers, as I told a gentleman who was going to speak at a meeting recently, reminds me of the story of the Kerry man who went to save his mother.  Most stories about Kerry men are in their favour, but this one is not.  He came out one morning and found the river in flood.  He found his mother being borne down on the flood and she was holding a plank.  He did not jump in but he said in Irish: &ldquo;Coinnigh do ghreim, a Mham,&rdquo; which I think means &ldquo;Hould your hoult, mother.&rdquo;  That is what people were doing in Dublin when the unfortunate man was going to his death in Portlaoighise, while they themselves professed law and order and said that they were people who would never get inside the prison. There is, I think, very little interest taken in prisoners.  Those making an agitation outside are not in sympathy with the prisoners' political aims. There is not open political support for armed action against the State and, therefore, prison treatment might perhaps be adjusted by some very small matter when there is nobody standing behind the prisoners' theories or the prisoners' acts.  Even the most irresponsible speakers take care to say that they have no sympathy with any actions against law and order in the State.  That means that the State is very strong.  There is no attack being made against it and we should be able to go along and do our own business in our own way without taking any notice of any lying propaganda that may be going on about the Minister himself.  I want to put this to the Minister.  I say to him in all sincerity that if an inquiry into prison conditions is a good thing we ought to have it and not allow ourselves to be hampered by any propaganda.  There is a good deal one could say about prisons. There is different punishment for different persons and that is one point <Col N="2187" /> we must remember, because one of the great miracles of creation, as has been pointed out here, is that, although we are all the same in that we are all made in the image of God, every man is different.</P>
    <P>Punishment differs according to physical conditions and mental conditions. It differs according to the prisoners' education and according to their likes and dislikes and to their upbringing. The fact is being recognised in education and in prisons and it is one of the points that should be discussed by a commission.</P>
    <P>I quite agree that guilty people must be restrained and I quite agree that you must run the prison and not on a mere sentimental basis.  The governor of the prison is in charge of a number of people who are, as the saying goes, &ldquo;tough&rdquo;, and there is no use in expecting that in a particular situation or in a particular case he can act in a soft way because he cannot.  I believe that this matter should be settled by the Minister and the House and that neither agitators nor politics nor prejudice nor our own history should prevent us from showing that we can adjust our present system to meet our own sense of Christian requirements.</P>
    <P>The object of imprisonment is not vengeance, but punishment and reform. Seeing that there is need for that inquiry I think it would be in the interests of the security of the State that we should have it.  I entirely agree with the Minister that he may not have it immediately but he should have it and recognise the principle that it must take place sooner or later.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I should tell the Senator that we are bringing in consolidating Bills and one of these Bills which we hope to bring in will deal with prisons.  Before that there will be some sort of amending Bill, but that may be in about a year's time. Perhaps about then I will have the matter examined.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>That is just the point. It seems to me that the Minister is not right in thinking that the only kind of inquiry possible is a departmental inquiry.  The only reason he is doing that is because he is allowing his vision to be obscured by recent events.  I think from what the Minister has said now that it should be easy for him to consult certain people on this matter in bringing in amending legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>This is not a party matter.  There is no need to consult people on a party basis, but it would be a good thing and it would be quite possible to get in the country intelligent and hard headed people who have considered this matter to make recommendations before an amending Bill came in.  If that were done an amending Bill would be much more freely discussed in the Dáil and Seanad. As a matter of fact over and over again amending Bills have been brought in as a result of commissions' reports. For example, The Town Tenants Tribunal was one, before the Rent Restrictions Act, and the Tribunal on Greater Dublin was another.  There is any amount of precedent, so what the Minister has told me rather fortifies our case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The matter is one which, in 1922, in our enthusiasm at that particular moment, would have been done, and I think it should be done now.  We are recommending it to be done now, merely because of the motion by Senator Duffy.  We are not asking that it should be done immediately or urgently; we are not endeavouring to condemn the Minister for any action he has thought fit to take; we are not challenging the Minister's <i>bona fides</i> in the matter or challenging the present system; but we do think an inquiry by competent people&mdash;civil servants, <Col N="2189" /> officials and outsiders&mdash;should take place.  For that reason, I would like to recommend the amendment to the House.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Hayes emphasised the words &ldquo;if any&rdquo;, but he wants the Seanad to insist that an inquiry is desirable.  If <Col N="2190" /> we feel that an inquiry is desirable, surely we have something in mind to indicate that a change is necessary?

      <P>I cannot understand why this amendment is put forward so vociferously here, considering that a leader of the Party to whom Senator Hayes boasts his allegiance, in the other House&mdash;where I listened to the full debate, and even if it were rather heated in many ways, I think on the whole it was just as sincere as we have heard here to-night&mdash;Deputy O'Higgins, as reported in Column 1169, said:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;If such a motion were put down in different circumstances and not in an atmosphere of general national demand for release of prisoners, the position would be different.  If a motion such as this were put down in ordinary, normal times, say 12 months hence, asking for a review of prison conditions, for a commission to inquire whether conditions in our jails were too punitive or otherwise&mdash; if such a motion were put down at a time when there would be no political <Col N="2191" /> agitation, we could clearly and easily subscribe to it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Those are Deputy O'Higgins's words in the other House, but Senator Hayes speaks to-night with an absolutely opposite point of view.</P>

      <P>But the phrases used by Deputy O'Higgins could be applied to the motion before the House to-night.  If desired, I will read them again, to emphasise them. We had an expression of opinion formulated by Deputy O'Higgins on the point before us to-night, but Senator Hayes totally disagrees, though he should have expressed the same opinion.  He says we should pass it to-night, but will not ask the Minister to act upon it for six months.  I think I am in order in saying I consider that that was not sincere.  It flavours of playing politics, to say that in this august Assembly, where Party feelings do not run high and where we can express our opinions in our wisdom, not bound by the Party feelings which are expressed in the direct representation in the other House, this was calmly considered, and we thought that such action should be taken.</P>
      <P>I think Deputy O'Higgins expressed the proper point of view, and if Senator Hayes had acted rightly, he should have expressed the same point of view here to-night.  No matter how he may emphasize that this is a calmly debated, pious expression of opinion, there are people outside who will be only too glad to grasp at the fact that something is wrong with our prison regulations and prison treatment. They will say: &ldquo;See how the Seanad has passed this motion demanding an inquiry.&rdquo;  It would not justify our intelligence to pass this amendment as it is worded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2192" /> The debate generally&mdash;including the eloquent description by Senator Kingsmill Moore of the poor unfortunate prisoners and the regulations that apply to them&mdash;was the reverse of what was expressed in the other House.  The whole furore there was: &ldquo;Why this discrimination; why should one prisoner or set of prisoners be treated in such a manner and other prisoners taken, say, to the Curragh?&rdquo; Here the whole effort to-night is towards discrimination.  The word is not &ldquo;discrimination&rdquo;; it is &ldquo;individualism&rdquo; or, as Senator Moore suggested, that the treatment should be individualised and be elastic.  If we have a prison treatment which is individualised and made elastic to the extent he indicated, the next thing you will have is: &ldquo;Why is such a prisoner treated in such a way; is there to be no standard regulation?&rdquo; Now, I am not going to be too hard on that point.</P>
    <P>You can have segregation, we will say, of first offenders.  Mind you, even there a first offender might be a murderer.  Well, you only commit a murder once because you will get it in the neck afterwards.  That does not mean that the first offender, who was a murderer, must get special treatment. I do agree that there would be a case for people who fall for the first time, and for those who commit minor offences, being put into a separate prison.  But even there you will have the claim made for individualising, for making the prison regulations elastic.</P>
    <P>I grant that Senator Kingsmill Moore has the best intentions in the world, but will he tell us how it is going to be put into effect as a practical treatment? You would have public representatives, representatives of the professions and of vocations pointing out that it was wrong: that you were giving individual treatment, preferential treatment.  Discrimination is the word that will be used, as it was used in the other House.  That word was not used in the debate here this evening, but the words substituted here for the word &ldquo;discrimination&rdquo; are just the same.  The different points of view would have to be considered.  A commission will not give any better opinion than the opinions that could be expressed by public representatives <Col N="2193" /> like ourselves.  My main reason for speaking is to point out to the House the ambiguity of the amendment.  I have said that the amendment was &ldquo;phoney.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>The amendment asks that in our wisdom we consider such a thing is necessary and that we are to do such a thing if it is required. I do not think that that reads sense. Now, with regard to the debate it was just as phoney.  The proposer of the motion spoke for one-and-a-half hours. The seconder of it said he was doing so in order that he might support the amendment.  That brings us down to the position in which we are now.</P>

I did so on another occasion in this House when the proposer of a motion had one other Senator to support him.  I want to point out to the Senator that his motion had not a seconder until another Senator said that he was seconding it in order, as he expressed it, that he might support the amendment.

      <P>I want to say a few words.  I am not one bit concerned <Col N="2194" /> with the political motives or reasons which were given by members of the House who spoke in this debate.  I think Senator Duffy's was the only speech I did not hear.  There was no heat introduced into the debate by any Senator who spoke.  They put their points of view without getting into any heat.  The only one who introduced heat was the Minister.  I intend to express my own personal views on this matter, and I do not mind what anybody thinks about what I have to say, whether they are inside or outside the House.  I do want to say that I stand for law and order.  After listening to Senator Campbell this evening, I am satisfied that the ordinary criminal in this country is too well treated.  The Senator said that Mountjoy was a kind of hotel&mdash;with the food and all the rest that they are receiving.  It is surprising that more do not commit crime in order to get in there.</P>
      <P>I am not going to deal further with that side of the question.  I am, however, going to say that a political prisoner is entitled to political treatment. It was given by Britain, an alien Government, when she was in control here.  Is there any member of the House who will say that a man who is in prison for his political views should get the same treatment as some skunk who is in prison for some selfish low crime?</P>

      <P>If Seán McCaughey had not died this motion would not be before us this evening.  Let us be honest about it.  Was it not because of Seán McCaughey's death that resolutions were passed by county councils through the country, some of them with a Fianna Fáil majority?  Let us be honest about it and admit that it is because of Seán McCaughey's death that the motion is before us.  I believe it is, even though I did not hear Senator Duffy say that.  After all, the people of this nation do not stand for the solitary confinement of a political prisoner.  Listening to some statements that were made this evening, one would think we were living hundreds of years after events that took place in this country within the last quarter of a century.  Is there any body of men in this nation that thinks that the people are going to turn overnight to be law abiding?</P>
      <P>The Minister is a gentleman that I have a very high opinion of, but his attitude this evening convinces me that he is not a man who is capable of dealing with political prisoners in this nation.  That is my honest opinion.  I have already said that he was the only one who got heated in this debate. He said he was going to put down this pack of criminals who were out to wreck the State.  Remember that we tried to wreck the State previously. The men of 1916 tried to wreck a foreign Power in this country. There are men who are prepared to give their lives as long as this country is unfree, not to wreck this State, but to wreck an outside Power that holds a portion of our country in bondage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe that the Minister is as honest and as good an Irishman as any other man in the country.  Nevertheless, he should have respect for other people's views and give consideration to them.  The Minister, in his time, did certain things and taught people to do certain things.  These young people think they are going the same <Col N="2196" /> road and that they are serving Ireland in the same way.</P>

      <P>So far as I am concerned, I never will stand for anybody who would attempt to wreck this State, but I would be glad to give any help I could to a body of men who would go up to wreck the State which is holding portion of this country in bondage.  The British Government gave political treatment to political prisoners.  The very fact that Seán McCaughey and his colleagues were sent before the Military Tribunal and were not tried by the ordinary courts automatically made them political prisoners.  If not, why were they not tried in the ordinary courts?  The Government cannot answer that question. I do not like the Minister's attitude.  He got too hot and hasty.</P>

I listened to him in the other House, where he may have got provocation.  So far as this House is concerned, I do not think that a word was said about which he should get hot and bothered.  I believe that every statement made in the House this evening, other than that of Senator Duffy, which I had not the pleasure of hearing, was helpful and was in the interests of the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator O'Donovan suggested that this motion was brought forward just for fun.  When good Irishmen lose their lives, it is not fun.  They do not give their lives for fun but to help to free this country and bring the republic for which many on the other side fought&mdash;a republic of 32 counties.  There is too much humbug going on and people in high positions should not be leading other people <Col N="2197" /> astray and inciting them much more than some of us here are.  The Senator says that speeches made were not sincere.  I was not going to speak until I heard him and the Minister speak. Do members on the other side think that no Senator has a right to put forward a motion according to the light of his own conscience on a matter which concerns the people?  If we have not the right to do that and to speak according to conscience, what business have we coming here?  I pay this tribute to the Seanad&mdash;I leave myself out of the compliment&mdash;that the time Senators spend on amendments to Bills and the way they co-operate with one another show that the Seanad is a first-class body and not second even to the other House.</P>
      <P>Why should the Government be afraid of a motion like this, if they have no skeleton in the cupboard?  All that is asked for is an inquiry.  After hearing Senator Campbell, I would give no more to the ordinary criminal, but I would give more to the political prisoner.  Therefore, I am satisfied about everything but a small point. The number of political prisoners is few.  I am sincere in asking the Minister to accept this motion or amendment.  If he does not, I appeal to him, for the honour of the country, to concede to political prisoners in his prisons what the British Government conceded to the members of my family and to him, when they were similarly circumstanced.  In asking that, I feel that I am not asking too much.  Even people who do not stand for the views of those prisoners expect this to be conceded.  They feel that it is a crime to have a prisoner in solitary confinement for three years because he will not wear prison clothes&mdash;the clothes of the ordinary criminal.  Since he is not a criminal, why should he be asked to wear the clothes of a criminal?  I hope that the tragedy which occurred recently will not be repeated.  I can assure the Minister that, as long as this country is unfree, whatever Government is in power will have political prisoners.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>I gathered from the Minister's speech that he, at any rate, accepted part of the case which I endeavoured to submit at the beginning. I refer to the question of <Col N="2199" /> segregation.  Most of the members who took part in the discussion accepted the view that there ought to be segregation of prisoners.</P>
      <P>If there is a possibility of creating separate prisons for different classes of prisoners then there should be separate prisons provided.  If that is not possible there should be clear segregation inside where there is only one prison.  I want to submit to this House that this timidity which is blocking progress in the Department of Justice should not block progress in this House.  There should be a clear understanding that the present method of having all kinds of people, in all kinds of conditions, imprisoned for all kinds of offences, in close proximity in the one prison is a bad one and that it should not be continued.  It is quite obvious that in Portlaoighise prison we have people who are sentenced to six months' and to 12 months' imprisonment incarcerated side by side with people sentenced to 20 years' imprisonment.</P>

      <P>Some of them sentenced for heinous crimes.  No matter what attempt there is made at segregation within the prison, it is impossible to imagine that you will avoid contamination. I think, however, that the Minister agrees in principle with the <Col N="2200" /> view that there should be segregation and to that extent the case is made for one portion of the proposition which I advanced at the beginning.  In the main, the objection to the proposal before the House, as I understand it, is that the time is not opportune. There has never been any period in the last 25 years when time was opportune in this country for inquiry into the prison system.  The same objection would be raised as is raised to-day, but I think that that is one of the reasons why the time is opportune to consider whether the prison system is suitable, whether it achieves its purpose, and what actually is the purpose of a prison system.  I quoted earlier from an inspector of prisons.  I should like to quote him again in relation to the question of, first, the purpose of penal legislation and, secondly, the question of the segregation of offenders. In regard to penal legislation Major Griffith wrote:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The chief aim of penal legislation should be either to keep gaols empty or to use them only where a distinct reduction in the number of offenders whether by regeneration or by continuous withdrawal from noxious activity can be obtained&rdquo;</P>
      <P>and on the second point he wrote:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;the great aim and object of all penal process, it has been said, should be the recognition of the general principle of dividing all offenders into two categories (1) those who ought never enter a gaol and, (2) those who ought never to be allowed to leave it.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main purpose of this proposal is that there should be an examination of the whole penal system, an examination of the process by which people charged with offences against the law of the State are restrained and punished.  My own view is that people who are incarcerated should have the maximum amount of liberty and the greatest degree of natural life and physical existence so far as it is possible to maintain discipline and to impose restraint without a breach of discipline.  This idea of locking people into cells and keeping people in the prison for a long period of years is, in my opinion, an unwise one and one we <Col N="2201" /> ought to get rid of.  I do not object to hard work in the prison.  I think it would be far better that prisoners should be properly housed, should be properly fed and that they should be expected to work hard.  In that connection I would permit them to earn a reward for the work which would enable them to supplement the food and the clothing provided by the prison and, at the same time, I would also permit them the one luxury that most prisoners seem to look for most, the right to smoke.</P>

      <P>If I finish in five minutes will that satisfy the Chair?  There is little more I desire to say.  I think the sense of the House favours the idea of the reorganisation of the prison system and that it favours an inquiry. The difficulty that confronts those who are supporting the Minister's view is that it is not opportune, that you give an impression abroad that the Government is weak.  That, I think, is a wrong view and, in my submission, the <Col N="2202" /> correct view was put by Senator Hayes when he pointed out that a Government is strong enough to do what they believe to be right.  I have no doubt that the right thing is to have the inquiry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>&ldquo;Challenging&rdquo; is the word&mdash;challenging a division.  Senator O'Donovan is challenging the opinion of the Chair that the motion is lost.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hearne</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of information, is that the ruling of the Chair? Is that the interpretation of the Standing Orders that when five members challenge a division they are challenging the opinion of the Chair?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="An Leas-Chathaoirleach An Leas-Chathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, only the opinion of the Chair.  The procedure is that when there does not appear to be the requisite support those who are in favour of a division rise in their places.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>But is it a question of being in favour of a division or challenging the decision that the motion is lost?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is definitely challenging, because it is provided in Standing Orders that if there are not five Senators to challenge, the others can have their names recorded.  Therefore, it is clearly challenging a division.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHearne" hpid="Mr. Hearne Mr. Hearne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hearne</NameTxt>
      <P>The point arises as to what the procedure should be in having a division.  The question is the interpretation of challenging a division. One point&mdash;and it is Senator O'Donovan's point&mdash;is that you are challenging <Col N="2204" /> a vote of the House; the other point is that you are challenging the decision of the Chair.  I take it that the decision of the Chair is that the latter is what operates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>You cannot decide these points at 10 o'clock at night.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="An Leas-Chathaoirleach An Leas-Chathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>In such circumstances any Senator can challenge the opinion of the Chair.  I gave my opinion on the voices that the motion is lost and anyone with the requisite support can challenge that by dividing the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHearne" hpid="Mr. Hearne Mr. Hearne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hearne</NameTxt>
      <P>So that any five Senators can demand a division whether they are in favour of or against a motion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="An Leas-Chathaoirleach An Leas-Chathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hearne</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely when Senators by their voices vote, the Chair can give its opinion that the motion is lost.  A division is challenged by people who desire to see whether in fact the motion is lost, those in favour of the motion not believing it is lost.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanODonovan" hpid="Mr. S. O'Donovan Mr. S. O'Donovan">
