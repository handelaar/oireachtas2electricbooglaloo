      <P>It is with very deep regret I announce to the House the death, on Saturday last, of our friend and colleague, Senator William Magennis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Personally, I find it not easy to adjust my thoughts to the news of his passing.  The last night he attended in the House&mdash;a fortnight ago&mdash;he engaged me in conversation in regard to certain proceedings of that day with all the acuteness of observation and shrewdness of comment which he brought to bear on the business of the Seanad.  I did not then discern any signs of waning mental powers, and he parted from me with a humorous threat.  It is only those who had the privilege of serving with the late Senator during his public life&mdash;earlier in the Dáil and in later years in the Seanad&mdash;who can appreciate to the full the great gifts he brought to the service of his country as a parliamentarian. His addresses to the Houses conceived in the classic mode, displaying lucidity of thought, preciseness of language, felicity of phrase, aptness of illustration, marshalling of argument made appeal not only to his hearers but to the wider public outside.  He was a doughty opponent in debate but there was none more courteous or impersonal. It was in the intimacy of committee work, however, that Senator Magennis best displayed the very human side of his nature.  In the committee room there were no political opponents for him, all were colleagues, and his persuasiveness, suavity and keen sense of humour often built bridges.  Of his work outside the Oireachtas, for his university and for the cause of Catholic higher education, which was so dear to him and for which he was honoured by His Holiness <Col N="1166" /> the Pope, others have spoken.  His work in both spheres will be remembered.</P>
    <P>With the assent of my colleagues I shall convey to the widow of the deceased Senator the expression of our deep sympathy.</P>

      <P>A Chathaoirligh, I should like to join with you in expressing my sympathy upon the death of Professor Magennis.  It was as Professor Magennis I knew him over a period of nearly 40 years.  When I first saw him, he was a member of an older generation in Ireland upon a social and political stage, the actors of which are passing all too quickly from us now.  At that time&mdash;nearly 40 years ago&mdash;in the old Jesuit College in St. Stephen's Green, before the establishment of the present National University, William Magennis' reputation was very high, indeed.  Only yesterday, one of his most distinguished pupils in metaphysics and philosophy told me that Professor Magennis was the most brilliant lecturer he had ever listened to in this country or outside it.  At that time, he was in the very forefront in the fight for a national university and for suitable higher education for Catholics and Nationalists in Ireland.  He was, as you have said, Sir, a magnificent orator.  He had clarity, aptness of phrase, and a sustained vigour which he retained to the very end of his life.  He did not come into public life, proper, until 1922, when he was elected an independent member for the National University of Ireland to support the Treaty.  In face of the dangers and difficulties of that time, he displayed great courage and determination.  He was a very good committee man, reasonable, sensible and resourceful in solving difficulties but, as a public man, he was abnormally sensitive and highly strung and, so, in many ways, unfitted for the cut and thrust of Parliamentary debate.  It is for that reason that, in politics, he did not achieve the success for which his varied talents would seem to have fitted him.  He was a man of many interests&mdash;philosophy, literature, education and law&mdash;and he also proved, since <Col N="1167" /> his entry into public life, that he had the capacity for doing a specific job of work.  His achievement, for example, on the Greater Dublin Commission was very thorough and very fine, indeed. He was a man of vast reading and he had a great grasp of detail.  When he took up any particular topic or any particular work, he did so most enthusiastically.  It was granted to him to live to a ripe old age and, what is rare enough, with his intellectual vigour unimpaired to the end.  We pray that God may grant him rest.</P>

      <P>Because it so happened that it fell to the late Senator Professor Magennis and myself to take leading parts on opposite sides on a couple of debates during the past year, members of the Seanad may have been deceived as to the very cordial relationships which subsisted between us.  After our differences had been expressed in the House, we used frequently to discuss them in private in a friendly manner and with a very great measure of agreement.  Indeed, Professor Magennis more than once asserted that the differences which arose between us were differences between people who on most subjects thought fundamentally alike.  During the last few months I think Professor Magennis had some slight intimation that his life might not be extended much longer.  Although he still would run for a bus or still show his old pertinacity in debate, yet he seemed keen on recalling and having remembered for posterity certain incidents of Irish history of which he conceived himself to be one of the few repositories.  He also was keen that certain attitudes for which he stood all his life should be preserved, and indeed he seemed to think that I, who had been his opponent, was the person who might be best able to preserve them, and he talked to me on many occasions on this subject.  I had not known him before I came into the House, but he was one of the first to welcome me when I came here.  He always helped me in every possible way, even when my attitude was opposed to that which he adopted, because he realised the importance <Col N="1169" /> of having matters thrashed out upon an abstract intellectual level. Even though he might not agree with his opponents, he was one of the first to realise the essentiality of having the opposite arguments put forward from a similar groundwork of approach. Personally, I shall miss Professor Magennis.  I shall miss him in the House; I shall miss him in the ante-room; I shall miss the occasions when I had the pleasure of driving him back or walking with him a good portion of his way home after the Seanad. Although my knowledge of him has been so short, my expression of regret at his death is not less profound than that of anybody who has spoken or who will speak.</P>

      <P>As one who had differences, sometimes rather acute differences, with the late Senator Magennis across the floor of the House, I should like to pay a sincere tribute to his memory.  He was direct and uncompromising in debate, but when one met him outside the House he was invariably friendly, courteous and showed no sense of personal rancour. In that way, he upheld all the best traditions of Parliamentary life. His death is a great loss to public life and scholarship in this country.  I should like to add these few words in tribute to his memory.</P>

      <P>It is with a profound sense of personal loss that I join with those who paid tribute to the late Senator Magennis and who reminded us of the vacuum that his passing from this House will leave.  I suppose there is nobody in this House who knew him so long as I did.  That is one of the consolations of the passing of the years.  I had known him for about 45 years.  When as a girl I had to study logic as one of the <i>disciplinæ</i> for the first and second arts examination in the old Royal University of Ireland, I found I had to sharpen my wits so as to be ready for the cross-examination he would give at the &ldquo;oral&rdquo; examination table.  I had also the advantage of attending his lectures on literature, and may truly say that from no one had I ever garnered such light and leading.  It was as if he had given me the key that admitted <Col N="1170" /> into a kingdom of splendour and delight. His conception of literature was high and noble&mdash;and ennobling. He thought literature was an instrument to help us to right living and that is why it must have been a torture to him to serve as he did on the Censorship Board.</P>
      <P>It must have been acute agony to him, and we ought to think of the sacrifices he made from his sense of duty. He was a great figure, a brilliant figure in the lecture hall or on the platform. I was one of those associated intimately with him in the meetings of the Catholic Graduates' Association, which brought into being the present National University of which I have the honour to be the senior representative in this House, and it was there I learned to know Professor Magennis's real work.  In the ante-room or at the tea table in Leinster House I got to know Professor Magennis as a man, and it was as a man that I felt the deepest affection for him.  One of the things I admired most about him was his deep fidelity to duty.  It must have been hard on a man of his character and attainments to sit through long hours of dreary debate on matters which did not hold interest for him, but so deep was his sense of duty that he was one of the most regular attendants in this House.  Everything he did he put his heart into and that is one of the things that count most in the end.  It is not the brilliancy of his mind or his intellectual attainments but his character that really made him great, and in his character Senator Magennis was really great.  With his great reading and knowledge he brought also the simple faith of an old Irish country woman, and I cannot give him higher praise than that.  It is through his faith and upright living that he will get a welcome from St. Peter on the other side.</P>

    <Title>Land Bill, 1945&mdash;Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoylan" hpid="Minister for Lands (Mr. Moylan) Seán Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Lands (Mr. Moylan)</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the common complaint against the land code relates to its extent and complexity it is with reluctance I propose to add a further reason for such complaint by the introduction of this Bill.  My justification is that an evil, limited indeed in extent, but grave in its implications, has disclosed itself, as a result of inspection and examination of the manner in which certain unvested allottees have met the commitments imposed on them by the terms of their contract with the Land Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Inspections made from time to time in the five or six years preceding 1944 &mdash;during the emergency period when failure to use land to its fullest extent could be held to be more than usually blameworthy&mdash;showed that in some 20 per cent. of the cases examined the allottees were not working their lands properly and that several hundred houses built for allottees remained unoccupied. Warnings and threats produced a big improvement but there still remains a substantial number of defaulters who seem to believe that no effective action can or will be taken to ensure their compliance with their contract. It is in the interest of the community <Col N="1172" /> that such action must be taken and the instrument devised for the purpose is the Bill now before you.  At the moment the position is that we have set up in the Land Commission a special section to deal systematically with investigations for usership and residence and during the past year or so some 6,900 parcels have been visited with the following results:&mdash;We are satisfied with 5,660 or 82 per cent.  We found that 1,120 or 16 per cent. were not being worked satisfactorily generally because they were being sublet by the allottees.  We found that of 1,920 houses on holdings examined 116 were unoccupied.</P>
    <P>In addition to these results from regular systematic inspection we have had brought to our notice 500 individual cases of bad husbandry and 175 cases of non-occupancy of houses.  So that just now we have in the Land Commission information about 1,620 cases of failure to work land and 291 cases of failure to occupy houses built for or given to allottees.  And all this after an amount of publicity and inspection and warning which would have moved any but a really unsatisfactory allottee to change his bad habits.</P>
    <P>I feel that the figures given are sufficiently disturbing to justify the introduction of the Bill.  I want to emphasise the fact that it is not intended as a punitive but as a reform measure. I also think that the Seanad will agree that definite action and specific powers are needed if the evil is to be eradicated.</P>
    <P>The question of residence was dealt with in Section 19 of the Land Act, 1939, which purported to give the Land Commission sufficient powers to enforce it, but they have been advised that an allottee who has been called on, under that section, to take up residence within three months (or such longer period as might be allowed him) and who has actually gone into residence following that notice, may subsequently cease to reside in the house, leaving it empty and the Land Commission have no further legal power to interfere with him.  Allottees have also found another method of evasion by assuming pretence of residence.  It is therefore proposed to repeal Section 19 <Col N="1173" /> of the Land Act, 1939, as inadequate and have it replaced by Section 2 of this Bill.  It is essential that there should be no doubt whatever as to the powers of the Land Commission to enforce permanent residence as ordinarily understood, when they provide an allottee with a house on the land given him.</P>
    <P>The question of the proper use by allottees of their parcels of land is a matter of supreme national importance and I am sure the House is aware that where allottees to whom parcels of untenanted land are given hold their allotments under purchase agreements, such agreements provide, <i>inter alia</i>, that they will not sell, alienate, sublet, subdivide, or part with possession of their parcels before the land has been revested in them; that they will work the land in accordance with the proper methods of husbandry to the satisfaction of the Land Commission, and that the Land Commission may recover possession in case of any default on the part of the allottee to comply with such conditions.</P>
    <P>Though a letting of a holding or parcel in conacre or for the purposes of agistment or for temporary depasturage does not in law constitute a breach of a condition in a purchase agreement against subletting or parting with the possession of the holding or parcel or any part of it, it has never been intended that land provided for allottees could be let in conacre, etc. In addition, some recent High Court decisions have laid down that lettings of parcels by allottees for grazing or in conacre did not constitute breaches of the conditions in the purchase agreements that the parcels shall be worked in accordance with the proper methods of husbandry, with the result that allottees so using the lands could not be dispossessed.  Sections 3 and 4 are designed to give the necessary remedies.</P>
    <P>Opportunity has also been taken in the Bill to deal with some other points which have come to light in the operation of the land code.</P>
    <P>First there is the matter of the devolution of parcels on the death of allottees.  This is dealt with in Section 5 of the Bill.  The devolution of parcels <Col N="1174" /> of unregistered land on the personal representatives of deceased allottees has never up to recently been questioned, so far as the Land Commission are aware, by anyone and the Land Commission and everybody else have acted on the assumption that these parcels of unregistered land did so descend, but recently a doubt arose in the minds of the Commissioners' advisers as to whether the hitherto generally accepted view was correct and it was considered advisable in the general interest to put the matter beyond doubt in this section.</P>
    <P>Secondly there is the question of restrictions on dealing with holdings and parcels provided for the enlargement of holdings.  The whole purpose of an allotment is defeated if the allottee is free to dispose of either his holding or parcel before they are consolidated. Such a separate alienation is prohibited, except with the consent of the Land Commission, by Section 6 of the Bill and the prohibition extends to parcels allotted before or after the passing of the Land Act, 1939.  This section supersedes Section 23 of the 1939 Act which was intended to effect the same result but has been found not to be retrospective.</P>
    <P>Finally there is the question of the devolution of holdings and parcels provided for the enlargement of holdings. This question is dealt with in Section 7 of the Bill which provides that following the death of a purchaser for the enlargement of whose holding a parcel was provided the parcel and the holding (prior to the consolidation thereof) should not pass to different persons under the terms of the deceased's will.  Such parcels being given as additions to existing holdings, it is proposed that the parcel should go to the person taking the holding in succession to the deceased purchaser.</P>
    <P>I do not know if it is any use to inform the Seanad that the Bill, after a very wide discussion&mdash;it was attacked from many points of view&mdash;passed through the Dáil in all its stages without a division.  The Bill is absolutely necessary.  It has been drafted in really narrow terms to deal with a limited evil.  It asks for what may be considered rather exceptional powers, <Col N="1175" /> but the evil with which we have to deal, though limited, is such that it cannot be dealt with other than by an instrument of this kind.  I recommend it to the Seanad.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>With the general principle that, when a person is allotted land by the Land Commission to remedy a social evil, the land so allotted should be properly worked, I think every member of the House will be in agreement. I equally think that every member of the House will be in agreement with the principle that when a house has been built for an allottee at public expense&mdash;the expense representing a substantial charge upon the taxpayers of the country&mdash;it should not be left idle but should be lived in by that allottee.  I do not think there can be any doubt as to the views of anybody who considers the problem on those lines, so that if it were merely a question of those two general principles, I think there would be very little to discuss at the moment.</P>
      <P>But there is something more.  I entirely agree with the Minister that it is necessary to protect those two principles and that if it has been found that existing legislation is not sufficient to protect them, then additional legislation was desirable.  I am further in entire agreement with him, when, in his opening remarks, he spoke of the complexity of the land code.  Where the Minister and I will differ, however, is in the machinery that he is proposing to adopt, and because of certain other incidental results of that machinery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The figures which the Minister gave in regard to the number of houses that are not occupied, and in regard to the number of holdings that have not been properly worked, were rather alarming. They certainly show a very disquieting reflection upon the choice of allottees, especially when we find that as large a proportion as 20 per cent. of those allotted holdings which had been inspected should not be carrying out the social principles which they were put in to carry out.  Those figures show that there has been some slipping up: that there has been a <Col N="1176" /> very large proportion of mistakes made in the choice of the persons allotted land.  In my opinion a large portion of those mistakes arose from the policy adopted by the present Government in the early years after it took up office.  In those early years people were allotted land who should never have got land, and people were allotted land who did not intend to work it properly.  That, of course, only applies to a proportion of them. Certain people were, however, given land who should never have got it, while certain other people were put on land with the best intentions in the world, but in their case what happened was that they had not the means to work the land.  One of the great difficulties in regard to a lot of those allotments was this: that people got them who had neither the experience nor the means to work them.  The result was that they were not able to work the land.  So far as all that is concerned, I am merely commenting on the manner in which these things led up to the very disquieting state of affairs which has been outlined by the Minister to-day.</P>
    <P>I want to pass for a moment to another aspect of this measure: to be more strictly accurate, perhaps, I should say to another result of it. This measure deals with land allotted before it has been vested in the allottee.  Once vesting has taken place, there is not, and cannot be under the existing legislation, any method by which the Land Commission, as such, can ensure that such land is properly worked.  Therefore, the effect of this measure, when passed, will be to increase immeasurably the importance of vesting to individual persons.  It will mean that, once an allottee is vested, he is completely free from any restriction. Whether the restrictions are good or bad, does not enter into the question: once he is vested he will be completely free from restrictions.</P>
    <P>I want to ensure, in the working of the Land Commission, that after this Bill has become an Act, vesting will be carried through in accordance with strict principles, and that it will not be possible, either during the lifetime of this Government, or of any other Government, so to arrange that people <Col N="1177" /> will be taken out of their order and given the privilege of vesting before it is their due.  There have been very considerable allotments in the County Kildare.  On the 12th December, 1945, there were some 2,000 holding-allotments which had not yet been vested in the allottees in the County Kildare. There were about double that number in the County Meath, and there were some in County Carlow, County Wicklow and County Dublin.  At the moment I am taking the Leinster counties.  But there have also been in all those counties vestings which have taken place during the years, and I want to ensure in the future that when there are vestings, the vestings will be dealt with on a merit basis rather than on a basis of pull with the particular Government that may happen to be in power at the moment.</P>
    <P>I am going to mention two specific cases for the benefit of the Minister, because I do not want merely to make a vague suggestion without coming down to brass tacks There are two large estates that were taken over, one near Prosperous in Kildare and the other near Kilcock.  Both those estates were taken over 20 years ago, and the vast majority of tenants on those two estates&mdash;the Bury estate and the Cloncurry estate&mdash;were put into their holdings back about the end of 1926 and at the beginning of 1927.  So far as I can ascertain from the tenants, practically none of them has yet been vested, though they have been there for 20 years.  A lot of people in Kildare were disturbed last year to find that, though these examples remain, yet it is common knowledge that there are other similar examples in the county and in other counties&mdash;that people who were only on their holdings for a few years or so were being vested, and when they had been vested were selling their land.</P>
    <P>The Minister will recollect certain questions that were put to him in the other House on the 12th July, 1945. There was an estate near Celbridge.  It was acquired by the Land Commission and in respect of it 16 allotments were made by the Land Commission.  In July, 1945, four out of these 16 allottees who had so far as one can measure from the Minister's answer been in <Col N="1178" /> possession for some eight or nine years, were vested though holdings not more than a few miles away where the people had been for 19 years, as it was then&mdash;20 years now&mdash;had not been vested.  There is another estate very near to where I live, on the main road down to the South; everybody who passes through to the South through the town of Naas, just outside Rathcoole, knows it.  There again holdings were vested in allottees.  There were 12 allottees, nine were allotted on the 19th December, 1935, two in 1937 and one in 1938.  There were three of these holdings vested though again holdings in which people had been resident for 19 years had not been vested.</P>
    <P>I want to ensure, I want to have the complete assurance of the Minister, that that sort of thing will not happen in the future.  We all know, of course, that where an allotment arises out of an exchange of holding and where the former holding of the allottee was a registered holding, the new one must be vested as well, but unfortunately that was not the reason for these cases. I want to be crystal clear in this: I am not charging the Minister personally with graft, but I am saying this, that he is the responsible head of a Department and as the responsible head of the Department it is up to him to see that it does not occur.  It is up to him to see that there will not be cases taken specially out of their order to suit the whim or fancy of, say, a particular Deputy whether that Deputy is Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael, Labour or anything else.  In case anyone should think that I am speaking of my opposite number, Deputy Harris in County Kildare, in respect of these cases, I want to say I am not.  He was not the Deputy responsible in regard to the Celbridge-Ballyulster case.</P>
    <P>I want to know now what steps are going to be taken to ensure that that cannot happen again in County Kildare or elsewhere.  I am not so foolish as to believe that where I come across cases where people have been given facilities which ordinarily are not afforded&mdash; when I come across three or four cases of that, I am not so foolish as to believe that these are all the cases that can possibly exist.  We all know that for every one case, good or bad, we come <Col N="1179" /> across there are 10 others, good or bad, of the same kind happening at the time. The general feeling in regard to the cases I have mentioned&mdash;the Celbridge case&mdash;was that facilities had enabled the two people who had been given land to offer it for sale for £2,850 and £2,500 respectively, solely because these two tenants are intimately related to a former Fianna Fáil Deputy.  The general feeling in regard to the Rathcoole case is that that was the case of a person who was permitted to sell for £3,200 because he was a well-known prominent Fianna Fáil supporter in the place from which he had come to Kildare.</P>
    <P>It was suggested in the other House that these cases occurred during the office of the previous Government.  I do not know whether they did or not. I am not interested in whether they have occurred or not.  It is in the future I am interested.  Whether this Minister or any other Minister is there I want to ensure that vesting which takes the land out of the power of the Land Commission shall be completed in chronological order and that there would be no suggestion of influence of any kind, whether from Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael, Labour, or any other Party, that that influence is not going to have the slightest effect with the Land Commission in making them take cases out of their order.  We all know that the best method of ensuring that something like that cannot possibly happen is publicity. I suggest, therefore, to the Minister that it would ease the public mind very considerably if there was published periodically and laid on the Tables of both Houses of the Oireachtas a list showing the allottees who have been vested by the Land Commission in the preceding three months and showing on the face of that list the dates upon which they had been sold their holdings.</P>
    <P>It should also show that if they were being taken out of order such as for the reason I have mentioned&mdash;to utilise a registered holding in one of the congested districts&mdash;that that reason would be there for everyone to see why the privileges were being given.  Then there could not be, behind the backs <Col N="1180" /> of the Government and behind the backs of the Oireachtas, certain people granted privileges which the ordinary allottee could not get and which if the ordinary allottee who was not vested used would mean that under this Bill he would very probably be put out of his holding if he did not reform.  There are further matters in regard to this Bill which will have to be discussed on Committee.</P>
    <P>It is perhaps as well, as the Minister has mentioned some details in regard to sections, that I should refer to a few of the sections very shortly.  I take it that it is your view, A Chathaoirligh, that on this Bill we cannot run the whole gamut of the Land Acts.  If that were so, we should have a very much longer debate.  I should like the Minister to clarify certain provisions when replying to the debate.  As regards Section 2, I want to know why Clause (ii) of paragraph (ii) is necessary at all. Surely, if a man has a house built for him, it is right he should go and live in it.  The only thing that could be done, or should be done, is to extend the time of the direction by the Land Commission from three months in special circumstances.  We can all understand that a man might have to go back to look after his mother for a period if his father died, but I cannot understand why the complete direction to live in the house should be revoked.</P>
    <P>Section 5 contains a legal monstrosity in one respect.  That is the section where it is declared that what I might roughly describe as fee farm land which has been bought out from the Land Commission is to pass not to the heir-at-law but, as I understand, to the personal representative.  If that is so, it will, perhaps, be more apt that it should pass before vesting in the same way as it will pass after vesting, but I cannot understand why it is necessary to make that retrospective. If my interpretation of the section be correct, it would seem as if very injurious results might follow.  There was a decision fairly recently in the case of a person who held land under a fee farm grant and made application under Section 44 of the Land Act of 1931.  He was declared to come within the provisions of that section.</P>
    <P>That was, of course, untenanted land <Col N="1181" /> held under fee farm grant.  Until vesting, it devolved as real estate.  After vesting, it should devolve as personal estate.  When it was held as real estate, the owner of it as real estate might have parted with his interest to a <i>bona fide</i> purchaser for value.  As I read the section, the interest of that <i>bona fide</i> purchaser might be completely prejudiced because he might have got the conveyance from the wrong person. The phrasing is obscure.  If my interpretation is incorrect, the Minister will have an opportunity of saying so when replying and time will thus be saved in Committee.</P>
    <P>As to Section 6, I am in great difficulty. I do not see how a purchaser of land can protect himself.  The Minister is well aware that the land certificate issued under the 1891 Act is <i>prima facie</i> and conclusive evidence of title. Under sub-section (2) of this section, if I purchase a vested holding and am given a land certificate, that land certificate will not show that there has been an addition to the registered land by the Land Commission for the purpose of making it an economic holding.  I may find that, with the best will in the world, I have purchased under an assignment which is void.  I entirely agree with the principle behind the section.  It is in regard to the machinery that I find difficulty.  I suggest to the Minister that it will be necessary to have, in relation thereto, something in the nature of the certificate granted in respect of income-tax under Section 6 of the Finance Act, 1928, issued by the Land Commission, stating that there has been no additional allotment to the holding, or, in the alternative, that it should be mandatory under statute on the Land Commission to enter the portion or addition on the folio itself.  One of those two things must be dealt with in the statute.  These are matters of detail which, perhaps, are not appropriate to the Second Reading but I think that it is well to mention them.</P>
    <P>I want to make perfectly clear that I entirely approve of the principle behind those sections.  Obviously, where you have a holding which has been enlarged by the allotment of land, if that holding is subsequently split, then, <Col N="1182" /> instead of having only one uneconomic holding, as you had before the allotment, you will have two uneconomic holdings.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I think that the Minister is on quite sound ground there, but I suggest that he has overlooked one matter.  So far as any registered holding is concerned, there is one way in which it might be split by the registered owner without the knowledge of the Land Commission.  If the registered owner charges portion of the holding in favour of a mortgagee and then defaults to the mortgagee, the mortgagee can sell that portion in pursuance of his right to sell, and that is not an assignment, within the meaning of the Act of 1891, for which the consent of the Land Commission is necessary.  In order more accurately to achieve the Minister's laudable desire to prevent the further splitting up of holdings, that matter should be satisfactorily covered in the Bill.</P>
    <P>It is regrettable that a Bill such as this is necessary, but the figures which the Minister has given make it abundantly clear that it is necessary to adopt a new procedure to prevent the social evil of land which has been allotted for the benefit of the country as a whole not being properly worked, and of having empty houses on Land Commission farms throughout the country.  Because it is necessary to do that, I accept the principle behind this measure.  I think that, on Committee Stage, we shall have to make certain that there cannot be a genuine mistake by the Land Commission in operating the provisions of Section 4, and that we shall have a further safeguard in regard to Section 5.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Counihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no love for this Bill, but I am not opposing it. After listening to the statement made by the Minister, I cannot see that he could do anything else.  I have pointed out to successive Ministers on various Land Bills which came before this House that the indiscriminate distribution of land would be most detrimental to our national economy.  I pointed out that it was useless to give land to landless men who had no capital to stock it or buy seeds, manure or implements. <Col N="1183" /> Even though they were getting a present of it&mdash;sometimes more than £1,000&mdash;it was useless to give it to them when they had not the means of working it.  These are the classes of people with whom this Bill is going to deal, but the agitation that has been going on, as everybody knows, is one of the greatest vote-catching stunts for any Government, Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael or Clann na Talmhan&mdash;this advocating the splitting up and division of land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no question about it, anyone who looks at the Order Paper in the Dáil and sees all the questions there at every sitting, particularly from Deputies from the rural districts, and anyone who knows anything about the conditions of the land that they are seeking to have acquired must come to the conclusion that the morality of the majority of Deputies of all Parties has sunk to a great depth&mdash;gone very low indeed.  They are going to any extremity to play up to the people who have votes and have no regard for justice for the people whom they want to dispossess.  I will give a few examples of the injustice of these questions which appear on the Order Paper of the Dáil. One case is that of Michael Begley of Claremorris.  This case was recently discussed in the Dáil in connection with this Bill.  I have a great interest in County Mayo.  I feel I have as good a right to represent County Mayo as any other Deputy because in the 1925 election they put me at the head of the poll.  We here in this House are supposed to represent every county in Ireland and for this reason I thought this case was very unjust and I made inquiries and here are the facts as represented to me.  If I am wrong, the Minister can correct me.  Michael Begley owns a farm near Claremorris of 36 Irish acres.  The Begleys are an old Mayo family.  They have been there for generations.  At one time they owned a great deal of land which was taken from them, from time to time, by the old Congested Districts Boards.  Michael Begley farms these 36 acres in a practical way and to the satisfaction of the Land Commission. <Col N="1184" /> His annuities and rates are paid up-to-date. He does not live on the farm because there is no house on it but I understand he is building one there. He lives with his sisters on a farm convenient to his own.  There are three sisters of his own on this particular farm, two widows and one spinster.  He helps to work this farm for his three sisters and the only farm he owns of his own right is the one of 36 acres. I think this case is most unjust.  It has been pointed out to me that if the Minister did not give such evasive answers to these questions when they are asked about this farm or other farms, the agitation would stop.  At a recent by-election, I understand, one of the candidates definitely promised at a meeting convenient to this particular holding, that if he was elected he would compel the Land Commission to take up Begley's land and give them no satisfaction.  These statements create a great deal of dissension in a locality.</P>
    <P>Another case which was discussed in the Dáil recently was that of a Dublin man, a speculator if you like, who went down to County Offaly and bought a farm there with the full consent of the owner.  After buying this farm and getting possession of it he split it up into 50-acre farms and sold them to local farmers in the district.  The man who bought the farm was satisfied, the men who bought the smaller farms from him were satisfied, and the man who sold the farm originally was satisfied.  All were satisfied except the people who wanted something for nothing.  They started on the T.D.s of the constituency, T.D.s of all Parties, and a cry went out against the Land Commission, against the Minister, against the man who bought the land and sold it and against the farmers who purchased it from him.  That is why I say the morality of our Deputies has sunk very low.  I am glad to be able to say, however, that the Minister on this occasion was not intimidated.  He stuck to his guns and told them he was quite satisfied with the transaction and would be glad if other transactions could be carried out in the same way if possible. That is one up for the Minister.  The most objectionable part played by some of those politicians is their incon- <Col N="1185" /> sistency.  They speak of the three F's &mdash;fair rent, free sale and fixity of tenure.  They are constantly talking about the sacrifices of previous generations of farmers in obtaining these concessions; they are constantly talking of what Davitt, Parnell and the Irish Party had endured to obtain them but they have no consideration for the farmers whose lands they want taken over, confiscated.  It is simply confiscation, because although the Minister promised that anything the Land Commission would take over would be at market value, I have never seen that carried out.  These politicians talk about all the sufferings and tears of our predecessors to obtain these concessions but as far as I can see the three F's have no greater meaning for them, let them be Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael or Farmers, than so much propaganda.</P>

      <P>That is the position so far as Deputies are concerned.  The trouble is that we have not sufficient land to go round.  If we were in Australia, New Zealand or Canada, I suppose there would be no land question, but as we have only 11,500,000 acres of land entirely, we cannot find land for everybody who wants it.  These 11,500,000 acres are divided into 384,563 holdings and of that number there are only 7,226 holdings of 200 acres and upwards. I do not think that any reasonable man or Minister will say that out of 384,563 holdings altogether 7,000 holdings of 200 acres and upwards are out of proportion.  If you continue to split up these 7,000 holdings will it lead to any more prosperity in the country?  Will it lead to more employment and more production?</P>

      <P>This Land Bill is considerably different from previous land Bills with which the Oireachtas had to deal.  Whereas in former cases the Bills were exclusively intended for <Col N="1188" /> the purpose of taking over large tracts of untenanted land and dividing them into small holdings or for the purpose of increasing uneconomic holdings, this Bill is designed to take land from people who were provided with it as a result of former measures, but who have not fulfilled their obligations.  I am not saying that that is not justifiable. From the statement the Minister gave us at the outset, very evidently operations in the matter of land division latterly have seemed to drift in this country.  I agree with Senator Sweetman that while the particular investigations carried out by the Land Commission showed that so many new allottees have proved to be defaulters, if the investigation were made more general the number of defaulters would be found to be still greater.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am afraid this measure has been made necessary because of the interference that has undoubtedly taken place with the administration of the Land Commission and the work of the Land Commission officials.  From my experience of these officials&mdash;and it extends over a considerable period&mdash;I am quite satisfied that where they were allowed to function without let or hindrance, political or otherwise, they invariably gave service that could not be quarrelled with.  I have in mind a case that occurred in my own area over 20 years ago when, during the lifetime of another Government, an agitation was carried on by people living in a townland nearly all of whom were supporters of the Government at the time.  These people's farms were very poor, the poor law valuation of any one of them was not more than £7, and they felt that they were entitled to some consideration when a large estate in the vicinity would be divided. As a result of the agitation&mdash;it was a very mild one, I am glad to say&mdash;the landlord of the particular estate was approached and he agreed to make over sufficient land to ease the wants of these particular people.  Those of us in the area who were interested in the matter brought it under the notice of the Land Commission, or, rather, their officials.  After a very considerable time the Land Commission officials visited the district, carried out investigations and the land was allotted, <Col N="1189" /> and not a solitary tenant from amongst those responsible for the agitation got an acre, but people in another part of the parish were liberally provided for, and rightly provided for, because the holdings they had been farming were worse than those farmed by the people who initiated the agitation which led to the distribution.  Those who initiated the agitation were supporters of the Government while those who benefited by it were supporters of the present Government Party and have continued to support it.  In the present instance, if the Land Commission officials, to whom I pay a tribute, were allowed to function as they functioned in that particular case, there would be no need for this Bill.  While I have every sympathy with the Minister and compliment him on the steps he has taken to remedy an abuse, I feel that the remedies he is taking are rather drastic.  If Land Commission officials can be influenced as they have been influenced to make such a-I was going to say mess-of the distribution of the holdings that occasioned this Bill, they might similarly be influenced to commit a wrong so far as Section 4 is concerned.</P>
    <P>I submit that before any landholder is compelled to give up land allotted to him he should have an opportunity of having his case presented before some judicial tribunal where he would have an opportunity of being represented by legal aid and of thus having his case put forward in a legal way.  It may happen that as far as some of the defaulters are concerned, the circumstances which obtained in the last four or five years may have been responsible for their defaulting.  Many people were unable to work their land as they would like to because of the absence or scarcity of fertilisers, machinery and labour in certain rural areas.  All these matters would be considered in a more impartial manner by a judge or a magistrate than they could be considered by a Department official.  I am quite satisfied that this Bill is necessary and although the Minister brought it before the House with the qualification that it passed through all its stages without amendment in the other House I hope that before it <Col N="1190" /> leaves the Seanad one or two of the objectionable features will be modified and that an opportunity will be given to people who come within the provisions of the Bill of making a case so that they may not be dispossessed without getting a chance of being heard in their own defence.  I have no objection to the Bill.  My only objection is that its provisions are rather drastic and I hope the Minister will see his way to have these objectionable features made more acceptable before the Bill becomes law.</P>

      <P>I do not know that there can be any enthusiasm on any side of the House for a measure like this.  It does not do credit to anyone that such a law should have to be passed by the Oireachtas.  Wherever the fault lies, whether in the administration of the Land Commission or whether in the interference by responsible people with those who are charged with the obligation of allotting land to landless men or uneconomic holdings, there is a cause in this measure for a much deeper examination of our whole approach to this problem.  It is a definite confession of failure on the part of the Minister, on the part of the Department dealing with this problem and on the part of the Governments who have held office in this country up to the present that they should now be faced with such a situation as this.  Perhaps it may be that we have not got all the facts.  In that regard I would like some further information from the Minister if it is available.  Something must be wrong when we are told that there are out of all these holdings 1,620 people who have failed to work their land and 1,290 houses unoccupied-I think that is what the Minister said.  I would like to hear something more from the Minister about all this.  I would like to hear something more about the causes which have led up to this situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it is a very drastic step for the State to take to give possession of property to someone and afterwards to have to take it away again.  I do not know if there is any record of the same sort of activity on the part of the <Col N="1191" /> State up to the present, and I think it is a step the State can only take with regret on the part of all of us on any side of the House.  It is undesirable. Steps should be taken to see that we shall not be confronted with a situation like this again.  I remember on one occasion in this House a good many years ago, that I made an estimation of the cost of the distribution of land to uneconomic holders and landless men, and as far as my recollection goes these holdings cost the State something like £1,000.  When I see so many people who have failed in these new holdings I ask myself how far was their failure due to a failure on the part of the people who investigated them, or selected them, or exercised such pressure as to enable them to get possession of these holdings or how far was their failure due to the fact that they never got a decent start.  I would like to know what the Minister can tell us about that.  I feel myself from the study I have made of these cases that while the Land Commission and the Government of the day went a considerable distance towards giving these men an opportunity, they never completed the job.  They put these men on the land and gave them the bare walls of a house, but beyond that they had nothing but the health that God had given them.  They may have had a half-stocked farm with few tools to work with, and they struggled on in great adversity against a market with falling prices, until they reached a stage where they could not hold their heads up any longer.  It is quite conceivable that in the case of a number of these holdings that have not been worked, that, if we had enough of the back history, we would find that we are going to pass an Act to dispossess men of farms, because in the first instance the redistribution of the land was not in itself sound.  We may, therefore, be going to do a very great injustice and to establish a principle which I should not like to see this State establish.  Accordingly, I would like to have some further information on that aspect of this whole problem.</P>
    <P>I am quite satisfied it is true that a number of men were given holdings <Col N="1192" /> entirely because of the political pressure that was exercised.  I cannot say that I have any great personal experience of the distribution of land, because in my county people often have to look for land outside its borders. But a few small parcels of land were distributed here and there in the county.  With reference to the remarks of Senator Sweetman, I can recall a rather strange instance myself of somewhat similar partial administration in this whole matter.  I know an individual who received a holding in my county not very long ago.  He is a very prominent and active supporter of the present Administration.  A short time ago I made inquiries as to how he was getting on.  I was told that not only had he taken down, and sold off, the buildings on the farm, but that he had managed to sell the farm as well. I do not know if that man could have been more than five or six years in possession of the holding.  I do not know what he netted, but in a case like that would it not be a far more decent thing for the State to give him a grant of some sort rather than set up the immoral principle of enabling him to enjoy something which other people cannot have conceded to them?</P>
    <P>I would like to support the point of view put forward by Senator S.T. Ruane.  Personally, I do not like the position of an official coming down and telling me how I am to manage my farm. I have no quarrel with officials generally. I think that, on the whole, if officials are at liberty to do their job according to their judgment, according to the reason and justice that God has instilled into them, they will do it with credit to the country.  On the other hand, I am not satisfied that it should be the complete and absolute responsibility of any official in any Department to come down the country and say to a farmer &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo; as to whether he is carrying out on his farm good husbandry or bad.  I think that is a principle that this House ought to reject every time it is confronted with it.  I have no reason to display antipathy to officials.</P>
    <P>I do want to say, however, that I know a very good farmer in my own county who had this sort of experience. <Col N="1193" /> He came to me last year, I think, about the problem of his tillage.  He said that he had been trying to grow wheat, that it had failed with him, and that if he was to continue trying to grow it it would mean wasting his land.  The man had tilled the area of his land that he was obliged to do in order to comply with the tillage regulations.  He told me that he could not grow wheat.  I said to him that it was not really sensible to ask a man like him who could manage his farm as well as any man and better than most, to do that.  He said that he had the inspector with him some days previously.  The inspector told him that he would have to do it. The man told the inspector that it was a failure with him last year, and would be a failure this year again.  The inspector answered that that was not his responsibility, that the farmer had got to do it, and that he did not mind what happened about it.</P>
    <P>It is easy for a civil servant, when he goes to a certain individual to discover whether or not he is managing his farm in accordance with the principles of good husbandry, to get the idea that the man is not doing that.  It should not be forgotten that all sorts of factors enter into a man's capacity to manage his farm in accordance with the concepts of good husbandry.  That is what I fear in connection with the administration of this measure: that a man who may have got a holding may not be managing it well, first of all, because of the problem relating to capital that confronted him at the start.  Another factor could be that he might not be awfully popular with some of the boys who shape opinion in the district: the boys who shape opinion because they want to get something which the neighbour has got.  People of that type can make quite a fuss.  Is there not the possibility that if you put absolute responsibility on an official to decide whether a man is to be allowed to keep his holding or to be ejected from it, the same kind of pressure which was used to put him into the holding may not be exercised to put him out of it?  I do not see any evidence of a change of mind or heart, or of a reversion to high principles, that we are going to be saved from that in the <Col N="1194" /> future.  There is much more of the mentality, so far as my observations go, that if people want to get anything they must all be of the one mind.  If they are, then they can manage to wangle anything.  I do not want to give any instances of that now, but I do know that that idea has taken possession of many of our people.  It may be different elsewhere.</P>
    <P>I feel very definitely that where a man is to be ejected from his holding in which he has some legal rights he ought to be able to bring an appeal to a court and there make his case.  I do not know whether or not the Land Commission are going to take into account the fact that many of these men did not get a fair start.  Some of them may have been put into poor holdings. In a case like that what could a man do unless he had stock and farmyard manure?  He could not manage the holding unless he had got the tools and equipment.  There is also the question of a man's health.  How could a man's health or that of members of his family be good if he is not able to get good food out of his holding?  You can have a lot of illness in a family, illness which would make all the difference in the world between success and failure in the management of a holding.  I do not know if any of these considerations will weigh with the people who will decide whether a man is to be allotted a holding or not.</P>
    <P>On the Minister's figures it may be that some ne'er-do-wells got parcels of land.  Perhaps in other instances they were wasters and good wanglers who got out of the holdings that they had, and managed to get good holdings.  If that be so, then part of my case falls to the ground.  Nevertheless, there will be the residue of people who ought not to be put in the position of feeling that whether they can remain in the holding or not will depend on the prejudice of a neighbour: or whether or not those people can exercise such pressure as will make sure that John will be put out.  That would be a disastrous spirit to get a hold in the countryside.  I want to say definitely that, even from the point of view of prestige, and of holding confidence in <Col N="1195" /> the country, it is of vital importance that the Land Commission should not themselves be the final arbiters in this matter, that there should be a court before which those people can make their case.  One cannot disagree with the principle that if the State, out of its resources, makes a grant of land to a man, and that he makes a bad use of it and wastes it, that the State cannot abandon its responsibility in the matter.  I want to suggest that before the State determines that the inevitable is to happen, that before they evict people and leave them on the roadside, all the circumstances ought to be taken into account. I do not know that we have heard the full case from the Minister here to-day.  Personally, I do not think that we have.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcGee" hpid="Mr. McGee Mr. McGee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGee</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I should add my voice to those of Senator Baxter and Senator Ruane in urging that for the sake of the credit of us all and of the entire land question some court should operate before people are deprived of their land.  The Minister once said here that the one person who throughout the whole operation of the Land Commission activities since 1923, shone out as understanding all about the land question was the late Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Hogan.  I do not know whether the Minister wishes to add himself now so that we might have two such persons.  I think, however, this Bill is proof positive that, whatever tribute the Minister was paying to Deputy Hogan, the whole system was a colossal failure and that the foundation on which Deputy Hogan started was wrong.  It leaves itself open to the charges that were made to-day which were also made in the Dáil and largely unanswered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The division of land should be decided in open court and on oath.  There have been divisions that have been a credit to the inspectors that made them.  In fact I may say that I never saw an inspector who was not largely a credit but at the same time they have made some sub-divisions that are a naked and unabashed affliction. That has not been disclosed here <Col N="1196" /> because these people work themselves up in life into a position of considerable success and in several instances they could not be deprived of their land.  The facts are that this land question should have been started on a solid foundation and, certainly for the sake of the credit and ownership of land, people should not be deprived of it without the operation of a court and without evidence on oath.  I have sometimes heard it suggested that parish councils should be consulted before any applicant is given land, that he should be approved by the parish council, where it exists, before getting land.  Possibly that might work but I would be in favour of getting down to the question of evidence which the applicant himself could give in his own interest before this question is decided and before the taxpayer is asked to foot the bill.</P>
    <P>In my position as an auctioneer I and the other members of that calling see all the returns.  And we are in a position to give the applicants or the Land Commission the benefit of that. Down through the years there is the promise to pay on the headland and we find that in thousands of lettings there is seldom a defaulter for the land.  I think we can give unquestioned evidence of the value to the country of the applicant who will come forward, backed by his paid bills released from the auctioneers or through the auctioneer's banks and released to the credit of the individual who has made his livelihood in the competition he meets for the purchase of land in the previous years.</P>
    <P>For these reasons I am perfectly certain that this Bill is necessary but we must remember that many social questions and many difficulties arise. Some time there is much keenness and spite and sometimes an individual may not want to see another man obtaining land.  Before, however, there is any wholesale depriving of people of their land, evidence should be given and in my opinion the whole decision should be taken as a result of evidence on oath.  Senator Ruane went into the matter as also did Senator Baxter. The list of cases mentioned by Senator Sweetman are contemptible and I think it would be a healthier atmosphere if <Col N="1197" /> everybody requiring land went on oath and if everybody who is to be deprived of land should have their case decided in the same solid way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kingsmill Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Sweetman anticipated me in calling to the attention of the Minister what I think is a defect in Section 6.  I wish to emphasise the remarks made by Senator Sweetman on that section because so far as I can see there is no protection whatever for the <i>bona fide</i> purchaser.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Assume the case of a man who is registered as a full owner with the Land Registry.  He has received from the Land Commission promise of an additional portion of land for the enlargement of his holding.  There is on the register no note to that effect.  The purchaser comes along anxious to buy the original holdings and he finds a perfectly clean folio.  He pays his money, he gets possession and he himself is registered as the full owner. The original owner puts his money in his pocket and goes off to America. Subsequently the newcomer is confronted with the fact that an application has been made for the enlargement of the holding when additional land has been allotted.  But there has been no vesting order and yet by the operation of sub-section (2) the transfer of the land on the original folio is completely void.  I think that is a case which, unless amendment is made, is likely to happen.  I could introduce a number of amendments designed to avoid such a contingency but this is eminently a case in which the Minister should introduce his own amendment.  He could do it either by putting in protection for <i>bona fide</i> purchasers or, as was suggested by Senator Sweetman, by providing that caution or inhibition must be entered by the Land Commission when they proposed to give the extra holdings and until such is entered the provisions of sub-section (2) of Section 6 should be ineffective. Or he could do that by providing that there would be put on the face of the folio a note something in the nature of what we are familiar with in relation to land purchase folios <Col N="1198" /> stating that the lands in the folio are subject to the prohibition on sub-letting contained in the 1923 Act.  It is for the Minister to adopt the proper method but that he should secure the result necessary is the important matter.</P>
    <P>One further matter occurred to me when listening to the speeches of the various Senators here to-day.  As they spoke there came before my eyes the vision of a road in West Galway on which have been erected a number of excellent houses and a number of excellent outhouses but attached to them is nothing but strips of absolutely bare bog undrained, unfertilised and unlimed. I have seen attempts made to put the land into good heart and for years I have seen the land go back and back because the occupants had not either the knowledge or the capital to do the necessary drainage and to apply the necessary lime and other materials for bringing the land into good heart.</P>
    <P>I do not think that such a strip of mountain should ever have been chosen for building houses and for settling people on unless the Government were prepared to choose a very particular type of settler and to give them assistance to engage in the rather thankless job of trying to bring bare, solid, acid peat into some kind of cultivation.  I know that that can be done and that people have done it, but they were people of considerable intelligence, pertinacity and capital.  In the selection of land which is to be granted and in the selection of people to whom it is to be granted I think a certain difficulty has been overlooked.  The type of allottee must be suited to the land allotted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Madden</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to keep the House very long.  I am glad to welcome this Bill.  I was listening to the Minister when the Bill was being put before the House, and I think he brought in an atmosphere which would be welcome in the country.  He has faced up with realism to the whole position, in my opinion.  Listening to some of the speeches which Senators have made here it appears to me that <Col N="1199" /> they can see the beam in the Minister's eye without seeing the mote in their own.  I am delighted with the terms of this Bill, and there is only one point I want to draw the Minister's attention to.</P>
      <P>I know many who during the lifetime of the previous Government got land. Perhaps they were adherents to the policy of that Government: I do not know.  I never ask a man to what Party he belongs, and indeed I do not care a damn to what Party any man belongs.  My concept of life is that if you can do a good turn you should do it, and I never question a man as to what his allegiance is or to what Party he belongs.  I know some people who got land and who, after the statutory period for the vesting of the land had passed, have sold and realised that land.  I do not think some of these people had any political convictions. If they had they changed their beliefs. I believe that they simply changed horses and Parties with a hope.  I know some of them, and on one occasion I met the present Minister in another place, and I told him of some of these gentlemen who had come to me and who were applicants for land when it was available in the area.  I told him about these cases of people who had been trying to get land in that way and I was much impressed by his answer.  He said: &ldquo;Give me the names of those gentlemen and they will never get a foot of land from the Land Commission.&rdquo; I hope, indeed, they will not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure the Minister is aware that there are perhaps such applicants who having disposed of land previously secured from the Land Commission and having joined another Party in the hope that they will secure land through that Party&mdash;the present Party&mdash;are now again looking for land.  I want to draw his attention to that.  I know quite a number of these people and I trust that they will not be successful. I heard people talk here about the number of houses that are vacant but I heard nobody speak of the hundreds of houses that have not been vacated and of the many people who have got land <Col N="1200" /> and who have justified the lettings that were made.  There is only one other matter I wish to mention.  I believe that five acres of land for those who come within the category of the working or labouring class is insufficient.  It provides no encouragement or incentive for them to go out and do something which would keep themselves and their families in frugal comfort.  I think that when the working classes are being considered in the allocation of land that the Land Commission ought to be disposed to give more than five acres. Five acres is too insignificant and trifling.</P>
    <P>I think Senator Counihan ought to bear in mind that the cause of neglect in preserving the population of this country may be traced more to the farming community than to the working classes.  I am afraid the Irish nationals would largely disappear only for the working classes and they ought to be encouraged by getting more land.  The whole atmosphere created by Senator Counihan seemed to be that we should encourage the disappearance of the people and the reappearance of the bullock.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephJohnston" hpid="Professor Johnston Professor Johnston">
      <NameTxt>Professor Johnston</NameTxt>
      <P>The object of this Bill is to get rid of some thousands of allottees who have failed to work their land in a workmanlike manner or in accordance with the principle of good husbandry, as the phrase goes. Now this Bill is an attempt to deal with a minor problem which arises because of the attempt to deal with the major problem being not entirely satisfactory. I do not propose to deal with the major problem, but there are some aspects of the minor problem to which I would like to refer.  I would like in particular to say that while this minor problem is a very real problem the machinery to deal with it as proposed in this measure is not the kind that commends itself to me, and the Bill itself would be quite unnecessary if the approach to the major problem had been as it should have been.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are, perhaps, a thousand allottees or more who are not making sufficient use of their holdings.  I could base from reliable statistics a case to <Col N="1201" /> prove that there are probably 10,000 or 20,000, or perhaps 100,000 people in this country who are not making adequate use of their land and should be dispossessed by administrative means.  If the method contemplated in this Bill was applied to them it would give rise to a vigorous and angry protest but the method and principle of this Bill are not any less objectionable when applied only to 1,000 allottees. The facts which I am going to give will show that there are thousands of people not making adequate use of their land and they are not only large owners, large farmers, but others too.  From our knowledge of different parts of the country and from reading Lamartine Yates on &ldquo;Food Production in Western Europe&rdquo; and from other sources of information we know that in 1937 the net output per acre in our country was about £4.  In Britain it was £6; in Germany, £8, in France, £8; in Denmark, £10.  It was £14 in Belgium and Holland and £15 in Switzerland.  The net output per person occupied in 1937 was £76 in our case; £70 in Germany; £90 in France; £100 in Belgium; £120 in Holland; £155 in Denmark and £200 in Great Britain.  I know you can prove anything by means of statistics, but in face of these it would be possible to build up a very strong case in favour of dispossessing this section of agricultural occupiers who are not pulling their weight, and it would not be an answer to say that there is not enough land to go round, and that is why output per person is low.  Actually, in comparison with other European countries, there is more land per head of agricultural population in Eire than there is in most European countries. There, again, I should like to put on record the statistics.  The number of persons agriculturally occupied per 100 acres of farm-land is: in Switzerland, 14.1; Belgium, 13.3; Germany, 12.7; the Netherlands, 11.2; France, 8.5; Denmark, 6.3; Great Britain, 3.0, and Eire, 6.  The figures relate, of course, to one of the immediate pre-war years.</P>
    <P>In face of those statistics, it is quite evident that, from the point of view of the country as a whole, there is no real problem of agricultural congestion, <Col N="1202" /> though there is a problem of greater mobility of agricultural labour and some geographical distribution of persons available for agricultural work.  I do not want to go into that at any length but I think the real problem is how to maximise output per person and output per acre. I fear that this Bill is making only a very minor contribution to that real problem.</P>
    <P>Perhaps, one of the reasons why these allottees have not been in every case successful&mdash;perhaps the principal reason&mdash;is that the method of choice of allottees is administrative rather than economic and because the person who is successful in his application for an allotment is getting something for nothing to the extent of some £600 to £900 per allotment, in capital value. Expressed on an acreage basis, that means that the successful allottee is getting at an annuity of, perhaps, £1 per acre something for which, if he were paying the full economic cost, he would be paying £3 per acre.  In other words, the whole system involves a subsidy of, perhaps, £2 per acre for every successful allottee.  When you have that situation, in which a person who is sufficiently persuasive can get something for nothing, you have the danger of favouritism.  I have no personal knowledge of any case in which favouritism was actually exercised but the system itself is open to favouritism.  Under the system, it is quite impossible to eliminate the suspicion of favouritism and quite impossible to eliminate accusations of favouritism.  I should like to see both the suspicion and the possibility of favouritism completely eliminated from the choice of allottees.  If a man gets for £1 an acre or thereabouts&mdash; I am using those figures purely for the purpose of illustration&mdash;something which he can turn round and let, under present conditions, for £5 an acre, without doing a hand's turn of work, you are putting a very considerable temptation in the way of that man and making it well worth his while to sit back and do nothing. Human virtue is hardly sufficiently great to resist the temptation to take the easy way.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1203" /> If you made him pay the full £3 an acre which it cost the State to provide the land for him, then the margin between that £3 and the £5 which he might get by sub-letting would be so small that he would have little or no temptation to sit back and do no work. He would have to work the land according to the principles of good husbandry if he wanted to get an income out of it.  As things stand, paying £1 an acre and getting, perhaps, £5 an acre, he makes £4 by doing nothing.  If he worked the land in accordance with the principles of good husbandry, there is no reason why his gross return per acre should not be about £10 rather than £4.  In that case, the difference between the £3 he should pay and the £10 he should get by working the land properly, would be £7 an acre, which is considerably more than the difference between the £1 he now pays and the £5 or thereabouts he gets by letting the land on the 11-months system.</P>
    <P>The way to solve this problem is to eradicate its roots.  That would involve changing the whole method and principle by which the annuities are calculated in reference to those successful applicants for land.  In fact, I think that the Bill, in its present form, deals only with symptoms rather than with full economic and social causes. To that extent, it will produce minor results from the point of view of the national interest, as a whole, although, undoubtedly, there is a temptation to do something with those people who have done their best to &ldquo;do&rdquo; the State.  The way to approach the matter of these defaulting allottees&mdash;allottees who have failed to carry out their contract with the Land Commission&mdash; would be to say to them: &ldquo;You have got something for £1 an acre&rdquo;, or whatever the figure might be, &ldquo;which is actually costing the community £3 per acre.  You have failed to carry out the conditions under which you got that bounty from the State.  Therefore, the Land Commission propose to increase your annuity to £3 an acre&rdquo;, or whatever the full amount would be which would cover the whole annual service of the capital cost of putting <Col N="1204" /> that land in the possession of the allottee.  The Land Commission would take power to increase the annuity to the full economic level and would then say to the defaulting allottee: &ldquo;You have power either to get on or get out; in other words, you can carry on on that basis or you can freely sell whatever your equity in the land may be, subject to that higher annuity; we shall put no obstacle in the way of your selling whatever interest may remain to you after the annuity has been raised to that permanent level&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In that way, you would compel these defaulting allottees either to work the land more efficiently or to get out at whatever might be the market value of their holdings, subject to the higher annuity.  Whoever bought subject to the higher annuity would, probably, be a person of greater substance and more agricultural knowledge who would be able to make a living out of the land even with the higher annuity.  The price he would pay would be very much less because of the fact that the land was carrying an annuity of £3 instead of £1.  It is most undesirable, and quite immoral, that these beneficiaries of the State's bounty should, under any circumstances, be allowed to cash-in on what the State has given them.  The best method of preventing this from happening would be to raise the annuity to the full economic level in the case of defaulting allottees and then give them freedom of sale in respect of the amount of equity which will be left to sell, which will be comparatively trifling.  It would be most improper that any person should be allowed to cash-in on the capitalised value of the difference between the present annuities and the full economic annuity, whatever that might be.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>We, of course, all agree with the principle of the Bill and what it implies.  I think we are in a position to congratulate the Land Commission, its advisers and its inspectors down the country as well as the Minister on the fact that they have been successful in selecting allottees, 84 per cent. of whom have been successful.  I do not know any other occupation or profession, including even the old farmers, <Col N="1205" /> of whom it could be said that 84 per cent. were successful in managing their business.  It represents a very high percentage and even though there is a considerable number of defaulters, I think that 16 per cent. is not above the average number of defaulters in any other business or profession. I think, therefore, that the Land Commission and its inspectors are to be congratulated on the discretion which they exhibited in selecting allottees, 84 per cent. of whom were successful.  There has been an innuendo in some of the speeches made here that the defaulters were to be found principally amongst those who were put in the possession of land by political pressure and also that most of them were to be found amongst the followers of the present Government.  I am in a position to state, after an experience of the small amount of land divided in my own area, that that is not the case.  At least 50 per cent. of those who have been defaulters, in the matter of working the land according to proper ideas of husbandry, never supported the Fianna Fáil policy.</P>
      <P>Default may be attributed just to human nature and the follower of one Party is just as likely to be an offender as the follower of another.  I think that when this measure becomes law and when those who have flagrantly misused what the country and the taxpayer have been good enough to give them, are removed from the land, that the percentage of success amongst the allottees will be raised to at least 95 per cent. and that we shall have done a very good day's work.</P>

      <P>I hesitate to speak on this question of land policy, even considering the limitations of the present Bill, because I speak as a dispossessed landholder, one whose family for two generations lost possibly two-thirds of their income under a policy which has brought about the lamentable conditions we see to-day.  I am sorry that Senator Counihan is not now present because I think we are entitled to be regarded as veterans in our opposition to this land policy. Ever since the State was founded, and <Col N="1206" /> even before that, in the early days of anti-landlordism, we found Senator Counihan in the ranks of the antagonists. The irony of the situation was aptly illustrated a short time ago when I was able to quote the identical speech I made 20 years ago against the policy of the then Government in support of their policy to-day.  I only mention that as showing the morass into which we have got.  We have got into a state of what might be called psychological confusion on this matter. Some Senators want to see totalitarian methods of dealing with land. I certainly have an alternative, which I think is infinitely preferable, but by the totalitarian method we would probably get what Senator Johnston says we have not got&mdash;and that is increased production on the land.  There is a great deal to be said for a policy which in the interests of the State aims directly at maximum production. A totalitarian policy would get us that but what does this Bill get us? It gets neither one nor the other. You get a lot of people who are not qualified to hold land pulling political strings to get favours from those in power and getting those favours for nothing.  Therefore, we see the necessity for legislation of this kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would ask the Minister in replying to say whether this evil is confined merely to what he calls allottees. Surely tenants who have been vested are no longer allottees and many of them are doing the same sort of thing as those against whom this Bill is directed.  I venture to say that a large part of the evil which Senator Johnston pointed out&mdash;our low level of production and comparatively small numbers supported by the land&mdash;is due to this policy of putting on the land people who are not qualified and giving them something for nothing.  So surely as you get something for nothing, you will not make the best use of what you get. That is the moral to be drawn from two generations of our policy.  What is the remedy?  It can only be slow, but it can be gradual.  I do not feel that my proposals are likely to be accepted because they imply Ministers free from all political influence.  It may be that in order to do the right thing, you will have to <Col N="1207" /> eliminate politics, eliminate the fact of political bribery in connection with land.  Assume you can do that, and there is one other thing that can be done.  You can get private sale and free sale in land.  I give you an example of where a beginning might be made.  Let the Government secure the land, divide it up and then let them offer that land either for sale, not necessarily to the highest bidder, but to a person who is prepared to pay for it.  If you like, make it a condition that no claimant shall be considered who has already a certain amount of land.  To my mind it is essential that a person who is put on the land should have a financial interest in it, that he should put his money into the land to a greater or lesser extent.  Unless you have that, you will not have the driving force which is necessary to promote production. Meanwhile, for the sake of consistency and in order to justify this objectionable method of control, this Bill should be supported.  If we are ever going to get the land position healthy, we must get away from all control.  You must vest the land, allow free sale in the land and gradually reach a position where we shall have no Land Commission at all and even face the risk in the dim and distant future of reviving landlordism again.</P>

    <P>D'éirigh le roinnt daoine talamh a fháil ó Choimisiún na Talún agus níor choimhlíon siad an connradh a rinne siad leis an gCoimisiún.  An ceart na daoine seo a fhágáil i seilbh na talún atá i gceist?  Sílim go bhfuil an Seanad, ar fad beagnach, ar aonintinn nach ceart.  A bhfuil an Bille atá os ár gcomhair ceaptha sa tslí is go mbeidh ar chumas an Aire na daoine mí-fheiliúnacha atá i gceist againn a <Col N="1208" /> bhriseadh ar a ngabháltais?

Creidim féin gur scéal an-sásúil é, nár theip ach ar timpeall 16 per cent. de na sealbhaithe a ndualgaisí a chomhlíonadh mar ba chóir.  In áit bheith éadóchasach mí-shásta faoin dóigh ina bhfuil an scéal, is dóigh liom, gur ceart dúinn bheith sásta.</P>
    <P>I would like to join in the welcome that has been extended to this Bill by practically every section that has spoken so far.  The Bill is very limited in scope, so much so that I wonder why the time of the Seanad should have been occupied for so long in discussing it, especially on a Second Reading.  The principle of it is very simple.  The scope of the Bill is very restricted.  Some people, it seems, have got land who have not justified their getting it, and in view of the fact that the supply of land is so restricted, and in view of the objects underlying land division, it is not advisable that they should remain in possession of their holdings.  Why should they be allowed to retain these holdings, having failed to fulfil their contracts?  That is the simple issue under this Bill.  Some people seem to have got an idea from the figures given by the Minister that the position generally in regard to the occupants of these holdings is very bad, and that this question of land division has been a failure.  The Minister was rather sudden in coming to his statistics this evening, and I doubt if I have taken them down correctly, but if those I have before me are correct, it seems to me that there is no reason for alarm but, on the contrary, every reason to feel satisfied.  If we look at the matter statistically the number of failures is unimportant, but socially on the other hand, the number of failures may be very important.  One bad apple in a barrel can destroy the whole barrel. <Col N="1209" /> One occupier abusing the rights given to him, misusing the land given to him, can have a bad influence on the remainder of those who got land and who are doing their best to fulfil their contracts. Socially it may be an evil, and if the evil is there it ought to be eradicated. Most of the discussion seems to have been taken up with the making of charges that unsuitable and incompetent people got their holdings through the influence of Fianna Fáil clubs.  That, I think, is a most contemptible insinuation.  No justification whatever is given for it.  I know of many cases of Fianna Fáil supporters I have met who have been dissatisfied because they did not get land, while people who were not supporters of Fianna Fáil did get holdings.  I am aware of instances where Fianna Fáil clubs have broken up because of dissatisfaction on this matter; because they felt that supporters of other Parties were getting land in preference to them.  If people are going to make charges such as have been made here this evening, and if people are going to impugn the morality of public representatives, as was done this evening, they ought to substantiate their charges.  I do not look lightly on Senator Counihan or anyone else standing up here and impugning the morality of members of the Dáil in the manner and to the extent to which they were impugned to-day.  It is unfair that the morality of a body of public representatives should be impugned in the way it has been impugned to-day.</P>
    <P>I remember some years ago when I first became aware of this problem I was giving a public lecture in a technical school in a certain rural area. When I had finished, the chairman, a very well known and highly respected parish priest, got up to speak on the lecture.  I did not know what his politics were then and I do not know what his politics are now, but I think I would be safe in venturing the opinion that he was not a strong supporter of Fianna Fáil.  In the course of his remarks he drew the attention of his audience to the fact that in his particular parish a number of people had obtained holdings and that they were not using these holdings in the way they should.  He asked his <Col N="1210" /> audience there and then whether what he said was true or not and there was a chorus from the hall that he was right and that what he said was true. Later on a young man drew the attention of the audience to the fact that the parish priest himself had supported some of these people who were looked on as undesirable allottees.  The chairman admitted openly that he had supported these people but made the remark that he could not be aware that these people would have turned out as they did.</P>
    <P>I do not know what care the inspectors of the Land Commission can exercise, but it seems to me that we will always be faced with a problem of this kind&mdash;unsuitable people getting possession of holdings and not fulfilling their contracts for one reason or another. I have tried to find out what number of holdings has been created by the Land Commission.  If we could get that number of holdings and get an average of the people who have failed to fulfil their contracts, I believe that instead of the Bill being the cause of regret as has been suggested, it would be a cause of congratulation.  I do not think I have anything more to say except to hope that all the compliments paid to the Minister will not have the effect of making his head swell.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayden</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to say a few words on this particular Bill.  I say that it is a regrettable Bill, but I think we have no other alternative.  I come from a small county, County Carlow. There is not much land divided in that county, and indeed I would like to see more land divided there.  Last October I went to some of the lands that were divided there and on one farm I saw cars taking the corn away from the land.  The man who owned the land was not able to till it himself.  I think it was appalling to see the way that farm was being used&mdash;taking away the crops to manure the other man's land, and leaving his own in a state of starvation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I read the debates on this Bill which took place in the other House.  Some of the statements made there surprised me a good deal.  I would like to be honest in any statement I make. About eight or ten years ago a farm of <Col N="1211" /> land adjacent to where I live was divided.  I had a labour club there, and I sent in the names of four, five or six good labouring men who would have made good allottees.  Three Fianna Fáil men came to me and asked me if I would send in their names.  I said I would, and I did so.  As Senator Madden has said, I never ask a man what his political affiliations are.  If I can do him a good turn I will do it.  I regard every man as my neighbour.  I was greatly surprised to find that the Labour men and the Fianna Fáil men were turned down and did not get any of this land.  Men who are supporters of Fine Gael got it.  I must say that they were good allottees.  Now that the emergency is over we hope that there will be a more widespread division of land.  Senator Counihan talked about the big ranches.  Instead of these we want more people on the land, and not have them going away on the emigrant ships.</P>
    <P>I am sorry to say we have many bad allottees.  On the other hand we have a number of good allottees in my district. There has been a good deal of talk here to-day about landless men.  I know a landless man in my district living in a labourer's cottage.  He got 20 acres of land, and it is a credit to him to see the way he is working it.  He is going around now trying to get the Land Commission to give him another 20 acres.  As regards these allottees, I want to bring to the Minister's notice that too many old bachelors are getting these houses and land.  The allotments should be reserved for men with working families.  We have enough bachelors as it is.  I trust that the Minister will attend to that point.  I am a new member of the House, and want to say that when I made a complaint to a certain Labour Deputy in my constituency about the division of the land to which I referred earlier, he said to me: &ldquo;Do not run down the Minister for Lands; he is an honest man.&rdquo;  I accept what the Labour Deputy said to me because he knows the Minister better than I do. The Minister has said that this is not a punitive measure, but rather one that is intended to bring about a reformation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1212" /> We have heard a lot of talk about evictions.  How can you evict people who are not living in those houses, which are very fine ones indeed?  The houses and the land cost the State anything from £300 to £1,000 each.  It is surprising that so many allottees do not show appreciation of that.  They should be thankful and work the land to advantage, and not be leaving the houses in a derelict condition.  Those Land Commission houses are well built.  It is a terrible calamity to see a number of people leaving them vacant.  I know that the Minister will not be too drastic in operating this measure.  I wish it every success.</P>

      <P>I agree with what Senator Sweetman says about Section 5. Possibly it would be well to provide that if there was a sale of a holding that, before it went through, it would have to be sanctioned&mdash;that is on the question of the descent of land.  With regard to Section 6, I think the difficulty could be easily got over because in investigating title the purchaser's solicitors must always ask if there has been any allotment of land by the Land Commission.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>By producing a letter to the Secretary of the Land Commission. I agree with the suggestion that a note ought to be put on the folio of each person who gets an addition of land to the effect that nothing can be done with this land without notice to the Land Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was surprised to hear all that was said with reference to the allottees. That matter was thrashed out very fully in the Dáil where it was favourably answered.  In the first place, I should say that it was irrelevant because it had nothing to do with the Bill, except perhaps that Senator Baxter made it relevant to a certain extent by suggesting that allotments of land were given dishonestly, and that this Bill might be used to deprive tenants in the same dishonest way of the holdings that have been given to them.  The Senators who spoke on the Bill and suggested dishonesty on the <Col N="1213" /> part of the present Government in appointing wrong allottees through political influence and power overlooked not alone the debate in the Dáil, which I am sure they had read, but the Acts passed by the Oireachtas.  This Government came into office in 1932, and almost immediately introduced a Bill which was passed through both Houses of the Oireachtas and which deprived the Minister for Lands of all power whatsoever.  It vested that power in the commissioners.</P>
    <P>The suggestion was made that the commissioners are politicians, that they are Fianna Fáil politicians, and that they have used their powers to give land to people who did not deserve it. In other words, that 16 per cent. of the people who failed must have been Fianna Fáil people and that they got land because they were Fianna Fáil: that it was given to them by the commissioners knowing that they were unworthy to get land and ought not to have been given it.  Even Senator Sir John Keane suggested that there should be no suspicion: that something should be done to get rid of suspicion. Was not that the very thing that this Government did when they introduced a Bill taking away from the Minister for Lands every power that had been vested in him in regard to the distribution of land, or the taking of land from people?</P>
    <P>I do not think anybody would suggest that any of the commissioners are politicians, or that they would be amenable to the political influences of any person, good, bad or indifferent.  If the people who spoke in that way knew the procedure in connection with land they would not have made those statements. Land is divided, in the first place, by the local inspectors.  When their scheme is sent up to the commissioners they sanction it or alter it, and are the only people with the power to do so.  I hope that we will not hear any more said about the rights or the wrongs of the allottees who get land in these particular instances.  The Minister has stated in opening this debate that when notice was sent to the various allottees they exerted a great deal of improvement in the management of their land.  I hope that when this Bill <Col N="1214" /> becomes law there will be similar improvement and that there will not be any necessity to disturb people who had been given land.  Senator Sweetman mentioned that some estates have been vested earlier than others because the tenants of these estates had political pull.</P>

      <P>I know an estate in County Galway which was purchased by the Congested Districts Board about 35 years ago, and while nine-tenths of the tenants are Fianna Fáil supporters the estate has not been vested yet.  I know there are reasons why it has not been vested.  There was great difficulty about boundaries, about commonage and about the titles to this commonage. That is the reason and there may have been similar reasons in the case of the Kildare estate, and no doubt similar reasons why some estates are not vested while others are.  In my experience, holdings are vested by the estates and not by the tenants.  For that reason favouritism cannot be shown.  When an estate is to be vested it is registered if there are sufficient mappers available for the purpose. There has been a shortage of mappers, and that is one of the great reasons for the delay.  The same argument applies to these allottees and, above all, the commissioners are responsible.</P>

      <P>It is not my intention to take up a lot of time in this debate.  As a city man and one who knows very little about land and land division, I cannot possibly go into the finer art of land division.  The reason for the Bill is that a section of people failed to carry out their obligations.  They undertook or contracted to do a certain job and they are not doing it.  Will anybody here or anybody outside argue that they are justified in that attitude or that having taken that attitude we should allow them to continue in that way?  They may be Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael or Labour supporters but if they are Fianna Fáil supporters I think that the congratulation should be all the greater for the Minister for evicting his own supporters.  I think it is a courageous <Col N="1215" /> and praiseworthy action.  Are these allottees to be allowed to be parasites on the community?  The division of land was originally intended to put as many people on the land as possible and to give them a decent standard of living and make them reasonably comfortable.  We have heard Senator Johnston telling us how by applied science the land could be better exploited and more profit got out of it.  Then we had Senator Counihan telling us another way by which we could get more profit.  Senator Sir John Keane told us that by employing the totalitarian method we could get better production and certainly we could, but with what results?  What would be the results?</P>

      <P>It is only a question of degree whether it is landlordism or totalitarianism.  The ordinary workingman is a slave anyhow and subject to the will of one or the other.  I do not think I will argue this any further, but I am 100 per cent. in favour of this Bill and the principle in it; not only are those people doing an injury to themselves but they are doing an injury to the worthy allottees.  It is very much to our credit that a very considerable number of people who got land, whether they were Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael, Clann na Talmhan or Labour and did not work it, are going to be penalised and evicted, but in this case it is not eviction.  I think the Minister said that there were 1,200 houses unoccupied.</P>

      <P>Well, that in itself would <Col N="1216" /> justify the Bill.  Houses are so valuable and so eagerly sought after that 200 odd people with houses unoccupied should not be allowed to retain them. These are the facts.  We should concern ourselves with not trying to turn this matter into a political argument because it does not apply and certainly those who tried to make political capital out of the Bill have had the tables turned on themselves because if their contention is right, that Fianna Fáil people because of influence got the allotments the Minister and the Government have the courage to come along and evict them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to intervene in the political discussion which has taken place.  I would like, however, to refer to a number of aspects of this Bill which are not quite obvious to persons looking for headlines.  The principal object of the Bill is to deal with the situation which has arisen owing to a number of allottees declining or failing to reside on their allotments. That, of course, is only one section of the Bill.  It is, in my opinion, a miscellaneous amending Bill. The first section, of course, has drawn all the fire, and there is very little fire left for the remaining sections.  In the course of the Bill a number of decisions are dealt with and reversed.  I would just like to make a few suggestions for the consideration of the Minister for the Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is admitted that desperate diseases require desperate remedies.  The second section of the Bill might well be described as a desperate section, because it empowers the Land Commission to issue a certificate that a direction under Section 2 was given to the purchaser, that the direction had not been revoked and that the purchaser had failed to comply with the direction.  Such certificate is to be conclusive evidence of the failure of the purchaser to comply with the direction of the Land Commission. What is the direction?  The direction is &ldquo;to reside continuously to their satisfaction in the dwellinghouse as on and from such date as the Land Commission think fit".  In other words, the certificate empowers the Land Commission to go into court and say that <Col N="1217" /> the defendant, who is being ejected for failing to observe the direction, has not resided continuously to the satisfaction of the Land Commission in the dwelling-house.  The Land Commission take upon themselves the functions, so to speak, of prosecutor, judge and jury, because the certificate is sufficient to obtain judgment.</P>
    <P>In order to make that conclusive certificate equitable and just, I suggest that the direction given by the Land Commission should be given in a stereotyped form and under rules to be made under this Act by the Land Commission. In other words, it should be made in accordance with Land Commission rules.  Directions given by the Land Commission may vary.  The provision is too flexible.  Is the direction to be given by an inspector of the Land Commission or by a letter by the secretary to a purchaser or by a notice in the Press?  I say that justice requires that the same direction should be given to every allottee who comes within the scope of this section.  Therefore, I suggest that the section should provide for rules to be made thereunder, dealing with the form of the direction, how it is to be given, what it is to contain and also making provision for its revocation.  Sub-paragraph (ii) of paragraph (b) of Section 2 refers to the giving by the Land Commission of &ldquo;another direction&rdquo; to the purchaser.  Only one direction is provided for in the section&mdash;that is, to reside continuously to the satisfaction of the Land Commission in the dwelling-house as from a specified date. I take it that it is the intention of the Land Commission, in giving that other direction, merely to alter the date from which the allottees should reside continuously to their satisfaction in the dwelling.  I say that the use of the words &ldquo;another direction&rdquo; is ambiguous and has no force.  However, it is a matter which will require certain consideration, because one direction is provided for and that direction may be varied or modified.  That is the direction to reside continuously in the dwelling-house to the satisfaction of the Land Commission.</P>
    <P>I also suggest that this section should provide for notice to the defaulting allottee of his failure to comply with <Col N="1218" /> the first direction.  Unfortunately, a number of allottees oftentimes do not take notice from Government Departments as seriously as they should.  It is quite possible that these allottees may be engaged in their own work, may not be literary people and may overlook those directions, with the result that the Land Commission could close down on them by reason of the certificate.  Therefore, before evoking the drastic powers given by this conclusive certificate, notice should be issued calling attention to the direction that had been given and informing the purchaser that, in case of breach of that direction, the Land Commission will evoke the powers given it by Section 2 of this Bill.</P>
    <P>Another point arises on Section 2. The purchaser must &ldquo;reside continuously&rdquo; in the dwelling-house to the satisfaction of the Land Commission. &ldquo;Continuous&rdquo; residence is a very difficult matter to determine.  It is a matter of opinion as to whether or not a person &ldquo;resides continuously&rdquo;.  He may be sick in hospital for three months.  Therefore, he would not &ldquo;reside continuously&rdquo; in the dwelling-house. It is difficult to construe the word &ldquo;continuously&rdquo;.  Hence, since power is vested in the Land Commission to construe that word to its own satisfaction, the allottee should get notice of the intention of the Land Commission to invoke the powers given it under the section.</P>
    <P>Section 3 is intended to reverse a decision of the High Court on circuit in a case in which it was sought to eject persons for letting land in conacre.  It was held by the circuit judge and confirmed by a High Court judge on circuit, that letting in conacre of land is not sub-letting nor parting with possession of the holding or any part thereof.  Therefore, it was held that the defendants in that case were not guilty of a breach of the condition. This section provides that &ldquo;a letting in conacre or for the purposes of agistment or for the temporary depasturage or meadowing of the holding or any part thereof&rdquo; shall constitute a breach of the condition. There is a well-known principle that <Col N="1219" /> the Legislature is deemed to know the law, and the law at present is that it is not a breach of the condition to let land in conacre.  Therefore, I suggest that a more accurate way to frame this section would be to provide that the making of such a letting shall be deemed to be a breach of the condition. The words &ldquo;shall be deemed to be&rdquo; are in Section 5 (1), where land for the purpose of devolution on death &ldquo;shall be deemed to be a chattel real&rdquo;.  This section also reverses a decision of the court, and in sub-section (2) we find what I call particularly obnoxious legislation&mdash;retrospective legislation.  Sub-section (2) provides that &ldquo;this section shall apply with respect to agreements and undertakings to purchase parcels of untenanted land made and deaths which occurred before the passing of this Act in like manner as it applies with respect to any such agreements or undertakings made and deaths occurring after the passing of this Act.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I say that is wrong.  In legislation in England, under the Administration of Estates Act, 1925, it is provided that it shall only apply in the case of deaths occurring on or after the 1st January, 1926.  If this applies to deaths which occurred five years ago, the heir-at-law who has got his land will be dispossessed by this section.  I say that in essence, what I might call remedial legislation, should not be retrospective so as to disturb settled rights or to affect rights already given.  With these few remarks I support the Bill.  The criticisms which I have made are merely intended to improve the Bill and at the same time make the provisions of the Bill more equitable and just.</P>

      <P>I found it much easier to reply to the debate in the Dáil on this Bill because even though the debate there covered a tremendous lot of ground, nevertheless it channelled itself into certain lines.  Here the debate has been so wide that it would be very difficult to reply with any kind of coherence at all.  When I came to the Seanad the first and, I think, the only time, I suggested that the members of the Seanad seemed to be perfectionists.</P>
      <P>To-day I had almost forgotten that I said that but again it was impressed upon me that I never met a group who were so much indoctrinated with perfectionism as the members of the Seanad here.  Speaking to the resolution on the death of Senator Magennis, Senator Hayes said the late Professor Magennis was a very sensitive person, and that his lack of success in politics was due to his inability to accept the cut and thrust of debate.  I am not sensitive.  I am not a bit concerned whether Senator Sweetman accuses me of graft or suggests that I am a grafter, nor am I concerned with Senator Counihan's calling me and members of the Dáil politicians.  I am a politician and it seems to me in this non-political body quite a big number of politicians have got in here in disguise, because I never heard in the Dáil so many accusations against a political Party by politicians as I have heard here from non-politicians.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know where exactly I can start in replying to this debate.  It seems to me that the points that were <Col N="1221" /> debated in the Dáil have been completely overlooked here and that quite new issues have been raised.  I suppose I had better start with Senator Sir John Keane, the dispossessed landowner. I think Senator Keane is a very lucky man to be dispossessed in this country.  I am interested to see how the wheel can come full circle, to see how Senator Sir John Keane and Karl Marx can agree.  Marx's idea was that in certain circumstances Government should disappear altogether; Senator Sir John Keane seems to think that it would be a good idea if the Government, in the person of the Land Commission, also disappeared. I do not think there is any hope however of a solution of that kind.  He made one very good suggestion with which ordinarily I would agree; we might possibly get Senator Counihan's agreement on the matter also.  That was that we should acquire land, divide it, equip it and then put it up for auction.  That would be a magnificent idea from the purely economic standpoint.  But the Land Commission was set up to deal with the issue of congestion, particularly in the congested areas.  To approach the work of the Land Commission from the point of view of dividing, equipping and selling the land by auction would not at all deal with the question of congestion.</P>
    <P>Who are the politicians&mdash;Senators, members of the Dáil or the Land Commissioners? I do not quite know. Senator O'Dea suggested that the Minister was completely deprived of any authority in the Land Commission. That is not quite correct, but the Minister, by Section 6 of the 1933 Act, divested himself of certain powers. One of these powers is concerned with the very debatable question raised here&mdash;the question of the selection of allottees.  The Minister has no power of any kind in the selection of allottees, irrespective of who they are.  Possibly we can deduce from what Senator Hayden said how the political Parties line up.  It would seem to me that the reason Fine Gael supporters in Senator Hayden's area were selected as suitable allottees rather than Fianna Fáil or Labour supporters, was because they were possibly closer to the land than <Col N="1222" /> the others.  If that is so, I think that the Land Commission has acquitted itself very fairly in trying to secure men to place on the land who have a good idea of farming.  I disagree with Senator Hayden.  There may be exceptional cases where landless men do make suitable farmers, but again the whole work of the Land Commission is to relieve congestion and to make the uneconomic holding economic.  That is the work of the Land Commission and only by basing our idea on that particular matter, can we hope for any success in the Land Commission.</P>
    <P>Senator Sweetman raised the question as to what is the reason for Section 2 (2).  I think that every lawyer should appreciate the need for that.  The Land Commission may, at any time, revoke any direction given to a purchaser under this section. There may be, and always are, unforeseen circumstances where it will be necessary to have such powers as that. Every lawyer should, I think, appreciate that such powers are needed. Senator Johnston&mdash;I did not know that he was Professor Johnston: he talked so much like an elementary text book on economics that I expected that he did have something to do with a university&mdash;nevertheless showed a very poor grasp of knowing anything about the question of the purchase of land. He said that he would allow an unsatisfactory allottee to sell his land provided the full annuity was payable on it, and because the full annuity was payable on it, the price that he would get in the sale of it would be so much less.  Nobody purchasing land in this country ever takes any notice of what the annuity on the land is.</P>

      <P>There was not very much of an attack made on Sections 1, 2 or 3.  Section 4 escaped.  I would like to read a note that I have on Section 5.  This section deals with the devolution of parcels on the death of allottees.  It is intended to remove a doubt which the lawyers believe to exist in connection with the devolution of certain parcels of land allotted by <Col N="1223" /> the Land Commission.  The doubt exists only in regard to parcels which at the date of allotment were not registered in the Land Registry, and therefore not subject to the provisions of Part IV of the Registration of Title Act, 1891, regarding devolution.  The position is that after vesting all parcels, and before vesting, those parcels which at the time of allotment are subject to the provisions of Part IV of the 1891 Act, devolve, as it is technically termed, as chattels real, that is, they pass on the allottee's death to his personal representative for, broadly speaking, the benefit of the next of kin if the allottee died intestate, or for the benefit of the devisee if the allottee died testate. Section 5 is designed to ensure that the remaining parcels (that is those not subject to Part IV at the time of allotment) shall devolve in the same way. The Land Commission have, in fact, generally regarded these parcels as so devolving.  Section 32 (4) of the Land Law (Ireland) Act, 1896, was enacted to rectify an anomaly of an analogous nature in relation to purchasing tenants.  This is merely to conform with what is the usual practice and not for any other purpose.</P>

On a death occurring previous to the passing of the Act, supposing, as Senator Sweetman has pointed out, there was a death years ago and that the land did descend to the heir-at-law and that the heir-at-law sold, would that section have the effect of upsetting all the transactions which had occurred in the meantime, or would it be necessary to have another sub-section added confirming anything done before the passing of the Act?</P>

If there are any legal points which strike Senators, I should be glad to have a note on them before <Col N="1224" /> the Committee Stage of the Bill is taken.  Section 6 is to prevent us undoing with one hand what we have done with the other: it is to prevent an uneconomic holding which we have made economic by making an addition to it being divided into two economic holdings again.

    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir John Keane Sir John Keane">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That the Seanad takes note of the intention of the Government to appoint two new Ministers within the Department of Local Government and Public Health, and requests the Government to issue a paper embodying the principles of the proposed change and further to afford the House an opportunity to debate the matter before the actual legislation is introduced.</P>
      <P>I should like at the outset to say how gratifying it is to find that the Taoiseach has seen fit to come in here this evening.  I hope it indicates on his part sympathy towards the subject of the motion.</P>
      <P>What I am going to advocate and apply later on, more closely to the terms of the motion, is a new procedure towards large-scale public reform and the procedure is in this wise: instead of seeing the reform in the terms of a printed Bill the Government would prepare a memorandum setting out the framework of the new proposals.  This memorandum should be free as far as possible from legal verbiage. It speaks the language of the ordinary man and&mdash;this is important &mdash; it is merely an indication of the Government's desires.  It does not commit the Government to legislation in the exact or even in the approximate form of the memorandum. The object of the issue of this memorandum is to secure the co-operation of the humblest voter in the country and also of course of organised associations, professional and private, local authorities and the like.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Such experience as there has been on this procedure shows it is wise to <Col N="1226" /> allow a considerable period to elapse between the issue of the memorandum and the introduction of legislation, and during that interval organised bodies are encouraged to state their views and to criticise the proposals.  This is very important in the case of local authorities and it gives a very healthy opportunity to local authorities to participate indirectly in the work of Government. This has come to be known&mdash; though it is a rather loose term&mdash;as the White Paper policy, but that is only a short term for convenience because one must be on one's guard against the term &ldquo;White Paper&rdquo;.  White Papers have come to mean any form of report on a matter of public interest.</P>
    <P>I have heard in the news this morning that there had been a White Paper issued on the escape of the Gneisenau and the Prinz Eugen during the war. Another White Paper was issued on conditions in a detention barrack.  The application I have in mind, however, would apply to far-reaching legislative reform.  I may mention without apology three instances of where this method has been adopted with very promising results in Great Britain.  After all, what more appropriate place is there for a fundamental change in the Parliamentary procedure than in the Mother of Parliaments itself?  We may not all agree with what happens in the Mother of Parliaments, but we must say it is a House with a very long and great tradition and a House whose methods and procedure have been largely adopted in our own Parliament.</P>
    <P>I would like also to say that this procedure has only a limited application. I do not suggest for a moment that White Papers in the form I have indicated should be introduced for all kinds of legislation.  For instance, things like the Forestry Bill, the Harbours Bill and matters of that kind are not suitable for this White Paper method.  It is suitable for measures that affect the daily lives of our people and that is illustrated by the three instances where it has been employed in Great Britain, namely, on the medical services, on education and on social insurance.  In the case of the medical services, two years have been allowed to pass between the time the White <Col N="1227" /> Paper was published and when legislation was introduced.  During that period all associations affected were very vocal.  Frequent conferences took place with authorities before the legislation ultimately took final form.  I would like to outline briefly some of the advantages which I claim come from this method; not merely the purely mechanical or machinery aspect. To my mind&mdash;and I hope to persuade the House on this&mdash;it is a new and lasting departure in the true democratic approach to law making.  In the first place it serves to educate the people. By the issue of proposals, in the form I have suggested, the people, through the Press, through local associations, through possibly their own political clubs, and through a number of organisations in their daily lives, come to hear the matter discussed, and that is a most wholesome approach to any democratic government.  I might almost call the Referendum an analogy because there is a certain but somewhat remote resemblance between the two ideas.</P>
    <P>The Referendum seeks the advice of the people on some specific matter.  We have the machinery for our Referendum in our Constitution but I think I am right in saying it has only been applied on one occasion, and that was in regard to the Constitution itself.  I feel I should like to see the day arrive when White Papers dealing with fundamental reforms in our social system would themselves become the subject of a Referendum&mdash;that if they were published for the people the people's authority would be obtained before they were passed into law.  Even if the Government did not get a favourable response from the people I do not think that would be any reason why they should necessarily vacate their office.  It also to a certain extent enables us to restore the spirit of the old Greek democracy where it was possible for the laws to reach every single voter.  We could approximate to that now with new methods of communication and radio.  Leaders of all Parties might speak to the people on matters of importance.  I even go so far as to hope that in time to come White Papers may be spoken on over the <Col N="1228" /> radio by the Leaders of the different Parties.  In the modern curriculum of education the subject of civics plays a large part.  What better approach to civics could there be than that proposals for reforms that affect the lives of our people in an intimate manner should be known among all classes and discussed as current affairs by our teachers and explained by them to the pupils?  I hope I am not casting aspersions when I say we are singularly backward in political education.  It is deplorable that important matters should be discussed in either of these Houses (I will not say which, but Senators can draw their own conclusions), with very small attendance.  On one occasion I saw a &ldquo;count out&rdquo; during a debate on a matter of major importance. This question of approach, education and the co-operation of our people seems to me to be the only hope for Parliamentary government in the future.  It is the only alternative I see to the totalitarian system.  The totalitarian system gets things done, and provided the measures are wise, it is probably a good way of putting them through, but that is not our way or the way of democratically-minded countries.</P>
    <P>I feel that if democracy is to survive it can only do so by extending to the humblest people in the country and by no longer being a mere appeal to the people at general elections to vote for a programme which of necessity can only be of a general character. The people are then left to get any scraps they can of what is going on.  I want to see these reforms developed in a spirit of education and co-operation, in fact, that we should turn our backs on the bad 17th-century view about people which prompted a poet to write: &ldquo;Nor shall the rascal rabble here have place, whom kings no title gave and God no grace.&rdquo;  I am rather reinforced in this view by a recent broadcast from the Vatican which stated: &ldquo;It is the democratic duty for Governments to educate and inform the people they serve.&rdquo;  I stress the word &ldquo;serve&rdquo; because, after all, Governments should not deny that they serve the people and that in the last resort the people are their masters.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1229" /> Now, having set down the general principles of this motion I would like to apply it to a piece of legislation which is now shortly approaching.  We have not been told the form in which the legislation is to take place, but I think we have pointers to show that something very fundamental is contemplated. We have first of all the statement of the Taoiseach himself that two new Ministries are to be formed in the Department of Local Government.  Then we have had an exciting and arresting speech by the present Minister for Local Government, who was speaking to the Fianna Fáil Congress.  &ldquo;A century of Local Government&rdquo; was the title and he made these remarks: He said that the present system, and I quote him, "is gravely anomalous, calculated to hamper the rationalisation of our system of local government and impede the uniform development of those local services upon which the health, the convenience, the general activity and social wellbeing of the community so greatly depend&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>He said that the present framework was an out-dated system of valuations and an obsolete rating code to complicate and defeat all attempts to give to the country a rational, convenient and economical system of local administration. I take it, this is not merely the personal view of the Minister for Local Government.  I think I might say the Government as a whole shares this view.  I myself feel that some reform is well overdue.  To reinforce this belief, and I merely refer to this in passing&mdash;Heaven save me from raising a debate on proposals which may come before us&mdash;but we have the Public Health Bill and the statement made, and not contradicted, that an expenditure of £24,000,000 on health services is contemplated.</P>
    <P>We have a far-reaching extension of schemes of nursing and an increase in local dispensary doctors&mdash;proposals which will place additional and very heavy burdens on local ratepayers.  And that being so, I think I am warranted in concluding that a big reform is in the mind of the Government.  Here I would like to stress the danger of piecemeal legislation such as we have in the <Col N="1230" /> Public Health Bill.  We want to see, when legislation is introduced, a complete picture of what is intended including, especially, an estimate of the cost. When this paper has been published and criticised then is the time for legislation to be introduced.  Legislation there could be by stages undoubtedly, because we could see how it was being pieced into the entire picture. Parliament and the country have a right to see proposals in their entirety before being asked to commit themselves to legislation in detail.</P>
    <P>After all it is only sensible business. I will give an analogy which I am sure will be appreciated by my Labour colleagues. I knew an old tradesman who served my family for many years, a sort of carpenter who wore a bowler hat.  He said he always saw the end of the job before he began it and that in fact every tradesman should see the end of his work before he commenced it.  I am sure the Government sees the end of this reform but they have not told the country and I think the country and Parliament have a right to see it.  Local government affects the whole lives of our people.  It affects the fundamental producer&mdash;the farmer &mdash;whose rates on his farm are a fixed charge.  Rates, in fact, are a form of land tax.  Medical services, nursing and public health affect the daily lives of our women and children. It is eminently a subject in respect of which we should know the Government's intentions in their entirety. In that respect it is, perhaps, second only to education.  Therefore, I ask, in the terms of this motion, that we should get this information.  Without such an approach and without a continuance of that method, I do not think we can ever lay the foundations of democracy, based on adult suffrage, in a sure and lasting way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Johnston</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not hesitate to jump in at this early stage in the proceedings although I was hoping that somebody else would help to develop the very interesting ideas Senator Sir John Keane has set out in this <Col N="1231" /> motion.  I think that what he has specially in mind is that the functions of the central Government and of the Legislative Assembly should be used not merely as mechanism for steam-rolling legislation through both Houses by a powerful majority vote but also as a very important instrument of political education for our people, as a whole, regardless of Party.  It is not democracy if Government is content to produce new legislation, as it were, like a conjuror from a hat and then push it through by the rigorous use of Party discipline.  I do not say that the Government invariably uses those methods but I think that people would generally agree that there is too much of that kind of thing and not enough of the other kind&mdash;the kind of constructive development of political democracy which one would like to see taking place.  There are matters&mdash;and matters of local government which are on the tapis at the moment are pre-eminently of this kind&mdash;in which the Government may well have certain general ideas gradually crystallising in their mind but in respect of which it is of the utmost importance that the people generally should have an opportunity of formulating their ideas.  With reference to those things, the primary duty of Government is to give the people the material on which they can make up their own minds and to give them every opportunity, without necessarily committing themselves beforehand to any specific scheme of reform, of developing, in an atmosphere of freedom, their considered views as to what would be the best relations, say, between the State and the local authorities in matters of public health and local government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A White Paper developing the intentions of the Government with reference to the proposed two new Ministries would be a very desirable instrument for enabling public opinion to instruct itself, to crystallise itself, and ultimately to influence the final decision of these matters before the Government would have committed themselves to any cut and dried scheme.  In a mature democracy, we should have not only the influence of <Col N="1232" /> political leaders on the people, but also the reciprocal influence of public opinion on political leaders, regardless of Party.  If we have only the first&mdash; only propaganda by well-organised parties&mdash;we have not even half what is requisite, because we are bound to turn citizens not only into thinking, active, public-spirited persons, but into mere yes-men of the political Party machines.  What we want to do is to develop independence of thought and judgment on the part of our citizens, regardless of Party, and constructively apply that to the solution of all the problems that confront the Government.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether it would be appropriate on this motion to deal in any detail with the two new Ministries which it is proposed to establish.  If it is not out of order&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanGoulding" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephJohnston" hpid="Professor Johnston Professor Johnston">
      <NameTxt>Professor Johnston</NameTxt>
      <P>Then, I shall not pursue that line.  I have a feeling that, in general, there is a tendency to tighten up too much the centralised control of the activities of local authorities. If that process is carried too far, it will destroy the value of those local governing authorities as instruments for the creation of a healthy public spirit and a healthy local public health opinion in the several areas of our country.  In fact, it has been noted that one of our major difficulties is that there is a lack of interest in the doings of our local governing bodies. The more you hamstring and emasculate those local authorities, the less likely it is that any desirable development of local public spirit and local initiative will take place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It may be that the units of local government are both too large and too small.  After all, the counties of Eire are a somewhat artificial creation, with a history of about only 300 years.  They do not always or necessarily correspond with any natural, social or economic regions of the country.  In general, it may be that they are too small for efficient, economic, local administration, as the Minister for Local Government himself seems to believe. Without committing myself to this particular <Col N="1233" /> opinion, I should like to suggest that it might be worth while to consider the grouping of certain counties, not so much as counties but as regions, and reviving, for purposes of local government, some of the larger local divisions of our country such as Ossory and Oirghiall, which have certain traditions and really Irish history behind them.  For certain local government purposes, the somewhat arbitrary division of the country into counties, which we inherited, could be ignored. I do not stress that.  It is one of the aspects of this question that ought to be considered and made public, first of all in the form of a White Paper, to be afterwards thought out by the people generally.</P>
    <P>Another difficulty of our administration is not so much overcentralisation as overdepartmentalisation.  There is a certain tendency for "my right hand not to be allowed to know what my left hand doeth" amongst a number of our public Departments.  It may be that that lack of effective co-ordination between different Departments at the centre would be qualified and limited if there were some kind of local focus in each local governing area and an executive official responsible to the local governing authority in each area who would also represent not one Department only but Government as a whole.  I think also that, associated with local governing bodies&mdash;whether county councils or regional councils&mdash; there should be some permanent machinery for the intensive study of social and economic phenomena.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamFearon" hpid="Professor Fearon Professor Fearon">
      <NameTxt>Professor Fearon</NameTxt>
      <P>May I make one or two observations, if merely for the purpose of clarifying my own mind which has become considerably confused? I should like to say, firstly, with regard to the proposed appointment of Minister for Health, that I most warmly welcome such an appointment as I have been urging it in my own small circle for years.  I urged it because I felt the subject of public health was becoming a very complicated one indeed and that it was a whole-time job for one man.  The question that keeps running through my mind is how many Ministers we are to have, and the answer that seems to present itself is that gradually, as these subjects get more and more involved and specialised, they will require Ministers. I presume the advantage of having a Minister for a particular Department is that his subject becomes more and more integrated into the work of the Government.  In that respect, a Minister differs from a head of the Department.  I do not know whether I am right in inferring that from these two appointments.  Whether or not this motion is adopted, I should be very grateful if the Taoiseach would take this opportunity to tell us something about the functions and position of Ministers.</P>

    <P>That may seem a rather foolish way of putting it, but the Taoiseach knows <Col N="1235" /> what I have in mind.  We have been frightened very much by delegation of powers.  In one way the appointment of more Ministers may be an antidote to that because you can get hold of a Minister when you cannot get hold of a head of a Department.  I do not know whether that is the underlying idea or whether this is a further development of that extraordinary organism, the modern State.</P>

      <P>When Senator Sir John Keane asked me if I would second the motion, I said I should be quite glad to do so because it seemed to me that underlying it was a matter of very considerable public interest apart altogether from the specific proposal which the Senator makes in the motion.  In seconding it, I did not speak because I thought that possibly there would be a more general debate.  I have felt for a very considerable time that one of the most important problems of democracy is how to make effective contact between Parliament, as controlled by the Executive or technically in control of the Executive, and the people during the period between general elections in such a way that, on the one hand, the people would feel, and feel with justification, that their opinion mattered, and on the other hand, that Parliament would feel that it had a duty to try to ascertain, not in the particular but in the general, what was the mind of the people as a whole?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Sir John Keane refers to what he calls &ldquo;a White-Paper policy&rdquo;.  I think it would be just as well for various reasons, in addition to those he gave, to drop the words &ldquo;White Paper&rdquo;.  We have, as any of us who have studied the matter knows perfectly well, moulded our Parliamentary system very closely on the British system&mdash;I think, personally, far too closely.  I have never been an advocate of a too-close following of British precedents either in Standing Orders or other practices.  I rather generally find myself in a minority as far as that is concerned, but the use of the words &ldquo;White Paper&rdquo;&mdash;they have now got a partial use here and are used for all sorts of purposes in Britain&mdash;may, I <Col N="1236" /> think, cause misunderstanding.  I have some idea of what is in Senator Sir John Keane's mind and I am quite sure of what is in my own.</P>
    <P>I do not suggest to the Government that they should set out in a White Paper their whole plans on a particular subject for a period of years.  What I do suggest is, that where there is a problem to be tackled of a general character, the Government should cause a document to be prepared which would give an account of a scheme which could be applied as a solution or as an extension of a particular policy, or possibly of a revolutionary change in our practices, that that paper or that scheme, as prepared under the auspices of the Government, would be circulated, with their approval, only to the extent that they considered that this was one method of dealing with a problem which, they thought, would have to be tackled, a solution to which they did not have a fundamental objection.  The circulation of the paper would not imply specific approval of all that was written in it.  The most obvious instance of that kind was the Beveridge Report which was circulated by the British Government, it being made perfectly clear that the then Government accepted it with a sort of vague approval.  Everybody knew perfectly well that they were not likely to carry it out in its details; what they wanted was to have it discussed.</P>
    <P>If documents of that kind could be issued with definite Government sanction, or more or less Executive approval, that would go a long way towards awakening public interest.  It would make the people realise that Parliament had a function, and remove the impression which now seems to obtain, that the people merely elect a Parliament which in turn elects a Government, and because that Government has a majority in the House it carries out whatever it wants and then, at the end of five years, comes to the people again.  That is a very common view and people in the meantime say: &ldquo;We are not interested.  What is the good? We have no say, anyway.&rdquo;  I think that is very largely what is at the back of Senator Sir John Keane's mind.</P>
    <P>When one comes to the particular, I think there is a good deal in his suggestion. <Col N="1237" /> I am carefully avoiding a discussion on the merits of what may be the principles of the new Local Government Bill, but it is quite clear to very many people that very substantial changes will take place in regard to local government.  Some of those changes have arisen because of the emergency, and may be of a temporary character.  The Orders are not intended to be permanent; whether the principles they enshrine are intended to be permanent or not we do not know.  There is a general belief that substantial changes are likely to take place.  Obviously no Government in its senses is going to bring in a Bill without any idea at all as to its connection with the changes that are planned.  You cannot hope for any possible success if you simply change the system of local government piecemeal without having some idea ahead of what you are aiming at.  Is the general intention to get our local government in order and then to decentralise it as soon as things are working smoothly, or is it the general intention more and more to centralise matters and to take more and more power to the central authority?  Is it the intention to make that a temporary step and gradually to get back again to effective and increasing local control?</P>
    <P>I give that as an illustration.  I think that if it were only a matter of appointing two Ministers, as mentioned in the Resolution, there would, of course, be no case for a White Paper.  I imagine that would be Senator Sir John Keane's view too, although I have not discussed the matter in any detail with him.  As far as I am concerned, I think there is a case for setting out a plan before future legislation is introduced. I would support Senator Sir John Keane in respectfully suggesting to the Government that this whole thing is well worthy of consideration, and that there is a good deal to be said for a more or less comprehensive plan&mdash;I think that probably it should be a more or less revolutionary plan&mdash; in dealing with local government.  We want an efficient local government; we want it uniform to the extent of essential services, and I think that we want <Col N="1238" /> it free, so that local desires and feelings can be expressed.</P>
    <P>While saying that, it is probably correct to say that none of us is satisfied with it as it stands.  Legislation of an important character is envisaged.  One Bill dealing with it will reach the House soon.  That deals with only one aspect of it, and even that Bill is not intended to be complete with regard to public health.  I think there is a very definite case for the preparation of a general plan which would be discussed over the next year or so, and which would undoubtedly influence the Government as the details came to be worked out.  That would have this great advantage, that Parliament, in considering the detailed legislation, would know the scheme that it was intended to fit it into.  For that reason I support the motion.</P>

      <P>I wish to address a few remarks to the House on the wording of the motion.  It reads: &ldquo;That the Seanad takes note of the intention of the Government to appoint two new Ministers within the Department of Local Government and Public Health,...&rdquo; The first thing that I want to say on that part of the motion is that I am not exactly clear when it was ever noted that there were to be two further Ministries within the Department of Local Government. I understood that there would be a Minister for Public Health, a Minister for Local Government and a Minister for Social Services.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am referring to the fact that they cannot be within the Department of Local Government as it exists at present.  I fancy that the greater amount of effort in promoting social security is provided by the central authority.  Some of the help of social security is provided by the local authorities.  Therefore, social security as a Ministry would involve both central and local administration.  I am just not clear on the fact that there were to be two further Ministries in the present Department of Local Government. Proceeding from that, the <Col N="1239" /> motion says: &ldquo;and requests the Government to issue a paper embodying the principles of the proposed change.&rdquo; I want to point out to some of the previous speakers that Senator Sir John Keane was correct in not saying that the paper was to be red, pale pink or white.  He just called it a paper.  He was discreet enough to do that.  Some of the previous speakers did not like the terminology &ldquo;White Paper&rdquo;.  In the motion it is called a paper, and I think that is good enough because many of the papers that are called White Papers are not white at all; they are coloured.</P>
      <P>What I wish to stress is that, I think, if the motion ended there it would be quite satisfactory.  I, personally, would like to see a Government publication indicating what the proposed changes were to be so that they could be discussed by vocational interests outside.  After all, we here in this House are a vocational body. Therefore, the different aspects of these proposed changes would be discussed by different vocational interests throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The motion then proceeds to say: &ldquo;and further to afford the House an opportunity to debate the matter before the actual legislation is introduced.&rdquo; To my mind it is there that the danger lies.  I fancy that either House at any time could on motion discuss some of these matters, but that would mean that we were bringing into public debate in the two Houses of the Oireachtas matters which, in the minds of the movers, were meant to be discussed by vocational interests outside.  I do not think it would be advisable that the proposed changes and suggested alterations in the public published paper should be made the subject of debate in either House of the Oireachtas until they had come before the House formally as proposed legislation.  We would get plenty of opportunity of discussing them when the proposed legislation came before the House, but I fancy we could develop endless debates in the House on different aspects of the proposed changes.  A point that I desire to stress is that I would like to see such <Col N="1240" /> a publication indicating to the citizens outside what the changes were, the way in which they were going to be given effect, as well as the way in which they would affect the community at large.  Some of the duties of the Minister for Local Government are designated by Order to the Parliamentary Secretary who, more or less, functions as Minister for Public Health. This delegation of powers to the Parliamentary Secretary at present causes some confusion in the minds of citizens, in the minds of members of local authorities, and of officials of local authorities.  Therefore, it is an ambiguity at present to have practically three Ministers functioning within the Local Government Department. You have a Minister and two Parliamentary Secretaries.</P>

      <P>It was not my intention to intervene in this debate.  In fact, I do so with great reluctance.  But, as I am more or less definitely associated with what might be called the democratic side of this House, I thought that I should congratulate Senator Sir John Keane for having brought this motion forward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The conversion of the Senator is very welcome to democracy.  I want to support him 100 per cent. in this motion he has before the House and to express the hope that his conversion is of a permanent nature.  Shortly before the adjournment, however, he seemed to have a different outlook altogether. This country needs political education.  Our political education on self-government is of very recent origin and, consequently, our people have not <Col N="1241" /> the same knowledge nor unfortunately the same respect for their Parliamentary institutions as have the people in other countries.</P>
    <P>Democracy has been under a great test.  It has had to fight for its life in a world war and we who believe in democracy ought to do everything in our power to preserve it.  We have a fine opportunity in this country of establishing a democracy that will wear well and stand the test of time.  In Britain they have their Parliaments and they have preserved democracy, though they had to put up a fight to preserve it.  We have not been called upon to suffer for democracy to the same extent as other countries.  In saying that, I also want to say that there is definitely a tendency in this country to depart from pure democracy as I know it.  I suppose I would be out of order if I went on to instance the practical disappearance of local government in this country?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry Senator Keane did not try to express in his motion something of what he said in his speech because, as was pointed out by Senator O'Donovan, the motion is almost incomprehensible.  I take it from what Senator Keane has said that his real purpose in bringing the motion before the House was that we should initiate the practice or continue the practice, in so far as it has been adopted, of anticipating legislation that is of a comprehensive character, by some informative paper, something that would enable the people to see what was being contemplated and to express their opinions upon it in advance.</P>
      <P>Now, those who have spoken in the debate have indicated different views as to what kind this paper should be and what authority it will have in expressing the views of the Government. I take it that Senator Keane would like it to contain the Government's proposals&mdash;what they really contemplate&mdash;but of such a kind that they could retreat from it without having any difficulty.  That is, if they found that public opinion was rather strongly opposed they would not go ahead with their proposals at all. When he was speaking about White Papers in that connection I thought of kite papers.</P>
      <P>The question is: are these to be in the form of a kite, to find out what public opinion is, or are they to be definitely just advance information of what the Government has decided upon bringing into legislation?  Another suggestion has been&mdash;so as to get a little bit further&mdash;that we would have something like what might be expected from a commission set up to examine the question&mdash;the report of a commission.  What commission are you going to get?  Are you going to get some outside people to make their report quite independent of the Government and without the Government having any responsibility for it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1243" /> That would mean that legislation would have to be anticipated by having a commission that would examine the question and make suggestions and recommendations which the Government is free to adopt or not.  I think there is some confusion of thought in the matter and that it has not been examined home in all its implications.</P>
    <P>That it would be desirable to give the public as early information, in as complete a way as possible, of Government intentions is common ground.  I think every one will admit that it is desirable.  The unfortunate thing is, when you examine it from the Government's point of view you are so exhausted when you have got to the point where the measure is drafted that you do not like to think of another year or two of delay or something of that magnitude intervening.  If proposals for bringing in an originating measure have to be published, though not really required to be done in the public interest, it will involve delay and you are already chafing at the long delay that must necessarily take place between the preliminary examination of the problem and the point where the Minister can propose the heads of a Bill.  Not merely has the preliminary investigation to take place in the Minister's own Department but other Departments of State have to see these proposals, and their views upon them are expected.</P>
    <P>That takes a long time and the experience of Ministers generally is that a great deal of delay is involved by the time the measure passes the various stages, as I might call them, before it is sent to the draftsman or before the heads of the Bill are brought before the Government.  Then they are considered by the Government and, if the heads are agreed upon, they are sent to the draftsman.  The draftsman takes a considerable time in drafting.  He has to consult sometimes the originating Department about doubtful matters.  Finally the draft Bill appears before the Government in the form of a printed paper which is practically the same, in many cases, as the paper printed in green for the Dáil. It is considered by the Government and gets its Final Reading by the <Col N="1244" /> Government but a very long period has elapsed and I can tell you that Ministers are constantly complaining, saying: &ldquo;Where is this or that Bill?  We got it drafted.  What are the Departments doing with it?&rdquo; Sufficient time has to be given to examine these matters in the Departments and are we going to add another stage now? Are we going to add a further stage in which before anything is done, before we get to the stage of bringing proposals to the Government and of getting the heads of a Bill accepted we will have to prepare and publish this explanatory paper?  We could have Parliamentary debates here and then we could be held up for a year or two. The trouble about modern parliaments is that the procedure which worked quite well in former days is quite inadequate for dealing with the needs of the present time.  That is why you have a lot of these Orders but you have not a debate about each particular Order as you have about a Bill. We have power given to make Orders which is strongly objected to but the pressure of the times makes it inevitable that we should have them.  But after all those delays in preparing legislation for submission to Parliament is there going to be another stage?  I think we would like to see explanatory papers.  I think the system has been adopted by us&mdash;the system in which complicated measures when circulated are accompanied by an explanatory memorandum which enables the ordinary person to grasp the essentials of the proposed measure.  It is not in legal terms but in the everyday speech which everybody will have little difficulty in understanding.</P>
    <P>Now as regards this general question to which Senator Sir John Keane addressed himself I can only say that while the idea is a good one I do not think we can have a hard and fast rule, even in the case of large measures, that before they are introduced they must be published and criticised and particularly be debated in Parliament.  I think Sir John himself will see how foolish this is.  How could we have a debate upon a particular measure unless the Government was going to give its <Col N="1245" /> views upon it?  The idea is being met to a certain extent by present practice and there may, perhaps, be a question of trying to make that practice more general.</P>
    <P>With regard to this particular question of the formation of two new Ministries, in the Dáil on at least two occasions I indicated what the position was in this respect.  There has been, as you know, a very strong public demand, and, I think you will admit, a very widespread demand, that there should be a Minister for Public Health. I do not know whether Senators are in favour of this being done or not, but there has been a strong demand and the Government has considered it.  The view taken by the Government is that the situation at the present time makes it desirable that we should have this Ministry.  There is contemplated a certain reorganisation, a certain extension of the public health services and to supervise this reorganisation and extension and also to administer the services when they have been reorganised, we think a Minister is necessary.  I think it is right that I should point out what, perhaps, some may not realise, that there is a considerable difference between a Parliamentary Secretary and a Minister in matters of this kind.  My opinion is that generally it is not a good practice to delegate, as we have done in the matter of public health, to a Parliamentary Secretary powers which almost take him outside the supervision of the Minister.  When you do this the Government, as a whole, which has collective responsibility, has no way immediately of dealing with the Parliamentary Secretary.  The Parliamentary Secretary is outside: he has, in a sense, a greater amount of liberty in a situation like that than the Minister. The Minister has to share the collective responsibility and is immediately responsible to the Government.  He has to meet direct criticism which he would not probably hear if he were not coming to the Government meetings.</P>
    <P>It is not desirable that this situation should continue for any length of time. In the particular case of the Department of Local Government and Public <Col N="1246" /> Health this arrangement is necessary in present circumstances because there is the problem of gradually disentangling the services.  This requires the closest co-operation between the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary while the Minister remains in supreme control. Where then is the need for a White Paper regarding the setting up of this Ministry?  This proposal has been indicated and the reasons for it have been given in general.  There is a public demand for it.  A White Paper would indicate the extent of the reorganisation of the public services contemplated.  I have already stated that this is in preparation and that it was being considered by various Departments of State.</P>
    <P>As a matter of fact there is very close co-operation.  I have intimated for instance that whenever a new measure is under contemplation the Minister who is bringing it in has to get details from his own Department and he then prepares a memorandum which is circulated to the other Departments concerned so that Ministers and their officials may know what is proposed and the Ministers may probably consult particular officers affected.</P>
    <P>The proposed changes in the public health system as we have it at the moment have been set out in the form of a draft White Paper.  They have been circulated to Departments and are under consideration.  In due course they will be considered by the Government. Is the White Paper going to represent the considered views of the Government?  It must be close to the Government's intentions.  Otherwise it would not have the same appeal and would not stimulate the type of criticism you want.  It will not stir up public opinion if it merely expresses opinions which may or may not be adopted.  You want to have it fairly close to the considered views of the Government&mdash;in fact, practically indicating the heads of a Bill which the Government would introduce.  I have already told you that the Senator's demand is being met and that a White Paper will be circulated.  How long it will be circulated before the Bill appears, I cannot say at the moment.</P>
    <P>The drafting of Bills is a slow business and a much longer period than <Col N="1247" /> we should like inevitably elapses between the time the heads of a Bill are put up and the time when the Bill is presented to the Dáil.  The procedure which the Senator principally requests is to be adopted in this particular case.  It was indicated in advance that it would be adopted. That is why I think it rather strange that the Senator did not give a little more thought to the way in which he drafted the motion.</P>
    <P>The next question is concerned with the social services.  Any members of the Seanad who read the remarks I made on that subject on more than one occasion in the Dáil, will understand what our position is in that regard. We do not believe that there is any substance in the case which has been presented to us for the co-ordination of the social services as they stand at present.  We have examined that matter over and over again.  We came to the conclusion that the increase in efficiency which would be obtained by amalgamating those services and operating them through one Department would be negligible and that the amount of money which would be saved would be negligible.  If that were the only reason put forward for amalgamating the social services, there would be no justification for a new Ministry at all.  These services are being administered by Departments which have been associated with their growth.  Their administration of them has been found satisfactory and there is at all times the necessary cooperation and co-ordination.  It is often claimed that we have too many inspectors. If Senators examine the matter in the way in which we did, they will, probably, arrive at the conclusion that we were right in holding that the present system is not a wasteful system either in respect of the effort of public servants or in respect of the expenditure of money and that, therefore, we should not be justified in setting up a separate Ministry to administer them if that were the only reason for so doing.  But we are going to set up a separate Ministry for a different reason.</P>
    <P>This question of increase of social <Col N="1248" /> services has been engaging the attention of large numbers of our people. It is also a matter of considerable importance in the social thought of other peoples.  Here, we have a difficult problem to assess: how far can we go? There is no limit to the desire of the Government to extend those services so as to meet the needs of the people; the question is: have we the means to do so?  Will it be possible to give greater services than are being given at present unless our wealth is considerably increased or unless there is considerably more production here?</P>
    <P>What we are establishing the new Ministry for is precisely this: so that we shall have somebody in authority, knowing the mind of the Government, examining this question in the necessary detail to enable us to satisfy ourselves, before we extend in any particular direction, that we have the means which will enable us to extend. It is very easy to get plans which would lead to extension for a time but which would have social and economic consequences which might be very serious for our people.  If we begin on any scheme, we must be able to see that we shall not have to abandon it on account of the consequences to our national economic structure.  Consequently, we want to have a member of the Government who will be in a position of authority, and who will know the mind of the Government, to take those services as a whole under his control, examine their working and see whether the view I have expressed &mdash;which is the view arrived at by the Government on more than one occasion&mdash;is true or not.  More than that, we want him to examine this whole question and see, in view of proposals made elsewhere, whether there is any direction in which we can usefully advance and how that advance should be made, if it is possible. This way of attacking the problem means that the Minister is an investigator who will go into the thousand and one details necessary to satisfy himself that a scheme in a particular direction will be a wise and good one.  We have come to that conclusion and it is not a recent conclusion. After two or three discussions <Col N="1249" /> of this question some years ago, we formed the opinion that the only way we would be certain that our conclusions were sound would be by having a Minister who would devote his time to investigating this whole problem and seeing what our means were and in what direction we should go in extending the social services which are being rendered at the present time.</P>
    <P>It is quite clear that there can be no question of a White Paper in that connection. The only justification for such a course would be the sort of statement I have made.  The Dáil and Seanad may agree that that is justification or they may not.  They may say that they think that this is the right way of attacking this problem. It may be suggested that we should have a commission instead of dealing with the matter in this way and it would be a matter for argument whether that was the right way or not. I do not think that there would be any need for a White Paper in advance, because no further explanation than the general explanation I have given here could be given.  We shall either convince the Dáil and Seanad that this way is the right way or we shall not.</P>
    <P>Of course, these particular Departments will not be within the Department of Local Government.  They will be separate Departments of State. They will have the full status of Ministries. The Ministers in charge will have Ministerial authority and responsibility. They will be independent Departments of State and there will be no question of their inclusion in some other Department.  That brings us to the question which a remark made suggested was operating in the mind of one of the speakers&mdash;how many Ministries are we to have?  Are we to have a gradual increase in the number of Ministries?  If something requires to be done, it is frequently suggested that we should have a Minister to do it. It is quite clear that we cannot have a Minister for the doing of everything that can be thought of in isolation. Ministers must have sub-divisions of their Departments.  Just before 1921 we had seven Ministers and one was <Col N="1250" /> Minister for Economic Affairs.  He represented in the Government the Department of Agriculture and the Department of Labour, which we regarded as Ministries outside the Cabinet proper.  He was responsible for those.  Although we have not subordinate Ministries at present, still a Minister is responsible for a number of different sections.  Take the case of the Minister for Industry and Commerce. You could get out of his Department a number of different Ministries.  One which would strike you immediately would be Transport and Communications. In other countries there is a Minister for Transport and Communications. In some cases they are joined, in some they are separate.  You can take any Department of State practically and sub-divide it.  If you wish to take that point of view you might say of many services: &ldquo;This deserves to have a special Minister in charge of it&rdquo;.  It is obvious you cannot do that.  You have to try to be reasonable, and in the Constitution, in view of the likely number of members in the Dáil, and to ensure that there would not be too many members in office, the maximum number of Ministers was fixed at 15.</P>
    <P>It would be interesting to discuss the whole question of Parliamentary Secretaries, whether it is a good system or not.  A Minister might very well say in dealing with it that it is a bad system.  He may say: &ldquo;A Parliamentary Secretary is far more independent than I am because I have at least to meet my colleagues a few times a week and they are likely to be critical of everything I do but he does not meet them at all.  He is far away.  I have to go into details and take responsibility for him.  Sometimes my colleagues may object to what the Parliamentary Secretary does but I have to take responsibility for him without knowing thoroughly the various things that have happened.&rdquo;  I know that some Ministers have expressed the view that the whole system of Parliamentary Secretaries is bad essentially and that it should be dropped altogether.  However, we have managed to get along so far with these arrangements.  Personally I can say that my whole effort has <Col N="1251" /> been to keep down the number of Ministers I think it is desirable that we should have only a reasonable number.  If the Ministry becomes large, discussions at meetings become long and decisions become more difficult. The difficulties that we have already in connection with our work would be greatly increased if you were to enlarge the number of members of the Cabinet. I do not know how they have managed in Britain but I think that in a crisis it is very rare for the Ministry as a whole to meet.  There is a certain amount of delegation of the power of the Government as a whole.  A certain number will act in the name of the Government and the Government as a whole will discuss some of the measures.</P>
    <P>I want to say finally with regard to the general idea to which Senator Sir John Keane gave expression that I see its value.  We are doing something in that direction but I should not like to say that it is going to be a general practice.  I have given some of the reasons why we could not agree that it should be a regular practice and why in this particular case it is being adopted in regard to public health services. In regard to income maintenance services there would be no point in adopting it because that is not considered a thing on which you want information.  I do not know what I should ask the Seanad to do about the motion.  But having expressed these views&mdash;I do not know if it is proper for me to make suggestions here&mdash;it seems to me that the terms of the resolution do not indicate exactly what the Senator wanted, and, having heard it discussed, I think that the motion might be held over.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>May I support the suggestion of the Taoiseach that the motion should not be put to the House?  I do not know what Senator Sir John Keane intended to achieve by the motion and I sympathise with the Taoiseach in that he came here without knowing what case he was expected to answer.  As for myself, I do not know precisely what case Senator Sir John Keane intended to make but <Col N="1252" /> I think he did make a case which, perhaps, was not appreciated by the Taoiseach.  The case he made seems to be that we may gradually, by different pieces of legislation, accomplish a piecemeal revolution unknown to ourselves and that we may do something piecemeal towards achieving a thing which we have not ourselves in view. If the Government have had it in view then I think the Government should declare that plan and that policy beforehand.  Let me give an example. We are accomplishing a revolution in local government and the White Paper explanatory of that particular Bill does not meet the case Senator Sir John Keane has in mind.  I have some sympathy with the case he has in mind even though it appears to me that the motion is not drafted to indicate that case at all.</P>
      <P>In the case of local government, we had to begin with a Managerial Bill applied to the City of Dublin only. That Bill was almost violently opposed by the Taoiseach himself and those who were associated with him.  Then subsequently, when they became the Government, a County Manager Bill was introduced, applying the Dublin system to the counties, although a different position existed as between the county boroughs and the county. Now we have a Public Health Bill&mdash;I am not going to discuss it&mdash;and a Local Government Bill in the Dáil.  Into the Local Government Bill, after it had been introduced, an amendment was put which takes away from local bodies the powers they had over the general financial position.  These local government bodies must strike a rate at the request or on the order of the Minister for Local Government.  That may or may not be a good provision but the point I want to make is that, taking all these things together, the result is that no power at all is left to local bodies.  I think the case that has been made this evening is that the Government should declare in a general way its plans in regard to local government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The same question arises with regard to rates.  A matter of £24,000,000 was mentioned as likely to be spent on public health services.  Is that £24,000,000 to come from central taxation <Col N="1253" /> or from rates?  What is the policy in regard to rates?  Is it intended, for example, that there shall be, so to speak, a destruction of local bodies plus a rise in rates as a result of legislation passed by the central Parliament? All that is something which might be envisaged in one White Paper.  We might have a general view before we proceed to discuss particular pieces of legislation which will accomplish a very considerable revolution. Again, it has to be remembered that there is a very important difference between central taxation and local rates.  If you have no income, you are not called upon to pay income-tax but whether you have an income or not you must pay rates if you have a rateable valuation on your house and you cannot have a house without a rateable valuation.  A number of important points of that kind arise which are not explained.</P>
    <P>Similarly, with regard to public health, it is not explained why it is proposed to appoint a Minister for Public Health.  At the moment there is a Parliamentary Secretary in charge of that Department and, if I am to take the Taoiseach literally, Parliamentary Secretaries appear to have more independence than Ministers. That may again explain the behaviour of some of them but we shall let that pass.  We have the decision on the part of the Government to appoint a Minister for Public Health.  We have at the moment a Public Health Bill of a very drastic voluminous character going through the Dáil which will eventually come to the Seanad. When that has been passed, it will be presented to the new Minister. In other words, what the Minister has to do in detail, and what his relations are to be to the local bodies, is decided before he is appointed at all. That would appear to me to be rather a mistake.  It is not, therefore, explanatory memoranda of particular Bills.  You want rather to look at the problem as a whole, with an opportunity given to the two Houses of the Oireachtas to discuss these general proposals.</P>
    <P>Examples were given from Great Britain of medical services.  The difference <Col N="1254" /> in our method of approach to these things and that of the British method is very remarkable.  We have a Public Health Bill which got no public discussion before it was printed. The Bill was presented to the doctors who are very important persons in this regard.  They were not allowed to express their views to the Parliamentary Secretary in conference on the matter until the Bill had received a Second Reading, in other words, until the principle of the Bill had been decided.  Now that is surely a wrong attitude.  It is a different attitude from that of the British.</P>
    <P>Even on education, I was wondering as the debate went on, whether if people had been compelled by usage and by circumstances to set out say 20 years ago what our policy was on education in a White Paper, whether it would not be very interesting reading now, and whether we would not be able to compare what has happened in the last 20 years to what we set out to achieve.  Would it not be a good thing now, for example, in connection particularly with education, if we had set out a statement of Government policy with regard to some of the very important matters that arise in education?  A Bill does not always explain Government policy.  This House will remember a School Attendance Bill in which there was a particular section which we debated for days and days, and which finally was declared by the Supreme Court to be <i>ultra vires</i> the Constitution.  In spite of the fact that that section was in the Bill, this House certainly failed to get any explanation as to what the section was intended to mean.  Senators who were members of the House at the time will recollect the particular section to which I am alluding.</P>
    <P>Take the British method of dealing with social insurance.  The Beveridge plan was printed, containing certain very important principles to one of which the Taoiseach alluded.  It was forgotten, in a good deal of the discussion on that plan, that the putting of it into operation depended on a rise in production in Great Britain.  Here there is no such document setting forth what the attitude of mind of the <Col N="1255" /> Government is.  You get it indicated by the fact that the Minister for Local Government sets forth a theory which is completely contrary to democratic policy and democratic procedure, namely that anybody he appoints must be his servant, not only for the carrying out of his particular duties but that that individual must never express himself in public in any way which would indicate that he disagrees with the Minister.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach appears to be of opinion&mdash;I have heard other Ministers say the same thing&mdash;that the procedure for turning out Bills is too slow for the public need.  Long before Fianna Fáil came into office I did not believe that.  I never believed it.  My belief is that the procedure for turning out Bills is far too fast for the public need.  What Ministers mean when they say that the procedure for turning out Bills is too slow for the public need is that the procedure is too slow for what the Government think is the public need, which is quite a different thing.  I really think that, in spite of the fact that the motion does not express on its face, apparently, what Senator Sir John Keane means, he is quite right in saying that we should have, where it is possible, and even if it means delay, a comprehensive statement and general plan from the Government, which would be before the public and which would serve to educate the public.  Members of the two Houses might discuss it in their own circles with interested people.  We should not be in the position that legislation would be passed in this way: one Bill now and one Bill again, so that when they had become Acts you found that you had actually accomplished a revolution of which you had got no notice.  I think that Senator Sir John Keane deserves our gratitude for having brought that point to the notice of the House and to the public. At the same time I think the motion is one which, obviously, could not be the subject of a division.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir John Keane Sir John Keane">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no intention whatever of putting the motion to a division.  I do not know that there <Col N="1256" /> has ever been a division in this House on any of the motions which I have brought before it in this way.  Their object is to stimulate discussion on matters of importance, and I feel that has been effected in this case.  I agree with the Taoiseach that I might have been a little more precise in the terms of my motion, but I assumed, and I think rightly, that he knew what had been happening for years past in Great Britain on this subject of White Papers or, as one might call it, advanced news on the principles of legislation.  I was rather disappointed that he should have stressed so strongly the differences in machinery and procedure as between ourselves and Great Britain and did not enter more into what I had in mind, namely the spirit of the whole proposal.</P>
      <P>With regard to procedure, I am really not convinced by his argument. Take education, to which I was glad to hear Senator Hayes refer.  Some reform in education is long overdue. We can go along perfectly well for the next two years, but would it not be possible during that time to set out the framework of that reform?  Let me stress this, that I do not mean that the White Paper should set forth definite proposals to which the Government of the day would be committed.  I think that if the heads of proposals were set forth in the White Paper they might serve the public need.  We would not be committed to them, but we would like to get the reaction of the public to them.  When we had heard what people had to say about them, then we could frame our legislation to a certain extent, and its preparation could go on concurrently with the discussion in public of what was in the White Paper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am very grateful to the Taoiseach for the sympathetic, although rather restricted, manner in which he has accepted my proposal.  I do ask him to keep an open mind on the spirit of the proposal, that is, the necessity for bringing the people as a whole, as well as the various organisations of the people, into closer touch with legislation. Is it the intention that this White Paper which we are going to have on public legislation, and which <Col N="1257" /> I feel we should have had before the Public Health Bill was introduced, should be circulated to the local authorities and the health authorities for their comments, and will their comments be considered before the legislation is introduced?  I am not asking the Taoiseach to answer that question now.  In conclusion, I thank the House for the way it has received <Col N="1258" /> the motion.  The discussion on it has not been in vain.  With the leave of the House, I beg to withdraw the motion.</P>
    <P>Motion, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 9 p.m. until Wednesday, the 10th April, 1946, at 3 p.m.</P>
