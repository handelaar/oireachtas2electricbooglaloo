      <P>I move amendment No. 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (1), paragraph (a), lines 6-7, in page 3, to delete the words &ldquo;and if so required by the Minister shall,&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment governs amendment No. 2.  It is put down for the purpose of ensuring the independence of the local authority.  It appears to me to be desirable that, if the Department are not to meet the entire cost of the grant, the local authority should have some discretion in regard to individual cases.  I should be quite satisfied if the mandatory provision was merely that the Minister should direct a local authority to bring in a scheme to deal with these shelters.  According to the wording of the section, however, the Minister may, on my reading, determine that a particular applicant may, and must, have a grant given to him for building a shelter at his particular house.  That appears to me completely to cut across any independent function which a local authority may have.  It is a very old and true saying that there should be no taxation without representation. In this case, the local authority is being taxed to the extent of the portion of the grant which it must give and it is left without discretion in the matter.  If the Minister looks at the proposal in that way, he will, I think, agree that it is unnecessarily restrictive of the independence of the local authorities.  In addition, it might not work out well in individual cases.  The local authority might come <Col N="186" /> to the conclusion that, in a particular area, it would be bad policy to have a shelter erected, having regard to the fact that other sufferers in the area were being treated in institutions.  In that respect, the local authority should be left some discretion.  As regards the question of payment, it was not competent for us to deal with the proposal in the Bill as to do so would involve an additional charge on the Exchequer but it seems to me that the line taken by Senator Baxter on the last occasion was absolutely correct.  This question of tuberculosis is a national problem and it should be dealt with as such and not by individual local authorities. Since the State is to meet only two-thirds of the charge, it is essential that the independence of the local authorities should be upheld by the deletion of the words suggested in paragraph (a).</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment. I do not know whether or not the Minister has so convinced himself of the equity of this mode of procedure as to be impervious to reason or argument. The interests of individuals which are involved in this issue may be, to some of us who come up from the country, a matter of intimate and even personal concern on which we cannot remain silent.  It may be that the Minister has one view regarding the functions and responsibilities of the local authorities and that we have another.  I find it very difficult to understand why a proposition such as this is made to rational people down the country.  The Minister proposes to direct the representatives on a local authority to provide certain funds for the reconstruction of residences within their domain.  The Minister must take the view that local authorities are quite irresponsible, quite incompetent and that they have no appreciation of the interests of those with whom they have to deal, or of the position they occupy with regard to the administration of public funds, levied mainly by way of rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No other line of reasoning can justify the Minister asking for powers such as these.  Let us look at what he is proposing. The section enables an addition to be made to any residence after <Col N="187" /> a recommendation from the tuberculosis officer for the county.  Presumably, what will happen will be that the medical officer of health, or his assistant, will make an application that So-and-So should have an additional room to his residence.  When that report is made, it is a matter for the Minister to issue his edict.</P>
    <P>This edict of the Minister will come down to the local authority, directing the provision of an additional room to a residence.  That seems to me to be a provision enabling the Department to override the views of the local authority.  When the Minister asks for this power, he is really trying to treat the local authority as if they were children.  He treats them as children, without any sense of responsibility or without any understanding of their obligations.  It is proposed that the local authority should be put into a position of having continually to carry out the Minister's orders, whatever they may be, and regardless of their own judgment in the matter.</P>
    <P>Eventually, we shall reach the stage when local authorities will not know what commitments they must meet, when they are making up their estimates. In fact, they do not know that to-day.  They do not know what further impositions the Minister may seek to impose upon them within the financial year.  Last year they had experience of that, when the Minister was responsible for a considerable addition to expenditure for which no provision was made at the beginning of the financial year.</P>
    <P>I am not arguing that we should not make this effort but I am arguing that this is the wrong way to go about getting the right thing done, and I speak on it because I know the attitude of a number of the local authorities.  The Minister has the power and the impression seems to be that it does not matter what the local authority may think.  I do not mind what Party is in power or what Government rules&mdash; what I object to is the general attitude towards local authorities.  The local people, no matter what those in the Custom House may think, are not as stupid, and not as unconcerned, about <Col N="188" /> the health of the people as we might be led to believe.  It would seem that some people in the Department of Local Government and Public Health would think they are stupid.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister, very seriously, that he can get this thing done better by leading the people rather than driving them.  The people will not be satisfied to have his objects carried out in the way he proposes.  I suggest to the Minister that he will get a greater sense of responsibility among local representatives by treating the ratepayers, and their representatives, as grown-up men and women, with their own sense of responsibility about their obligations to the community regarding the health of the people within their administrative areas.  I suggest that the Minister should accept the amendment of Senator Sweetman.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to ask the Minister to explain how he thinks this proposal will work.  It seems, from reading the Bill, that the county medical officer of health, or another doctor, may certify that, owing to the state of health of the patient and the nature of the house itself in which he lives, additional accommodation should be provided.  If the Minister recommends it, the local body must carry it out, but by what process is the local authority to do it?  What kind of officer may override the local authority?  Presumably the expression &ldquo;Minister&rdquo; means some officer of the Minister, and I would like to know how it works where the Minister has to make an Order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under sub-section (5) of Section 3 the Minister may make regulations.  I can see no objection to the Minister making regulations, when certain conditions are fulfilled, but I am not clear what the Minister may make regulations about.  To me, it seems that the whole provision fails for vagueness. Nobody wants to support a local authority which takes up a futile attitude and refuses to put the provisions of the Act into operation.  We agree that it should be put into operation, but surely the local authority would be willing to take the advice of its own medical officer.  We expect, naturally, that it would have the good sense to <Col N="189" /> do that, but we do not know what particular officer of the Minister should have power to make a decision.  What principle should be applied if the local authority is not to have an overriding decision?  If there are no principles there will, inevitably, be the charge that persons of different political complexions may get preference.  Somebody will say that because he belonged to a particular Party somebody could get a room added to his house, while someone else of a different political complexion could not.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree completely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. MacEntee) Seán MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me that after Senator Sweetman's agreement with the views of Senator Hayes there is little to be said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>What did it do?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that it meant the amendment should be withdrawn. Surely it is not contemplated that the Minister, who has power to make regulations under the section, will make regulations dealing with every point Senator Hayes has raised? That was not the fashion of this Government, and it was not even the fashion of my predecessor.  When we got general power to ensure that certain things should be done, provision was made for the making of regulations to cover points such as Senator Hayes has raised.  Naturally, of course, the first provision of the regulations would be to require county councils in general, and the local authorities concerned, to put a scheme of this sort into operation, and under those regulations we feel that every person entitled to secure the benefit of this Act would naturally apply to the officer designated for the purpose, whether the officer of the local authority, the secretary, or the medical officer of health.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>Or the local authority?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Or the local authority. The local authority will take all steps necessary to ensure that applications <Col N="190" /> are considered by the medical officer of health for the county or by his assistant, and if he is satisfied that the conditions prescribed by the Act are fulfilled, his certificate would issue.  Now we heard a lot about the reasonableness of local authorities. The certificate of the county medical officer would issue and be addressed, presumably, to the local authority who in this case, as this would be an executive function, would act through its manager, if the Minister was for any reason compelled to require it to act in a particular case, in such a case as might arise under sub-section (3).</P>
      <P>But let me get back.  We are discussing at the moment amendment No. 1, and that amendment proposes to leave to the local authority full discretion to disregard the certificate of its own competent medical officer in a matter of this sort.  I do not think that any local authority should be left that discretion.  I remember debates in this House, when public health issues were raised here, and there was no Senator's heart bled more freely or with more concern about the spread of tuberculosis throughout the country than Senator Baxter's. Senator Sweetman did not weep quite so copiously but I assume that the concern which was expressed on these occasions was genuinely felt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, it is genuinely felt now as in the past.  The Minister is trying to misrepresent Senators.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>If it were genuinely felt, what justification is there for leaving to any local authority, charged with particular duties under the Tuberculosis Prevention (Ireland) Act and the other duties with which I assume they will be charged under the present Public Health Bill, any discretion to ignore the certificate of their own medical officer, if there is a person suffering from tuberculosis whose cure would be expedited by the provision of this extra accommodation in his dwelling?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>Who said they would ignore it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the justification for bringing them into the Bill if <Col N="191" /> the Minister is to be a complete dictator?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not interrupt Senator Sweetman or Senator Baxter when they were speaking.  I am not pleading for mercy but it is quite clear that they do not want this matter discussed. I was asking what justification is there in these circumstances for allowing a body of laymen a discretion to refuse to carry out their plain duty to their own community, because remember that apart altogether from the fact that the health and the life of the particular person affected by the disease are involved, as well as that the health of all those who come in contact with him, whether they are immediate relatives or those who visit his house, may be involved also.  What Senators are asking me to do is to agree, where steps can be taken which would enable a person to recover his health&mdash;or if not to recover his health that would at least prevent him from being a more dangerous source of infection to his neighbours&mdash;to allow the local authority solemnly to determine that the steps which the medical officer of health certifies may be taken and should be taken to enable him to recover and to prevent him from being a source of infection, will not be taken.  That is what they are contending if the local authority so wishes.</P>
      <P>One might as well say that the Public Health Acts should not be made mandatory, that no public health authority should be compelled by statute to carry out the responsibilities which are imposed on it by law, that the Oireachtas should pass measures here and that they should remain pious aspirations to be acted upon if members of the local authority, with the same sort of mentality which characterises Senator Baxter, should determine that they will, or, because they might impose a certain burden on the ratepayers, should determine that they will not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is really what is the issue here. I do not think for one moment that that is the general mentality which animates local authorities.  I know that, so far from having to urge and spur local authorities on to incur expenditure <Col N="192" /> in matters of this sort, we sometimes have to exercise on their behalf a form of prudence and ask them to look around, but all local authorities are not like that.  There are some local authorities which are dominated by the mentality of Senator Sweetman and Senator Baxter.  I do not think that in the present circumstances, with this problem of tuberculosis confronting us, that mentality should be given the right to operate irrespective of the public good, because that is how it does operate in the generality of cases.  That is why I ask the Seanad to reject this amendment. If you do not reject it, and it is inserted, I shall advise the Dáil to reject it.  I do not think, in view of the reception which the Bill got in the Dáil, that there will be any question as to what will be the fate of the amendment there.  I do suggest that it is not consonant with the good judgment of this House, at any rate, that an amendment of this sort should be passed here, because if you accept it you are in fact saying: &ldquo;We do not care what the competent medical authority in the neighbourhood thinks about any particular case&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>No one said anything of the sort.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;&ldquo;We do not care what the competent medical authority thinks in any particular neighbourhood about any particular case; we say that the laymen on the county council may override that opinion and may deprive applicants of benefits to which they are entitled under this Bill&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I would ask the Minister to exercise a little care before he deliberately tries to mislead this House.  The first thing I would ask him to do is to go back to his Department before the next stage of this Bill and to ascertain from that Department whether, in fact, I as a member of a county council asked the local county medical officer of health a couple of years ago whether he wanted more money to deal with a publicity campaign on tuberculosis.  If the Minister finds, as he will find, that that is a fact it seems, to say the least of it, rather <Col N="193" /> unjust that the Minister should come in here and suggest that this amendment is designed to deal with something that is entirely different from the purpose for which it is designed, to suggest that it is designed to restrain local authorities from spending money on tuberculosis and trying to make it appear that Senator Baxter and myself are anxious for the spread of tuberculosis amongst the people.  The fact is that if the Minister wanted to do what he has just said, the section is very badly drafted.  The section as drafted provides that the Minister can override a judgment in an individual case.  What I want the Minister to do is to frame regulations and, if and when a case comes within these regulations, then the job will be done.</P>
      <P>That appears to me the ordinary method of carrying on business&mdash;not that the Minister can walk in and make a certain action mandatory in a particular case and, having made it mandatory, waste the time of the local authority in having to consider the matter at all.  If the Minister drew up his scheme properly it would be quite an easy matter to carry it out, and then there would be no difficulty at all arising between the Minister and the local authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I read this Bill pretty carefully, and I read it to mean that the intention of the Minister was to leave discretion to the local authorities, subject to certain cases where they might be over-ridden.  I gathered from his speech that that is not his intention &mdash;that his intention is to make it mandatory. If that is so, then I think it should be made mandatory; that this section should read: &ldquo;the local authority shall, in accordance with the regulations made under this Act&rdquo;, and that there should be no question about &ldquo;may, unless over-ridden by the Minister&rdquo;.  I quite genuinely believed that his intention was to leave it to their discretion, except in individual cases where the Minister thought there was injustice and that he should right it.  I suggest to the Minister that this is a case where it would be very much better from every point of view to make it clear in the Bill that they shall do so <Col N="194" /> in accordance with the regulations which will be made under the Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>I merely want to repudiate the implications of the Minister's references to me&mdash;that the purpose is to ensure that certain local authorities who will not do their duty by the people who are ill in their county, and who want treatment such as will be made possible under this Bill when it becomes law, will not be dominated by a mentality like mine.  That is the statement made by the Minister.  Senator Sweetman has indicated to the Minister that he should inform himself somewhat better about the activities of people like Senator Sweetman in his county in relation to their efforts to improve the standard of public health. If he will busy himself equally in regard to my attitude in my county, he will find the very same thing.  It would be very much more honest on the part of the Minister to get his facts right before imputing to members of the House motives entirely at variance with their attitude to this matter in the past. If he had got his facts correctly, it would be very much simpler to discuss a measure like this, in which we are just as interested as the Minister, and as to which we have experience, perhaps, of a rather different type from the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I realise, of course, that it is quite impossible to argue with a Minister who will make the kind of approach which he has made to this problem. In fact, one wonders whether it is worth one's while giving any attention to the matter at all.  Does the Minister really want the co-operation of local authorities in his battle to improve the standard of health in this country, or does he think he is going to win that co-operation by imputing to people like Senator Sweetman and myself the kind of motives to which he has referred here to-day?  Is he just childish, or merely foolish, or does he want to look upon us as children? It is not my purpose, and I am sure it was not Senator Sweetman's purpose either, in moving this amendment or in speaking to it, to indicate that our view is that there will be neglect of the health of the people by the local authorities.  Not at all.  As a matter of fact, as a member of a local authority, <Col N="195" /> I would be much more enthusiastic in proceeding to take steps such as are suggested in this Bill without getting directions from the Minister or his Department at all.  If the responsibility and the obligations are put on the local people, as a matter of conscience, and as a matter of public duty, I think their response will be much more enthusiastic than anything the Minister is going to get under this Bill.  The Minister may have the most supreme contempt for Senator Sweetman and myself, and for other people here who come from the country, but we have views of our own on this matter, and so have the local people, including the Minister's own supporters.  You can proceed along this line up to a certain point, but you will reach a point some fine day when local government in this country will crack into pieces.  You are driving in that direction.  Perhaps that is what the Minister wants.  If that be the Minister's aim, I do not think there is any use in my asking him to stop.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TheodoreMoore" hpid="Mr. Kingsmill Moore Mr. Kingsmill Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kingsmill Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>May I suggest that the Minister is doing less than justice both to himself and to his opponents?  It is the business of the Minister to make general rules, for universal application, and completely impartial.  He has that power under the section.  It is his business to do so, and I have no doubt he will do so, and, as far as I could understand, the emphasis laid by Senator Baxter and Senator Sweetman was on the necessity for such procedure.  What the Minister does not seem to realise is that if in addition to that power he reserves to himself the power to examine individual cases, and to say: &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; to one and &ldquo;No&rdquo; to another, he must inevitably put himself in the invidious position that no matter how carefully he acts he is almost certain to be accused of political bias.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is why I say that I think the Minister is not doing himself justice. The medical officer recommends a case. One of the considerations, no doubt, which will come for careful thought before the local authority is the wealth of the person concerned.  If it were Mr. <Col N="196" /> David Frame or somebody like that, they would probably say: &ldquo;You can provide your own house&rdquo;.  They would be in a position to know the exact circumstances. If they considered that for any particular reason it was not incumbent upon them, upon the general fund or upon the local fund, to provide that particular house, they might say: &ldquo;This is not a case for us to interfere in&rdquo;.  If the Minister, after having had the matter brought before him, were to reverse that decision, he certainly would be open to suspicion no matter on what <i>bona fides</i> he acted.  That is why I say that I think the Minister has not done justice to himself in fighting so vigorously against this amendment, and he certainly has not done justice to his opponents, because, to my mind, he has misrepresented them.  I think a certain amount of unnecessary heat has come into this.  Framed as it is, it looks very like giving to the Minister power not to act by universals which is the function of the Minister, but to interfere in individual cases, which is nearly always objectionable and intolerable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Senator Baxter has reason to be grateful to Senator Kingsmill Moore for his diversionary action on his behalf.  I have listened to Senator Baxter trying to forget what he did say in his opening speech in support of this amendment. I do not know what the Senator's activities may be on his local body.  I am sure they are just as praiseworthy as Senator Sweetman's are on his.  I can only judge the Senator on his performance here, and on the statements which he makes here.  When he rose to support Senator Sweetman he made it quite clear what he had in mind&mdash; that what he wished to do was to reserve to the local authority power to ignore or override the certificate of its own medical officer of health.  He told us that for one reason or other the local authority in a particular area might be concerned to prevent the erection of those particular additions to existing houses.  Does the Senator remember that?  What has that got to do with public health except to make certain that all considerations of public health, and all considerations for the welfare of a person affected by tuberculosis <Col N="197" /> and his immediate relatives and those who come in contact with that family, will take second place to some other consideration to which the local authority chooses to attach primary importance?</P>
      <P>Then he went on to say that an edict will come down from the Department of Local Government to put this scheme into operation, and that then the assistant county medical officer of health, or some other person, would go around inspecting premises, would issue a certificate, and that the local authority would have to comply with the certificate; and for that reason he objected to that.  I have said that the issue raised by this amendment was a simple one: as to whether the local authority was to have power to ignore all its responsibilities in regard to the prevention and cure of tuberculosis, and that if the amendment were to be carried, the net effect would be that you would be at the mercy of those local authorities which adopted the same attitude towards this problem as Senator Baxter did in his speech, in suggesting that some other considerations than that of the public health should be the governing factor in this matter, and I do not think I was unjust in saying that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator himself, after all, did say these things, and it was on these things that he based his case.  There was not any question then about deciding according to the universals.  Oh, no; the local authority was to decide in each particular case, and to determine in each particular case, irrespective of any Order or regulation made by the Minister.  That is one of the particular grounds on which I am opposed to this amendment. Now, there are other aspects of this amendment.  The sub-section requires that the local authority shall make to the owner or occupier of the house a grant towards the provision of an extra room in or attached to the house, and other paragraphs of the sub-section require that the grant shall not be made except certain conditions are fulfilled.  These conditions have to <Col N="198" /> be certified by some officer of the local authority.  Now, a person may be aggrieved and very greatly injured by the refusal of a certificate of an engineer, notwithstanding the fact that the primary certificate, the certificate of the medical officer of health, has been issued, and notwithstanding the fact that the premises have been certified as being fit for having such an addition made to them.  The third point is that the certificate may be withheld because, in the opinion of some person, the third condition has not been fulfilled.</P>
      <P>Now, surely there must be an appeal to somebody in such a case, and surely the person who has the final appeal must have power to enforce his decision, but how can he enforce his decision unless he has statutory power to do so?  Surely, he must have statutory power to make sure that his decision will be honoured.  It is quite clear that this amendment and its implications have not been fully considered.  Otherwise, as I have pointed out, it is quite plain that there would not be such an amount of resentment at the exposure of what, in fact, the amendment did imply.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister please deal with the point made by Senator Douglas: that the amendment should read that the local authority &ldquo;shall, in accordance with the regulations made under this Act&rdquo;?  Will he deal with that point?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think there is any substance in that point.  The statutory Order says that the local authority &ldquo;may&rdquo;, and that is almost mandatory in these Acts.  I understand that the element of option is very slight, but in order that there may be no mistake as to what is the duty of the local authority in this case, the words &ldquo;and if so required by the Minister, shall&rdquo; are inserted.  I do not see what the force of Senator Douglas' point was.

      <P>The Minister has a habit of weaving pleasantries around topics that are not pleasant at all.  I asked him what he intended to do under the regulations, and what the machinery was, and he gave us some information which we had not got before that.  It seems to me that the Minister may make regulations, but the Minister should have power under this Bill, when it becomes an Act, to make regulations to set out conditions under which a local authority must give a grant, and the Minister will then have power to say to them that they must make a grant, certain conditions having been fulfilled; but what he is doing here is quite a different thing.  He objects to the local authority saying in a particular case: &ldquo;We will not build an extra room for Patrick Murphy,&rdquo; and in another case he is saying in effect: &ldquo;I will not make them build an extra room for Patrick Murphy, but I will compel them to build an extra room for Tom Ryan&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>In other words, he is taking power to discriminate amongst individuals. This is a kind of thing which is a common form under this Government and many other governments in the world: &ldquo;Look, we have not the regulations in front of us at the moment, and we will not have them until the Bill becomes an Act, and therefore we cannot say what they will be&rdquo;.  The Minister professes not to know what the conditions will be.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, perhaps my knowledge of the English language is different from that of the Minister, but I understood the Minister definitely to suggest that he could not say exactly what they would be.  The position seems to me to be quite plain.  The Minister should have power to make regulations under Section 5.  These regulations, he has told us now, under <Col N="200" /> one of the principal Housing Acts, will be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas.  When he lays down these regulations, under which certain provisions for persons suffering from tuberculosis should be made, then the local authority will have to comply with these regulations, and the Minister should have power to make them comply with the regulations, but in that case the local body should have no option, and hence paragraph (a) of sub-section (1) should read that &ldquo;the local authority shall, in accordance with the regulations, make to the owner or occupier of the house a grant,&rdquo; and so on, and in that case it would be over and above board, and individual cases would not be considered behind closed doors.  That is where Senator Kingsmill Moore was absolutely right when he said that the Minister is doing less than justice to his opponents and less than justice to himself, because the Minister, quite gratuitously and wrongly, thinks that his opponents have a mentality that is opposed to the whole principle of this.  I give the Minister credit for being himself very much interested in the crushing out of tuberculosis, and in that respect he would have to take power to crush it out, but the power of deciding individual cases should not be left to an unnamed officer in the Custom House, who may be subject to influences of one character or another.</P>

If &ldquo;may&rdquo; means &ldquo;shall&rdquo;, put &ldquo;shall&rdquo; in.  I do not see why the Minister does not do that. That would relieve everyone of the necessity of considering individual cases.  It would leave the matter, too, to be determined by the county medical officer of health, or by another medical officer, and it would be outside the arena of political debate or any <Col N="201" /> other type of debate.  It would be better drafting and be better business, as well as being more effective help for people suffering from tuberculosis.</P>

      <P>As a member of a local authority with a certain amount of knowledge as to how a county medical officer of health or a tuberculosis officer acts, I might state that there are two conditions precedent to the county council entering into this matter.  The county medical officer must certify that a person is suffering from tuberculosis, and that the existing accommodation is inadequate.  These two conditions must be fulfilled before anybody can interfere. I do not care what regulations may be made by the Minister, these two conditions cannot be overridden. With the insertion of these two conditions the county medical officer or the tuberculosis officer gives a certificate.  I am a member of a local authority and I am aware of the faults and defects of some of these authorities, but there is nothing wrong in saying that if Parliament passes an Act imposing upon them a certain duty, the local authorities should not be in a position to flout the Act.  Otherwise you would have 32 separate and independent republics.</P>

While there he listened for a long time to many people talking, and afterwards inquired who exactly these people were.

As an ordinary member who gives a good deal of thought to local work in the county in which I reside, <Col N="202" /> I cannot see any difficulty arising.  I can certainly see no difficulty arising out of politics, by which Mr. X. would get a grant and Mr. Y. would not, because of his politics.  The administration of the Tuberculosis Acts throughout the country as a whole belies any such suggestion.  I submit that there are only two conditions taken into account.  As the county medical officer must certify, the Minister does not come into it at all.  The Minister cannot override the giving of a certificate on the grounds (1) that a person is suffering from tuberculosis and (2) that the accommodation is inadequate.  If a local authority refused to give a grant that they were authorised to make, I think that there should be a right of appeal but that would be taken away if the amendment were accepted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us get back to the certificates and consider the matter to which they relate.  I am not now dealing with the medical certificates. I am dealing merely with the certificates to be issued by the officer to whom the amendment relates.  Paragraph <Col N="206" /> (d) states that the local authority &ldquo;shall not make the grant unless and until it is certified that the house is suitable for being provided with an extra room&rdquo;.  The person who will do that, in the normal way, will be the housing officer of the local authority.  All officers of local authorities are not equally satisfactory, and it might be necessary, for the protection of everybody concerned, to designate some other officer as the certifying officer.  Normally, however, the officer designated would be the housing engineer.  Paragraph (e) states, &ldquo;subject to paragraph (f) of this sub-section, such local authority shall not pay the grant unless and until it is certified that the provision of the extra room has been completed in a proper and workmanlike manner&rdquo;. That is a matter to be dealt with by the local housing engineer.  Paragraph (f) provides that the local authority may pay by instalments, but shall not pay any instalment &ldquo;unless and until it is certified that the stage to which the instalment relates has been completed in a proper and workmanlike manner&rdquo;.  The questions which have arisen are: who is to estimate what the cost of the room is to be, in the first instance, and what the amount of the grant is to be?  I take it that we shall have a certain amount of prototype designs which the medical officer and housing engineer consider most suitable for adding to the particular types of building; that tenders will be received for construction of the room in that way; that a grant, up to the total cost of the room, will be provided by the local authority, and that the engineer will certify that the room has been completed at such cost, in accordance with the tender, or at a lower cost, if that be the case. If you ask me frankly how that is going to work out in every case, I cannot say, because there may be a case in which, for one reason or another, the original net estimate as to the cost of the building may be exceeded, but I assume that the normal feature of other contracts, the contingency provision, would govern it.</P>

      <P>After sub-section (4) to add new sub-section (5) as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(5) Where an extra room in or attached to a house is provided at the expense of the owner or occupier who would have qualified for a grant under the provisions of this section if such grant had been applied for, the house shall not, on any valuation or revision of the valuation thereof coming into force within seven years after the completion of such provision, be increased on account of any increase in the value of the hereditament or tenement arising from such provision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The object of my amendment is to provide for something of an anomaly which would arise in connection with this Bill.  My attention was drawn to it by people outside, and it seems to <Col N="208" /> be worthy of consideration.  Under the Bill, it is provided that where a grant is made there will be no increase in valuation for a period of seven years. It seems to me that some owners might prefer to pay the cost of erection themselves, and the amendment provides that if the owner is so prepared there should be no valuation increase for seven years when he has provided the money himself.  It is highly undesirable that where a person is prepared to spend a sum of money the rate should be increased.  It may not always be that that will happen but I am sure there will be many cases of it.</P>

      <P>May I say that this amendment is rather curious.  What the Senator wants to do is to prevent people paying rates.  His amendment is intended to cover those cases in which a grant is not applied for. What he is asking the House to do is to compel people with plenty of money to erect a house without a grant, not to pay extra rates&mdash;extra rates which they might be willing to pay.  One must assume that the person who is not willing to accept a grant is in a position to pay the extra rates.  We should not try to prevent him.</P>

Frankly, I do not believe that any such people exist, but I do know that there are people who refrain from making additions to their houses because of the fear of revaluation of the whole building and premises.  For them, revaluation <Col N="209" /> might be a serious matter.  In this case, we want to encourage people to make additions to their houses, and it is reasonable to ask that they should be protected from revaluation.</P>

The extra room will add a considerable proportion to the valuation of the house, but I see no provision in the Bill to cover the case of the owner-occupier who seeks to dispose of his house within a reasonable period after it has been built.</P>

      <P>Who is to get the additional value of the house on its resale?  Many people have been encouraged to build houses because of the remission in rates.  I think there is a lot in the contention that in the case of an added room for this purpose the rates may be waived.  We are asked to add an increased value to certain houses at the expense of the ratepayer and the taxpayer.  If the occupier lives in the house for 50 years it is not important, but what is important is that a number of these houses will come on the market for resale.  Who, then, will get the increased value?</P>

      <P>I am not without a great deal of sympathy for the purpose of Senator Douglas's amendment. Naturally, we are very anxious that where additional accommodation can be provided to enable sufferers from tuberculosis to be segregated at the expense of the occupier, that should be encouraged in every way possible. We should all like to see the additional accommodation provided by the owner or the occupier of the house rather than by the State.  The trouble about the Senator's amendment is that it affronts my sense of order.  It concerns premises not the subject of the provisions of the Housing Acts in relation to grants and therefore, would not be <Col N="210" /> covered in any sense by this particular Bill.  If this amendment were carried here, I could not undertake to recomment it to the Dáil.  But, there is a Local Government Bill going through the Dáil now, and this House will have an opportunity of considering the terms of that measure in due course.</P>
      <P>I will see whether I cannot put in an amendment to the Bill to cover the point which Senator Douglas has in mind in his amendment.  Of course, I could not put it in the exact form the Senator has suggested.  The medical officer of health would have to certify that the construction of this room was necessary, and certain conditions precedent would have to be fulfilled, but subject to that, I will see what I can do with it in another Bill.</P>

      <P>I put the amendment down because it was a serious point.  I am not going to fight it, but I want to say that I disagree with the Minister. I think it is made as clear as it could possibly be made.  The extra room would have qualified for the grant under the provisions of the section if the owner had applied for the grant. I would ask the Minister to consider the matter between now and Report Stage.  I do not stand for my wording, but I followed the wording of the Bill as closely as I possibly could.  All I am suggesting is that where it is a house that fulfils the conditions laid down in the Bill, and where a person could prove that he would be entitled to the grant&mdash;he would have to get the same certificates as a person applying for the grant&mdash;he should be given this concession.  There are quite a few people who would not go to the trouble of actually applying for the grant, but who would be very glad to get a reasonable concession.  I am afraid that if I waited for the introduction of the next Bill and then sought to have certain provisions applied to tuberculosis cases by an amendment of my own, I would be ruled out of order.  I might be told that the Bill had nothing to do with tuberculosis.  I would ask the Minister to consider whether this is not a reasonable proposition which might be met.</P>

      <P>My intention is to keep within the scope of the Bill.  All I want to secure is that if a house came within the scope of this Bill, and the owner would have been entitled to a grant but did not take it, say, that he had spent upwards of £40 or £50, then he would not find that his whole house would be revalued.  I think the Minister will agree with me that people are sometimes deterred from carrying out improvements because of the fact that it might lead to a revaluation of their premises.  If it were certified that the addition was made for the purpose of the treatment of a tuberculosis case, then the valuation of the house should not be increased on any revaluation within seven years after the addition had been made.</P>

      <P>In some cases this might not be necessary.  Take the case of a house belonging to a farmer under £25 valuation.  He could apply for a reconstruction grant.  Supposing, while he wanted to have the additional room, he did not want to go through the form of having the room certified as being for a particular purpose, he could apply for a reconstruction grant and he would get seven years' remission of rates in any event automatically. It would be, to my mind, very much easier if I could make this applicable to houses built or reconstructed under the Housing Acts.  That would cover a vast number of cases, but I should have to make it a condition that the purpose of the room would have to be certified.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make one point for the guidance of the Minister.  As I understand it, this section is not intended to have retrospective effect, and I want to bring to the notice of the Minister two cases which seem to have arisen over a period of a year or two, in which people in rather poor circumstances have, in fact, provided an additional room for the purpose of segregation. I am wondering if it is possible for the Minister to say, if a proper case is submitted, that a grant will be made available in respect of rooms, if they are otherwise satisfactory, which are built before this Bill becomes law.  One case in particular was brought to my notice of a person who had a rather limited income and who was in a position in which he could not continue his employment once he was certified to be suffering from tuberculosis.  The doctor considered that he should not be sent to an institution and money was borrowed to build an additional room to the house in order that he might be segregated from his family.</P>
      <P>The position is that the room is now built.  I do not know whether it satis fies the conditions of the Bill but, assuming that it does, it seems to me that it is a case that might be considered in view of the fact that the person had to borrow the money and that the money must be repaid.  I do not know how far the Minister or the local authority will be prepared to go in the matter but I submit that if a case can be made in respect of a room erected before the Bill becomes law, an effort should be made to meet it.</P>

      <P>When this Bill was having its second reading I threatened that I would bring in certain amendments to this section.  I think the Minister must have regarded that <Col N="215" /> threat with some seriousness, because, recollecting that he was not only Minister for Local Government but also Minister for Public Health, and possibly after consultation with his Parliamentary Secretary, he took care to dispatch that same night to my house a formidable parcel of influenza virus, so that I was quite incapable of writing or of drafting anything until yesterday morning.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TheodoreMoore" hpid="Mr. Kingsmill Moore Mr. Kingsmill Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kingsmill Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the personal disclaimer readily.  I did manage to draft them yesterday morning. I know they are of importance, and I know they are in accordance with the views of the medical profession. I hope the Minister is going to co-operate with me in getting them through, and will consult his own medical advisers.  I propose to indicate, by way of speaking to the section, what they are.  I said that I thought this section was conceived too narrowly. I think it is conceived too narrowly in at least a couple of respects.  It will be noticed that the medical officer of health can certify only that the existing accommodation in the house is inadequate for the proper segregation of the sufferer.  The first general amendment which I hope to introduce, and which I hope the Minister will accept, is that he may certify that it is inadequate for the proper treatment or for the proper segregation of the sufferer.  I doubt very much whether it will be easy to secure proper segregation, but I am perfectly clear that the provision of an extra room according to proper plans and designs will have or may have a profound curative effect, and most especially in the case of people who have been in a sanatorium, and have been discharged from it.  I know that I said this on the Second Reading, but I am going to repeat it now, because it cannot be said too often: when a person is sent out of a sanatorium he is not cured.  The disease is arrested, but it is only quiescent. It is there in his lungs, and has got to be sealed off, and his lungs have got to be hardened.  He is not infectious. Therefore, you cannot certify <Col N="216" /> that the room is necessary for his segregation from other members of the family.  He will not be sent out, unless there is tremendous shortage of beds, so long as his sputum is positive, but he is sent out in a state in which if he goes back to dark, ill-ventilated and dirty surroundings he is going to re-develop the disease in a very short time, and unless he can be put into surroundings where he has light, air, cleanliness and good food, he will not complete his cure, so as to be able to take his part in the ordinary affairs of life.  I think it is very essential that it should be possible for the medical officer to certify that the extra room is necessary, not merely for the segregation but for the treatment of the sufferer, and especially for the treatment of the sufferer who has just come out of a sanatorium.  That is the first line of amendment.</P>
      <P>Secondly, I want this section extended so as not merely to refer to the provision of a complete and separate room but to the alteration or modification of an existing room.  As it is, you can get a grant to build an entirely new room.  But supposing that what you really want to do is this: to knock out a small window which does not open fully, and to put in two big casement windows which would open fully and allow the sufferer to sleep in a through draught, or perhaps to raise the roof a little, I think you would not be able to do it under the section as drafted.  I think the section should be extended, not merely to provide rooms for curing people but to allow of adapting rooms for segregation and for curing, with certain provisions, one of which has been mentioned by Senator Fearon&mdash;that before a grant is paid it should be certified by whoever is the certifying authority that the plans for the provision of the extra room, or for the alteration or modification of the existing room, are as suitable as circumstances permit.  Now, I have the amendments drafted.  I have got only one copy, but I can make that available to the Minister immediately if he will let me have it back.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Speaking on the section, I do suggest&mdash;in fact I am positive&mdash;that the <Col N="217" /> introduction of those simple variations will about double the value of the section, and I ask the Minister to consider them, not from the point of view which Ministers sometimes do adopt, that everything which has not already been thought of by them or their Department must necessarily be either a bad thing or, at best, as the medical people would say, an innoxious substance with no curative effect.  I have taken the trouble to fortify my own views, which I hold very clearly, by other views of an expert nature.</P>

I am envisaging cases where there seems to be a marked improvement in the health of the unfortunate patient, and where it might be felt that segregation was no longer necessary, although it might be vitally necessary that that segregation should continue.  I see nothing at all in the Bill to ensure that the room provided at the expense of the State for a specific purpose will in fact be used for that purpose, and I am wondering what machinery the Minister has in mind to ensure that it will be used for the purpose for which it is provided.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fearon</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I repeat the suggestion I made some time ago, that the provisions of this Bill be extended to conditions other than pulmonary tuberculosis?  I have in mind conditions such as chronic heart or chronic chest, from which a person may have been suffering for years.  I think they have just as much claim in many ways on our consideration.  They are very often elderly people, and there is also <Col N="218" /> the question that if an extra room were to be provided for other purposes, such as I have suggested, it would not be always associated with the tuberculosis problem.  I was interested in Senator Summerfield's reference to the question as to whether the extra room would be used for the purpose for which it was provided. Well, I am afraid there is no means of compelling people to use a room for the purpose for which it is provided. It is just the same in the case of medicine: one prescribes medicine for people, but there is no guarantee that they will use it, or no means of compelling them to use it.  Of course, we sometimes get people to use medicine by dressing it up in a different form, making it sweet, and so on, and so they do not know that they are taking the medicine.  However, I am in favour of providing an extra room for people suffering from diseases other than tuberculosis, and I think that that could be easily arranged by extending the wording of sub-section (1) of Section 3, to include, as well as persons suffering from pulmonary tuberculosis, persons suffering from other diseases requiring medical treatment, and so forth.</P>

      <P>I should like to reply to one or two points that were made. First of all, let me set Senator Sir John Keane's mind at ease.  There is no intention to compel anybody to take <Col N="220" /> accommodation which they do not want.  Under the regulations, people who want to avail of the provisions of this Bill will apply to the local authorities, an officer of which will be designated for the purpose.  Then, what will happen will be that the appropriate medical officer of health will visit the premises, and if he finds that the premises are suitable for the provision of an extra room, and that an extra room is required for this purpose, he will certify to that effect, and the local authority may, or may not&mdash;let us be quite clear about this&mdash;make a grant, which will be assumed to cover the whole cost of the provision of this extra accommodation, but there is an overriding provision that the whole grant shall not exceed the grant approved by the Minister.  They cannot go further than making the grant, and the grant, I presume, will be made to the owner of the premises, and, in the great majority of cases, the owner will prove to be the local authority itself.  Now, the prime mover, the original mover, in this matter, is, of course, the person in the house who applies to come within the terms of the scheme.  Therefore, if he does not apply, the machinery does not come into effect, and accordingly there is no question of a person being compelled to take extra accommodation to his house if he does not want to do so, but we assume that all those people who might be expected to benefit by the provisions of the Act will naturally apply for such extra accommodation. In that connection, I might also say, in reply to the point made by Senator Summerfield, that there are no provisions in the Bill to ensure that such an extra room will be used for the purpose for which it will be provided. So far as mortal man is concerned, there is no means of ensuring that that will be done; all that we can hope is that people in whose houses this disease exists will naturally want to get rid of it and to take advantage of every opportunity to do so.  That is what we rely on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the suggested amendments by Senator Kingsmill Moore, I shall have to wait to see the amendments, but I promise him that I shall give to them all the consideration that I can.  Personally, I can see no objection <Col N="221" /> to them, except to the extent of the additional cost that the provision of the extra accommodation he seeks for would impose on the Exchequer; and in view of the fight that I have already had to put up with the Department of Finance in connection with this Bill, I am afraid that I could not ask for more than I have.  That is my answer to him as well as to Senator Fearon.  We-are providing free accommodation in the cases of persons suffering from a certain disease, because of its infectious nature, and the cost of these extra provisions is estimated to be about £100,000.  Accordingly, I am afraid that in the present state of the Exchequer, I would not receive the consent of the Minister for Finance to the imposition of any heavier expenditure. Consequently, I am afraid that I could not promise any extra expenditure at this stage.</P>

      <P>On this section I should like to institute what I might describe as the softening-up process of the Minister, anticipatory to an amendment that I will bring in on the Report Stage.  On the Second Reading I pointed out that it was not, from the point of view of the Minister for Finance, a very satisfactory thing to put up a permanent building, the property in which would pass to the owner of the existing building when, by all ordinary medical expectation, at the end of three or four years, it would be a white sepulchre or a white elephant, as either the unfortunate person for whom it was put up would be dead or he would be cured.  From the public health point of view, and from the point of view of the Minister for Finance, a grant of £150 would have been provided for a man who was dead, or for a man who was well, and although nobody could put the room in his pocket, he could put the proceeds from the sale of it.  Wherever possible it would be a much more economic proposition, <Col N="223" /> as well as a better proposition from the curative point of view, to provide temporary and easily-erected outdoor shelters, which would remain the property of a local authority. These could be put up when needed, and taken down when not needed, and would always be serving the purpose of helping to cure somebody instead of remaining for 80 out of a probable 100 years quite ineffective for the purpose for which they were put up.  I assume that a well-built room would last 100 years.  Certainly the man for whom it was put up would not be there at the end of that time.</P>
      <P>The Minister met my suggestion, not by a frontal attack but by a flank scrimmage.  He said he would accept the figures given by Senator O'Reilly that these shelters could be provided for about £30 or £40, but he thought if he took into account the cost of putting them up, and other incidental expenses, they would not be as good a proposition as they appeared.  As a matter of fact there is no expense in putting them up, except the hiring of a lorry to take them to the site.  They rest on concrete blocks and have revolving floors.  They would take about half an hour to erect.  They are meant to provide outdoor protection from the weather for people who are sleeping in them, and they have the advantage that they can be turned around to get the sun.</P>
      <P>There is no provision in this Bill whereby county councils are to provide these shelters out of their own funds and keep possession of them.  Section  provides for chalets, but it does not meet my objection, because any that are put up will become the property of the owners of the ground.  Although these shelters may not have a life of 100 years, if properly built wooden chalets they should have a life of 60 years, and five years after being put up they will cease, from the public health point of view, to be needed, either through their complete failure or complete success.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, I propose to introduce a new section, to the effect that where-ever a county medical officer of health <Col N="224" /> or a medical superintendent certifies that a member of a household in his area is suffering from tuberculosis&mdash;I use the word tuberculosis there to indicate all tuberculosis, because the treatment of bone tuberculosis may be dealt with&mdash;and should be segregated, in such circumstance the local authority administering the scheme may provide an outdoor hut or shelter for such period as the county medical officer of health may from time to time certify it to be necessary.  That will enable the county medical officer of health to certify when a shelter is immediaely necessary where a patient cannot be got into an institution. While a patient is in the institution the shelter could be taken down, and when he comes out the county medical officer can again certify that for, say, two years, it was necessary that a chalet should be provided.  At the end of that time it should be packed up and taken away.  In addition, a local authority may, if they think fit, make such charges as are reasonable, either by lump sum or annual payments, or the Minister for Finance may make such an allowance in respect to the provision of a shelter as he thinks fit. It is possible that the last provision would create a difficulty, although I think otherwise.  However, I intend to introduce an amendment on these lines and I suggest that it is no answer to say that under the tuberculosis scheme that may be done.  I do not want it done under the tuberculosis scheme. I want it under an Act where everybody will understand it, because it will be so much more efficient than providing permanent outdoor chalets, which would become the property of the ground owner, and might be only used once.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TheodoreMoore" hpid="Mr. Kingsmill Moore Mr. Kingsmill Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kingsmill Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to withdraw this amendment and reintroduce it in a slightly different form. There was a great deal of misunderstanding about his matter on the last occasion on which it was discussed. Yearly tenancies were taken out of the Bill, as they were taken out of the measure of 1923, because they were a type of tenancy already protected by another Act.  They were not taken out because of their duration or because of the notice necessary to determine them.  They were a type of tenancy already protected which did not require additional protection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The point made in the Dáil was a completely different one.  What was said there was that, although it might be right that that type of tenancy should be taken out of the Act, yet it was unfair that it should be determinable by short notice&mdash;notice of a week, as in the case brought before the Dáil.  I submit that the proper way to meet the position would be to go back to the form in which the provision was introduced, excluding business premises in a fair or market, business premises which are held for a term of years and business premises held on yearly tenancies&mdash;in all those cases there are other statutes or provisions to protect the owners of such premises&mdash;but adding at some suitable place in the Bill another section saying that business premises, within the valuation limits fixed in the Bill, which are excluded by reason of being yearly tenancies or tenancies for a term of years or tenancies in a fair or market shall not receive the protection of the Act but shall, nevertheless, not be terminable by notice of less than six months, given on either side. That will give the protection which was intended by those who raised the point in the Dáil.  It gives a limited protection in that the person will have notice if he is to go out.  For other protections, they will rely on the Landlord and Tenant Act.  I believe that a provision of that nature would meet the original intention of the Bill <Col N="227" /> and the difficulty which the Dáil found in it.  If the House permits me, I shall withdraw the amendment and reintroduce it by way of a new section or ask the Minister to do so.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 11:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (2), paragraph (g), page 6, lines 33 and 34 to delete the words &ldquo;or the use of furniture&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment deals with a subject which has received a great deal of consideration over a long period of years.  It was dealt with at some length on this Bill in the Dáil.  The question is whether or not the vast majority of furnished flats should have the protection accorded by this Bill&mdash;the protection given to a separate dwelling if it were not furnished. The words with which I am concerned in this amendment provide that, amongst the premises to be excluded from the operation of the Act, are dwellings let at a rent &ldquo;which includes payments for... the use of furniture... unless, on apportionment of the reserved rent by the court, the portion of the reserved rent which... is attributable to the dwelling alone equals or exceeds three-quarters of the reserved rent,&rdquo; or the total rent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us take this case.  Somebody rents a furnished flat at 30/- a week. That flat is not controlled.  If the proportion of the 30/- attributable to furniture exceeds 22/- a week and if the court considers that the flat unfurnished is worth £1 per week, it is not controlled, with the result that the rents can and will soar, almost without limit, in respect of these furnished flats.  A case has been made that so long as a flat is substantially furnished there is no need to do anything about it.  This provision is modelled purely on the <Col N="228" /> British Act, and there is no protection against the landlord who throws in a few chairs and tables so as to take it outside the scope of the Act.</P>
    <P>There is, however, the guarantee that if the flat is not reasonably furnished it will be treated as a dwelling to which the provisions of the Act apply.  I have mentioned the case of flats let at 30/- a week.  They are not elaborate, but nevertheless they are not controlled and they are outside the scope of this Bill if the proportion of rent attributable to them as unfurnished flats is not at least 22/6 a week.</P>
    <P>I would suggest to the Minister that if he is unable to take out these words, he ought, at least, to alter the provisions regarding the proportions of the rent attributable to the furniture and to the flat as unfurnished.  My own view is that it will probably require a special code to deal with furnished flats, if the whole gamut is to be covered, but at any rate we can improve on the existing position by making alterations in the Bill as it now stands.  I would urge strongly that the Minister should concede this point, or else introduce a different relationship in proportion to the rent attributed to the furniture and the proportion attributable to the unfurnished dwelling.</P>

      <P>It does not seem to me that the Senator is very sanguine that his amendment will be accepted. Altogether, as the amendment stands, it is absurd.

      <P>If anything is done it will be the subject of a separate Bill. We have heard it argued that a furnished flat should be controlled.  I think that the present safeguards are good enough.  My Department had no complaints about furnished flats until this matter was raised in the Dáil. After it was raised some complaints came in.  If it becomes necessary the matter will be examined and it will be dealt with under another Bill.  In the British Bill, there is no provision for security of tenure.  In this Bill there is provision for rent and security of tenure and I cannot accept this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister might consider whether, if there is a difficulty of accepting the amendment in its present form, he would not be willing to alter the figure from one quarter attributable to furniture, and to make it one-third.  That is to say in the case of a rent of 30/- a week to bring the flat under control the proportion of the rent attributable to furniture should be less than 10/- a week.  This is not merely a question of flats; business premises, too, are involved.  A number of people have commented freely in recent months on the extortionate rents being demanded for office accommodation in this city.  A case was mentioned by myself of a rent which is paid for an office, for official purposes, in this city.  Up to six or eight months ago, the rent was £180 a year. The occupier vacated the office and his successor sought to become the tenant, but he found that he was asked for £450 a year for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another case brought to my notice recently was that of an auctioneer who advertised certain office accommodation in this city.  One of the persons who made inquiries was prepared to pay a <Col N="230" /> very high rent, up to £300 a year.  He offered that price, but the auctioneer or house-agent told him that the lowest he would take would be £500 a year and that there was no use in arguing about it.</P>
    <P>The applicant looked around to see what he would get, but he could not satisfy himself in location, and he came back again to the agent hoping to beat him down from £500.  When he came back he found that a London firm had taken the offices at £500 a year. The fact that complaints do not come to the Department of Justice may prove one of two things.  It may prove ment of Justice.  It is worth while considering in what light one should accept the statement of the Minister that little or no complaints have been made about certain flats.</P>
    <P>The Minister ought to consider very seriously the position before this Bill goes through.  Of course, if he has made up his mind that the question of flats calls for special legislation, then I am perfectly satisfied that that is probably the best way to deal with it.  I have no hesitation in saying that I am willing to drop this whole proposal in favour of the suggestion that there should be separate legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasForan" hpid="Mr. Foran Mr. Foran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Foran</NameTxt>
      <P>I think this is a very sensible amendment and I hope that the Minister will give it serious consideration. One of the most serious aspects of the housing shortage in the City of Dublin is the exorbitant rents sider that there is not much use in making representations to the Depart-on the one hand that the people con-charged to people who occupy flats.  In addition, all kinds of conditions are imposed upon them.  A condition commonly imposed is that the tenants must have no children.  I think that is a state of affairs that should not be allowed to pass unchallenged.  Other conditions imposed on tenants are that they are not allowed to use certain portions of the house or yard.  People compelled because of the housing shortage to live in these flats are enduring terrible hardships in addition to paying exorbitant rents.  Senator Sir John Keane seems to be on the side of people who let flats and objects to anyone interfering.  It seems certain that <Col N="231" /> he does not have to live in a flat, to pay these rents or to suffer the conditions that are imposed on these tenants. Only on last Tuesday evening, I met two people chasing around looking for flats.  They had been occupying a flat in a fairly large house in the Rathgar area.  The landlord is resident in England but a solicitor forced them out of the house and left them without home or habitation.  I do not know how far this practice extends but I do know it is time that the Government took serious notice of what is going on in the way of rents and conditions imposed on people who have to live in these flats.</P>
      <P>Senator Sir John Keane stated that house-owners would leave their flats idle rather than let them at fixed rents.  He has no idea of the Dublin landlords if he thinks they are going to leave their flats idle.  They are first and foremost business people. Because of the great competition for these flats people are compelled to pay or undertake to pay rents far beyond anything their income would justify.  The Minister has thrown out a hint that it is possible that if on inquiry the Government are satisfied that this matter needs legislation, they would be prepared to bring it in.  I suggest to the Minister that they do not wait until complaints come in, that they go out and look for them. They do that in other matters with good results to the citizens in general. An inquiry should be made by the Government as to the position obtaining amongst residents in these flats and the information will surprise him, I am sure, as to the conditions they have to endure.  I am entirely in favour of the amendment or of any amendment that will bring relief to the long-suffering people who have to live in these flats.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Patrick J. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure there is no member of the House who does not sympathise with people obliged to live in flats in this city or in any other town but there is a philosophical side to the question that seems to be forgotten.  Reading through the report of the tribunal and <Col N="232" /> various other documents leading up to, or advocating measures such as the one before us, we find references to the fact that there is a shortage of housing accommodation and that that shortage is due to certain abnormal circumstances.  The first question then that arises is: are owners of houses in districts where a shortage occurs in any way responsible for that shortage or have they any particular responsibility for creating the problem which has arisen?  Sometimes we hear of cases where an organised body of men descends on a village.  This body is in a difficulty regarding supplies of, say, food or other similar requirements. They find a store where food is available.  With the force behind them they take the food by force.  If they are an organised body of one type, then they will give some guarantee that what they have taken will be replaced at a later stage.  In this case we have a somewhat similar problem.  We have a certain limited population in particular towns.  Then, owing to the extraordinary economic development of the country, whole rural districts are being evacuated and people are flocking into Dublin and other large towns.  Is it any fault of the people already living in these places that these conditions arise and that the housing shortage that is associated with the big national change, has taken place?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot see for one moment why the people whose property has been commandeered so to speak in that situation should be made the victims.  I say it is a national responsibility.  The whole of the argument for the control of flats seems to be based on the fact that the responsibility for shortage rests on those who have accommodation. I think that the philosophy of the question is being lost sight of and that there is no obligation on a limited section of the people to meet these difficulties, while I think every right-minded citizen sympathises with the people who are subjected to such inconvenience. If we could get that &ldquo;hang&rdquo; of the thing, all matters at issue could be settled satisfactorily and justly and there would be none of this bickering about this particular class of house owners such as we have <Col N="233" /> experienced in connection with this Bill and measures of a similar kind.</P>

      <P>I do not know whether I ought to say anything in reference to the statement of Senator O'Reilly except to express my amazement that the doctrine which he has enunciated should be expressed in this House.  If it is true that a person is entitled to avail of scarcity in regard to living accommodation and charge any price he likes for such accommodation, that doctrine must hold in respect to the price of clothing, the price of food, the price of land, rents and everything else, but it is a long cry from the principles enunciated in our own Constitution and it is a far longer cry from the doctrines contained in the Popes' Encyclicals.  I wonder whether Senator O'Reilly has considered that in advocating the survival of the fittest to the extent of squeezing the less fit into the dust, he is opening a way for the promulgation of views and doctrines which will have the effect, not of achieving what he aims at, but of uprooting society altogether? The Minister and those who are responsible for making our laws do not bring in these Bills and regulations merely for fun.  I would suggest further that they do not bring them in in the interests of tenants.  They are brought in in the interests of society, because the Ministers and those advising them know quite well that if restrictions of this kind are not imposed by lawful authority they will be imposed by mob law.  The origin of this legislation is to be found in a situation which arose in Great Britain in 1914, even before the first Rent Restrictions Act, when an Emergency Order had to be made to restrict landlords from raising rents, because the people went out <i>en masse</i> and seized houses and made their own of them without leave or licence from anybody.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is happening now in Great Britain.  It is happening in many of the larger cities and towns of Britain&mdash; people are just going out and seizing vacant houses and flats.  The Minister is aware of this.  He brings in legislation in order to provide the minimum protection for the tenants, so as to evade the risks of mob law.  Senator O'Reilly is less wise in his generation. <Col N="234" /> In order that a few people might set at £5 a week a flat which would normally be worth £2, he is prepared to take the risk of mob law.  I suggest that it is a dangerous doctrine to put forward in this House.</P>

      <P>In sub-section (3), paragraph (b), (i), page 8, line 16, to delete the word &ldquo;twenty&rdquo; and insert in lieu thereof the word &ldquo;thirty-five&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I should like to point out that this amendment proposes that, instead of 20 per cent. being added to the standard rent of premises, 35 per cent. be added.  On the face of it, that seems rather a big jump, but we must remember that rents generally, at the date on which the standard rent is calculated &mdash;that is 1914&mdash;were very low.  I am speaking now of conditions in provincial towns rather than in the City of Dublin, but I should say from my knowledge of provincial towns that a large number of houses were set at rents of about £20.  Many of them, of course, were set at rents much below that.  I have written out a little table here showing what the effects of this amendment would be.  If the standard rent of a private house is £20, and we assume an addition of 20 per cent., or one-fifth, in acordance with the Bill as it stands, that would give us £24.  If the 35 per cent. is taken instead of 25 per cent. that rent would amount to £27 a year; in other words, there would be a difference of £3 in that particular case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, if we take, for convenience, another house at £40 rent per year in 1914 and calculate the rent in accordance with the provisions of the Bill, it would amount to £48, whereas, if calculated in accordance with the amendment, it would amount to £54&mdash;a difference of £6&mdash;and in that case, compared with 1914, the tenant of that house would have a very considerably increased income, even above that of the owner.  If we take another case and <Col N="237" /> assume that the standard of rent in 1914 was £60 a year, according to the Bill the rent would be £72, and according to the amendment it would be £81, or a difference of £9.  Now, the increase there, from the tenant's standpoint, would be, in the cases I have mentioned, £3, £6 and £9 respectively. I am taking a case that I know is a fairly general one, and that is where the owners of these houses are depending solely upon the income derived from them.  They regarded the purchase of these houses as an investment, and a very safe investment, at the time, but if we remember that since 1914 the cost-of-living index figure, which was then taken at 100 points, is now at 295, it means that the cost of living has gone up by almost 200 per cent. and there has been a corresponding decrease in the value of money.  There has been an enormous increase in the cost of living.  It does not seem unreasonable, therefore, to ask for an increased income for the owners of such property, from the 20 per cent., provided in the Bill, to 35 per cent.  That, I think, is a sufficient case to make in favour of this amendment, and I do not think there is anything very much more that can be said about the matter.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer again to the enormous increase in the cost of living &mdash;and to the very low rents that applied in 1914.  Since then there have been great increases in wages and salaries.  Admittedly, the increases in rent are very small compared with the increased cost of living, but the increases, small as they are, would mean a very considerable improvement in the financial position of the owners of these houses. I think it will be admitted that wages and remuneration generally have been enormously increased since 1914.  I will not say that they have increased to the extent to which they should have increased, but that is an extraneous matter.  As the old saying goes: &ldquo;Two wrongs do not make a right,&rdquo; and if salaries, wages, and so on, have not gone up to the same extent as the cost of living, that is not the fault of the owners of these premises. Certainly, these increases have not lowered the costs which these people have had to bear since the 1923 <Col N="238" /> Act, which provided for the 20 per cent. increase which is continued in this Bill.</P>

      <P>I do not propose to accept this amendment.  This addition of 20 per cent. has been here for a long time, and I think it is fair enough.  I do not say that it is an entire justification, but if we were to change it now it would mean an all-round increase in rents on a section of the community that could least afford it.  There has been an attempt to stabilise rents and to stabilise wages and salaries also, and I do not think it would be possible for me to accept an addition to this 20 per cent., which was fixed in connection with the 1923 Act.</P>

      <P>Could the Minister be more explicit in regard to this matter?  How has he justified this wide disparity between the increases in rents and the increases in the incomes of all classes of the community?  The incomes of all classes of the community have gone up by far more than 20 per cent., and I think that there is no apology to be made in the case of landlords who, after all, have taken a great deal of risks, if they seek this protection&mdash; risks which other people do not take&mdash; and why should landlords have to suffer more than other classes of the community? I do not think that it is fair or just.  I am sure that the Minister is a very fair-minded man.  Of course, I know that this is political or Government policy, but I do not see how the Minister can be happy in sponsoring a miserable concession of that kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a point here which has been ignored by previous speakers.  Take the case of a particular kind of house, which, in 1914, was let at £40 a year.  If we follow up what would happen under the Bill in the case of a house of that kind, it would probably enable us to examine the proportions.  Under the Senator's amendment, there would be added to the standard rent a sum of £14.  In other words, a house rented in 1914 at £40 is deemed, under this, to be at a standard rent of £54.  Now, in order to arrive at the basic rent we have to arrive at a standard rent of £54.  On that figure we calculate that one-twelfth for general repairs would <Col N="239" /> arrive at a figure of £4 10s 0d., which would bring the rent up to £58 10s. 0d.; but the landlord is entitled to certain other additions, which are specified in Section 11 of the Bill.  For instance, is it to be assumed that if, during the last 30 years, he expended on his own property a sum of, say, £300, which is not a very big sum to expend on an old house over a period of 30 years, there should not be some allowance? If we assume that portion of that expenditure came under paragraph (e) of Section 11 (2), and the other portion came under paragraph (f) of the same sub-section, we get the result that in respect of his expenditure under paragraph (f) he would be allowed to add £12 a year&mdash;that is, assuming that he spent £150&mdash;and if he spent £150 under paragraph (e), the rent now becomes £100 a year, and in the case of a house which was let in 1914 at £40 a year, under Senator O'Reilly's proposal&mdash; and assuming that this experiment was carried out&mdash;the landlord would be entitled to charge £100 a year.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Reilly talked about all the advantages being intended for all classes of the community with the single exception of landlords.  I remind him, as I remind other Senators, that this legislation is designed to deal with a situation that has arisen in the past few years.  How could Senators consider giving to landlords what is set out in Senator O'Reilly's proposals, while at the same time having in existence a standstill Order which prohibits, with statutory effect, any advantage being given to wage earners in order to increase their incomes?  The people living in the houses to which this amendment refers are, in the great majority of cases, not the plutocrats of which mention has been made here. They are civil servants, school teachers, clerks, shop assistants, people with comparatively low incomes, but the State has taken steps to ensure that they will not benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If Senator O'Reilly had his way the landlords would be able to dip generously into their incomes in respect of rents&mdash;rents of old houses.  These are not new houses.  Many of these houses were 50 years old at the outbreak of the last war, and I suggest that if the <Col N="240" /> owners spent £150 on improvements and £150 on repairs they would be entitled to add £42 yearly to the rents. It is well to keep that factor in mind, because that is the only way in which we can judge with fairness a number of other proposals that will come up for consideration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnOReilly" hpid="Mr. P.J. O'Reilly Mr. P.J. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Duffy is imagining a case where an expenditure of £300 is involved and got away from the case under discussion. I gave an example of a £20 house. The Senator was anticipating a subsequent section dealing with repairs. According to my reading of the Act, a landlord is entitled to an increase of 20 per cent. on the standard rent together with an allowance of one twelfth of the standard rent for repairs. That would be the total income in that particular case.  Are repairs a profit to the landlord?  If so, the Government has no right to provide such a section here.  I am speaking of a £20 house, which I maintain is the average type of house in a country town at this period. If you take that example it represents something less than £2 being allowed for repairs and on top of that you have 20 per cent.  Instead of that Senator Duffy took a case where the standard rent is £40 per year and made out a rent of £100 per year and in doing so brought in many social questions.  I sympathise with him about the social questions, but I doubt if they are relevant to the matter now under discussion.  Two wrongs do not make a right.  I include myself amongst owners of property.  It is not my fault if certain things happen.  Senator Keane dealt with the bones of the question.  There are here what are called pressure groups. A lot depends on the size of these groups, and on the complexion of the legislation that results.  We are here to do justice to all parties irrespective of the size of these groups.  The pressure group which should represent householders is not as vocal as it might be.  It is silent because many people do not like to express themselves in public as they do to me.  I know the feelings of these people, but, for various reasons, they cannot come <Col N="241" /> out into the open to give effect to what they think.</P>
      <P>I believe that Senator Keane was right when he said that the Minister was a just and an honest man.  I am fully convinced of that.  I hope he will not be offended if I say something which has a bearing on this matter, namely, that the question here is one of justice and only justice.  That will be the permanent issue and it cannot be evaded. The abstract principle of justice is what should guide us, and not the size of the vote.  There is a request for justice, and a very meagre instalment of it in this amendment.  I appreciate the Minister's difficulties.  I would like to keep in the Minister's good graces. More than two thousand years ago we heard of the &ldquo;shifting breeze of popular favour.&rdquo;  There is a big body of opinion which believes that these people are being unjustly treated.  They are entitled to fair treatment in this House and, in spite of the Senator or anybody else, I am going to see they get fair treatment.</P>

      <P>Before the adjournment, the suggestion was made by Senator Duffy, in regard to paragraph (e), that there would be quite a substantial addition to the rent in respect of repairs.  I made a rapid calculation in this connection and I hope I have not gone on the wrong lines.  I have taken the rent of a house at £21 per year, which is not an uncommon rent in provincial towns.  If two-thirds of the standard rent were expended on repairs, it would give a sum of £14.  Fifteen per cent. of that would give 42/-, which is not a mighty addition in respect of repairs.  It is not easy to see how the Senator arrived at his figure.  Between now and Report Stage, the Minister might, perhaps, think over this amendment and see if he could allow some reasonable increase. If the Minister would undertake to consider the matter, without committing himself to anything, I should be prepared, with the permission of the House, to withdraw the amendment.</P>

      <P>I am not supporting <Col N="242" /> the amendment, but I should like the Minister to meet a position to which I shall refer.  I pointed out on the last occasion on which the House was sitting that the original intention of these Acts was to prevent extortionate rents and not to prevent reasonable increases of rent where there were circumstances which would have caused an increase if there had been no control.  The present increases in respect of the low-ranking houses were made in an attempt to reach what was a fair, economic compromise in the years 1923 and 1926.  There has been a rise since then, and they represent no longer a fair, economic compromise.  If they are to be supported, they must be supported on the grounds that many people who live in those houses are labourers and people whose earnings have been kept down by means of standstill Orders and similar legislation. I respectfully suggest that the House and the Minister should accept the view that the rents fixed for the 1923 Act houses are not merely rents which prevent extortion, but are, in fact, rents appreciably lower than would be arrived at under market conditions, even if there was a full supply of houses of that type.  Better face that fact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot undertake to consider this matter at all.  This situation has lasted since 1923.  I think the Senator suggested that it was not justice I was considering, but that I was yielding to popular clamour.  Naturally I have to take congnisance of what was happening.  The last Government tried in 1926 to decontrol houses.  They hoped, by knocking off £10 every year, that they would arrive at a stage when there would be plenty of new building and no necessity for further control. They found in 1928 that they had to stop.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They found that, as these houses became decontrolled, and as no great number of new houses was built, exorbitant rents were being demanded for decontrolled houses.  I do not think that you can have a ready-made solution to the problem.  We all desire abstract justice in this world, but I am afraid that abstract justice is not possible. We have to have regard to all <Col N="243" /> the circumstances.  The landlords may feel a grievance, but surely the poorly-paid people whose wages have been stabilised have to be considered, too.</P>
    <P>The attempt at consolidation of these laws has been an object lesson to me. When this matter came before me at first it was the intention to provide for continuance of the Emergency Powers Order, so that when the Emergency Powers Order expired, control would remain.  I said that we had too many Acts on this question of rent restriction and that it would be better to consolidate the whole lot.  Now, I find myself going back to 1923 and there are requests to amend that Act.  This is only a temporary measure.  It may have to be kept on for longer than five years&mdash;that depends on the circumstances.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that if you could do away with control, it might result in an increase in building, but, in the meantime, we would have to put up with these exorbitant demands.  The last Government saw that this restriction had the effect of stopping building.  The alternative to the proposal is to allow any rent which a person would be prepared to pay for a decontrolled house. That is the question before us here.</P>
    <P>Other points of view have been expressed in the other House.  On one side you have demands for increases and in the other for reductions.  Deputy Dockrell accused me of playing one side against the other.  In one way he was right.  I will try to stay in the middle of the road without going to one side or the other.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment concerns business houses.  The Bill proposes an increase from 25 per cent. to 40 per cent.  Instead of the £20 rent, according to the Act, we get £25 which, with the 40 per <Col N="244" /> cent. increase, makes £28, a difference of £3 in a particular house.  If we take £40 as a standard rent, we get £50, and, according to the new rent, it is £66.  In the case of the £60 house we get, according to the Act £75, making £84, or £9 difference with the 40 per cent. increase.</P>
    <P>Whatever case against an increase may be made in the case of the private house no such case could be made in the case of the business house. I know several cases of people running businesses and paying £156 a year for a single room on the ground floor without turning a hair.  I think any business man here will admit at once that the rent, as a part of his expenditure, is a comparatively insignificant portion of the total.  It would be very hard to find anyone in business saying that they could not possibly afford the rent, or that it would make any serious difference to them.</P>
    <P>So far as my observation goes, the money now in circulation is simply enormous, and business people so far as I know, have never been better off in their lives than they have been for several years past.  To say that an unfortunate landlord who is given an increase in the case of a house the rent of which was £60 a year, that he could not afford this increase, I would not believe than man personally. There may be a few cases of people who have not been successful in business. In those cases they could not afford any rent, but surely these rents are merely fleabites, as the saying goes&mdash;they do not enter into the total expenditure to any important extent. As I say again, whatever might be said about the Stabilisation Order affecting wages and remuneration, two wrongs do not make a right.  To my knowledge the practice of the last two years has been the other way around, because earnings have been vastly increased as compared with pre-war years.</P>
    <P>Therefore, the argument does not apply as it might be alleged to apply in the other cases.  There seems to be a special case for the consideration of the Minister, and I would be interested to hear the arguments which the Minister is prepared to advance against this particular amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kingsmill Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a matter on this section to which I would like to call the Minister's attention. He provides for a new basic rent being fixed in two cases, the first being one where a court has made an Order which Order includes the amount of the standard rent, and the second where an arbitration award has been made including the amount of the standard rent.  At first, it was rather puzzling to me why it was necessary to add that in such cases the provision should include the amount of the standard rent. I thought it would do it, but I understand there would be certain difficulties where District Court orders did not make the position clear.  I see reason for putting that in.  There are a very great number of cases, probably something like 70 or 80 per cent. of all the houses, in which the standard rent is perfectly well known, there being in existence at the present moment indisputed and indisputable evidence as to what was the 1914 rent, the matter of calculating the permitted increases being an easy one.  It is not realised how many of these there are because they do not come before the courts, as the evidence is clear and conclusive, available to both-landlord and tenant and usually in the form of written letting in 1914. There is nothing to bring either party before the court because the facts are there and the decision of the court would be perfectly automatic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It did occur to me looking at this section and realising that if for the majority of houses landlords and tenants have satisfied each other as to the evidence and made calculations, that would be disturbing the position of these landlords and tenants who <Col N="246" /> have quite happily between themselves fixed the standard rent and the permitted increases and gone on paying and receiving it.  I still think that it would have been wiser to provide that where satisfactory evidence was in existence of all the facts enabling a standard rent to be fixed easily, it should come in under Section 8.  I do, however, understand the reluctance of the Minister to perpetuate much longer a system which depends for these calculations on the rent in 1914.  I can understand the Minister saying: &ldquo;It would be more satisfactory if we got a new way&rdquo;.  After all, 1914 is a long way back but there is a danger in leaving it out altogether.  The danger is that in cases where the landlord and the tenant have quite happily gone on, knowing that there could be no dispute if it came before the courts because the evidence was there, that either the landlord or the tenant might chance an application to the court feeling that under the next section the court would be bound to make an estimate of the rent and will not only not be forced to have regard to the admitted facts of the 1914 rent, but may not even be at liberty to do so.</P>
    <P>If Senators will look at Section 9, they will see that in any case that has not come under Section 8, the court has to fix the basic rent as a rent &ldquo;of such amount as the court considers reasonable, under any given contract of tenancy, not being for more than a term of five years having regard to the basic rents of other controlled (1923 Act) premises.&rdquo; So if a landlord or a tenant, in a case where all the facts were at hand, were to go to the court, it would appear that the court in fixing the new rent can look at the rent of every other premises except the particular one with which it is dealing.  Therefore, I think that unless either you put in a sub-section in Section 8 providing that where there is undisputed evidence of the 1941 rent, that shall be taken into consideration and that the rent should be fixed on that basis or add to Section 9 sub-section (3) (a) the words &ldquo;the basic rent shall be a rent of such amount as the court considers reasonable ... having regard to the basic rents of other controlled (1923 Act) premises <Col N="247" /> and such evidence as is in existence of the 1914 rent of that particular tenement,&rdquo; you will be creating a new difficulty.  I have not put down an amendment on this matter but I think these are considerations which should be examined before the Report Stage.</P>

      <P>May I say that I should like to join with Senator Kingsmill Moore in asking the Minister to consider the position that the Senator has just put to him?  Despite my animadversions on lawyers, I still think they serve a useful purpose in the community. If there is any doubt, as the result of the coming into law of Section 9, that the 1914 rent which has been the basis as Senator Kingsmill Moore has pointed out of a great number of rents that are being paid and are payable without dispute&mdash;both landlord and tenant know exactly where they are&mdash;and if that situation is now going to be changed so that the whole thing can be thrown into the melting-pot again, and that either the landlord, feeling that he is getting too small a rent or the tenant feeling that he is paying too much, might chance a favourable result by bringing proceedings in the courts, that is a situation we should guard against.  I think it would be deplorable if the existing law should be changed in cases where it has worked satisfactorily.  Where, of course, there is no evidence or where there is very great doubt, or that it is extremely difficult to get evidence as to the 1914 rent, there is everything to be said in favour of the section, but I would ask the Minister to consider the insertion of a clause which will provide that where evidence of the 1914 rent is available, that rent should be taken into account as the basic rent for the purpose of the statutory additions.</P>

      <P>I should like to join with Senator Kingsmill Moore in the case which he has made, because I think it is absolutely undeniable.  I would suggest that it would be wiser to insert the suggested new clause in Section 9 by changing the existing phraseology to read that if the court was satisfied as to the evidence available of the 1914 rent, then it should <Col N="248" /> automatically fix the rent on that basis. Nobody would go to court if he was aware that the court would automatically fix the rent on the 1914 basis where evidence of the 1914 rent was available.</P>

      <P>It seems to me that you must retain Section 8 because you are dealing with a case in which, by some process, the standard rent has been determined and is known.  I think there is no doubt that Section 8 deals with a distinct class of house from Section 9.  However, it might be considered by the Minister whether he would not alter the section to read that where the standard rent is known &mdash;whether determined by the court, by arbitration or otherwise&mdash;Section 8 would apply.  Once there is agreement, or once it can be established what is the standard rent, there is no difficulty.</P>
      <P>There is one other point which I want to bring to the notice of the Minister.  I do not know whether it is vital or not.  This section was altered in the Dáil, and cognisance of the alteration is not taken in the marginal heading, which is misleading.  I do not know if it has any significance in relation to the construction of the section at all.  In any event, there is no reference to arbitration in the marginal heading.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 16:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To add to the section a sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(2)  If the rateable valuation of premises is increased by reason of the execution by the landlord of structural alterations or improvements thereto and the landlord is in possession of the whole of the premises at the date of such alterations or improvements then sub-section (1) of this section shall not apply to such premises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="250" /> This amendment is calculated to try to see if I could prevent a house to which this has happened going off the letting market, so to speak.  As I see the situation at present, with present values and present practice, what will happen is this: the landlord has a house vacant at a particular time and proceeds to make improvements to it.  If, having made those improvements, the valuation is increased from the Chapter I into the Chapter II class, and he is allowed to let on the Chapter II basis, there may be some chance of his keeping the house available for letting.  On the other hand, if he is not permitted to do that, but is controlled on the 1914 basis as against the 1941 basis, then it appears to me quite clear that what he will do in those circumstances is sell that house in the open market with vacant possession.  He will have no difficulty whatever in getting a high price for it, and that house will go out of letting, so to speak.  My anxiety in this and a couple of other amendments which will come subsequently is to ensure that so far as we can, while retaining control on certain lines, the maximum number of houses will remain available for letting.</P>
    <P>To be quite frank, I do not know whether my amendment is phrased very happily, because I can see one objection which would have to be covered by a subsequent paragraph.  I want to be certain that, when a vacant house goes from one part into the other part, it only goes if there is a letting of the whole house as one entity.  Under the 1923 Act there were cases where a whole house became, by reason of its size and valuation, entirely uncontrolled. When the whole house became entirely uncontrolled, then the owner of it proceeded to divide it up, and let the four rooms, as he was entitled to do, at uncontrolled figures.  That did, without any question, create a scandal, and I think it was that particular scandal&mdash; where the type of the letting, in regard to the size of the premises, was changed &mdash;that the Minister was anxious to avoid.  I think that could, by a slightly differently phrased amendment, be covered against in this case, and that it would be possible to ensure, where improvements were made to a house, that <Col N="251" /> that house would then not necessarily go out into the sale market but would be kept in the letting market.  That could be done by something on the lines of what I have here.  I would very strongly commend that to the Minister. We might consider in the meantime whether some more happy phraseology would meet the case.</P>

      <P>As far as I am concerned I would be agreeable that all the amendments be taken together.  I have here figures supplied by an architect who has had considerable experience. The figures are in regard to housing costs per square foot in 1913-14 and 1945-46.  In 1945, the cost of building is given at 18/4, per square foot. Some may object and say that the usual plan is to reckon in cubic feet, but you will get more or less the same result by dividing the figures given by 12.  The point then is that in 1914 we had building costs at 5/6 per square foot, and in 1945 the figure is 18/4. It is interesting to take the cost of a six-roomed building, and compare the cost of that building in 1945 with what would have been the figures in 1914. The cost in 1945, including architect's fees, would be £1,300, and in 1914 a similar building could be put up for £371.</P>
      <P>I will give this table to any member of the House.  It might be of interest because the calculations have been made by a very experienced architect, and I think the figures will stand examination.  I am told that where you have straightforward building&mdash; new building&mdash;the cost is always less than the cost of repairs, and in fact I have been assured that the proportion between straightforward building and repairs can be obtained by simply multiplying the figures given by anything from two to three.  That I think will bring home the fact that the cost of repairs now is very much greater than the cost in 1914.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is one of the justifications for the amendments standing in my name. With regard to amendment No. 18, that alludes to paragraph (c), and in that case the tenant is supposed to be responsible for damage to the premises, and that is one of the reasons for suggesting, in that amendment, that the word &ldquo;eight&rdquo;, should be converted into the word &ldquo;twelve&rdquo;, because anybody who has had experience of house property knows that there are certain classes of tenants who seem to have no sense of responsibility <Col N="253" /> in regard to repairs, damages, and so on.  If it is known, however, that such people will have to pay for the increased cost of the repairs of such damage, it might have some effect, and that is one of the reasons for suggesting that the word &ldquo;eight&rdquo; should be converted into &ldquo;twelve&rdquo; in paragraph (c) and corresponding paragraphs.  There is also amendment No. 20, standing in my name, and I thought we were going to discuss that.</P>

I suggest that we are not discussing that, but that we are discussing the matter of the rate of interest to be charged.  Senator O'Reilly wants to make the rate of interest 12 instead of 8, and why he did not make it 112 I do not know.</P>

      <P>I agree with Senator Duffy.  It is immaterial whether the repairs cost £3, £300 or £3,000; it is a question of the rate of interest, and I think that a return of 8 per cent. to a landlord is a generous return in view of the interest-bearing rate of money at present.  I think that this would be an encouragement to people to do something that is badly needed.  Of course, I quite agree that in complying with this the landlords are getting something into their own pockets.</P>

      <P>I understood that we were taking all these amendments together, but I find that we now have <Col N="254" /> to consider this amendment alone, and therefore the question of building costs would not arise.  As regards the statements made by Senators Hearne and Duffy, the rate proposed is admittedly a penal one.  I do not think that any member of this House would say that it is not desirable to inflict a penalty in the case under consideration or to adopt some method which would tend to prevent wilful damage to houses.  In the normal case, 8 per cent. would, I think, be sufficient, but this case is different.  Paragraph (c) provides that in case the landlord expends any amount on repairs to the premises which are wholly or mainly rendered necessary because of the acts of waste by, or the neglect or default of, the tenant, and so on, a sum equal to 8 per cent. per annum shall be added to the amount.  That is why I am asking for it to be made 12 per cent., instead of 8 per cent.</P>

      <P>Speaking generally, on this question of repairs, I do not think it is fair or just to apply a flat rate.  We all know that the cost of repairs to property in the city is fairly high, but I have some experience of the cost of repairs to houses in the provinces.  I can speak about this myself, personally.  I happen to own a number of small houses in the country, the rent of which would amount to about 4/- or 5/- a week, and the cost of the repairs to these houses is inordinately high.  In fact, I get no income at all from these houses, since all the income goes on repairs.  Of course, I admit that there is a provision which relieves me from income tax in cases of that kind, but my point is that the application of this kind of a flat rate in such cases is inequitable. There should be some method of dealing with it.  Do not ask me how to deal with it, but I suppose it could be done by means of the production of a certificate as to what the repairs would cost.  I do not know where the Minister has got his advice and has come to the conclusion that the provision of this amount is adequate for any particular case.  In fact, I do not think the Minister has made any attempt to approach this matter factually at all. He said that some people said it was too low, and that others said it was too high, and that he kept to the middle of the road.  That might be a good method of securing justice in a rough and ready way, but the question must be determined by facts.  I can assure the Minister that 25 per cent. would be an understatement of the average cost of repairs in connection with comparatively low rents.  Take property in a small country town.  The £12 basic rent would represent quite a decent sort of house in 1914.  I possess property of that character, and the cost of repairs would be at least £3 a year on each house.  All that is now being allowed over 1914 prices is an addition to the rent of a miserable £1 to cover the increased cost of repairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="256" /> I am sure the Minister is tired of hearing figures relative to the increased cost of building, but I feel that I have to give them again.  Take the price of timber in a year which was not the peak year of scarcity. The price in 1939 was 12/6, and the price now 23/-; lead piping increased from 25/- to 40/-; cement from 40/- to 60/-; lime from 20/- to 55/- and so on, all along the line.  We heard about the standstill Order for wages.  There was no standstill Order in operation between 1914 and 1939.  In this class of property the labour percentage for repairs is much higher than for materials.  There is no doubt that if the matter is examined objectively, one-twelfth would be utterly inadequate to do justice, or to recoup landlords for the additional cost of repairs.  It is for that reason I put down the amendment.  What I suggest is certainly not going to secure even a sufficient increase for the owners, as one-twelfth would only add £2 to cover the increased cost of repairs since the 1933 Act was passed.  I think the request is a most reasonable one.</P>

      <P>Senator Sir John Keane suggests one-sixth, and in the next amendment I suggest one-eighth. As a matter of fact some owners of house property suggested that the fraction should be something like one-fourth. A solicitor who has experience of dealing with house property in Dublin asked me if the Minister would consider inserting one-fourth.  Within the past few days I was speaking to a solicitor who has to deal with house property, and he stated that on the average 50 per cent. of the rent goes for repairs.  Anybody who has experience of house property would agree that that was a reasonable proportion. The houses contemplated in this section are necessarily those of an older type.  New houses, like new motor cars, do not involve much repairs for the first few years, but as time goes on it is found that the cost of repairs is higher and higher.  These are comparatively old houses.  Seeing that the cost of repairs has greatly increased, the fraction suggested by Senator Sir John Keane is nearer the mark than what I intended to propose.  If the <Col N="257" /> Minister is prepared to accept Senator Sir John Keane's amendment in preference to mine I will have pleasure in not moving mine.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to put a few points to the Minister, partly on the amendment and partly not on it, but I may save time in the end.  I do not like the wording of the amendment and I do not like rigorous ruling.  On the general question of repairs, I put it to the Minister that it was estimated, with prices ruling in 1923, that a fair increase from the year 1914 in the cost of repairs was 10 per cent. It was on the basis that 10 per cent. represented at the time the increase in the cost of repairs that that figure was brought in.  The Minister in this section has kept to the same figure. I suggest to the Minister that while I am with him without question in controlling profiteering, so far as repairs are concerned it is not a question of profiteering.  The effect of retaining after the recent war the 10 per cent. level means that in fact you are decreasing from 1939 the amount which the owner of house property was getting from the property, because the cost of repairs is very much higher now than pre-war.  I am accepting that for the moment.  I think the Minister will agree that the 10 per cent. figure, when the Principal Act was introduced, did at that time represent a fair increase, but as the cost has gone up very much more since that time, it is not fair or reasonable that he should continue the same figure.  I am also against the possibility of merely making a fixed increase on the rent, which would have the effect of benefiting, not the good landlord who does his job and carries out fair repairs, but giving to the bad landlord, who neglects his job and neglects to keep his premises in repair, a return which could be fairly described as profiteering.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to ensure that, no matter what is done, premises will be kept in the best possible state of repair by the owners and that everything possible will be done in this Bill to induce them to keep their premises in adequate repair. <Col N="258" /> I think that the Minister would be wiser, if I may say so, to retain his percentages, as provided in the section, with an overriding provision that, where the owner of the house was in a position to go to the court and satisfy it that he had, during, at least, a couple of years up to the date of the application, expended more than the prescribed percentage, he would be permitted by the court to recoup himself the extra expenditure.  I do not want it to be possible, in any circumstances, for the owner of a house to get additional payment without doing the necessary work.  However, the law is so inexorable at present that there is no inducement to the owner to keep his premises in proper repair other than that of preventing his property from falling.  We all know that there is a great difference between keeping property in a suitable state of repair and making certain that the property will not fall.  I had intended to table an amendment on the lines indicated in the Majority Report of the Tribunal, which was that the 10 per cent. rule would be kept so as to render unnecessary litigation in the vast majority of cases, with a provision, which I would make operate both ways, that a dissatisfied owner or tenant could go to the court and, if a reasonable amount had not been spent on repairs, the tenant should get relief; while, on the other hand, if the landlord could show that he had expended moneys beyond the figures set down in this Bill, the court could give him relief in addition to the basic amounts set out here.</P>
    <P>I do think that it is necessary to stress the contention with which I started regarding the increase in the cost of repairs.  The Minister realises that as well as anybody else.  Figures that were possible before 1938 are no longer possible.  I have before me interesting figures regarding amounts spent by a firm on repairs.  I find that, before the last war, this firm was spending on repairs about 18.5 per cent. of the rent.</P>
    <P>In 1944&mdash;the last year for which figures were made up&mdash;though the firm was not able to do anything like the same amount of repairs, owing to the shortage of materials, the cost had gone up to 23.8 per cent.  That increase <Col N="259" /> had to be met in some shape or form. I suggest to the Minister that something along the lines I have suggested might be the easiest method of securing that premises would be kept in a proper state of repair and that there would be no evasion of control.</P>

      <P>I dislike this idea of enterprise being brought within the purview of the courts.  But we have got ourselves tied up in knots and we have to recognise that the courts afford the only fair way by which issues of this kind can be settled.  If I may say so, Senator Sweetman is perfectly right.  He advocates a factual approach to the problem.  He wants this matter determined by actual figures of expenditure. That is the only way to determine it.  I am afraid that the Minister and his officials felt that the matter was so complicated and that it would be so difficult to make allowance for different classes of property, that, for administrative convenience, the Minister took one flat rate and said that that would do rough justice.  But it does not afford rough justice.  It may be just in a few cases but it is unjust in the great majority of cases.  Senators have heard the figures quoted by the last speaker.  Twenty-three per cent. of the rent was expended in 1944 on repairs.  That was at a time when very little expenditure was possible.  I feel certain that a vast amount of deferred maintenance is due on this class of property and that 30 per cent. would be nearer the required figure than 23 per cent.  I hope that the Minister will not give a definite reply now, that he will think the matter over and see if the problem cannot be approached in a fairer way than that set down in the section.</P>

      <P>I support the suggestions put forward by Senator Sweetman and by Senator Sir John Keane.  The same view has been expressed by a large number of persons who are acquainted with the difficulties. May I mention the view which has been shaping itself in my mind? Having ascertained the actual cost of repairs, I suggest that there should be some machinery by which the tenant would be enabled to pay that amount, <Col N="260" /> spread over a long period, without bringing it into the landlord's accounts at all.</P>
      <P>That would, probably, result in a greater measure of justice as between landlord and tenant.  Conceivably, the landlord might, in certain circumstances, make a profit on this expenditure on repairs and I do not think that any landlord wishes to do so.  He merely wants to be repaid, approximately, his expenditure.  He never does succeed in getting the total amount but he would like to get as near to it as possible.  If some financial arrangement could be made on the lines I suggest, it might solve the difficulty. It would be a matter for the tenant to pay off the cost of repairs, in one year if he were able to do so, and get rid of it, so that the rent would not need to be altered at all.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hearne</NameTxt>
      <P>I must say that I have been somewhat impressed by the case made for the amendment, but before the Minister considers it and replies, I would like to examine one aspect of it.  There is a very big social problem involved in this, and I know from experience of my own town, Longford, that the type of property let by the landlord at a low rental is a borderline property in the sense that it is very nearly bad enough to be condemned as unfit for human habitation. If encouragement is given to the landlord of such property to get more than he is getting at present in order to continue the existing state of affairs, then, I think, I certainly would oppose any legislation that would tend to lengthen the period before the house would be condemned and levelled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know, myself, that because of the cessation of building in the town of Longford there are slums there equally as bad as the slums I saw this evening in Gloucester Street, or the other day in Bride Street&mdash;a hopeless place altogether.  I am speaking of places in Longford where the rent is 2/6 a week.  If there is any encouragement given to the landlord of that property in my own town to continue to keep his houses in just a habitable condition, just above the border line, then that social problem is one that will call for redress and I am <Col N="261" /> not quite clear as to how this amendment will affect such property.  I should like guidance on that.  I want to make it clear to the Minister that if this amendment will retard the day when that property is condemned and levelled to the ground, I intend to oppose it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely Senator Hearne appreciates, in the present state of building shortages, the reason why property of the type he has mentioned is not condemned is because there is nowhere tenants can go.  It appears to me desirable that everything should be done to make certain, so far as we can, that the condition of that property is kept as good as we can ensure it until the day when we can produce alternative accommodation.</P>

      <P>I should like to say a word in reply to Senator Hearne.  I admit that he has knowledge of conditions in Longford; otherwise he would not speak as he has spoken.  But, we shall always have this borderline problem and if we had not it the housing situation would be greatly aggravated. There are many properties&mdash; not ideal properties, I agree&mdash;where the landlord does his best but if we had not these properties we should have a much more serious problem to face.  It will be years before housing schemes can provide space for those persons who would be displaced from condemned properties.  Even if these properties are not ideal, the local authorities are there to ensure that they are reasonable. Senator Hearne mentioned rents of 2/6 a week.  When these tenants are displaced and secure council houses, they will find they will have to pay a rent up to 5/- or 6/- a week.  Those properties serve a need and the local authorities are there to see that sanitation and the sewers conform to a reasonable standard.  We know the standard may not be up-to-date, and that the houses may not have the latest ideas in cubic space.  But, after all, people have lived in them for generations without losing their health.  They have lived under those conditions for years and I am sure they are perfectly satisfied and perfectly healthy.</P>

    <P>(e)  In the case of premises to which Section 8 of this Act applies where the landlord in the year 1922 expended an amount exceeding one-third of the standard rent or during the period of the two years 1923 and 1924 or the years 1924-25 or the years 1925-26 or the years 1926-27 or the years 1927-28 shall <Col N="263" /> have expended an amount exceeding two-thirds of the standard rent on putting the dwelling-house into a reasonable state of repair, a sum not exceeding 15 per cent. of such excess or excesses of expenditure.</P>
    <P>This is a very small point.  The Minister himself wants this Bill to be a consolidating measure, but as it was drafted it is not quite a consolidating measure.  My amendment seeks to repair that omission and I have therefore proposed the re-enactment of the section in terms somewhat different from that in the Acts of 1923, 1927 and 1928.

    </Speaker>
    <P>This sub-section provides that in the <Col N="264" /> case of certain premises, after August 4th, 1914, we are calculating the rate of interest to be allowed for money expended at any time after that date for improvements or structural alterations to the premises.</P>
    <P>In the original British Act, the rate of interest allowed on that expenditure was 6 per cent. and we are going one better.  We are allowing 8 per cent., not upon the expenditure incurred during the emergency, not upon the expenditure incurred since 1923, but at any time after the 4th August, 1914.  I think the Minister seems to ignore the fact that most of this expenditure was incurred before World War I or the early days of that period.</P>

      <P>It does not seem to me just that the rate of interest should be 8 per cent., in these cases particularly. You will remember that when we were dealing with paragraph (b) I intimated that I did not intend to move an amendment which I had submitted, in deference to the arguments used here in relation to present difficulties, present costs of improvement and so forth.  I was quite prepared to say that if a landlord executes substantial structural alterations or improvements to his house in the interests of a tenant after the Act becomes law, there is a case to treat him generously.  I do not say that he is entitled to 8 per cent.; I do not think he is, but to make a demonstration that we were willing to allow a good return on expenditure incurred in a period like this in keeping houses in good condition I did not persist in my opposition.  These arguments do not apply at all so far as the expenditure covered by this paragraph is concerned.  I would urge on the Minister very strongly that this particular proposal requires review and that the proposal I have made to reduce the rate of interest to 4 per cent. is reasonable in this case.</P>

I am not going to accept this any more than the others because by doing so I should be taking from people something already <Col N="265" /> given to them by the 1923 Act.  What justification would there be for that? The demand has been practically all the other way.

      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>What difference does it really make?  I agree that in 1914 alterations would probably cost less but that does not affect the rate per cent.  This is a fair percentage for outlay of a kind which is of a distinctly speculative character.  Very heavy expenses are incurred in repairs to property and 8 per cent. is really not considered an adequate return for private enterprise in building.  Generally a person who has put money into property looks for a gross return of 10 per cent. knowing that there will be very heavy expenditure on repairs and that in ordinary times the house may probably be vacant for some time.</P>

If Senator Duffy's amendment is accepted, people who are enjoying this income for the past 20 years will now be deprived of it to the extent of 50 per cent.  I think there are two aspects of this problem.  In the first place, it is entirely irrelevant to discuss whether 8 per cent. is too large or too small. What will guide me in the vote now being asked for is not whether 8 per cent. is too large or too little, but whether people who have been in enjoyment of something for the last 20 years without dispute are now going to be deprived of it.  I think that it would be unjust to deprive them of it.</P>

That is the argument put to the House now.  He is not going to vote for the amendment simply because this injustice has been in operation for 20 years.  One has heard of injustices taking place over a longer period of years in this country but all of us thought that it was the duty of the Oireachtas to see if it was not possible to remedy such wrongs. I cannot understand the attitude of mind of Senators opposite and of some Senators on this side who think that an allowance of 8 per cent. is justified when they themselves have justified an allowance of only 6 per cent. in their standstill Order.  I cannot see for the life of me why the special class of people who own houses should be protected in the way that the Party opposite propose to protect them.  Why should it continue?  Let the vote determine it.</P>

      <P>There is one matter which has been overlooked in this discussion.  Certainly as long as I remember, 8 per cent. was considered as the lowest percentage which one could expect by way of return on money invested in bricks and mortar. I am not dealing now with the Housing Acts; I am dealing with the matter from the point of view of accountancy. If you were taking advice as to whether <Col N="267" /> you should put money in bricks and mortar, more especially by erecting houses, you would be told that taking into consideration wear and tear, the difficulties of the situation, and the fact that you might not have tenants sometimes, if you got anything less than 8 per cent. you would be likely to meet with a loss and that if you wanted to get a fair return you should look for a percentage up to 15 per cent.  This has been taken as the recognised figure on which a person should base his calculations if he expects money which he has put into building to show him the equivalent of 3½ per cent. in ordinary funds.</P>

      <P>On the point that only 6 per cent. was allowed in Britain while 8 per cent. was allowed here, I should like to refer Senators to Section 8 of the 1923 Act. Clause (a), sub-section (1), says: &ldquo;an amount calculated at a rate per annum not exceeding 6, or, in the case of such expenditure incurred after the second day of July, nineteen hundred and twenty, 8 per cent&rdquo;.  It was 6 per cent. up to that date, and after that 8 per cent. What I am doing in this Bill is continuing the 8 per cent.  The 6 per cent. operated only for a couple of years.  I have not got a copy of the British Act here, but I should say it possibly follows the same lines as this.  Which follows which I do not know, but I should think they are somewhat on the same lines.  Anyway, people have done the repairs on the understanding that they were to get the 8 per cent.</P>

      <P>Very well.  I will not argue it.  The point I want to make is this: after the last war&mdash;after 1920&mdash; the Minister will be aware that interest rates increased enormously. At the end of the war, in 1918, 5 per cent. was the normal rate of interest on Government loans.  By 1921 or 1922 the bank rate had gone to 7 per <Col N="268" /> cent.  It was in the shadow of that financial situation that the Act of 1923 was prepared.  Obviously, if we are to have regard at all to economic reactions, it was the realistic thing to say that money expended in 1922 on carrying out improvements which involved, as Senator Kingsmill Moore has said, expenditure on bricks and mortar, should be rewarded at a higher rate than when the bank rate was at 5 per cent.  But what is the position now?  The bank rate in Ireland is 3 per cent. and the bank rate in Britain is 2 per cent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it?  In any event, Government borrowing is done to-day in this country at less than half the rate at which the British Government could have borrowed in 1922.  Surely this 8 per cent., to which the Minister has referred and to which Senator Sir John Keane has referred, must be related to something?  Eight per cent. is no more sacrosanct than 2½ per cent. or 5 per cent.  There was a reason for arriving at the figure of 8 per cent., and I suggest that when 8 per cent. was considered a proper rate of interest on expenditure incurred in respect of building it related to the current earnings of invested money. The current earning to-day in this State is 3 per cent., and a very large sum of money&mdash;probably £30,000,000 or £40,000,000 or £50,000,000 of our money&mdash;is earning less than 1 per cent. in London.  Surely we cannot concede that 8 per cent. must now be accepted in this Bill simply because it was written into a Bill drafted 23 years ago?  I would urge this House to accept the amendment, and to establish the fact that we are not prepared to go on indefinitely regarding 8 per cent. as reasonable remuneration on invested money.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 25:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (3), line 23, to delete all words after the word &ldquo;be&rdquo; and to substitute the following words: &ldquo;an amount equal to the sum of the following:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i) the net rent at which the premises were held at the relevant date, and</P>

      <P>(b) in the case of any other premises, 15 per cent. of the net rent.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>It is important for the House to understand that when we passed Section 13 we came to a completely different class of premises from what we had been dealing with up to this. Up to this we have been dealing with small and very small houses, occupied perhaps in the majority of cases by people of the labouring class or the very small shopkeeper and tradesman class.  We have now come to deal with premises which include all premises except the very largest in the most choice situations in Dublin.  Premises over £60 valuation are practically confined to Merrion Square, Fitzwilliam Square, Fitzwilliam Place, some of the larger houses in Clyde and Elgin Roads, some of the houses in Ailesbury Road and the houses in Shrewsbury Road. I do not say that that is an absolutely exhaustive list, but looking through <i>Thom's</i> you will not find many houses over £60 valuation outside those general areas.  Looking through <i>Thom's</i> also I find that the houses which you are now proposing to control are occupied by judges of the Supreme Court and of the High Court&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="TheodoreMoore" hpid="Mr. Kingsmill Moore Mr. Kingsmill Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kingsmill Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;by Senators, by a number of Ministers of State, by some of the most eminent doctors and surgeons in Ireland, by <Col N="270" /> senior counsel who are certainly not amongst those making the smallest incomes in their profession, and by prosperous businessmen, such as Senator Brennan.  He is no longer a Senator, but we all knew him.  Now, the point I want to make is that you are dealing now, not with a poor class of tenant, but with a class of tenant which includes the wealthiest people in the State.  Now, what classes of landlord are you dealing with?  Admittedly, the question of ground rents enters in here, but we are not dealing with that.  Where it comes to profit rents, you will find that the landlords are very often poorer than the tenants.  In the course of my law experience I have had to deal with a good many cases of this kind, and I hardly remember a case where the landlord was better off than the tenant. For instance, if you walk through the streets and squares in Dublin, you will notice that every few yards there is some little difference in the shape of the houses&mdash;some little difference in the design of the hall door or the fanlight, or something like that.  The reason for that is that the sites were granted in blocks of three or four to speculative builders who put up a group of houses and then sold them to different people, who took them as an investment. They were then left to families, going down from father to son.  Such experience as I have had in going through titles is that, generally speaking, the landlord is a less wealthy person than the tenant of these houses of £50 or £60 valuation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I made those introductory remarks because different considerations must apply in dealing with houses of that sort from those which apply in the case of smaller houses.  I think we are all agreed that it is wise to prevent extortionate rents, but my suggestion is that in the case of these new houses which are being brought in, from £40 to £60 valuation, you should endeavour as far as possible not to favour the landlord at the expense of the tenant or to favour the tenant at the expense of the landlord.  Now, both the tenant and the landlord each had to face the increase in the cost of living that is coming to us all, but as I have shown, <Col N="271" /> in most cases the tenants are better able to afford that increase in the cost of living than the landlord, because the tenant in most cases has been able to get a rise in his fees or profits, and so on, whereas, in the case of the landlord, in very many cases, the rent he derives from the house is his only means of livelihood.  So that, although you admit that the cost of living has gone up in the case of both the tenant and the landlord, if you permit this increase, you are in fact increasing the cost at the expense of the poor landlord.</P>
    <P>He has to face the cost of repairs, and the cost of the repairs has gone up tremendously, and you are giving him no increase in respect of these increased costs.  You are giving one type of landlord an increase in rent and also in the matter of repairs, but in the case of the poor landlord, as I say&mdash;the owner of the big type of house&mdash;you are giving him no increase. Now, that is unfair and unjust.  I think it would be correct to say that costs of such repairs have gone up by more than 40 per cent., since 1940.  I think that that would be a fair estimate.  One of the items that a tenant has to meet is the rent, but as against that the landlord has to meet all the increased costs of living out of the rent he gets from the tenant, which, in very many cases, is his only source of income.  All I am asking here is that the burden should be equally distributed between the landlord and the tenant, and that the relatively rich tenant should pay to the relatively poor landlord an increase of 10 per cent., in order to help that landlord to live, because, while not overlooking the fact that some of the assertions I have made are not applicable in all cases, I would say that they are applicable to the houses of £50 or £60 and I cannot see why this concession should not be given in these cases.  By all means, let us have control of these houses with a view to stopping exorbitant rents, but why not give the landlord what was given to him in 1923&mdash;10 per cent. under the 1923 Act, which was increased to 20 per cent. under the 1926 Act?  Why adopt the principle of putting on control and then manipulating it in such a way as, <Col N="272" /> not only to prevent the landlord from doing what would be unfair but also preventing the tenant from paying what would be a fair rent?  As I have said before, my only object here has been to stop exorbitant rents.  That has been my object in every case, but while I think it is desirable to exercise control in this matter, I do not think there is any reason to adopt what has been unconsciously underlying a great deal of the discussion in connection with this Bill: the unexpressed assumption that every landlord, with difficulty, conceals his horns and hoofs, and that it is only the modesty of the tenant which conceals the fact that he is equipped with wings and a halo.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say at the beginning that I am in entire agreement with the Minister's point of view, that in 1941, so far as control for the non-1923 Act houses was concerned, houses were let at the market competitive rate.  I do not think that that can be gainsaid. The Minister referred to that on several occasions previously, and I think that he was quite correct, but since then several things have happened, and the first of these is what Senator Kingsmill Moore is dealing with here in his amendment, and that is, the value of the money in terms of goods derived from that competitive rent has fallen very considerably.  That is one circumstance which, without question, has reduced the real income of the owner of the house in terms of money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second thing is that, where the owner was responsible for repairs, he has had since 1941 to expend a very great deal more in terms of money to do the same amount of repairs. Frankly, I can appreciate the Minister's point of view, that he might not feel able to meet both these points.  I think one of them should be met and, candidly, I am afraid I am of opinion that it would be better to meet the repairs one rather than the decrease in the value of money.  I want to make certain in every way that premises are kept in good and adequate repair, more than the tenantable repairs referred to in Section 22.  While the Minister may not be able to accept the amendment <Col N="273" /> in its present form, I urge him, between this and the Report Stage, to make an estimate of the increased cost of repairs between May 7th, 1941, and the present time.  Having made that estimate, I ask him to consider introducing a provision, by virtue of which, while the owner of a house has to bear the decrease in the value of money, he has not to bear also the increase in the cost of repairs, and that he would be met, by being able to pass on the increased cost of repairs.  That would appear to me to be a just provision, and one which would make for better conditions for tenants living in these houses.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir John Keane Sir John Keane">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been at trouble to find out the reason why the Minister meted out such a disparity of treatment between these two categories. The only argument I can see is that he can say that these houses were not controlled in 1941, and that they had already taken advantage of the increase and had put up rents accordingly.  Is there any evidence in support of that?  There was no justification for increasing rents prior to 1941 when costs were seriously on the upgrade.  Repairs had not then become the heavy burden they are now.  Demand is now being made for the same treatment in principle in respect of that increase, and that it should be allowed to the non-1923 houses as well as to the others, so far as circumstances go.  Surely Senator Kingsmill Moore has convinced the House of the equities of justice in the majority of these cases, and that the tenants are well able to pay the increased 10 per cent. to cover both repairs and cost of living.  In many of these cases the landlords are not exactly poor people, but they are dependent almost entirely on the rents they get from these houses.  They are hard hit by their inability to increase rents to compensate themselves for repairs and the increased cost of living.  Senator Kingsmill Moore says he knows some of these people to be starving. Perhaps Senators have not fully considered these aspects of the question. I feel that this would be only just as well as feasible, and that there should be no difficulty on the political side in <Col N="274" /> asking comparatively wealthy tenants to pay this slight contribution to meet the undoubted needs of small landlords who are now hard hit.</P>

      <P>I notice that Section 11 (2) and Section 17 (3) contain references to lawful additions to the basic rent.  I notice that Section 17 (2) does not contain a provision for repairs similar to that provided for in Section 11 (2) (d) (i) (ii).  I think there must have been a mistake there.  I would be inclined to agree with Senator Sir John Keane's figures, as if 10 per cent. was put in for lawful additions, that would agree with the corresponding sub-section in Section 11. There is complete justification for an increase of 10 per cent.</P>

      <P>There was no mistake of that kind made in framing the Bill.  As most Senators know, these are houses controlled under the Emergency Powers Order.  The whole question of repairs and as to whether we would allow the same percentage as in the 1923 Act was carefully considered.  I think I stated on Second Reading that I was satisfied that an allowance was made for repairs in the rents charged for these houses. The landlords had before them the example of what happened to their predecessors in 1914.  The experience of those who had houses for renting then was before them.  It is common knowledge that house rent included all those likely contingencies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Kingsmill Moore referred to houses at £60 valuation. I admit that that is rather on the high side, but there are a great many houses between £30 and £40 valuation which became decontrolled under Acts passed some years ago.  They are not occupied by wealthy people.  Every other house, no matter what the valuation, built after 1919 was decontrolled until brought under the Emergency Powers Order.  Senators are aware that the houses are occupied by people who are not wealthy.  I want to correct the impression that the 1941 rents applied only to that class.  All classes of the community living in decontrolled houses are <Col N="275" /> included.  I am satisfied that the rent charged was an economic rent and that all things a landlord was likely to have to meet were taken into consideration. We know that the rents of houses were very high compared to what they were before the last war.  I draw the attention of Senators to the fact that this is a temporary measure.  If it be amended before its expiration, it will be along the lines of decontrolling the houses of higher valuation.  The question of repairs may then arise.  That will depend on circumstances.  We examined the matter very carefully and I am satisfied that the case made for an increased allowance for repairs in respect of the 1926 Act could not be made in respect of those houses.  Therefore, I cannot accept the amendment.</P>
