      <P>Is oth liom go mór é bheith le cur in iúl agam don Tigh go bhfuair an Seanadóir Pádraic O Máille bás Dé Sathairn seo ghabh tharainn.</P>
      <P>Fear é thug grá dílis dá thír, duine de na scoláirí Gaeilge ab fhearr a bhí againn, duine de scoth na huaisle imithe ar shlí na fírinne.  Gheobhfar sna cuntais scríofa ar a ghníomhartha sa troid chun saoirse do bhaint amach dar dtír fianaise dheimhnitheach ar an bpáirt a ghlac sé sna gluaiseachta náisiúnta.  Is ar éigin is gá thar tagairt a dhéanamh d'fheabhas Phádhraic Uí Mháille mar scoláire Gaeilge agus, ar aon chuma, tá daoine sa Tigh is fearr atá inniúil ar na cáilíochta san do mheas agus a gcothrom molta do thabhairt dóibh.  Is leor a rá gurbh aoibhinn, fiú leo san a bhí taobh  beagán eolais ar an nGaeilge, bheith ag éisteacht leis ag labhairt i nGaeilge ar chúrsaí a bhíodh faoi dhíospóireacht sa tSeanad.</P>
      <P>Bhí sé d'onóir ag an Seanadóir O Máille bheith ina Leas-Cheann Comhairle ar an Dáil agus ina Leas-Chathaoirleach ar an Seanad agus is maith agus is ionnraic mar a rinne se a ghnó sa dá phost san.  Ba fear é a raibh tuairimí daingne aige agus a chuir in iúl go teann iad le linn díos póireachta, ach, ar a shon san, níor chuir sé aon mhúisiam riamh ar éinne. Ní raibh sé ina nádúir múisiam a chur ar dhuine.  Fear lách, groídhiúil, tiorthúil do bea é.  Ba chara le gach aon duine againn é.  Tá sé ráite ina thaobh ná raibh ann námhaid a dhéanamh d'aon duine agus sílim gurb é sin atá le rá againn go léir, is cuma cad é an taobh den Tigh ar a rabhmar i gcaitheamh na haimsire a chaith sé anso linn. Is brón linn a bhás agus níl duine riamh againn ná hairíonn uaidh é.</P>

      <P>A Chathaoirligh, nuair a bhíos ag sochraid Phádraig Uí Mháille Dé Domhna so caite againn, chonnac cuid mhaith de shean-dream na Gaeilge bailithe timpeall an choirp. Daoine dob ea iad san a thug grá agus taithneamh don Ghaeilg agus dár bhain léi le linn a n-óige féin.  Bhí meanma mhuintir na hEireann san uair úd tar éis dul i laige agus i ndearóile ar fad geall leis.  Bhí an Seanadóir Ó Máille ar an ngasra beag úd a chuir crann agus tús ar obair na Gaeilge fadó agus nár tháinig laige ná laghdú ar a shuim inti go dtí lá a bháis. D'oibrigh sé mar mhúinteoir is mar <Col N="3" /> thimire Gaeilge.  Is beag duine anois a thuigeann an cruatan is an t-anro a bhí ag baint leis an saothar san.  Nuair a cuireadh na h-Óglaigh ar bun chlaoigh sé leo is níor staon riamh roimh chath ná contúirt dá dhéine.</P>
      <P>Bhí aithne agam ar Phádraig Ó Máille nuair a bhí sé i mbláth a mhaitheasa is a nirt.  Fear breá cumasach a raibh guth árd solas-ghlan aige is an teanga Ghaeilge ba bhreátha ba cheolmhaire is ba líofa a chloisfeá in aon áit, fiú amháin i gConamara féin. Má bhí corp mór aige bhí mar a dúraís féin, a Chathaoirligh, croí mór lách istigh ann.  Tá cumha orainn a leithéidí a bheith ag imeacht uainn.  Ba mhaith linn comhbhrón a déanamh thar ár gceann go léir lena mhnaoi is lena chlainn is lena mhuintir.  Guidhmíd solas na bhFlathas is radharc na Trionóide dá anam.</P>

Ba mhór an fear é ar chuile bealach.  &ldquo;Pádhraic Mór&rdquo; a bheireadh gach duine air, agus ba fear mór é. Bhí croí mór aige.  D'fhéadfaí a rá gur chuid de stair na tíre a shaol.  Is iontach an méid a rinne sé ar son na Gaeilge agus ar son na tíre.  Bhí aithne agamsa air le dachad bliain anuas agus ón gcéad lá go dtí lá a bháis bhí sé ag obair ar son na tíre. Bhí sé cáirdiúil le gach Seanadóir, agus níor chuala mé focal aithiseach ar bith uaidh ariamh i n-aghaidh aon tSeanadóra sa seomra seo.

      <P>Perhaps, Sir, I might be permitted to add my tribute to those already paid to the memory of Pádraic Ó Máille.  He was one of the most loyal friends one could have.  In many activities, I knew him for a long period, outside this House altogether, and I always regarded him as a man of very high principles, devoted to the things in which he believed, and not afraid to make sacrifices where sacrifices were called for in defence <Col N="4" /> of his beliefs.  One of the things that can be said of him is that he was, above everything else, a great Irishman&mdash;not perhaps a great Party man; I would rather think that intellectually he belonged to a period in which none was for Party and all were for the State.  Those were the principles upon which those who knew him expected him to act, and those were the principles upon which he acted in his public life.  His death is a great loss to the Irish people, but it is particularly a great loss to his family.  I am sure that, when we pay tribute to him here to-day, we have in mind that he has left behind him a family and a large number of close friends who will miss him greatly.  It will be some consolation to them to know that in their great bereavement they have the deep sympathy of everybody who speaks with any authority in this country.</P>

      <P>Óna óige amach, chaith Pádhraic Ó Máille a shaol, a dhúthracht, agus a mhaoin i seirbhís agus ar mhaithe le hEirinn.  I rith a shaoil thug se deá-shompla, ins gach bealach, d'Eireannaigh.  An uair ba ghá é, bhí sé réidh ullamh a anam fhéin a thabhairt ar son a thíre.</P>
      <P>Ar ndóigh, an áit a rugadh agus a tóigeadh é, ní fhéadfadh sé gan brí agus spioraid na saoirse a fhoghlaim agus a thuigsint ann.

    <Title>Housing (Amendment) Bill, 1945&mdash;Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>This Bill, as the House will understand, is a continuing Bill, relating to building grants payable to private persons or public utility societies for the building of houses in rural areas.  Ordinarily, this Bill, which deals with building grants payable to private persons or public utility societies, would be concerned merely to prolong the operation of certain provisions of the Principal Act, that is, the Housing (Financial and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, <Col N="6" /> 1932, but on this occasion it includes also an important provision which is designed to assist the campaign now in progress to combat the scourge of tuberculosis.  I shall deal later with that provision of the Bill, which is contained principally in Section 3, but perhaps I should first deal with what might be called the more normal provisions of a measure of this kind.  In Clause 2 it is proposed to extend, for another two years, from 1st April last, the time for the completion of new houses in rural areas and the reconstruction of existing houses owned by small farmers and agricultural labourers, under the system of grants established by Section 5 of the Principal Act.  Normally, I may say that this section&mdash;Clause 2 of the definition Section&mdash;is all that would appear in a Bill of this description, but the House may wish to have some figures relating to the activities which have been carried on under the provisions of the Principal Act which it is now proposed to extend by Section 2.  The total number of new houses built by private persons and societies of the kind to which I have referred in rural areas since the passing of the Housing Act, 1932, is about 23,200, and, of these, 5,196 have been built since 1st April, 1940.  The number reconstructed since the 1932 Act came into operation is 30,696, of which 6,341 were reconstructed since 1st April, 1940.  Of the total number of 23,202 new houses completed for private persons or public utility societies, in rural areas, no less than 3,540 were for agricultural labourers and 9,791 for farmers with a valuation under £15; 2,186 for farmers with a valuation from £15 to £25, and 7,685 houses for other persons&mdash;residing, of course, in rural areas.  Of the 30,696 reconstructed houses, 27,963 were reconstructed by farmers with a valuation not exceeding £25, and 2,733 houses were reconstructed by agricultural labourers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These particulars, as I have indicated to the House, relate to the provisions of the Act of 1932 which it is proposed to continue as a temporary measure for another two years.  At the end of that period&mdash;indeed, long before that, I hope&mdash;I shall be putting before the Oireachtas a new Bill to deal with <Col N="7" /> the housing problem generally, not alone in the light of financial conditions but of economic conditions as they may be expected to stabilise themselves in the post-war years.  The experience which has been derived from the operation of the existing Housing Acts has shown that it is necessary to introduce a new measure in order to remove certain disabilities and to ensure that decisions can be taken with regard to this matter of housing, and, accordingly, we must press forward.  This Bill, as I have already said, is merely a continuing Bill&mdash;a Bill in connection with which I cannot, I think, at this stage, go into the whole question of housing.</P>
    <P>I come now to Section 3&mdash;what might be regarded as a novel section in the Bill&mdash;which deals with people undergoing treatment for pulmonary tuberculosis, in cases where the accommodation in the home is inadequate for the proper segregation of the patient from other members of the family.  The section provides that on the certification of the appropriate medical officer of health the local authority may, and, if required by the Minister, shall, make to the owner or occupiers of the house a grant towards the cost of the provision of an additional room in or attached to the house.  A grant of the full cost may be made by the local authority, and two-thirds of the grant or £100, whichever is the less, will be recouped to the local authority by the Minister for Finance.  Where the Minister&mdash;in this case, the Minister for Local Government and Public Health &mdash;is of opinion that the provision of a hut or chalet within the curtilage of a house would serve the same purpose, Section 4 enables the provisions of Section 3 to be applied accordingly.</P>
    <P>Section 3 of the Bill, therefore, as members of the House will understand, may be regarded as a further step in the campaign against tuberculosis.  The Tuberculosis (Establishment of Sanatoria) Act, which was passed last year, provided for additional sanatorium accommodation for patients who require institutional treatment, but only for those cases.  Further provision is required to deal with the cases of <Col N="8" /> persons who, although suffering from the disease, do not require active treatment in sanatoria.  One cannot say with certainty how many persons in this country are suffering from tuberculosis. It is known that 22,879 persons received treatment under the various local authority schemes in 1944. No doubt, there are many others who are being treated by private practitioners, and also there is a large number of people who, unfortunately, unknown to themselves, are suffering from the disease.</P>
    <P>Tuberculosis, as I need not tell the House, is an infectious disease, and, therefore, the first measure to be taken to combat it is to limit the spread of infection.  This is a matter of primary importance.  The incidence of tuberculosis infection and disease is, therefore, higher amongst persons who come into daily or, perhaps, hourly contact with infected patients in their own homes.  We have to recognise that fact, if the disease is to be prevented from increasing.  We have all known or heard of cases of families in which two, three, or four members had died from tuberculosis, and it is that kind of thing which has given rise to the delusion&mdash;I think I may call it so&mdash; that tuberculosis is &ldquo;in the family&rdquo;, as the saying goes; but I think it can be stated definitely now that tuberculosis is not hereditary and, therefore, is not &ldquo;in the family&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The reason why several members of the same family may die from tuberculosis is that, in their own homes, they have been constantly exposed to infection and cross infection, from one another.  Section 3 of this Bill aims at reducing this exposure to infection. When discussing this particular provision of the Bill, I hope Senators will keep in mind the fact that it is not necessary that every person who has contracted tuberculosis should be treated in an institution.  Very many sufferers do not require active sanatorium treatment.  What they need is food, rest and fresh air.  But if we are to counteract the influence of persons who already suffer from the disease as a source of infection it is essential that the conditions of the home in which these persons live shall be such as will permit of segregated <Col N="9" /> accommodation.  If this accommodation can be provided domiciliary treatment&mdash;that is by visits and treatment in the patient's home by the tuberculosis medical officer&mdash;will meet the case and the persons concerned will make satisfactory progress without any sanatorium treatment, at least in the vast majority of cases.  During the last year over 8,000 persons suffering from tuberculosis received institutional treatment. It is probable that a considerable number of these did not, in fact, require such treatment but because their home conditions did not permit of segregated accommodation being provided for them it was deemed prudent to have them admitted into sanatoria in order to protect the other members of the family.  If segregation can be secured, say, for 1,000 such persons as is anticipated in this Bill, it must follow that the pressure on the bed accommodation in existing tuberculosis institutions will be greatly relieved.</P>
    <P>When addressing the House on the Tuberculosis (Establishment of Sanatoria) Act, 1945, the Parliamentary Secretary, Dr. Ward, informed the House that we had instituted an inquiry to determine the extent of overcrowding amongst persons who were known to be suffering from this disease.  The results of that investigation have been analysed and we believe that about 1,000 persons will benefit by this new provision.  In these 1,000 cases we shall be attacking infection at the source, but more than that, not only will better provision be made, but there will be a considerable number of other individuals who, by the operation of this measure, will be protected against infection.  The grants under this Bill will be made in the first instance by the local authority concerned, but towards the amount of the grants the Minister for Finance, as I have indicated in paragraph (g) of sub-section (1) of Section 3, will make a generous contribution.  A grant will be given only in the case of a house where the conditions admit of an extension of the living accommodation and where the county medical officer of health or the superintendent medical officer of health, as the case may be, <Col N="10" /> certifies (1) that a member of the household is suffering from pulmonary tuberculosis, and (2) is undergoing treatment, and (3) that the existing accommodation is inadequate for his proper segregation from the other members of the family.  I should like to emphasise that persons in respect of whom applications for assistance under Section 3 of this Bill are made must be actually undergoing treatment and, of course, must be persons who cannot provide this proper accommodation out of their own resources.</P>
    <P>Section 4 permits the Minister to sanction a grant for a hut, chalet or similar building in lieu of a room provided for by Section 3, where he is of opinion that such alternative is necessary. The Exchequer contribution will be forthcoming in these cases even where it is thought better that the hut or chalet detached from the dwelling-house should be provided.  The Bill also provides in sub-section (4) of Section 3 that for a period of seven years the valuation of the building consisting of and including the house shall not be increased by reason of the addition of the extra room or chalet.  I am sure I do not need to say anything more to recommend Section 3 to the House. We believe that it will prove to be a very important ally in fighting tuberculosis. I should like to emphasise this, that it does not by any means represent all that is being done or that is in preparation in that connection. Next week it is hoped to circulate a White Paper giving a much more comprehensive view of the measures we are taking to deal with the disease.  I can assure the House that the Government's plans for tackling this white scourge are of the most progressive kind.  When Senators have had an opportunity to study them as outlined in the White Paper they may think it a more suitable occasion to debate the whole question at length.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be inappropriate to suggest that this Bill should receive anything but the unanimous support of the House.  As to its general terms, I think continuing conditions have been operating here for a number of years.  I want, however, to comment on Section 3, not in a very <Col N="11" /> critical manner, but to lay emphasis on the fact that this aspect of Ministerial policy, which seeks to impose an additional burden on local rates, is one which is not finding favour with ratepayers generally.  There can be no quarrel with the policy of the Government, or with the policy of the community, in the battle against tuberculosis. We must be altogether at one on that, as the State, in the name of the community, is obliged to do its utmost to eradicate this dreadful disease, but there are other methods by which that could be achieved which, I think, would do more than the thin end of the wedge the Minister has inserted in the Bill. I am not going to contest the wisdom of the insertion of that section now. Perhaps it must be given a trial.  But I confess that, even on the Minister's own statement, I am not too optimistic that it is going to achieve its end.  I accept the Minister's view, and also that of the Parliamentary Secretary, that tuberculosis is not hereditary, but if it is not passed on from parents to children, it is passed on from one generation to another in houses that are, probably, the greatest source of infection.  I am not quite clear what exactly the Minister means to do regarding the operation of Section 3. Does the Minister suggest that he is going to have a patient, who has contracted tuberculosis, possibly within the walls of that home, treated in an additional building that is to be erected?  I wonder what we are going to achieve by that.  That is an aspect of the operations of Section 3 which I should like to have taken into account. I do not desire now to go into a lengthy consideration of this problem.  We did that with the Minister's Parliamentary Secretary and, as the Minister said, we shall have an opportunity of doing so again.  Speaking with some experience, my view is that, while this disease is not passed on from parents to children, it is passed on from one generation to another and the living organism is present in many of the homes of the country.  I do not think that we shall achieve very much by the section which the Minister has inserted to enable what I may describe as home treatment <Col N="12" /> to be provided for persons suffering from this disease.  There are circumstances in which this might be a suitable remedy.  I should like, however, that county medical officers of health, when giving advice about patients being treated in out-buildings of their own homes, take into account the history of the families concerned.  I know quite a number of homes in which the disease has been passed on from one generation to another and I do not think that we shall get rid of it in those homes by the erection of an additional building, while the old building still stands.</P>
      <P>I dissent from the proposal that the cost of this treatment should be, to any extent, a charge on the ratepayers. The battle against tuberculosis is a national struggle in which the whole community is involved.  I do not think that the Minister should impose the burden which he proposes to impose by this Bill on the ratepayers.  On a number of occasions, the Minister has been very generous to people in the local areas at the expense of the ratepayers and, in this Bill, he is taking power to impose further burdens upon them.  These burdens are mounting up to an almost unbearable extent and this proposal is one which will not be received with satisfaction even by the Minister's strongest supporters.  I assent to the view that the House must accept this measure.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TheodoreMoore" hpid="Mr. Kingsmill Moore Mr. Kingsmill Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kingsmill Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>It is rather difficult to know whether to approach this Bill from the point of view of housing or from the point of view of public health.  This measure is called a Housing Bill but, obviously, the portion of it which deals with housing is almost automatic in its operation and no discussion is necessary in regard to it.  But that portion of it which, although contained in a Housing Bill, deals really with the problem of public health&mdash;Sections 3 and 4&mdash;does raise certain questions which it would be worth while for this House to consider in some detail and with some seriousness. Everybody here is in sympathy with the object of those sections&mdash;and nobody more than I am myself.  It may, however, be questioned whether the sections to which I have referred <Col N="13" /> are not conceived rather too narrowly and, from the point of view of their operation, somewhat erroneously.</P>
      <P>The object of those sections is, apparently, to have provided a permanent room, attached to the house in which the patient is resident, or, in certain circumstances, a chalet.  The ownership of the room or chalet will be in the person who owned the original house. This provision is intended, as expressed, merely to provide for the proper segregation of the sufferer from tuberculosis.  If it is intended merely for the purpose of segregation, then it is easy to see that segregation in this way will be almost impossible.  It will be easy to excuse delay&mdash;perhaps, necessary delay&mdash;in sending a person to an institution.  It will be easy to lose sight of the fact that the proper method of preventing the spread of infection is really by training in the use of the sputum flask and the handkerchief. Emphasis is here laid on the provision of a permanent room or hut which will be available to the sufferer.  That may be, eventually, unnecessary either because the person who has been suffering from tuberculosis gets well, as a result of the provision of this hut or otherwise, or because he dies.  Then, you have a room attached to the cottage, which is of advantage to the cottage, but which, from the point of view of public health, has ceased to justify its original function.  I suggest that the emphasis should be laid not on the making of grants to provide rooms for sufferers, but on giving the widest possible powers to local authorities to provide free of charge to sufferers something in the nature of chalets or garden shelters which can be rapidly put up and rapidly taken down, which can be put at the disposal of the sufferer within a few hours, or at latest within a few days, of the time when his disease is diagnosed, and which, when they have done their work or have, unfortunately, failed to do their work, can be taken away, disinfected and used for the treatment of other sufferers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>May I explain a little bit more clearly what I mean?  The scheme envisaged in the Bill is that a room <Col N="14" /> should be added to an existing house or that a chalet should be built in the garden attached to an existing house. It is set out that this is to be done for the proper segregation of the sufferer from the other members of the household. Anybody who knows anything about rural, or even urban, conditions knows perfectly well that it will be almost impossible to prevent children from going in and out of that room and that this method will not be effective either for the preservation of the children's health or for securing rest and fresh air for the actual sufferer.  What is needed in a case like that is training for the sufferer in the use of the sputum flask and the handkerchief, because, if those are used properly, approximately 95 per cent. of the danger of infection disappears. I am aware that, in addition to infection from sputum, there is a danger of droplet infection, but we are not dealing with nasal pharyngeal infection, and sputum, in the case of this disease, is, probably, the primary method of conveying the infection.  If there is a certain amount of droplet infection, a proper use of the handkerchief, in the event of coughing or sneezing, will deal with it.  In the case of the ordinary man, to ensure that he makes proper use of the flask or handkerchief, it is, probably, necessary he should have a short period of training in an institution.  Persons of naturally cleanly habits may be instructed by word of mouth but, in the case of persons who may not; naturally, be of disciplined or cleanly habits, a certain amount of training in an institution is necessary.</P>
    <P>I am rather afraid that, if we pass this measure in the form in which it is, we may be masking the measures which are necessary.  We may be inducing a person to adopt a room when he knows that institutional treatment is desirable and we may not be preventing infection by providing the extra room.  It is possible that these rooms will become nurseries of infection, because they will become impregnated, unless the occupant is well trained, with the germs of tuberculosis and children going in and out will be likely to pick them up.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="15" /> The scheme which I urge on the Minister&mdash;and which I urge in a cooperative manner and which I think might be added on to this measure&mdash; is power for every local authority to provide something in the nature of a garden hut or shelter for a man as soon as his disease has been diagnosed. Again I do not wish it to be conceived as a substitute for treatment in an institution.  I concede that its greatest use will be as auxiliary to treatment in an institution.  It is inevitably the case that, whether a sufferer is poor or rich, after his disease has been diagnosed, a period of greater or lesser duration must elapse before he can get into an institution, before a bed is ready for him, and it is most important that during that period certain elementary precautions for his own health should be taken.</P>
    <P>Under the scheme I recommend, it would be possible to have an open-air shelter to allow of an open-air life provided within 24 hours.  He then goes to an institution where he is trained in the manner of living, in the regular exercise, in rest hours and in the hygienic precautions necessary for a cure of the disease, and after being there for a short time&mdash;six months, nine months, or perhaps a year&mdash;he will, we hope, be given what is technically known as a clean bill; that is to say, his sputum is no longer positive, and, on examination of his lungs, no crepitation or sounds are found which indicate that the disease is then active.  It is, in fact, quiescent&mdash;it is not cured.  It is necessary for that man, for a period of six months or a year at least, to continue living in conditions as near as possible to those provided for him in the sanatorium, and here again comes into use the temporary shelter which can be provided by the local authority. He goes out of the sanatorium and he has this shelter at his disposal, and, in the course of the next six months or a year, his lung hardens and he is enabled to take up his regular life.  The shelter or chalet is then available for use for the next sufferer after having been disinfected.</P>
    <P>This is no chimerical scheme.  I myself know of one such shelter which, in 1912, was instrumental in completing <Col N="16" /> the cure of a person suffering from tuberculosis.  It cost £15 and it remained, after having served its function, in the place in which it had been put up.  In 1941, when another person in the neighbourhood had the beginnings of the disease, it was bought for the large sum of £2 and set up in another place.  A child was put into it and was also cured.  That is an example of one shelter used after an interval of over 30 years.  When its use for the first patient was at an end after a year, it remained there for 29 years. If it had been at the disposal of a local authority, it might have been carrying out its curative work during all those 29 years.</P>
    <P>It is some scheme of that nature&mdash;I am not attempting to go into details; I am merely envisaging it largely&mdash; which I think would be of more advantage, as well as being infinitely cheaper, than the scheme set out in the Bill.  It may be that to a certain degree local authorities already have power to provide these buildings&mdash;I am informed that one local authority, whether it has the power or not, has taken it on itself to adopt a scheme something like this&mdash;but I suggest&mdash; and, if necessary, I shall bring in an amendment to that effect&mdash;that local authorities be enabled, as an alternative to providing a permanent room or permanent chalet which is to pass into the ownership of the sufferer, to make themselves the proprietors of a considerable number of these small portable shelters, which they can give without any charge to sufferers for as long as they are needed and which they can take away for the use of other people when their use in a particular case is at an end.  If that authority exists it could, I think, be amplified, and, if I may use the phrase, put more into prominence in this Bill.  I fear that the money expended in the manner proposed will not be as well expended as it would be if expended in the manner I suggest, and I urge that serious consideration should be given to the relative merits of the scheme and the necessity for the particular provisions before the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>The general intent of this Bill is approved by everybody and the <Col N="17" /> only comment I should like to make is in respect of the provision in Section 3.  I have the feeling that, if a local authority adds a room to a house, that room will become merely one of the common rooms of the household and not a room for isolating a person afflicted in a particular way.  I assume, of course, that local authorities will provide the additional rooms only in the case of small houses.  I know it is intended that their activities will be restricted to the needs of people who cannot afford to provide the accommodation for themselves. These people, in the main, live in two-roomed or three-roomed houses, and the additional room will, in my opinion, become one of the ordinary rooms of the household.</P>
      <P>The Minister is probably aware that, in places like Peamount and also in Papworth in Britain and in other sanatoria, you find a large number of these chalets, wooden constructions, away from the main building.  People who are able to walk around and probably to work a certain number of hours in the day live, or, at least, sleep in these chalets, and I imagine that the best approach is that of providing some simple structure detached from the house which will be used as a sleeping room for a person affected. I do not imagine we contemplate a living room because, if a person is confined permanently to his bed, very likely he will be removed to an institution. Therefore, the person we have in mind, I take it, is the person who, during the day, goes around doing whatever work he is allowed to do&mdash; perhaps doing very much more than he is able to do.  What we are trying to do is to provide sleeping accommodation which will isolate him from other members of his family, and particularly children, and I therefore agree with the view expressed by Senator Kingsmill Moore that the best approach is the provision of a chalet, a hut, which is reasonably comfortable and has accommodation sufficient for sleeping purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the things one remarks about Peamount or Papworth is the fact that there is no front door to these huts.  There is a half door, and, in the <Col N="18" /> middle of winter, you find the place wide open.  I was very much struck when I first saw the chalets in Papworth, where the buildings are on a rather high elevation, to find, in the month of February, that they had no front doors.  I was told by the doctors, however, that that was a desirable feature, that one of the things needed above all was plenty of pure, fresh air.</P>
    <P>The one reservation I have about this scheme is that we are authorising the expenditure of approximately £150,000 to deal with a problem which is not merely a problem of infection. People contract tuberculosis without having had contact with affected persons, and the reason why they are prone to contract it is due to the fact that they are insufficiently nourished.  Often they have not got sufficient protective clothing.  I would suggest to the Minister that he has a special function in this matter, apart altogether from his colleagues in the Government.  He is the Minister for Public Health, and if he is to deal with this problem of public health then he has to face the fact that inside the Government he must be stern in getting endorsement for a policy that will enable every man and woman in this country to be properly nourished, properly fed and properly clothed. We get, therefore, to the position where we have to consider the mass of the people who are afflicted by a disease of this kind through the effects of poverty.  None of us here, I think, will cavil at the expenditure of this sum of £150,000 if, as the Minister has suggested, it is going to save the lives of a large number of people by isolation.  We all gladly subscribe to the view which he has expressed.  I merely want to draw his attention, in passing, to what I believe to be the kernel of the whole problem, which is not just that of taking the person who is stricken down with tuberculosis, but rather dealing with his social conditions so that he will escape the scourges of the disease.  In the long run, I believe that would prove to be the cheaper policy of the two.  Having said that, I want to say that I welcome the Bill as a small instalment <Col N="19" /> towards the social progress which we must have if we are to fight tuberculosis at all.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHonan" hpid="Mr. Honan Mr. Honan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>On every side of the House we join with the Minister and those concerned in the promotion of this good work of attacking the great scourge of tuberculosis.  It has often struck me that in this matter we, more or less, start mid-way in the campaign instead of acting on the policy that prevention is better than cure.  The efforts towards prevention could, I think, be started with great advantage in the primary schools of the country, and be continued in the secondary schools.  In the primary schools, some time might be allotted each day to enable the teachers to give lectures to the pupils.  This instruction might be supplemented by other methods.  The pupils might be warned of the dangers of expectoration in the schools, in their homes or elsewhere.  I think that would be a good start to make in the campaign against the terrible scourge of tuberculosis.  It has been suggested that chalets should be provided for those affected by this disease.  I am afraid that would not meet with the entire approval of affected persons or of their families.  Those of us who live in the country are well aware that people have a great dread of it becoming known that such a disease exists in their families.  Notwithstanding the points that have been made by previous speakers, I am afraid that the idea of providing huts or chalets would not meet with approval.  An addition to the house for the accommodation of an affected member of a family would, I think, meet more with their approval. The reason why I say that is that the erection of a chalet some distance from the house would indicate to the whole country that some person affected with tuberculosis resided there, whereas an addition to the house itself would not. I would suggest, however, that there should be a separate entrance to whatever addition is built to a house.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another suggestion I would like to make, and it is that the house in which an affected person has been reared should be fumigated, and that, if necessary, the plastering on the <Col N="20" /> walls should be removed.  The walls might be replastered and every care taken to see that all danger of infection was removed.  Those of us who come from the country are well aware that people do not like to admit that any member of their family died from tuberculosis.  Although some member may have died from the disease, the family will give a hundred reasons other than the real one, as being the cause of death.  Therefore, I am more strongly in favour of an addition being made to a house with, as I have said, a separate entrance to it, than of the erection of chalets which, as I have said, would indicate to the whole country that some one in that house was suffering from tuberculosis. I do not think the erection of these chalets would meet with approval in the country at all.  I imagine that those members of the House who are familiar with conditions in the country will agree with me on that.  I hope that the Minister will be able to find the happy medium.  I have the feeling that the views I have expressed, as to the manner in which persons affected with this disease should be treated, will meet with general approval in the country.</P>

    <P>Ba mhaith linn an tuarascáil a thug an tAire dúinn ar thoradh Achta na dTighthe ó 1932 i leith.  Ní fhéadfaimis gan bheith brodúil as Acht ar tógadh 23,200 tithe nua agus gur hatógadh 30,696 cinn eile ó tugadh an tAcht isteach i 1932.  Is scéal mór é sin, go háirithe nuair a chuimhníos duine gur faoin tuaith a tógadh iad sin uilig.  Níl mé ag iarraidh a rá go bhfuil an scéal sásúil go hiomlán.

    <P>Rinneadh tagairt d'ailt a 3 agus a 4. Is maith leis an Seanad go hiomlán na hailt seo bheith ann cé go bhfuil sé soiléir go mha mhaith le cuid de na Seanadóirí mion-athraithe a dhéanamh orthu.  I mo thaobh féin de, léiríonn na hailt seo dom go bhfuil fogha eile á thabhairt faoi ghalra na hEitinne, atá chomh fada sin ina chrádh mór ar an tír, a cheansú.  An socrú seo atá á dhéanamh le cuidiú le daoine na seomraí breise agus na chalets a chur suas, tá sé le moladh go mór.

Caithfear breis aire a thabhairt do scéal an bhainne ar fud na tíre.  Tá súil agam go mbeidh toradh sásúil ar imeachta an Choiste atá ag scrúdú cúrsaí bainne i mBaile Átha Cliath faoi láthair.  Ach tá súil agam freisin nach do Bhaile Átha Cliath amháin a déanfar beart de thoradh an Choiste seo.  Níl baile mór ar fud na tíre nach gá cúrsaí réire agus glaine an bhainne a scrúdú ann.</P>

Ach, thairis sin, is dóigh liom gur ceann de na cúiseanna is mó atá ann go bhfuil an eitinn chomh coitianta imeasc daoine óga, go dtagann an oiread sin díobh fliuch ar scoil, agus gan deis feiliúnach ann le iad a thiormú agus gan an deis acu ar dheoch te fháil go tráthúil.

Is maith liom go bhfuil an rogha ann, cé go bhfuil a lán le rá ar shon na tuairime a nochtaigh an Seanadóir Ó Hónáin i bhfábhar an tseomra.  Ní mór cuimhneamh nach é gach teach a fheileann sé seomra breise a chur leis.  Caithfear aoirde na talún, deis na gréine, fascadh, dréineáil, agus rudaí eile a chur san áireamh.  Má scrúdaítear an cheist go cúramach, sílim go n-aontófar gur réiteach sásúil é an rogha a bheith ann go mbeidh comhairle an dochtúra chontae le fáil ag na daoine ar an gceist.</P>
    <P>Ní shílim go bhfuil aon bhrí sa tuairim go mbeadh na seomraí féin dainséarach toisc go mbeadh bítheoga an ghalra sna ballaí.

      <NameTxt>Professor Fearon</NameTxt>
      <P>Like the previous speakers, I recognise and welcome most heartily the humanity and consideration that have gone into the construction of this Bill.  But, just in connection with Section 3, there is a point which I would be grateful for the opportunity of emphasising or submitting and that is: why restrict this concession of the additional room to cases of pulmonary tuberculosis?  It seems to me that for two reasons that should not be done.  One is that there are many other illnesses that can be just as incapacitating, just as grievous, and just as likely to benefit by the provision of an additional apartment as pulmonary tuberculosis.  Secondly, there is the practical one, that directly we mention pulmonary tuberculosis in this Assembly we seem to resolve ourselves into a committee to discuss the entire history of the disease and all its manifestations.  The point I would respectfully submit to the Minister is that under Section 3, if a member of a household is suffering from some condition for which he is undergoing treatment and if the existing accommodation is inadequate, we should let him have this additional room and leave out the tuberculosis part of it altogether.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another reason why that is advisable is because there is this question of the stigma attaching to a building that has an additional room built on to it for the purpose of the treatment of tuberculosis. This may seem fanciful, but it was raised in connection with the chalet system.  I have the impression that a house which has one of these accessory rooms will be marked for the rest of the life of that house.  Just as during the great plague days, when a cross was painted over the door, the people know that the plague had been <Col N="24" /> in the house, and just as at the present time certain houses are pointed out as cancer houses, certain houses will be pointed out as tuberculosis houses when one of these accessory rooms has been constructed.  That is a practical danger which I think we might get over by allowing the additional accommodation to be constructed for other conditions as well as tuberculosis. Then, if a certain house had a part of it extended for the benefit of some resident, it would not necessarily be for the treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis at all.  It might be for a chronic heart or many other conditions of that sort which have not got that unfortunate superstition attached to them that tubercular conditions have in the eyes of many people.  Possibly that might be better presented when the Bill comes before us in Committee; but I submit it to the Minister as a possible way out of what I believe is a real difficulty.  With regard to the question of chalet treatment, I think there is a great deal to be said for that where the right type of chalet can be got.  Apart from that, I welcome this very interesting scheme&mdash;I will not call it experiment, because I think it is more likely to succeed than a great many of our scientific experiments.  I think it indicates a very substantial contribution to the battle against our national enemy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanODonovan" hpid="Mr. Seán O'Donovan Mr. Seán O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Seán O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that but for the insertion of Sections 3 and 4 this Bill would have been passed by the Seanad long before now so far as the Second Reading is concerned.  So many Senators have contributed to the debate and so many opinions have been expressed that I have made up my mind to express a few opinions also, some of them contradictory of what has been expressed so far.  In that respect, I should especially like to refer to Senator Fearon's remarks with regard to the addition of a room to a house marking it out as a plague spot.  I think that is a very unfortunate thing to mention amongst, we will say, a learned body of representatives of the community like we are here.  It is a pity that, instead of emphasising such a possibility or mentioning the superstition attaching to it, <Col N="25" /> we should not devote ourselves to giving the opposite point of view and insisting that it is by a greater knowledge amongst the general public of the means of infection that we will get a proper approach to the final eradication or near eradication of the scourge of tuberculosis.</P>
      <P>We should remember that the cause of tuberculosis is the tubercle bacillus. If we can keep that away from us, we will not get tuberculosis.  We will not get it from a neglected cold or any of these other things that we hear referred to.  You must get the specific infection into your body in order to get tuberculosis. The medical profession tell us that it is not handed down, and we have to believe that.  But it is handed round, as the Red Cross Society point out in their propaganda.  Therefore, when a member of a family is infected with the tubercle bacillus, there is a danger of his propagating it amongst other members of the family.</P>
      <P>The object of this Bill is to try to provide a system of isolation of the infected individual from his neighbours so that he will not hand round the infection.  The disease cannot be contracted by others if it is not handed round.  I think it would be far better to try to emphasise these things rather than to say&mdash;I am sure the Senator really did not mean it&mdash;that because there is an additional room put on to a house it will be marked out as a place to be avoided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To my mind, the two greatest scourges we have in this country are tuberculosis and cancer.  Unfortunately, we cannot do anything to prevent the living death which people have to suffer when they are affected with cancer; but we can do a lot to prevent people suffering from the living death of tuberculosis.  I assume that this is more or less of an emergency measure to deal with a transitional period until we have a satisfactory system of hospitalisation for infected patients.  Possibly the greatest benefit will be derived from the facilities for rehabilitation afterwards. A patient who has been cured or in whose case the infection has been arrested will not be a danger to others. When that patient goes home he can use that additional room for isolation <Col N="26" /> purposes and thus remove the danger of the flaring up again of the infection.</P>
    <P>Some speakers seem to have forgotten the fact, when speaking of Section 3, that there is Section 4 in the Bill also. Section 4 provides for an isolation hut or chalet.  Senator Kingsmill Moore suggested that it should be owned by the local authority and transferred afterwards.  I would be delighted if that could be provided for, and I think it could.  Again, it is necessary to emphasise that, once it is disinfected there is no danger, as otherwise people would not allow a hut to come to their house or garden if it had been used by somebody else, even though it was for the same disease. The tubercle bacilli can be destroyed by disinfection or by the lapse of time.  Any tubercle bacillus will not live long outside the body where it cannot reproduce itself.  It will not live more than six months.  Therefore, if the building has been shut for six months, it naturally disinfects itself.</P>
    <P>I fancy that, if this were simply a Housing Bill, without these Sections 3 and 4, we would have had much less discussion on it.  It will require a lot of care and supervision to see that the added room or hut is suitably isolated and is not frequented by other members of the family.  Unless there is a proper sense of responsibility and a proper sense of the danger of infection, the hut or chalet in the garden can be just a handy playground for children.  I presume such a building would be used almost entirely as a sleeping compartment, so that the patient may be isolated from other members of the household and avoid sleeping in the same room or the same bed with children or adults not infected with the disease.  Everyone will agree that, where others sleep in the same room, whether in the same bed or not, as a person with pulmonary tuberculosis, there is always the danger of infection from the sputum.  Care must be taken that that danger is avoided and also that the hut or chalet be not used by other members of the family.  They must understand the danger and realise that the infection will be passed round if everyone, <Col N="27" /> including the patient, is not careful. The sputum holders or handkerchiefs are good in their own way, but the patient affected must be kept as isolated as possible from the other members of the family, so that the danger of passing the tubercle bacillus will be greatly reduced.</P>
    <P>I have been struck by the possibility of extending the provisions of this Bill to other forms of tuberculosis than pulmonary tuberculosis.  The section only applies to people who are suffering from pulmonary tuberculosis, to those in danger of coughing up sputum; but there are other forms of infection from the tubercle bacillus, in which the bacilli can be transmitted to other members of the family.  It is rather unfortunate that this is confined to cases of pulmonary tuberculosis. Of course, that is the greater danger and concerns the greater number of people, as it is also the more serious.  I suppose that, if we went any further, the expense would be far greater.  I view the insertion of these Sections 3 and 4 as being more or less of a transitory or emergency measure, to tide us over the period during which we have not sufficient sanatoria hospital treatment available for the affected members of the community.</P>
    <P>I must disagree with what Senator Baxter said.  His point was that the central authority should defray all the expense in connection with this or any other scheme which tends to raise the local rates.  Senator Baxter and others would be very perturbed if the central authority were to usurp all the powers of the local authorities.  These are powers which must be exercised by the local authority and, if they handed them over, they would be handing over to this octopus, the Department of Local Government, the sole control of the lives of the people.  That is the very reverse of what they will argue in other cases.  It would mean they were in favour of centralising all authority, legislative and executive. That would not be good for the people.  Our present system provides for the execution of these schemes through the local authorities and, <Col N="28" /> naturally, they must defray part of the expense.  We cannot have them carried out by the local authority, but have the central authority pay the piper. We cannot have it both ways.  Therefore, in the case of expenditure which is subsidised by the central authority, the local authority must bear its share, to the extent to which it is satisfied to help in carrying out this legislation, which, generally, we are glad to see being introduced.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>When I saw this Section 3 first, I was very dissatisfied with it, as it seemed to introduce a very new principle, a principle that is objectionable from many standpoints.  I would deal now with one standpoint, that is, that such a building must necessarily be of a temporary character. As Senator Moore pointed out, the disease either takes away the person infected or the person is cured. Then this special building automatically becomes a white elephant. People generally have very strong objections to it being known that a member of the family has been suffering from this disease.  It is taken to be a reflection on the family generally and the existence of a permanent building there will mark for all time the fact that one member of the family has been suffering from this disease. Senator O'Donovan suggested that that should not be the attitude but, unfortunately, it is the attitude and that is the general experience.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome Section 4 very heartily, as being the proper method of dealing with this particular trouble.  I would suggest that Section 4 really should have been included in the Public Health Bill, which is to come before us shortly.  In County Tipperary, we have Section 4 already in operation, inasmuch as we have erected four of these temporary huts, on the suggestion of the county medical officer. There is a very fine design, which is available to anybody.  This temporary hut can be erected at a reasonable cost. If the cost of timber and other materials had not shot up to the present level, I think the structure could be made at a total cost of £25 or £30.  The last one we had made came <Col N="29" /> to about £40 in all.  The structure is essentially a temporary one and can be moved as soon as it is no longer required and taken to other places, after disinfection.  As Senator O'Donovan has said, these buildings can be used over and over again.</P>
    <P>I do not like Section 3 but I heartily welcome Section 4 and consider it the proper method of dealing with this matter.  The question might be asked as to where we got the money to construct these huts.  The answer is that, up to a stage, it was contributed on a voluntary basis by local people and, at a later stage, when money became available in considerable quantities to the Irish Red Cross Society, the society was good enough to contribute a sum of approximately £200 towards the construction of these shelters.  That covered not merely the cost of the shelters but a lot of expenses which the tuberculosis committee had incurred. I wonder whether this type of work could not be done on some organised voluntary basis.  Personally, I detest this subsidising out of public funds for private people.  There will be no initiative left after a short time and we will become a nation of beggars.  We should try to secure co-operation.  It should be preached from the hilltops that co-operation is the only way to make this nation one that can hold its head up before the rest of the world.</P>
    <P>Senator Honan referred to the schools and what they might do.  I fully agree with what he suggests.  If there was more propaganda done through the schools generally, a lot of the danger from this infection would be removed.  I suggest that the Minister might approach the Department of Education in order to see that as much co-operation as possible will be given, on the largest possible scale.  If this propaganda were carried out on an organised basis, a lot of the danger associated with this disease would pass away.  That is another reason why we should not attach a permanent building to ordinary houses.</P>
    <P>Senator Duffy struck the nail on the head, as it were.  Knowing the gambling instincts in our Irish nature, he suggested that the additional room might be used, not for the purpose for which <Col N="30" /> it would be constructed, but for some other purpose.  Very likely it might be used as a kind of store room at some future time, and quite conceivably it might be used as a dance room because, as we all know, there is at the moment a craze for dancing.  Eventually the primary use of the building might be lost sight of and there would be a structure that would not actually be required for the purpose for which it was erected and it would be simply a testimonial to the fact that this disease existed in that particular spot at some time.</P>
    <P>There are technical instruction classes held in rural districts and, if the Department of Education were anxious to do it, I am sure they would be able to devise a plan under which they would supply the materials necessary for the construction of huts.  In other words, they might be prepared to advance money towards the construction of these huts on the understanding that it will be refunded.  It is important that the work should be done in that way, because it will bring home in a very definite manner to those engaged in making the structures the object they are intended to achieve.  It would, in my opinion, be the best type of propaganda to show people the great need there is for the prevention of infection.</P>
    <P>I am a member of the Tuberculosis Care Committee in Tipperary and I take a great interest in the work that is done there to help to check the spread of the disease.  I have been in close touch with the county medical officer of health for many years.  I may say that a relative of mine died from tuberculosis and, when one is personally acquainted with the dangers of the disease, one is inclined to take a much keener interest in whatever efforts may be made to check it.</P>
    <P>I do not like the idea of permanent buildings.  I do not like it from the standpoint I have mentioned.  Senator Fearon raised the point that the additional room should not be limited to cases of pulmonary tuberculosis. That raises a very general question and, if allowed, it might involve the erection and subsidising of thousands of buildings.  It often struck <Col N="31" /> me that every house should have one room set apart for the calamities of life, whether an infectious or any other type of disease, but that is raising a big question relating to the design of houses and, of course, affecting their cost.</P>
    <P>I would like to repeat that since we in Tipperary are working this scheme on a voluntary basis we can, if Section 4 is approved, go ahead and see that these huts are provided in larger numbers than heretofore.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quirke</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to support the Bill.  I believe it fills a long-felt need and it will be accepted in the country as a definite attempt to cope with tuberculosis.</P>
      <P>Listening to the various speakers, I felt it reflects much credit on the House that so many Senators have made what I might call an intensive study of tuberculosis.  It was quite evident, listening to Senators, that they have gone into this matter very intensively. One or two, in particular, seem to have made a study of it and their remarks were really extraordinary, coming as they did from what we may regard as laymen.  Of course, Senator O'Donovan has an advantage over most of us, in view of his veterinary studies and experience.  The speech he delivered threw a good deal of light on this important subject.</P>
      <P>I was sorry to hear Senator Kingsmill Moore&mdash;who made an excellent speech and who convinced most people that he knew nearly as much as most doctors about this disease&mdash;suggesting that it might be possible, in certain cases, that people would avail of the provisions in the Bill to get an extra room that they might not be entitled to get.  I think that is a reflection on the medical profession in this country.</P>

Senator Kingsmill Moore seems very much surprised, but I think I am quite correct in saying that most people here interpreted his speech in the way I have indicated.</P>

      <P>Like Senator Fearon, I was surprised to find the debate developing into the type of debate which might be expected from a board of doctors, or from other people with high technical qualifications.  Like most Senators, I have my own opinion as to whether the extra room or a chalet would be the best thing for the treatment of this disease.  I am prepared to say that matters of that kind should be left to people who are fully qualified to consider the desirability of providing extra accommodation for people suffering from tuberculosis.  At the same time, it was interesting to hear the various arguments put up by Senators.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it was Senator Honan who suggested that an extra room to a house would be more desirable than a chalet, and he suggested that a door be constructed so as to cut off access to the sick room.  You could argue that matter for a considerable time.  In my opinion that again would be a matter for the doctor.  It is quite understandable that if a person was in an advanced stage of tuberculosis he or she would be in contact with some other member of the household, or some nurse or other person who might be engaged to look after the patient, and if the door were on the outside and the weather were bad it would make things difficult.  Senator O'Donovan suggested that if proper care were taken, there would not be any disadvantage <Col N="33" /> in having the door connected with the rest of the house.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Reilly objected to the subsidising of this or any other scheme. If we were not prepared to subsidise it, I am quite sure that the Senator would say that no money should be spared in order to eliminate this disease and that we certainly should subsidise people to enable them to build these houses.  We are used to that type of argument here.  I agree that we should not, as Senator O'Reilly says, shout it from the hilltops and create a situation where a child going to school would ask other children: &ldquo;How do you think I am looking&rdquo;?  or where children would be inclined to think that they were doomed before having an opportunity to start out in life&mdash;that they were certain to die from tuberculosis.  That is the great danger and we should do everything in our power to prevent that impression from spreading.</P>
    <P>I am prepared to admit that this disease has been, as it were, a sort of nightmare to lots of people, including myself, although I believe I am past the age when I could be attacked by a germ of that kind.  I have known hundreds of people, in fact I know several people in this House, who have been cured of tuberculosis.  I believe we should create the impression amongst the people that, even if one has tuberculosis, it is really not a sentence of death.  I know personally hundreds of people who have been cured.  Some of them I might wish to get rid of in some other way but I should not like them to suffer that kind of death anyway.  The trouble is largely psychological.  I think money should be spent on that type of propaganda, that where people have been permanently cured that fact should be made known to the public, of course with the permission of the people who had been cured.  That would really do more good than taking chances in the other direction, by spreading the conviction amongst people that they were certain to die because that is what it amounts to.</P>
    <P>With regard to the preference which some Senators have expressed for the chalet as against an additional room, <Col N="34" /> I cannot see any great difficulty arising there.  It is really a matter of taste or a matter of getting advice from the doctor.  If a patient were really bad, it might be necessary to isolate him but I do not agree at all with the argument against the building of an extra room or with the suggestion that it will be always known as the plague room.  There are several other enactments under which extra rooms can be provided.  There are what are known as reconstruction grants which have been availed of all over the country and it is quite a common thing to see extra rooms added to houses in various parts of the country.  It is not suggested under this Bill that the extra room will look any different from any other room.  If that system is adopted, it will just mean an addition to the end of the house and I do not believe that any notice is going to be taken of it.  In the years to come, if somebody happens to die in that house after five or six years' illness, or if he happens to recover, I do not believe that anybody in the district will associate that fact in any way with the extra room.  I believe that in any statements we make, we should try to get into people's minds the idea that tuberculosis is not the scourge it was supposed to be some time ago and that with modern treatment people can be and have been cured.  We should try to instil the idea into the minds of young people who may get tuberculosis that if they take proper care of themselves and if the disease is treated in a proper way there is every prospect of a cure.  I welcome the Bill and I hope it will be followed by other measures aiming at complete elimination of this disease.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasForan" hpid="Mr. Foran Mr. Foran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Foran</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill as far as it goes, but I am much more impressed by the statement of the Minister that this is a prelude to a broadside on the national scourge of this country than by some of the other statements which we have heard.  To the extent that it is only a prelude, I agree with the Bill, but there are a few points I should like to put to the Minister. One is, how is he going to provide an extra room for the great number <Col N="35" /> of tenement dwellers in Dublin or other big cities throughout the country? I can only assume that in view of the confined and restricted space available to such people, institutional treatment will be arranged in their case.  If not, I do not see how a chalet or an additional room can be provided in tenement houses which are already overcrowded.  I am not at all enamoured either of the extra room or the chalet.  I do not know that it is going to do patients very much good to have them isolated and singled out as persons suffering from a plague or scourge, people who are to be avoided to a certain extent.  Because of that, I sincerely hope that the Minister will carry out the promise that he has already given here, that there will be a more intensive and perhaps more effective attack on this scourge.  Senator Quirke, after making an attack on everyone else for their alleged want of knowledge of tubercle bacilli, proceeded to inform us that we should go and tell our children who are all right that tuberculosis is no longer a menace.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamQuirke" hpid="Mr. Quirke Mr. Quirke">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasForan" hpid="Mr. Foran Mr. Foran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Foran</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the impression I got from what the Senator said to Senator Moore.  In my opinion we should rather over-emphasise, if anything, the danger of tuberculosis. To-day our people are leaving themselves open to infection by this scourge judging by the kind of pastimes they indulge in.  They are leaving themselves open to become receptacles for tuberculosis germs.  One has only to go along the principal thoroughfares of our cities on a fine summer's day to see queues crowding into picture houses.  Are we to tell those people that that is a healthy kind of recreation for them?  I say emphatically &ldquo;no&rdquo;.  The risks that they are running in such crowded atmospheres, when they should be out enjoying the sunshine, should be pointed out to them.  Again, we have overcrowded dance halls with heated, fetid atmospheres. The frequenting of such places is not calculated to prevent the development of tuberculosis.  That is the <Col N="36" /> answer to what Senator Quirke told us in regard to telling people that tuberculosis is not a serious matter.  The Irish Red Cross Society has done excellent work with the scare posters sent round the country bringing home emphatically to the people the menace this disease represents, how easily it is contracted and how easily it can be avoided and possibly cured by taking proper care.  I hope that the lines advocated by Senator Quirke will not be adopted generally throughout the country because we know that they are wrong lines and that their adoption may mean an increase in tuberculosis.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Reilly talked about Government and State intervention in health and social matters.  He actually told us that we were becoming a nation of bankrupts.  On the other hand he advocated that more voluntary effort should be encouraged by the State.  Is anything more calculated to pauperise our people than treatment of that kind?  Every thinking person knows that the first duty of the State is to provide proper housing and health facilities for the citizens.  A healthy citizen is a valuable citizen; an unhealthy citizen is an encumbrance.  Money spent on ensuring the health of the people is a gain for the nation generally.  When we have the more comprehensive plan of the Government before us we will be in a better position to judge.  As I said, I am not at all enamoured of the provisions of this Bill.  I do not think it will do a whole lot towards arresting the spread of tuberculosis.  I do not think it will do a whole lot towards curing it.  I do hope that the Minister, when he is concluding, will tell us how it is proposed to provide an additional room or chalet for tenements in our cities.</P>

      <P>I am very sorry that this scheme was not inaugurated very many years ago, because if it had been I do not believe that there would be any necessity for the regional sanatoria that we are contemplating erecting.  A very short time ago I was speaking to an expert on tuberculosis and he said <Col N="37" /> that there should be more treatment of the patients in their own homes than there is at the present time.  He said that if that were done the present sanatoria would be quite sufficient.  I said I thought there was great danger in keeping them in the houses, but his reply was: &ldquo;No; if they are properly instructed and their people are properly instructed there is no danger whatever of the spread of the disease.&rdquo; He did say that there was a certain danger from people sleeping in the same bed, but not so much from associating in the same house.  This idea of the extra room is the very thing that is required to provide for people who are stricken down by this disease, and who are quite capable of being treated in their own homes.  I believe that several types of tuberculosis will not spread except in certain ways, and that patients suffering from those forms of the disease can be treated in their own homes.</P>
      <P>Senator Baxter spoke about the cost to the local authorities.  I see here that two-thirds of the cost of £200 will come out of the central fund, so the extra expense to the local authorities will be very small, and I think they will be glad to pay that extra cost. Senator O Buachalla pointed out that it is not so much the poor who get the disease as the well-to-do people.  When the well-to-do people see those chalets or rooms erected for the poor, they will erect those chalets or rooms for themselves out of their own funds, without any cost whatever to the country.  I believe the disease is being conquered. I believe that nothing will help so much to conquer it as the provisions of Sections 3 and 4 of the Bill.  I certainly welcome it very heartily.</P>

      <P>Last night, the Minister made a very suggestive and very interesting speech, from which I should like to quote one line: &ldquo;It is the public, the taxpayers and ratepayers, who call the tune, and naturally they pay the piper.&rdquo;  To my mind, that ought to be in letters of gold in the frieze of this and the other House. When any question of public expenditure comes up we should regard ourselves&mdash;if not exactly as calling the tune&mdash;as speaking for those who call <Col N="38" /> the tune, and regard it as our duty to see that every penny which our action enables the Government or the local authorities to expend should be spent to the best advantage.</P>
      <P>This seems to me to be a question as between chalets and rooms.  There is a great deal to be said on both sides, and the Bill provides that either a chalet or a room may be provided, according to the circumstances.  Presumably, the circumstances will be determined by local conditions.  Chalets could not be provided universally. There would not be space for chalets everywhere, even apart from the question of the slums to which Senator Foran referred.  Even in the smallish towns, like Galway, if there was a question of providing chalets there would not be a proper place to put them.  Therefore, the choice must be determined by local circumstance, and the fact that the Bill sanctions both would seem to meet that situation.  I think there is a great deal in what Senator Kingsmill Moore said, that the local authorities should have power to provide those movable chalets.  At first sight, it would seem that in that way more people would derive advantage from the spending of this particular money, but the local circumstances must be taken into consideration, and must determine the issue.  Whatever rooms or chalets are provided, I expect the Minister will see to it that they will embody the very best results of the anti-tuberculosis planning, that is to say, that they will have the proper kind of glass in the windows, the proper kind of aspect and so on.  In that way, those rooms or chalets would provide a means of health training.  The people would learn the proper kind of houses to build or get built for themselves.  They would learn how to keep them properly and treat them properly.  That is all part of the intensive course of education which must underlie our campaign against tuberculosis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am very glad that the House has given such attention to this particular aspect of the Bill.  Our fight against the menace of tuberculosis is one of the greatest fights we have to face.  It is forced on everybody's notice.  We cannot <Col N="39" /> take it lightly, but we must regard it hopefully.  We must remember that it can be faced and can be fought, and we hope that we are on the right way towards solving the problem.  I was told by a nurse who lived in Holland&mdash; she was speaking of conditions before the war&mdash;that tuberculosis raged to an appalling extent in that country, but such measures were taken to combat it that it became almost negligible.  More than isolation is required.  Isolation of persons who are not getting institutional treatment is just one aspect of the question.  It is an important aspect. How their families are to treat those patients, and how they can be trained in ordinary healthy habits of life, must also form part of the fight.  I am very glad that the question has arisen under a Housing Bill, because the provision of proper housing is one of the means by which we must attack this problem. We must also attack it by training our women to do their job well, and to cook the food properly.  Of course, unemployment has a great deal to do with the problem too.</P>

      <P>I said he is a very intriguing not to say disarming speaker.  I never had a measure before this House that the Senator did not get up and open his speech by a most pacific announcement that he did not quarrel with any of the proposals. Unfortunately, however, his pacific temper does not always endure to the end of his oration, and, in this particular instance, having told us that <Col N="40" /> he was warmly in favour of the Bill and, in particular, in connection with Sections 3 and 4, he went on to say, firstly, that he dissented from the Bill in the matter of its cost of operation being made a charge on the ratepayers; secondly, that the Bill, in his opinion, would not achieve its purpose; and he wound up finally by going back to his first cause of criticism of the Bill: that is to say, that he dissented from it from the point of view that the cost of operating any part of Sections 3 and 4 of the Bill should be a charge on the ratepayers.  Now, I know that that is not a new point of view from the Senator.  I have often heard him putting forward that point of view&mdash;so often that I have been reminded of a story concerned with a local authority election, one of the candidates for which died before the day of the poll.  The deceased man's name appeared on the ballot paper, however, and when this became known, his friends were worried as to what they should do about it.  One man thought that it would be better to vote for him on account of the Party to which he belonged; another man thought that it would be better to vote for him on account of his wife, but another man said: &ldquo;Well, we might as well vote for him, because he cannot raise the rates on us now.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>However, Senator Baxter put one or two questions to me which, although I am not particularly concerned with the public health aspects of this Bill, I shall try to answer.  He asked, in effect: &ldquo;Why should we treat, in his own home, a person who is suffering from tuberculosis?&rdquo; Well, the answer to that is that there is a large body of public opinion and of medical opinion in favour of the view that if proper treatment can be given, in the earlier stages of the disease, in the affected person's own home, that is the best way to deal <Col N="41" /> with the disease.  Do not forget also, in that connection&mdash;now that we are talking about sanatoria&mdash;that there is a certain prejudice in this country against going to a sanatorium and getting treatment there.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not saying that there is any justification for that, but we must remember that that taboo applies to almost every aspect of the treatment of this particular disease. The second suggestion of Senator Baxter&mdash;to my mind, at any rate&mdash; rather indicated that he takes a very poor view of the way in which the medical officers of health, who are responsible for administering the various anti-tuberculosis schemes, administer their duties.</P>

      <P>Now, what I have to say applies also to some of the statements for which Senator Kingsmill Moore made himself responsible.  It is a fundamental condition attaching to the provision of these additional rooms that the county medical officer of health will certify that the person concerned is not only suffering from tuberculosis, but that he is undergoing treatment and that the existing accommodation is inadequate for the proper segregation of the patient from the other members of the household, and also that the local authority will certify that the house concerned is suitable for being provided with an extra room.  If Senator Sweetman will look at paragraph (d) of Section 3 he will see that a local authority shall not make a grant unless and until it is certified that the house is suitable for being provided with an extra room. However, let me get back.  First of all, the proposal to build an additional room can only be given effect to on the certificate of the county medical officer of health; and, secondly, it can only be given effect to in respect of a house which is suitable for the provision of an extra room to that house. Thirdly, it can only be given effect to where the medical officer of health certifies that the person concerned is undergoing treatment there.  Now, are <Col N="42" /> we to believe that the medical officers of health, who are charged particularly with this matter of the prevention and cure of tuberculosis, are going to issue certificates in respect of houses in regard to which these conditions cannot be fulfilled?  That is what Senator Baxter implied in his statement. Perhaps he did not do so consciously, but that is the clear deduction to be made from what he said: that the county medical officers of health would go along and ask for the erection of such rooms attached to houses which the Senator described as, and I think Senator Kingsmill Moore adopted the phrase afterwards&mdash;no, I am sorry; Senator Kingsmill Moore coined the phrase on his own&mdash;houses in which tuberculosis existed as a living organism, and the suggestion was that it existed as a living organism in many of the houses of this country.</P>
      <P>Now, first of all, I think we may take it that the medical officer of health will only permit this room to be erected in a part adjoining the premises; and, secondly, as he is treating the patient, and assuming that the local authority has to spend a considerable sum of money, he will also see that all those steps which can be taken to disinfect the house, and leave it safe structurally, will be taken.  We may also assume that, since he has to visit the patient from time to time, he will see that the precautions which are necessary will be observed, since he is visiting the patient in a domiciliary capacity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Kingsmill Moore said that Section 3 and 4 of the Bill raise certain questions.  He said that the Bill might be conceived to be too narrow, and perhaps he had in mind the fears that Senator Fearon had in mind in connection with these particular sections. If so, I shall wait to dispose of the particular arguments that Senator Fearon had in mind, but Senator Kingsmill Moore said that he thought this had been conceived too narrowly and that, perhaps, it might be thought that the ownership of the room would be vested in the original owner of the house.  Now, that is true, and I admit that that might be an objection, but so far as the majority of rural houses in <Col N="43" /> this country are concerned &mdash; the occupiers of which cannot provide such accommodation &mdash; the owner of such homes is already the local authority.  I am quite prepared to admit that there may be a considerable number of exceptions to that position, but, in general, a very large number of the people for whom additional accommodation will be provided under this Bill, will be already living in houses belonging to local authorities, and perhaps this has a bearing on the objection that Senator Baxter has to this Bill.  He was so obsessed with the idea of voting for the dead man, because that would not raise the rates, that he overlooked the fact that by the expenditure of something up to £50, the local authority would make itself owner of property worth £150.</P>

      <P>Let me get back to what Senator Kingsmill Moore said. The Senator stated that it was easy to overlook the fact that segregation was impossible, that it was easy to overlook the question of sending a person to a sanatorium, and easy to overlook this position, that a person should observe a certain régime and take precautions. I am paraphrasing what the Senator said, and I do not think I am misrepresenting him.  Under the development of our public health services, as we now envisage them, the main preoccupation of which will be the prevention and cure of tuberculosis, I cannot conceive that they will overlook the fact that in the home complete segregation is impossible, or will encourage to remain in the home a person who could only be adequately dealt with in a sanatorium.  I think it is not possible for a medical officer of health to make that mistake.  Similarly, I think we may reassure ourselves as <Col N="44" /> to the possibility of a tuberculosis officer of health refraining from sending to a sanatorium a person who ought to be there, if he could get accommodation. We are dealing with a problem for which, at the present time, we have not sufficient accommodation, and it may be that by segregating sufferers, while we may not be able to save them, we make it easier for other members of the family.  That is a consideration in the objections urged against the Bill. The third point was the need for observing a certain régime and taking precautions.  I do not think the Senator has considered the implications of the principal paragraph of sub-section (1) of the section where the county medical officer of health must certify that a person is not only suffering from tuberculosis, but is undergoing treatment. We may be reasonably assured that the medical officer ensures that the patient carries out the treatment he prescribes. We may take it that persons who avail of the accommodation will observe the precautions which are necessary if they are to cure themselves.  It seems to me that people who, despite all the prejudice, avail of the opportunities presented by the Bill, will be those in respect of whom the educational campaigns now being carried on by various bodies have been effective, and that they will be the more intelligent section of the population who wish to be cured.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Senator advocated the provision of chalets which may be taken down. Senator P.J. O'Reilly took the same line, being strongly in favour of temporary chalets.  The point about that is that local authorities for a considerable period have been in a position to provide chalets of this nature under their tuberculosis schemes. Under these schemes I think the Exchequer would be bound to reimburse them 50 per cent. of the cost of chalets.  Whatever may be the prejudice against erecting an additional room, there seems to be a much more firmly rooted prejudice against the erection of chalets.  In that connection the number of chalets erected from time to time has been very disappointing. Section 4 in this Bill represents a triumph of hope over experience, because we felt when drafting <Col N="45" /> the Bill originally, that we might save paper and not bother about chalets at all.  However, they are there. The erection of huts or chalets does come within the scope of the Bill, whether temporary or otherwise, when erected by local authorities.  I should like to say regarding the suggestion to provide temporary chalets that it is all very well to suggest that they would cost £25.  They cost £25 to pre-fabricate, but how much would they cost ultimately to erect and to take down when finished, or to keep in repair?  At the end I think it would be found that the advantage, from the monetary point of view, in favour of temporary chalets would be much less than in the case of annexes.</P>
    <P>The only other point in Senator Kingsmill Moore's speech to which I should like to refer is the concluding portion, where he suggested that instead of inducing persons to take a room we should try to get them to take precautions, or provide them with sanatorium accommodation to the extent to which that is possible.  I should like to assure the Senator that it is not a question of inducing persons to take a room.  There would be no coercion beyond the ordinary amount of persuasion that a medical man would be entitled to use in respect of a patient to get him to take the steps necessary, in this case not only to cure himself but to prevent other members of the family becoming infected.  We do not propose to operate this measure in such a way that, by inducing a person to allow a room to be built on the premises, we will dissuade a person from going to a sanatorium, who otherwise ought to go there.</P>
    <P>Senator Duffy expressed a point of view which received a certain amount of concurrence when he suggested that, if the local authority adds a room to a dwelling, the extra room will be used as another bedroom and not as segregated accommodation.  I do not think that there is much substance in that point, unless we are prepared to do&mdash; do&mdash;what I am not prepared to do&mdash; allege that, in most families where there are sufferers from this disease, there is such a degree of callousness <Col N="46" /> and indifference not only to the fate of the sufferer but to the fate of the other members of the family that, if this opportunity of having segregated accommodation is provided, it will not be availed of.  We cannot cure people of this disease despite themselves. There must be very intense personal co-operation on the part of the sufferer if this disease is to be cured.  What we can do and what we are trying to do under this Bill is: if people, overcoming all the prejudices to which reference has been made, come and ask us to provide them with the accommodation which is necessary to prevent their infecting other members of the family, we can, when we have done that, put the onus on the sufferer himself and, in greater measure, on the other members of the family, particularly the heads of the family, to see that that room is used for the purpose for which it was provided, so that the other members of the family may be saved from the infection which has stricken one of their number down.  I think that that is a complete answer to the fear expressed.  The only foundation for that fear would be that the families were so indifferent regarding the fate of the sufferer and their own fate that they would not take what is the most elementary and easiest precaution to prevent the spread of the disease and facilitate the cure of the patient.</P>
    <P>Apart from that factor, which, I think, will be a very powerful and general one, there are other safeguards. We are not asking local authorities to provide those rooms, even on the certificate of the medical officer of health, unless they are satisfied that they will be used for the purpose for which they are provided.  In providing the rooms, the local authority will, doubtless, attach certain conditions as to their use and will ensure that they are reserved for the purpose for which they were provided. With the tuberculosis officer visiting the house frequently, examining the patient and treating him, he should be able to satisfy himself that the room is being used solely for accommodating the patient and is not being availed of for the general use of the family.  That <Col N="47" /> would apply in the case of houses which do not belong to the local authority.  There is the further consideration, which I have already mentioned, that, in many cases, the local authority itself will be the owner of the premises to which the room has been added.</P>
    <P>Senator Fearon asked me why we restricted the provisions of this measure to pulmonary tuberculosis. The reason is that this Bill is of a dual nature.  Sections 3 and 4, it can be contended&mdash;and I have so decided&mdash;properly belong to a Housing Bill.  We did not want to have provisions relating to housing accommodation for human beings spread over a number of dissociated statutes.  The Bill has also a public health aspect.  That matter was referred to by Senator Kingsmill-Moore, or some other Senator, who thought that this measure might more properly be described as a Public Health Bill.  There is something to be said for that contention but we have come down on the other side for reasons I have mentioned.  We want to keep those housing measures closely associated with one another with a view to having them codified later and made available in handy form to anybody who wants to consult them.  We have not lost sight of the fact that the measure has a public health aspect and that it is the public health activity of preventing the spread of the infection that we are mainly, if not wholly, concerned with here.</P>
    <P>Most of the diseases which Senator Fearon mentioned&mdash;diseases to which, he suggested, a provision of this sort might be applied&mdash;are, I understand, not infectious.  As I have said, the principal purpose of this Bill is to enable members of a household one of whom is suffering from tuberculosis&mdash;a highly infective disease&mdash;to segregate themselves from the infected person during the day as much as possible and completely at night.  In the case of heart disease or cancer, I do not think that we could put up that argument to the man who controls the purse-strings, who would have to be satisfied before we commenced to provide for diseases other than those covered by this Bill. <Col N="48" /> I do not say that, at some future date, the provisions of this measure may not be expanded, but it is better to make a beginning upon a narrow ground.</P>
    <P>Senator Fearon also feared that the stigma attaching to the building of the proposed accessory accommodation would be such that few people would avail themselves of the provisions of this measure.  Senator O'Reilly said that, even in those cases where the additional building had been erected, it would be a white elephant and a hallmark which would prevent other people from availing themselves of the accommodation, even if the original patient had been cured.  I hope that that will not be the position.  Most of us who remember the terms in which consumption or tuberculosis was referred to when we were young are sensible of the fact that people generally are taking a much more rational and intelligent view in relation to the disease than was then taken. They no longer regard it as incurable. All sort of educative agencies are carrying on campaigns with a view to convincing people that if the disease is taken in time, or if it is properly treated even though it is not taken in its very early stages, the chances of cure are very great, but that, if neglected, the inevitable fatality will ensue.  Whatever about the unintelligent section, this campaign is bearing fruit with the intelligent section of the community.</P>
    <P>Despite what we have heard about the stigma and the taboo, I have no doubt that intelligent families will avail themselves of the provisions of this Bill and that, by force of their example, prejudices will gradually be broken down until the provisions are generally availed of.  I go further and say that, when the fruits of the segregation are known, when sufferers undergo a cure in these circumstances, it will do a great deal to disabuse the minds of the people of a superstition that, as there are houses which are known as cancer houses, there are houses which are tuberculosis or consumption houses.  I may say that I do not anticipate that we shall have a spate of applications for this additional accommodation the moment the <Col N="49" /> Bill is passed, but we do believe that for a period of years&mdash;for one year, two years, three years or four years&mdash;as this campaign goes on, the benefits of this Bill will be more and more generally recognised and will be availed of to a very great extent indeed.</P>
    <P>Senator Foran welcomed the Bill and then asked me in what way we were going to add an extra room or a chalet to a slum tenement.  I can answer the Senator very briefly.  We do not propose to add an extra room or a chalet to slum tenements.  We propose, if we can, in God's good time, to abolish them altogether and that is what we are trying to do.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (2), page 4, line 17, to delete the figures &ldquo;1950&rdquo; and insert in lieu thereof the figures &ldquo;1948&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Perhaps in dealing with this, the first section of the Bill, I might be permitted to read a brief extract from a letter which was handed to me this evening.  It is from a builder in Dublin City.  He says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;These Rent Acts have killed all private enterprise in house-building as an investment.  If there was a free, unrestricted market, thousands of people to my own knowledge in this country would invest their money in building houses as obtained up to 1914, when the supply far exceeded the demand, with automatic adjustment of rent.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I have no personal knowledge of what the conditions are in Dublin, but I can speak from personal knowledge of what is happening in some provincial towns.  I am personally aware of the fact that what is stated in that letter with reference to Dublin applies, with equal force, to provincial towns. Generally, the tendency of this Rent Restrictions Bill will be to damp further the enthusiasm of people who, in the normal way, would like to put their money into building as an investment. I am not suggesting that there is any restriction on people building houses for the purpose of occupying them.  I am not making any comments on that at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are all aware that a tribunal reported on this question.  I presume the recommendations of that tribunal govern some of the clauses in this Bill, but it is to be borne in mind that the members of the tribunal mentioned in their report that there was no attempt to control rents in the case of houses built after 1919, and that there was no intention of doing so.  This Bill, in some of its provisions, goes against that suggestion which is contained in the report of the tribunal presided <Col N="51" /> over by Mr. Justice Black.  I want to suggest now to the Minister that he would be going a long way to reassure people who have begun to doubt the sanity, if you like, of building houses for the purpose of renting them, if he were to accept this slight amendment moved by me.  Under the Expiring Laws Act, if the emergency conditions which appear to justify this particular measure have not passed by the end of three years, it will be possible to continue this measure more or less indefinitely, as some other measures have been continued.  I appeal to the Minister to consider this amendment sympathetically.  Its acceptance would, as I have said, go a long way to make people believe that ultimately they will be safe in resuming the practice of building houses to rent.  Should that occur, then a lot of the difficulties that exist at the present moment in regard to getting a house will disappear. I have personal knowledge that one member of my own stan has, owing to the difficulty of obtaining a house, to travel a distance of 13 miles. He is carrying on his work in a certain town and cannot get a house anywhere.  The same thing applies to several other members of my staff.  I am sure that other members of the House, if they were to call upon their experience, could quote similar cases. In view of all this, I appeal to the Minister to consider this amendment sympathetically.  It is not asking a whole lot.  It is simply proposing to reduce the duration of the Bill from five years to three, with the understanding, of cource, that, should conditions warrant the continuance of the Act beyond the three years, it may be continued under the Expiring Laws Act.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TheodoreMoore" hpid="Mr. Kingsmill Moore Mr. Kingsmill Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kingsmill Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I am prepared to give this amendment support though not perhaps absolutely unqualified support. There are certain considerations which the House and the Minister might keep before their minds.  I suppose there has rarely been any period in the history of the world in which it was less possible to foresee, with any approach to accuracy or confidence, what was going to happen in the <Col N="52" /> course of the next three years.  It is, I think, a safe prophecy for me to say that, when both Houses have finished with this Bill and when the various inconsistent amendments which we have all introduced have been put into some kind of order on Report Stage: when we all think that we have got the best Bill it was possible for us to get, it will be found, within a very short period, that even then there are a great many loopholes in it and that many difficulties will arise in connection with it.  In three years' time it is almost certain that there will be a need for provisions different from what they are at present.  How different, I do not know&mdash;different, perhaps, in favour of tenants; different in favour of landlords, different in favour of the State.  It is very much easier to introduce an amending Bill when a Bill is already on the point of expiring.  It is very much easier to continue a Bill.  It is always a very difficult thing to revoke or modify very substantially the provisions of a Bill which are in full force and I have a strong feeling that we would probably be wiser if we gave this Bill an initial life of three years with the possibility of continuing it very easily, with perhaps some minor amendments, than if we gave it an initial life of five years which would induce people to build on the assumption that the state of affairs was going to exist for five years when the state of the world is likely to have changed so vividly and perhaps so extravagantly that in fact the Act which people have regarded as setting down a relatively stable state of affairs will no longer be applicable to the conditions.  Therefore, unless there are strong objections, I cannot see any reason why this should not be initially limited to three years instead of five as I do not think it can do any harm and it may do some good.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>May I say that this Bill is not designed to provide an Act for five years?  The maximum life of the Bill is five years.  There is no guarantee that it will last five years.  If circumstances alter in the way that Senator Kingsmill Moore visualises it seems to me that you can scrap the Act at the <Col N="53" /> end of two years or three years, as the case may be.  That is my reading of it. But what amazes me altogether is the approach of Senator O'Reilly because if this Bill is amended in the manner he proposes in the amendments on the Order Paper, it seems to me it would aim at enriching the landlords beyond their wildest dreams.  He proposes, for instance, in other amendments to provide a sum for repairs equal to one-eighth&mdash;12½ per cent.&mdash;of the basic rent. He proposes to increase the standard rent, in certain cases by 25 per cent., in other cases by 24 per cent., and to provide a return of 12 per cent. on improvements for people who cannot get more than 3 per cent. for their money in any other enterprise.  I imagine that if Senator O'Reilly were serious he would propose that this Bill should last for 50 years rather than for five years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Kingsmill Moore has stated that it is much easier to amend a Bill on its expiration than to amend it during the course of its life.  Senator Patrick J. O'Reilly is afraid it will interfere with building. It will interfere with building to a greater extent if it is made for a term of only three years because then you may expect an amending Bill at the end of that term which&mdash;although I am sure it will not be done&mdash;would give the opportunity at any rate for bringing in houses built since 1941, whereas if it is allowed to continue for a period of five years there is no danger that that would occur.  Therefore, if the builders are frightened, I think they will be much more frightened by Senator O'Reilly's amendment than by the Bill as it stands at present.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Boland) Gerald Boland">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Senator Duffy made my case. The Bill cannot last longer than five years and I think it is a reasonable assumption that conditions would be rather uncertain during most of those five years.  It is not a question of interfering with the building of new houses. Such houses are not subject to control. Only those houses built up to May, 1941, are dealt with, and it would be only in the event of people who are building now charging exorbitant rents and profiteering that I think any Minister <Col N="54" /> would suggest that they should be brought under control.  The Government would naturally be anxious to have all the houses built that can possibly be built and any reasonable person would say that builders should get a fair return on the money they invest.  Therefore, if there is no attempt at gross profiteering, I cannot see any Minister bringing in a Bill to control houses that are to be built in future, unless some condition such as has occurred during the present emergency should arise.  If conditions improve much more than we expect they will, say, in three years or two years, there is no reason why the Government would not bring this Bill to an end, if they thought conditions warranted it.  I think five years is a short time and, as Senator Kingsmill Moore says, no one knows what is going to happen.  We will have to wait and see.  If conditions warrant a change in this Bill the Government will naturally have to take notice of the conditions and bring in an amending Bill, but I think it is reasonable to say that it will not extend for more than five years.  It does not say that the Bill must continue for a period of five years, but merely that it will extend for not more than five years.  The Minister at any time can bring in an amending Bill if he thinks conditions warrant it.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister consider discriminating between the two classes of controlled houses&mdash; the 1923-controlled houses and the post-1923 controlled houses, because they do seem to me to call for different consideration? Houses up to £40 in the country and £60 in Dublin are in many cases occupied by exceedingly well-to-do people.  I do not know if I am giving the show away when I put myself in that category.  I consider myself well-to-do and I am living in a controlled house, and I do not think it is at all called for that I should be protected by legislation.  As a matter of fact, I do not pay rent now; I own the house, but people in similar houses <Col N="55" /> to mine are protected against a fair increase on the part of the landlord or for repairs&mdash;because nobody can possibly contend that the present increases are unfair.  I do think it calls for discrimination, and I would ask the Minister to consider limiting the Bill to three years in respect of those houses and to five years in the case of the smaller houses.  They are totally different in character.  I think it has gone beyond all reason that houses occupied by people who are far better-off than the landlords, professional people in many cases, should be controlled. A large number of the houses in the Clonskeagh and Ranelagh districts are now controlled.  They are occupied by well-to-do professional men who can put up their charges, while the landlord is tied absolutely to the bare rent.  I think that is a matter that might be considered and that there might be some discrimination made in the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>On that point, I imagine that if, in a couple of years, an amending Bill was brought in it would follow something on the lines of the 1923 Act.  What was done then was that the valuation limit was reduced year by year.  I imagine that that is the line de-control will take in the future.  It seems to be the better way. Even in connection with houses of the kind referred to, I do not think it would be fair to let people profiteer, seeing that we have tried to have Standstill Orders both in respect of wages and the profits of companies. This is on somewhat similar lines.  I would imagine that that would be the line on which an amending Bill would go, if there was a case for it.  I do not think there is any real reason why we should limit it to three years.  As I said, if the circumstances warrant it, an amending Bill could be brought in in two years' time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I make one suggestion to the Minister in this matter? It might appear on the face of it that there is no need to protect people living in houses the valuation of which reaches up to £60 in metropolitan areas.  But I have already drawn the <Col N="56" /> Minister's attention to the fact that, if house rents in respect of that type of house are going to go up, the people who normally occupy them will leave these houses and look for cheaper houses, bringing the pressure from the top down to the very poorest class of people who have a struggle to pay any rent at all.  Therefore I urge very strongly that the Minister should bear that fact in mind and not merely have regard to the actual occupants of highly-rated houses.</P>

Personally, if I had my way I would make it 50 minutes.  I totally object to this and I explained my position very clearly just before Christmas.  As regards the profiteering side of the matter, there is nothing in Senator Duffy's argument worth replying to and I have no desire to continue it. When times are normal I think there should be an absolutely free condition of things just as before.  What I have said with regard to Senator Duffy applies to some extent to the Minister also.  I venture to say that a lot of Senators know that I am saying something very close to the truth, if not actually the truth.  I can assure the House that the feeling of people who would normally be inclined to invest in house property is that in no circumstances will they do so.  That is the universal position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have discussed the matter with solicitors and house property owners and when I suggest a term, I am making a suggestion that I think is a reasonable compromise between one made in the other House, namely, that the Act should be continued from year to year for whatever number of years is necessary, and what is contained in the Bill.  It struck me that there might be difficulties arising, and as a compromise I felt that this suggestion would be a reasonable one.  I appeal to the Minister to think seriously about the matter.  When I suggest three years, I visualise that during that three years there will be no private building <Col N="57" /> done, or practically none.  Therefore, the shorter the term of the Act the better.  It has been said by Senator Duffy and the Minister that the maximum duration of the Bill is five years. The implication of that is that the period may be shorter.  The reading of it is that the Act shall continue in operation until 31st December, 1950.  It is as definite as it can be.  I merely suggest that that be changed to 1948. That would reduce the period of uncertainty during which builders may not make due provision for houses.</P>
    <P>I am speaking on behalf of certain classes of people who are suffering under very serious handicaps.  I want to reduce their term of purgatory to the very smallest.  I should like to make it two years, but that would perhaps be asking too much of the Minister.  I think three years is a reasonable term. I appeal again to the Minister to consider this suggestion between now and the Report Stage.  I think he will have a large body of sensible and prudent people behind him who will regard this as a concession that should be extended as soon as possible.  He would certainly be doing a good thing for the comfort and happiness of thousands of people throughout the country.  So far as I am concerned, I should like to facilitate the poorer classes in every possible way.  I have suggested that their wages should be increased and, if there is any proposal to that effect in order to enable them to pay a reasonable and economic rent, I would be the first to support it.  In my opinion, that is the decent way of dealing with the matter.</P>
    <P>I suggest that it is a dreadful thing to inflict the hardships which are being inflicted on a lot of poor owners of property.  I am personally aware that they are far and away worse off financially than many people living in their houses.  I think that the nation as a whole should come to their rescue. If there is help wanted the nation should provide it.  It is a monstrous thing to be inflicting this injustice on a comparatively small section of the people.  I often wonder to what extent we are practising the nice sentiments laid down in the Constitution. Do we realise that these are people of <Col N="58" /> flesh and blood just like ourselves and that they are suffering dreadful hardships as a result of these Acts? Listening to certain Deputies talking in the other House, one would think that these people were made of wood and not flesh and blood; that they can alter their conditions of life or do anything you like with them and that they do not suffer; that they have no sensitivity to suffering.  I do not think anyone would consciously do that.  I think it is done from want of thought and want of realisation of the other-side of the question.</P>
    <P>When we come to the other amendment to which Senator Duffy referred, I will be prepared to deal with that. I appeal again to the Minister to consider this matter.  I know he is endeavouring to be as fair as possible in the matter.  I am speaking now on behalf of a very considerable body of opinion.  I am not merely speaking for the owners of property.  I am speaking from my experience in dealing with certain classes of people who are, to my knowledge, suffering very seriously as a result of these Rent Restriction Acts.  If I had my way, I would abolish the Acts completely.  Senator Duffy need not talk about 50 years.  I would only give them 50 minutes.  The matter should be settled on better lines.  If nobody else does it, I will submit a Bill for the consideration of this House that I think will put the matter on a healthier basis.  This is only a patchwork attempt at settling this question.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before Section 2, in page 4, to insert the following new section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>2.&mdash;The expiration of this Act shall not render recoverable by a landlord any rent which, during the continuance thereof was irrecoverable, or affect the right of a tenant to recover any sum which during the continuance thereof was under this Act recoverable by him.</P>
      <P>This is a proposal that, on the expiration of the Act, any rights which then exist in so far as tenants are concerned shall continue.  My attention has been drawn to the fact that the matter is covered, probably, by Section 21 of the Interpretation Act.  I cannot say if that is so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I think what the Senator is looking for covers only the tenant's part of it.  He does not want the landlord to have his rights at all. Both parties' rights are guaranteed by the two sections&mdash;Sections 21 and 22 of the Interpretation Act, 1937.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister reads the section, he will find that what is proposed here is that the expiration of this Act shall not render recoverable by a landlord any rent which, during the continuance thereof, was irrecoverable or affect the right of a tenant to recover any sum which during the continuance of this Act was under this Act recoverable by him.  It has nothing at all to do with the landlord's rights. I might also point out that this amendment of mine is lifted, so far as it was relevant, from Section 20 of the Act of 1923&mdash;it is a paragraph in that Section 20.  The only portion of the paragraph which I omitted was the portion relating to mortgage interest, which is a subject not included in the present Bill.  Therefore, I think it is quite wrong for the Minister to make the suggestion he has made, if he has <Col N="60" /> adverted to the Act of 1923, and to the correct interpretation of this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TheodoreMoore" hpid="Mr. Kingsmill Moore Mr. Kingsmill Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kingsmill Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I can make this clear, on the purely legal point.  When the Act of 1923 was passed, the Interpretation Act of 1923 was in existence.  That Interpretation Act provided that, where a Bill was repealed, the repeal should not have effect so as to alter the various rights of the parties as existing under the repealed Act.  It did not contain any provision for what was to happen when an Act was not repealed but expired.  Then, in the 1937 Interpretation Act, there was inserted, as far as I know for the first time, a provision that when an Act expired the expiration of the Act was to have the same effect in all respects as if it had been repealed.  So that, whereas the section was necessary in the 1923 Act, because the 1923 Interpretation Act did not cover it, it is not necessary now, since the 1937 Interpretation Act provides that, on the expiration of this Act, a state of affairs shall exist which Senator Duffy would like to ensure would exist, by virtue of his amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TheodoreMoore" hpid="Mr. Kingsmill Moore Mr. Kingsmill Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kingsmill Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I move the following amendment to amendment No. 4:&mdash;</P>
      <P>At the end of the proposed amendment to add the following new paragraph:-</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(d)  a person who retains possession of any premises after his contractual tenancy therein has <Col N="62" /> been terminated under a claim that the premises are controlled premises and that he is entitled to retain possession of the premises by virtue of this Act, whenever the immediate landlord of such person acquiesces in such claim either expressly or by implication.</P>
    <P>I think this amendment of mine is necessary to round out the amendment proposed by Senator Quirke.  Senator Quirke's amendment is obviously necessary because of the different interpretations which have been given and the difficulties which have arisen in knowing what was meant by the definition of statutory tenant as it stood in the 1923 Act.  Senator Quirke's amendment is designed to cover the various points which have arisen in the course of legal practice, but about which a certain amount of difference of opinion has been shown. There is one curious case not covered and on which a difference of opinion has arisen.  Sometimes, when an ordinary contractual tenancy is brought to an end by the service of a notice to quit, it is a question of some doubt as to whether the house on which the notice to quit operated is within or without the limitations of the Act.  It may also be a question as to whether the nature of the tenancy which existed and which is being brought to an end was a tenancy of such a type as to be within or without the Act.  Accordingly, a tenant may say: &ldquo;I admit that my contractual tenancy has ceased, but I say that, by reason of the valuation of the house and the nature of the tenancy which I had, I am protected by the Act and become a statutory tenant.&rdquo;  The landlord may say: &ldquo;Well, I am not at all so sure about that.&rdquo;  It may be a question of genuine doubt.</P>
    <P>It has been pointed out that the law is not such an exact science that people can always tell beforehand what will be the decision of the court.  In this particular case, differences of opinion have been given by eminent counsel on both sides.  This is designed to cover what will happen if the landlord says to the tenant: &ldquo;Well, you claim that you are within the Act: I do not think you are, but <Col N="63" /> I am willing to treat you as being within the Act&rdquo;.  From then on, the conditions prevailing between the landlord and the tenant are based on the conditions which would exist if, in fact, the tenant had come within the wording of the original Act.  But, in one case at least&mdash;and I think in others&mdash;when some kind of arrangement like that had been come to, the tenant making a claim which the landlord tacitly or otherwise acquiesced in, after a few years had passed and the tenant found it would be more advantageous to himself, for the purpose of assigning or subletting the tenancy, to say he was not within the Act, he took the attitude: &ldquo;It is quite true that I claimed that I was within the Act, to protect my possession, but I was wrong in that claim and I now assert a right to do exactly the same things which I could have done if I was not a statutory tenant and if the tenancy which has existed since the expiration of the notice to quite were an ordinary yearly tenancy.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This is intended to protect a tenant from blowing hot and blowing cold in that way.  If there is a genuine doubt and he claims he is protected by the Act, the landlord may say he does not agree and will contest it, but if he says or tacitly implies: &ldquo;Very well, we will not fight about it, as there is not much in it, but we will carry on on the assumption that you are a statutory tenant under the Act&rdquo;, then both parties should be bound by it and the tenant should not subsequently be allowed to go back on the claim he has put forward.  Now, that is an actual case which has happened more than once, and it seemed to me this was the only thing necessary to round out the very careful and most elaborately thought-out provisions which Senator Quirke has provided and brought before the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very glad this amendment has been brought forward, because I think it will strengthen an argument that I intended to make against the last paragraph of Senator Quirke's amendment, dealing with &ldquo;a person who retains possession of any controlled premises under Section 58 of <Col N="64" /> this Act&rdquo;.  If Senator Kingsmill Moore's amendment is carried, hundreds of tenants will be excluded from the benefit of the Act.  They would be made statutory tenants.  That would mean that they could not sell their premises; they could not assign without the consent of the landlord if Section 40 stands as it is.  Even if the landlord did give consent, they could not get a penny for their interest in the premises.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LouisODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>Because, if you refer to Section 40, you will see that a statutory tenant cannot give up possession for any consideration.  It is a very serious matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TheodoreMoore" hpid="Mr. Kingsmill Moore Mr. Kingsmill Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kingsmill Moore</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LouisODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a very serious matter.  As everybody knows, the first Act was passed in 1915 and there were Acts passed in 1917, 1920 and 1923. Under those Acts it was decided that a landlord could not serve a notice to increase the rent unless he terminated the tenancy by a notice to quit.  Therefore, up to 1926, when another Act was passed, every notice served to increase rent was accompanied by a notice to quit.  In most cases the landlord did not serve an ejectment, but if Senator Kingsmill Moore's amendment is carried, all those people will become statutory tenants and will have no further rights under this Bill.  I am afraid also that if paragraph (c) of Senator Quirke's amendment stands the same thing will apply, because Section 58 says that a person retaining possession by virtue of the Act of 1923 &mdash;if it is held that everybody should get a notice to quit&mdash;is a statutory tenant. These people will be put in the position of being mere statutory tenants, having no rights.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Act applies to business premises and in most towns business people reside in their business premises.  Those business premises are worth very large sums of money, sometimes £6,000, £7,000 and £10,000.  If they are statutory tenants only they cannot get one penny for their interest in the premises. That, I think, is a very serious matter <Col N="65" /> and I suggest Senator Quirke should amend paragraph (c) by inserting the words &ldquo;a person who retains possession of any controlled premises under sub-section (4) of Section 4 of the Act of 1923.&rdquo;  I think that would make the matter clear.  It is a very serious matter now, considering the terms of Section 40.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>No, because the expression &ldquo;statutory tenant&rdquo; is used.  There is a definition of &ldquo;statutory tenant&rdquo;. I was glad it was defined because I had very great doubts as to what was a statutory tenant.  If a tenant served notice to have his rent reduced, did he become a statutory tenant?  If the landlord served notice to have the rent increased, was the tenant a statutory tenant, or was he a statutory tenant only when he continued on under Section 4 of the Act of 1923, which has an equivalent section in this Bill?  Take the case of a person who has been brought to court in an ejectment suit and the judge says: &ldquo;I will determine your rights, but you can continue on as a statutory tenant.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I understood Senator Kingsmill Moore proposed his amendment in order to have the matter clarified and not for the sake of carrying his amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TheodoreMoore" hpid="Mr. Kingsmill Moore Mr. Kingsmill Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kingsmill Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>Oh, no, I want my amendment carried.  I think Senator O'Dea is under a slight misapprehension. Under the old Act there was always a question as to what &ldquo;statutory tenant&rdquo; meant.  It was a question as to whether, when you served a notice to quit, its expiration determined the tenancy and whether after that the tenant remained on as a statutory tenant, or whether it was necessary to go further and bring an ejectment before the court and get a <Col N="67" /> declaration determining the statutory tenancy, or rather holding that it had already been determined by virtue of the expiration of the notice to quit and direct that the tenant could remain on only as a statutory tenant.  The existence of that latter view, which was always, in my opinion, an erroneous interpretation, led to a great number of unnecessary court cases because landlords were advised that in order to make a tenant a statutory tenant it was necessary to go through the procedure of bringing the matter to court and getting a declaration.  In my view it was always an erroneous view of the law, but that view did persist and still persists.</P>
      <P>The whole object of this amendment is to prevent those unnecessary cases and make it certain that, with the limited exceptions mentioned there, when a person who has been an ordinary contractual tenant has his ordinary contractual relationship determined in the normal way by the service of a valid notice to quit, which subsequently expires, from then on, his contractual tenancy having ceased, his statutory tenancy automatically arises. That is the view which has been held by the majority of the members of the profession. The existence of another possibility has involved a great deal of unnecessary litigation and doubt and now that we are passing this Bill, it is an easy matter to put the question beyond doubt so that landlords and tenants may know where they are&mdash;that when the contractual tenancy ceases, if there was no Act of this kind, the man would be put out on the street but if he remains by virtue of this Act or by virtue of a claim under this Act, the provisions of this measure relating to statutory tenancies are to apply to him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LouisODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>That puts the matter very clearly, of course.  It is clearly put in the amendment that if a notice to quit has been served, even though the landlord does not go any further, the person who has been served with a notice to quit becomes a statutory tenant.  A statutory tenant is a person, as I said, who cannot get one penny for his interest, no matter what <Col N="68" /> it is worth.  He cannot assign his interest to anybody without consulting the landlord.  What is to be assigned is a question on which I should not like to have to tender advice if I were acting for the purchaser of a statutory tenancy, even though the landlord's consent was given.  If the tenant has not a wife or family, the tenancy terminates on his death.  If he has a wife, it passes to her after his death for her life.  If he has no wife it passes to one of his children, but after that it does not pass even to the next child.  It terminates.  It is therefore a very serious matter to make a tenant a statutory tenant.  Remember that under the Town Tenants Act of 1906, provision was made for compensation for disturbance and for improvements.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>That applied to the ordinary yearly tenancies as well as to a leasehold.  The landlord can now get rid of that difficulty by serving notice to quit.  If the amendment is put in the Bill, he just serves notice to quit, and the man becomes a statutory tenant.  He has no saleable interest.</P>

If he is not a tenant from year to year, or under a lease, he has no protection under the 1931 Act, so that serious questions may arise in connection with this method.

      <P>I thought I was simplifying the matter by bringing forward this amendment, because the point was raised with some of my officials.  The Bill went through the Dáil containing the definition: &ldquo;The expression &lsquo;statutory tenant&rsquo; means a person who retains possession of any premises by virtue of this Act.&rdquo;  I thought that by defining the expression at somewhat <Col N="69" /> greater length I was making it more simple, but in view of what has happened I think I had better have it examined again before Report Stage.</P>

      <P>It appears to me that there is a certain amount of confusion in this matter.  If we were to accept the view put forward by Senator O'Dea, the only possible effect the provision would have would be that it would clutter up the Circuit Court and that there would be a lot of work for solicitors because every landlord, having served notice to quit, would promptly go into the Circuit Court and automatically get his judgment, if it was a valid notice to quit.  Then the tenant becomes a statutory tenant.  All that has happened in that case means that this amendment is rather unnecessary because it must be clearly remembered that the judgment of the court declaring a man a statutory tenant is nothing more than a judgment declaring that the notice to quit terminating the tenancy was a valid notice to quit. If the notice to quit is a valid one, then to go to the court to have it declared valid seems more or less to be piling up unnecessary litigation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>This evening as I was coming to the Seanad I met an eminent judge.  I told him that I was going to the Seanad and that the Rent Restrictions Bill was on the Order Paper.  He said to me: &ldquo;I hope you will make the law clear at all events.  Rent Restrictions Acts have been the puzzle of the judiciary in England and Ireland&rdquo;.  In my opinion, it would be impossible to <Col N="70" /> make these Acts clear because they are a thing of shreds and patches.  Every individual has his own idea of how houses and rents should be controlled. Here we are dealing with a definition clause, namely, a definition of the expression &ldquo;statutory tenant&rdquo; in the Bill.  The Minister, for some reason or other I cannot understand, has yielded to some advice that was tendered to him to make the expression &ldquo;statutory tenant&rdquo; clear.  Senator Quirke has moved an amendment which confuses the whole definition.  Senator Kingsmill Moore adds words to that which make confusion worse confounded.  I would suggest that they should leave well alone in this matter and leave the words defining statutory tenant as they are in the Bill, namely, to mean a person who retains possession of any premises by virtue of this Act.  Other definitions are dependent on that and no amendments have been moved to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For example, the definition immediately preceding the definition of a &ldquo;statutory tenant&rdquo; is: &ldquo;a statutory tenancy means the interest of a statutory tenant in the premises in relation to which the expression is used&rdquo;.  I think the definition in the Act has worked reasonably well, and the definition in the present Bill is the same definition as is in the Emergency Powers (No. 313) Order, 1944, which is as follows: &ldquo;The expression &lsquo;statutory tenant&rsquo; means a person who retains possession of controlled premises by virtue of this Order.&rdquo;  The courts, I think, will understand what is the meaning of &ldquo;a person who retains possession by virtue of the Act&rdquo;.  The three sub-divisions, so to speak, in Senator Quirke's amendment all lead to the same end, namely, that the person therein mentioned will retain possession by reason of some provision or other in the Act.  Senator Kingsmill Moore's amendment, I think, would leave everything in the air, because his amendment provides that a person who retains possession of any premises after his contractual tenancy had been terminated, under a claim that the premises are controlled premises and that he is entitled to retain possession <Col N="71" /> of the premises by virtue of the Act, must, in order to become a statutory tenant within the meaning of this Bill, have the acquiescence, either expressed or implied, of the landlord. Well, the courts would be faced with the task of defining what might be described as implied acquiescence on the part of the landlord, and we know that landlords will not acquiesce in anything that is contrary to their own interests.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Nor tenants either.  Therefore, I think it would be more satisfactory that the relations governing the law of landlord and tenant should be expressly set out in the Statute, so that he who runs may read, and that there should be nothing left, so to speak, to the agreement of landlord and tenant unless it is either in writing or else is in a Statute so that it can be put beyond all doubt.  If the question of an agreement between a landlord and tenant is based upon implied acquiescence it might mean a nod of the head or it might mean some form of verbal agreement which would be difficult or impossible for any court to analyse or to determine in a proper way.  Therefore, I would suggest that the Minister should revert to the definition which is in the Bill as it now stands.  I would ask the Minister to refuse to accept Senator Quirke's amendment, and also Senator Kingsmill Moore's amendment to Senator Quirke's amendment.</P>

      <P>With all respect, I would suggest to my colleague, Senator Ryan, that paragraph (b) in amendment No. 4 does add substantially to the definition which Senator Ryan has quoted from a previous Act, that is to say, paragraph (b) deals with &ldquo;a person who retains possession of any controlled premises under sub-section (2)&rdquo;.  If we turn to sub-section <Col N="73" /> (2) of Section 39 we will find that, when the contractual tenancy has been determined by a notice to quite, if there is someone to whom there has been a lawful sub-letting he becomes the statutory tenant under the landlord, as if nothing had happened, under the terms to which he would have been subject had the tenant not had his tenancy determined.  That is something which is not in the definition of which Senator Ryan approves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TheodoreMoore" hpid="Mr. Kingsmill Moore Mr. Kingsmill Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kingsmill Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I just put this one point?  Hammering out a legal formula is a matter which can be easily done between legal gentlemen in committee, but there is one curious point which has been raised by Senator O'Dea and which is not a legal formula at all.  It is a contention of his which would have to be considered as a matter of policy.  Senator Ryan has spoken as if the definition of &ldquo;statutory tenant&rdquo; under the 1923 Act had given no trouble.  It has given a lot of trouble, and that is one of the reasons why an attempt is being made to clear up the trouble.  The very short point&mdash; leaving aside verbiage or anything else &mdash;which I imagine Senator Quirke attempts to meet by his amendment is this: it is, I believe, the agreed interpretation of the 1923 Act, and would be the agreed interpretation of this Bill as introduced into the Dáil that once a contractual tenancy has been determined by the service of a valid notice to quit the person becomes a statutory tenant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe that that is the agreed interpretation, and I have always believed that to be so.  But there have been other people who have believed that it was not so until the actual ejectment was taken, and they have been misled, I believe, by not seeing that the form which the judge uses in the ejectment is merely a declaration that the person is a statutory tenant and not an order that he be one. Anyway, the effect of that difficulty and the absence of clarity in definition has been that an enormous number of unnecessary court cases took place.  If this House is only agreed on the principle&mdash;as I should think it is agreed&mdash; it would probably be perfectly easy to hammer out a definition which would <Col N="74" /> give effect to that principle, though it might not be as complicated as this. It might be a person who retains possession after his contractual tenancy has ceased&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="LouisODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TheodoreMoore" hpid="Mr. Kingsmill Moore Mr. Kingsmill Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kingsmill Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  Senator O'Dea is making his own point, which, if I may say so with all respect, from the first time it was made was a bad one, and which has induced nothing but entirely fruitless cases and expenditure of money.  It has as far as I know&mdash;I speak subject to correction&mdash; never been so held by the court, but a lot of people have been induced, in order to make themselves more certain, to bring proceedings because of that.  Let us go back to what the origin of those Acts is.  The origin of those Acts is not to present entirely gratuitous biscuits to tenants.  The object of those Acts is to see that a person who is in a house and cannot get another should be preserved in the house in which he is, and should not be liable either to be thrown out by ejectment or to having his rent unwarrantably increased.  The service of the notice to quit puts an end to the common law tenancy, and provides for his rights to remain under the Act.  He cannot be put out because the Act prevents him from being put out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He cannot have his rent increased but, at the same time, and quite properly, he is not allowed to make a profit by selling a tenancy which is preserved to him merely for himself and his family, in order to save him from being put out into the street, or having his rent raised.  It was never the intention of the Act that the contract, as between a landlord and tenant, was a thing that could be varied from day to day.  Senator O'Dea seems to think that the tenant, when he did not want to live in the house any longer, could set it and put the profit in his own pocket instead of into the landlord's pocket, and it would seem that the reason he resists this amendment is that the tenant will not be able to pouch that profit, which will be profit properly accruing to the landlord. Now, quite frankly that is what I want <Col N="75" /> to stop.  I want to prevent the existence of any doubt, in the case of a person trying to keep on a crop of things like that in connection with his contractual obligations.  I imagine that Senator Ryan will agree with that.  He may not agree with the draftsmanship of the amendment.  It is frightfully difficult to modify such matters by draftsmanship, but what we want is to make things clear, so that people such as Senator O'Dea may not be able to assert things which I believe to have been fundamentally wrong since the date of the 1923 Act, and which, if I may use the phrase, has &ldquo;codded&rdquo; a lot of people.</P>

If the contract had gone, then there would be no contract other than by virtue of this Act, and why should the tenant be allowed to sell what is not his own?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment was suggested by the fact that it seems to be desirable, if at <Col N="77" /> all possible, to get some base line from which increases of rent should operate. I made a search to-day to see if it were possible to find a building index, but I failed in the search.  Perhaps, if I had given more time to it, I might have got it.  I did, however, get some figures bearing on the cost of living.  As everybody knows, the cost of living rose from about 1914 onwards, and at a certain period, subsequent to 1919, it tended to fall.  Subsequent to that period it dipped down a bit, but it rose again from then onwards, and there would have been a considerable increase in the cost of living during the years 1917, 1918, 1919, and afterwards. I want to point out that the figures in connection with the cost of building would have followed that, and, in the absence of precise mathematical figures, I will venture to say that it did follow it, although, perhaps, not exactly. Houses that were built prior to 1918 were controlled, even though they were built at a higher cost, but houses built subsequent to that were not controlled until the 7th May, 1919&mdash;a date which has now been pushed forward, under the Bill, to 1944.</P>
    <P>Senators are familiar with my ideas about this rent restrictions business generally.  I think &ldquo;1919&rdquo; is a good average date, and that it would be desirable to follow that date as closely as possible.  I suggest in this amendment that the date, 7th May, 1941, should be deleted.  It is a pity to disturb confidence by what is proposed in the Bill, and to bring under control houses built up to 1919, seeing that for a considerable time the people interested were led to believe they would not be subject to control.  It is reasonable to take as the basic date what the amendment proposes instead of that in the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>Some Senators are anxious about houses being brought under control.  Nobody is bringing any houses under control in this Bill. What is being done in this Bill is to de-control houses that are now controlled. Prior to February, 1944, every house in the metropolitan area the valuation of which did not exceed £60 was controlled if it was built <Col N="78" /> before April, 1919.  The same applied to houses outside the metropolitan area if the valuation exceeded £25. That was the position.  It was very obvious to most people that there was going to be a racket in houses, and representations were made to the Government to step in to prevent that racket developing.  In 1940 some of my colleagues in the Dáil endeavoured to introduce a Bill for that purpose.  It was resisted and the Minister or the Government did nothing whatever until the tide commenced to rise against them, and they discovered they had to do something.  On February 1st, 1944&mdash;two years ago&mdash;the Government made an Emergency Powers Order, controlling every house, the valuation of which exceeded £60 in Dublin and Dún Laoghaire, and £40 elsewhere, no matter when built or when it would be built in future. There was no time limit.  There was not a word about time limit in the Emergency Powers Order of 1944. That Order was published on February 8th, 1944.  It is dated February 1st, 1944.  I want to make it perfectly clear to the House that that Order applies to houses already built, and to houses not yet built, for all time to come.  But some people got busy and began to tell the Minister that it was going to interfere with house building. I can assure him that it does not, and that there is no sense in the argument that it does interfere with house building.  The Government&mdash;not the Minister&mdash;on June 25th, 1945, made an amending Emergency Powers Order&mdash;15 months after the original Order&mdash;limiting the operation of the first Order to houses which had been constructed, or in the case of flats reconstructed, on or before February 8th, 1944.  That is now the law, so that Senator O'Reilly cannot talk about bringing houses under control.</P>

      <P>Quite so.  The emergency continues until both Houses of the Oireachtas pass a resolution declaring it at an end.  I want to make it clear that the houses we are dealing with are controlled, and that people in the City of Dublin have gone to the courts and got reductions in the rents in respect of houses built in 1942.  We got a copy of this Bill last autumn, some of the provisions of which, according to the first copy read in Dáil Eireann, applied to every house built on or before 8th February, 1944.  That is in the Bill which was approved of on Second Reading in Dáil Eireann, &ldquo;imposing restrictions on rents which might be charged in respect of houses built up to 8th February, 1944.&rdquo;  People have gone into the courts under the Emergency Powers Order and at the discretion of the courts got reductions in the rents.  What actually happened is that when that Bill was going through the Committee Stage in the Dáil a private Deputy got up and asked that the Bill should apply only to houses which were erected on or before 7th May, 1944.  Where he got that date from God only knows.  That happens to be the date of the Standstill Order. I do not know where the Deputy got the 7th May, 1944, from, but the Minister said: &ldquo;All right, I will accept that&rdquo;.  The Minister and the Deputy concerned are not very fast friends and they do not very often pass complimentary remarks about each other.  It occurs to me that the Minister wanted to curry favour.  When I tell the House that the Deputy in question was Deputy Dillon, they will understand. The Minister came along then and said: &ldquo;That is an excellent idea, I am adopting it.&rdquo;  Therefore, by that act he has taken away control&mdash;if we do not restore the original position&mdash;of houses in this city which have been controlled for the last few years.  I am suggesting that this House ought to restore the position as it was, and as it is now under the Order, and as the Minister originally intended it should be, when introducing it.  If I were to achieve what I have in mind, notwithstanding the nightmares of Senator O'Reilly, I suggest that the Bill should apply to houses, no matter when built, and to all houses being built so long as <Col N="80" /> there is a scarcity.  Senator O'Reilly spoke about a free market.  A free market in what?</P>

      <P>The Senator's remarks seem to be based on the assumption that this Bill must follow the Emergency Powers Order.  If that be the case, I should like to make it clear that I assume, when the Bill is passed, the Emergency Powers Order, as it affects matters in the Bill, ceases to exist.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">

      <P>I do not say for a moment that this Bill must follow any pattern. What I did say was that if we passed the Bill in the form in which it now stands, not to talk about going back to pre-historic times, we would be decontrolling houses.  I am asking the House to refuse to decontrol houses which are now controlled by Emergency Orders.  I said that if I were responsible for this Bill I would apply control to all houses, whether built in the past or in the future.  When we are told of the effect that this restriction will have on house-building, we must remember that, so far as the houses built after 7th May, 1941, are concerned, there is no yardstick by which the courts will determine the rent.  The court has, under Section 16 of this Bill, to fix the rent at whatever figure it considers reasonable.  If the Minister feels that the court is in any way restricted under Section 16 regarding the fixation of rents of houses rented after 7th May, 1941, I have no objection to the amending of Section 16 to make sure that the court will fix a rent which will be fair, having regard to all the circumstances.  In other words, I agree that it is unfair that, if a house cost £1,500 to build in 1943, the rent should be fixed on the same basis as if it cost £1,000 in 1938.  But the contrary is the fact.  I have been informed by people concerned with the building of houses that local authorities were receiving lower tenders in the City of Dublin for the building of houses in 1943 than in 1938.  The reason is simple enough.  In 1938, the best-equipped and biggest building firms were contracting for the building of hospitals and other institutions.  They would not touch a building scheme of small houses unless <Col N="81" /> they saw a very wide margin of profit &mdash;far beyond the usual margin.</P>
      <P>Once the building of those institutions ceased, the best-equipped builders in Dublin commenced to compete for the small houses and brought down the prices very substantially. One building contract was mentioned to me&mdash;a contract with the corporation&mdash;which showed, so far as my recollection serves me, that the lowest tender in 1938 was £650 as against £630 in 1943.  I am not basing my case on that.  If it can be shown that the cost of building in 1943 and up to the 8th February, 1944, was higher than it was in April, 1941, I am satisfied that there should be a new principle for determining the rent of the later houses. That is reasonable.  I urge this House not to permit the repeal of the provisions of the Emergency Powers Order which extends control to houses built between 7th May, 1941, and 8th February, 1944.  I do not imagine that anybody will take seriously the proposition of Senator O'Reilly that we should control no houses built after 1919.</P>

      <P>Senator Duffy referred to building costs in 1938 and 1943.  I know nothing of the contract to which he referred but, if the facts are as stated by him, the persons responsible for assessing the values appear to me to have been sadly lacking in their duty.  Let me take the figures for 1939 and 1944.  It is just as well that they should go on the records of the House.  For the years 1939 and 1944 respectively the cost of materials was as follows:&mdash; timber flooring, 23/- per square against 65/9; spruce standard, £33 12s. against £80; lead piping, 40/- against 54/6; cement, £3 per ton against 98/-; sand, 8/- against 12/6; plaster, 80/- against 150/-; lime, 55/- against 80/-; slates, £55 against £67 10s.  The figures for 1939 and 1944, in respect of the cost of labour, per hour, are as follows:&mdash; carpenters, 1/11¼ against 2/3¾; bricklayers, 1/11½ against 2/3½; plumbers, 2/0¼ against 2/4¼; painters, 1/10¾; against 2/2½; slaters, 1/11 against 2/3; builders labourers, 1/5 against 1/9.  If anybody comes in here and tells us that building costs have gone down since 1938&mdash;<Col N="82" /> I can give the figures for 1937 if anybody wants them&mdash;and bases an argument in regard to this Bill on that assertion, I do not think we ought to pay very much attention to that argument.</P>

      <P>It is true that Deputy Dillon tabled the amendment to which Senator Duffy referred.  I do not care who puts down an amendment.  If he makes a good case for it, I hope I shall always listen to that case and act having regard to the case made.  Undoubtedly, there was a case for going back to the earlier date.  Senator Sweetman has given the figures.  We were up against the position that there would be no more building for letting.  I did not know that anybody was building for letting at the time.  I did not think that the material was available.  Some material was available at very enhanced prices and certain builders told the Department that they were prepared to carry on if allowed a fair return on their money.  If they were to be restricted to the 1941 rent, they could not go on building as it would not give them a return.  Consequently, that amendment was accepted by me, even though it was tabled by Deputy Dillon.  I do not care who introduces an amendment. If Senator Duffy brings in an amendment which seems reasonable I shall take the same line with regard to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards Senator O'Reilly's point, there would have been no extension of the Rent Restrictions Act if landlords had been content with the rent they were getting in 1941, which I am quite satisfied was adequate.  It is true, a Senator Duffy stated, that the Government was pressed, time and again, to bring certain houses under control. Letters poured into the Department and I was several times questioned in the Dáil on the subject.  I waited until I was satisfied that there was an attempt at gross profiteering.  People with stabilised wages and salaries were being asked for increases of rent which could not be justified.  Therefore, I asked the Government to bring in an Emergency Powers Order preventing any increase of rent beyond <Col N="83" /> what it then stood at.  I was satisfied, after examination, that the rent then being received was adequate and was giving a fair return to those who were letting the houses.</P>
    <P>That was why the new houses were brought under control.  I think that practically everybody knows it was not done until the Government had to do it.  Naturally, we are well aware of the restrictive effect on building of these Acts, but the point is that houses would not be built because the material was not there.  There was a limited number of houses available and there was a big demand for them, and I have no doubt that what would happen was that people anxious to get into a house would offer to pay any price&mdash;that those in possession would be put out because they could not pay it and that those who came in would perhaps be unable to pay what they had contracted to pay.  We were not going to allow any section to profiteer if we could help it and that was the justification for extending control to houses not controlled under the 1923 Act.</P>

      <P>I made it clear that the question of the price of materials does not enter into this matter at all.  I suggested that the rents of houses erected after 7th May, 1941, under the Bill as introduced, would be fixed by the court without regard to any basic figure.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister remembers the point I made.  I was willing to have Section 16 amended to enable the court to say what was a fair rent in respect of houses built after 7th May, 1941.  I am prepared to agree to an amendment of the section to leave it to the court.  If the Land Courts could fix a fair rent for 12,000,000 acres of Irish land, surely a fair rent can be fixed for the few hundred houses built between 7th May, 1941, and 8th February, 1944.  All I am asking is that control be maintained.  I am not even proposing to bring one new house <Col N="84" /> under control.  I am asking that the existing control be maintained and that the Minister will make provision to give the court the widest power to use its discretion in determining what is a fair rent in respect of these houses.</P>
      <P>Let me give the Minister one instance which came to my notice last week.  It is the case of a widow and a couple of young children in the City of Dublin who lived in a house for which she was paying 19/6 per week.  She was unable to pay the rent and she was dispossessed. The property owners, apparently not desiring to appear as extortioners in the public eye, transferred the nominal ownership of the house to a member of their staff, who then offered the house for letting at 25/- a week.  The house was built in 1942, but, when built in 1942, it was let at 19/6 a week, and, in 1945, it was let at 25/- a week.  The tenant in question went into court on the basis of the Emergency Powers Order and the judge, with great reluctance, reduced the rent by 1/6 a week and made the strange decision with regard to costs that both sides would bear their own costs.  As a last taunt, he said to the successful tenant: &ldquo;I think that when you have paid solicitor and counsel, you will not make much out of the reduction&rdquo;.  That is what we are up against now, and I am still prepared to say that judges of that mentality are to be free to fix a fair rent for the houses brought under control.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>With all respect, I am not criticising.  I am stating a fact, and saying that, notwithstanding that, what I am proposing is that a judge will have a free hand to fix a fair rent in respect of the houses built after 7th May, 1941, and up to 8th February, 1944.  I urge the Minister very strongly, unless he wants to face a tidal wave of criticism and anger in the City of Dublin, to maintain the existing position.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister give any indication of the approximate number of houses built after 1941 which are let in rent?  I cannot imagine any <Col N="85" /> sane man ever letting a house in rent with the present tendency of legislation. Surely the bulk of the houses built since 1941 have been sold, and I feel sure that, if Senator Duffy had a house, he would be very loath to rent it, that he would do what any sensible man would do, that is, sell it.</P>
      <P>That brings me to a very important principle involved in this legislation. Does the Government not realise the importance of having houses to rent? How are the large bulk of moderate-salaried workers ever to get accommodation unless there is freedom in the renting of houses?  At present their only alternative is to borrow and buy a house, and when they move, as they may have to, to run the risk of selling or letting that house at a loss.  It should be recognised as a matter of public policy that the renting of houses is a real demand for service from the community and it should be always borne in mind in legislation of this character.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one point I want to mention in reply to Senator Duffy's remarks.  I have made out the average cost-of-living figure from 1939 to 1945 and I find that, in 1939, the figure, in round numbers, was 178.  In 1940, it jumped to 205; in <Col N="86" /> 1941, it was 226; in 1942, it was 250; in 1943, it was 282; in 1944, it was 295; and in 1945, 295.  That cost-of-living figure certainly affected the people whose main income is derived from houses, and that aspect, I suggest, should be considered.  If we adopted a plan somewhat similar to that adopted on the other side, where roughly £200,000,000 was given by way of subsidy to keep down the cost of living, there could be no grievance on the part of owners.  In fact, in order to facilitate tenants in getting their houses, these subsidies should have been applied to rents just as they were to foodstuffs in a small way in this country and in a large way on the other side.  I am merely pleading all the time for equal justice.</P>
