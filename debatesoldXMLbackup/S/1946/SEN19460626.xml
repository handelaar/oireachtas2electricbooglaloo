      <P>I intend to refer to certain matters arising out of this excess corporation profits tax on the Final Stage but I would ask the Minister to consider this rather limited aspect of the case now.  I think it is very important to have some indication for future guidance to show under what general categories this excess corporation profits tax has arisen.  I do not imagine, even though some was due, that very much has been paid by the agricultural community but I think it is necessary that the public and that students should know under what main categories it has arisen.  I hope the Revenue Commissioners when they prepare their report covering this period will set out these categories under general headings, stating so much for the manufacturer, possibly divided into main groups such as textiles, so much for wholesalers, so much for retailers, sub-divided under appropriate headings.  It is most important to have this information, as this tax is staggering in volume and it casts a very disquieting light on what went on and the profits made under <Col N="3" /> conditions of scarcity during the war. Perhaps the Minister would consider conveying to the Revenue Commissioners a request for information on those lines in their annual report.</P>

      <P>The suggestion which the Senator makes will be examined.  The receipts from excess corporation profits tax have never been reported by the Revenue Commissioners in the form of categories and I can see that there would be a lot of duplication as between wholesalers, retailers and manufacturers.  A person who is a manufacturer may be a wholesaler and retailer at the same time.  It would be difficult to set out the various categories in absolutely watertight compartments. However I will have the Senator's suggestion examined.</P>

      <P>May I point out that any figures on the lines suggested by Senator Sir John Keane would be completely misleading?  In the case of a multiple store selling every conceivable kind of article, they may have made the profits out of luxuries or may have made them out of necessities.  In the case of such stores, they do not usually calculate the profits on specific classes of goods.  It would be absolutely impossible to get any kind of figure which could be relied upon for statistical purposes.</P>

In my opinion, as a member of a local authority, this provision of a Transition Development Fund, taken in conjunction with the statement of the Minister that money would be made available <Col N="4" /> for, say, housing at 2½ per cent. for a period up to 50 years, is one of the greatest steps taken to solve the housing problem.

      <P>On behalf of Senator Kingsmill Moore I move Recommendation No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 21, that all words after the word &ldquo;remain&rdquo; in line 16 down to and inclusive of the word &ldquo;shorter&rdquo; in line 18 be deleted and that the following words be substituted instead:&mdash;&ldquo;until the first opportunity when he can be brought before a judge of the High Court to abide such further order as such judge may be pleased to make.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Senator Kingsmill Moore asked me to move this recommendation because he is delayed on a case in the courts and finds it impossible to get here in time. While it is not my recommendation and, not being a lawyer, I cannot deal with the exact wording in it, I am in agreement with him in regard to the principle which seems to be raised.  It appears to me that under Section 27, to which this schedule relates, if the Revenue Commissioners decide&mdash;and no one has questioned that, in certain cases, it is right and proper they should so decide&mdash;to take a case to the courts in an endeavour to secure payment of income-tax or other tax, then the effect of the section, plus the wording of this schedule as it stands, is that the courts have no option.  If they are satisfied that the tax is properly due, and if this becomes the law, they must make an order in this form.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The effect of an order in this form is that, if the sheriff is unable to obtain goods, the man must be put in jail, irrespective of whether he can pay or not.  In dealing with this, the Minister said that the Revenue Commissioners would never press a person or take him to the courts if they were satisfied that he could not pay in fact.  I have no doubt that that is correct, but I suggest <Col N="5" /> that they cannot be absolutely certain. If they take him to the courts, it means they believe he can pay and if, on attempting to seize goods, it turns out impossible, then&mdash;if I understand Senator Kingsmill Moore's proposal correctly&mdash;it is desired in this recommendation to provide that the man may be taken to prison to await a decision of the court as to whether he should stay there or not.  That seems to be a far more reasonable and a far wiser practice than that existing at present.</P>
    <P>I am not a lawyer and I am not perfectly certain, but I understand that this particular schedule does not and is not intended to make any change in the existing law, except in the wording of certain orders, which are now to be worded in a way which the Minister for Finance presumably prefers.  This is an opportunity&mdash;if I am right and there is no change in principle here; and the Minister may correct me if I am wrong here&mdash;to make a change where there should be a change.  Along with many other things, I myself am much interested in prison reform and alterations in prison law and I am particularly interested in an Act passed by the British Parliament in 1930, I think, which changes the law considerably with regard to money payments and justices' procedure.  I think the effect there is that the court will only commit a person to prison for non-payment, either of tax or even of debts, after careful inquiry and being perfectly satisfied that the person could pay.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this recommendation is to raise the principle involved. It is not an attempt to claim that the provisions in the Bill effect a change in the law.  The Minister did not explain in any great detail&mdash;unless he did so when I was not present&mdash;exactly why this change is made in the form of the Order.  He said it was to substitute a more modern form for some archaic form and I am sure that is all the explanation necessary.  If there is something else there, I do not know of it and I am assuming there is nothing else there.  By this recommendation, we are raising this principle on the first occasion on which we have had an opportunity to raise it.</P>

      <P>I am sorry that Senator Kingsmill Moore was not here to move his recommendation, as Senator Douglas is naturally at a disadvantage in stating its purpose to the House.  I am also sorry that this schedule has been introduced into the Bill, as the proper place to introduce the form of execution order given in the Third Schedule would be into the Rules of Court.</P>
      <P>Now, at the present time the Rules of Court are being revised and brought up to date.  I assume that the form of execution order set out at form No. 37 in Schedule &ldquo;N&rdquo; of the Rules of the Supreme Court (Ireland), 1905, would be brought up to date by the Rules Committee.  However, apparently, the Revenue Commissioners feel that there is some urgency which requires that this form of execution order should be introduced into the Finance Act of this year.  Now, while I have said that, I feel that there is no substance in the amendment which has been moved on behalf of Senator Kingsmill Moore by Senator Douglas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the old common law when a plaintiff recovered a judgment for debt or damages against a defendant that judgment could not be executed against the person of the defendant unless the judgment was for a debt due to the Crown in which case the Crown had the right to seize the body of the debtor and keep him in prison until he had satisfied such debt.  Under the old common law, in the ordinary course of events, neither the person of the debtor nor the debtor's land could be taken in execution.  One of the oldest writs of execution was the writ of <i>Levari Facias</i> which is mentioned in Section 27 (1) of this Bill.  Now, there has been a great deal of confusion as to the meaning of that writ. It has been believed that the writ of <i>Levari Facias</i> was a writ for the purpose of taking in execution the body of the debtor.  It was no such thing. The words &ldquo;<i>Levari Facias</i>&rdquo; occur in this writ and mean &ldquo;cause to be levied&rdquo;.  In the old days, as I say, lands could not be taken in execution, and, therefore, in order to satisfy the judgement debt this writ of <i>Levari Facias</i> empowered the sheriff to levy <Col N="7" /> the fruits of the land, such as growing corn and other produce, the soil excepted, and also the goods and chattels of the debtor.  In addition to that writ, there was a writ known as <i>Fieri Facias</i>, commonly known to-day as a writ of <i>Fi Fa.</i>  The words <i>Fieri Facias</i> mean &ldquo;cause to be made of&rdquo;, so that the writ empowered the sheriff to cause to be made out of the goods and chattels of the judgement debtor the sum due by him.</P>
    <P>Now, in 1285 a new writ called a writ of <i>elegit</i>, was made under which a judgment creditor had the option or election of taking half the lands of the judgment debtor.  In other words, it entitled the judgment creditor to go into possession and take the profits of the lands until the judgment debt was satisfied.  From 1285 the writ of <i>Levari Facias</i> appears to have fallen into disuse.  Blackstone wrote in 1765 that it was in a sense practically obsolete having been superseded by the writ of <i>elegit</i> and so obsolete had the writ of <i>Levari Facias</i> become that under the Bankruptcy Act of 1883 Section 146 (2) it was enacted that the writ of <i>Levari Facias</i> should no longer issue in civil cases.  Of course that did not prevent the writ of <i>Levari Facias</i> issuing in criminal cases, nor did it prevent the writ of <i>Levari Facias</i> issuing in Ireland which, of course, was not bound by the Bankruptcy Act of 1883 as that Act only applied to England.</P>
    <P>Early in the last century the writ of <i>Levari Facias</i> was issued by the High Court in London to recover a fine of £50 which had been imposed by justices and which on appeal was confirmed by the High Court.  When the sheriff tried to levy the rents and profits and the goods and chattels of the debtor, he failed to recover the full amount of £50.  I think he only recovered £30.  Another writ of <i>Levari Facias</i> was then issued to recover the balance of the £50, but only £10 was recovered, so a writ of <i>capias ad satisfaciendum</i> was then issued for the arrest of the judgment debtor.</P>
    <P>In 1905, when our Rules of Court were being revised, the Revenue Rules of 1860 were introduced into our rules in a more or less modified form and this <Col N="8" /> so-called writ of <i>Levari Facias</i> was thus introduced into Schedule N of the Rules of 1905.  Although called a writ of <i>Levari Facias</i> it was not in the proper sense a writ of <i>Levari Facias</i> because only the first part of the writ was a writ to levy on the goods and chattels of the debtor and the rents of his lands.  The second part of the writ which corresponds to the portion of the Order here which Senator Kingsmill Moore would desire to amend, required that the debtor should be brought before the High Court to abide by whatever order the judges should make.  Hence while it was called the writ of <i>Levari Facias</i> it was partly a writ of <i>Levari Facias</i> and partly a writ of <i>capias ad satisfaciendum.</i></P>
    <P>That so-called &ldquo;Writ of Levari&rdquo; of course appears in the Rules of Court in a very archaic form.  I am not going to weary the House by going through it.  There is a lot of old legal jargon which very few people except lawyers with a knowledge of the history of law would understand.</P>
    <P>Now, to come down to realities it was always the prerogative of the Crown in England to arrest a person who failed to pay what was known as a Crown debt.  That has been the law from time immemorial.  In 1869 an Act was passed in England called the Debtors Act which abolished imprisonment for debt.  It was held in England that that Act did not affect Crown debts because the Crown is not bound by an Act of Parliament unless it is expressly mentioned in it.  A corresponding Act was passed for Ireland which was called the Debtors (Ireland) Act of 1872 which abolished imprisonment for debt in this country.  It contained a proviso that a person could be imprisoned for debt if he had the means and refused to pay.  Now, when the Treaty was passed and when the Constitution of Saorstát Eireann was enacted all that law was carried over to the Free State under Article 73 of the 1922 Constitution.  Under the Finance Act, 1924, Section 38, sub-section (2), it was enacted that &ldquo;moneys due or payable to or for the benefit of the Central Fund shall have and be deemed always to have had attached to them all such rights, privileges and priorities as have heretofore attached to debts <Col N="9" /> due to the Crown.&rdquo;  By Statute of the Oireachtas, therefore, all the rights attaching to a debt due to the Crown attached and continue to attach to debts due to the Minister for Finance for the benefit of the Central Fund.  The right to arrest for debt due to the Crown was re-enacted here and inures for the benefit of the State.</P>
    <P>Under the Courts of Justice Act, 1925, jurisdiction was given to the District Court to try cases where claims were made by the State against persons for debts of £25 and under.  Rules of Court were made under the Courts of Justice Act; 1924, and under Rule 85 of the Rules of the District Court, it was provided as follows: &ldquo;In proceedings for the recovery of any tax or duty under the management of the Revenue Commissioners, the civil process shall state the nature of the claim and the amount of the claim to be due in respect thereof.  The decree in such cases shall be in accordance with such modification of form XX in the second part of the First Schedule as may be suitable.&rdquo;  When we come to the second part of the First Schedule to these Rules, we see the form of execution order.  It empowers the sheriff to seize the goods of the debtor in respect of a debt of less than £25 to the State and it provides in much the same way as the Third Schedule provides here that if the sheriff should fail to levy the full amount, then he will hand the decree to a member of the Gárda Síochána, who shall with all due expedition arrest and convey the defendant to the nearest prison and there deliver the defendant so arrested to the governor of such prison, there to remain and be kept by such governor until satisfaction be made of such debt.  This Rule of Court provides that if a person who owes a debt of less than £25 to the State should be decreed in the District Court and if he did nothing to satisfy the debt then he should be taken to prison and detained there until the debt should be satisfied&mdash;perhaps detained indefinitely. That Rule of Court was expressly approved by this House by resolution on the 22nd July, 1926, as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That the Seanad hereby approves of the District Court Rules made by <Col N="10" /> the Minister for Justice on the 9th day of July, 1926, under Section 91 of the Courts of Justice Act, 1924 (No. 10 of 1924), with the exception of Rules 20, 24, 36, 95, 171 and 180.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I do not know whether Senator Douglas was a member of the Seanad in 1926, but if he was a member then this House expressly approved of this form of execution order designed to deal with what I might describe as small debtors to the State.</P>
    <P>In 1929 the validity of that execution order was tested in the courts. It appears that a man named Brennock who was a van-driver, owed about £18 15s 6d. for income-tax.  He was sued in the District Court by a collector named McGinty on behalf of the Minister for Finance, and the case is reported in the 1929 Irish Reports, page 177.  There was no appearance for the defendant in the District Court and the District Justice at that time felt that a great onus had been pressed on the District Court, namely, of issuing an order to arrest and put into prison a debtor for a sum which was within the jurisdiction of the District Court.  He stated a case for the opinion of the High Court on the whole question.  Unfortunately, however, Mr. Brennock did not appear in either the District Court or the High Court so that when the matter came before the High Court it was a one-sided argument.  Counsel for the Revenue Commissioners, however, put all the facts and law before the court. The court at that time consisted of the President of the High Court (Mr. Justice Sullivan), Mr. Justice Hanna and Mr. Justice O'Byrne, and there was a very full hearing, at which, of course, only one side was represented. The President of the High Court said at page 186:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I am of opinion that debts due to the Revenue Commissioners have attached to them the rights and privileges formerly attached to debts due to the Crown.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We find then that that principle was reiterated by the High Court in 1929. That being the position under Section 11 of the Finance Act, 1924, power is given to sue in the Circuit Court for sums under £300 due to the State in <Col N="11" /> respect of taxes and under Section 169 of the Income Tax Act, 1918, any sum may be recovered in the High Court. Therefore, the position now is that debts due for income-tax may be sued for and recovered in the District Court, the Circuit Court and the High Court.</P>
    <P>There is a form of execution order for decrees given in the District Courts and that is authorised by Rule 85 of the District Court Rules, but there is no such form of execution order at present in force for the Circuit Court and the form of execution in force in respect of the High Court is archaic and out of date.</P>
    <P>The position then is that it will be generally agreed that persons who are unable to pay a debt should not be imprisoned.  The days of imprisonment for debt are over, but the power of the State to imprison for debt still remains. That is a very important power and that is the power which is placed in the hands of the Revenue Commissioners. Under this Schedule, however, this form of execution order&mdash; under Section 27, sub-section (2), will only be issued if the complainant or informant so requires.  Therefore the complainant, the collector or the Attorney-General, as the case may be, will have the option as to whether this form of execution order will issue or not.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the power given by this Act to the Revenue Commissioners will not be abused.  I have not before me at the moment particulars of the estimates for income-tax over the last few years and the details of the yield.  I think on the whole the yield has been satisfactory and this has been achieved without machinery in the form of this execution order.  I think the majority of the people in this country have paid their income-tax and that there are very few defaulters.</P>
    <P>Income-tax is a tax which oppresses different people in different ways.  It oppresses the civil servant because it is taken from him before he gets it, so to speak.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the system of taxation which requires that income-tax for this year be assessed on the income of last year, it is quite possible that some people may be unable to pay because of circumstances which have arisen in the meantime.  The taxpayer may have had a bout of sickness or may have suffered some ill fortune. In such a case, it would certainly be a hardship and a cruelty to put the taxpayer into prison.  I am satisfied that the Revenue Commissioners will use this power wisely.  If they were to use it widely, there would not be sufficient prisons to hold all the defaulters after the receipt of the white notice or even the red notice.  I am satisfied that the Revenue Commissioners require this power and will use it only in very exceptional circumstances. I do not think that any person here or elsewhere has sympathy with tax evaders or people who do not wish to pay their fair share of taxation.  If they do not pay their fair share and if they incur fines or penalties, very few will have any sympathy with them.  It should be noted that, in the form of execution order scheduled to the District Court Rules, 1926, it is provided that a person shall be detained in prison until he satisfies the debt.  In the form of execution order in the Schedule to this Bill, it is provided that he shall be detained for not more than six months.  That was brought about by the enactment of Section 18 of the Finance Act, 1943, which reduced the period of imprisonment for non-payment of tax or duty to a maximum of six months.  Therefore, I am of opinion that this is a power the State should have to deal with exceptional cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We read of certain racketeers and gangsters across the ocean being committed to prison for non-payment of tax.  Now that our air services are so efficient, it may be that some people in this country will endeavour to move to some other country and leave <Col N="13" /> behind a legacy of debt to the State. This is a very useful power in the case of such people.</P>
    <P>The Revenue Commissioners have also power under Section 165 of the Income Tax Act to arrest, or cause to be arrested, any person who neglects or defaults in the payment of income-tax. For those reasons, I think that the amendment should not be pressed. A good case can be made for the provision in the Bill, though I should have preferred that the Revenue Commissioners had waited until the new Rules of Court would be available.  Then, the matter could be discussed, perhaps, in a more academic atmosphere amongst lawyers.  The Oireachtas is not a place for what I may call technical detail. As the Revenue Commissioners evidently require this power, I am prepared to give it to them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>In spite of the fact that Senator Ryan thinks that this is not a place for technical detail, he has given us a great deal of technical detail. Speaking for myself, I found it very interesting and I am very grateful to him for it.  He made it quite clear that this schedule, which is a form of execution order, is not, in fact, new, that it simply carries over power to the State which always reposed in the Crown.  The State is, of course, heir to the powers of the Crown.  There are two questions which I should like to ask in regard to this matter.  As Senator Ryan has pointed out so clearly, this is really a new rule of court and it might have been left over for the rule-making authority.  It certainly should have been submitted to the President of the High Court who is, I think, the proper authority in this regard.  Before the Rules of Court are changed, as they are being changed by this schedule, there should be consultation with the proper judicial authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the second place, I am inclined to agree with Senator Ryan that the Revenue Commissioners will not go around seeking to put citizens in jail for non-payment of income-tax.  That would be a very expensive method of dealing with income-tax defaulters and I think that the Revenue Commissioners know a trick or two better than <Col N="14" /> that.  I wonder if the Minister has figures for the last financial year, 1945/6, or any recent financial year, to show how many people have been arrested under this provision or any similar provision.  It is probable that very few have been so arrested.</P>
    <P>In any event, the six months' period is the maximum period, as Senator Ryan has pointed out, and there is the question of the exercise of the prerogative of the Crown which descends to the Minister.  That would reduce the period to some time short of six months.  If we knew whether the President of the High Court, or whoever is the proper judicial authority, had been consulted regarding this change, and if we knew the number of arrests which have taken place under such provisions as this, we should be in a position to come to a determination on this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LouisODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I was very glad to hear the history of legislation dealing with imprisonment from Senator Ryan.  It has been the policy of Legislatures to do away with imprisonment for debt unless the debtor is able and unwilling to pay.  I do not like the form in this schedule.  It authorises the sheriff to go out and look for the goods of the debtor.  If he cannot find sufficient goods, he is bound to issue a certificate to the Commissioner of the Gárda Síochána.  The Commissioner is then commanded to take the taxpayer into custody and keep him in custody until the debt is paid or until the period of six months expires.  Once an order is issued for seizure, I do not see any option.  If, after the order for seizure is issued, sufficient goods are not found, the sheriff must give a certificate to the Gárda Síochána and the man must be arrested and kept in prison until he pays the debt or until the expiration of six months.  I should rather see this matter left over, if the Minister could see his way to do so, and dealt with as one of the new Rules of Court.  Possibly, it would be worded differently. If that course cannot be adopted, I should like to see the amendment, or something in the nature of the amendment, considered by the Minister either now or on the Report Stage.  If a man <Col N="15" /> who cannot pay is arrested, it is a hardship if he cannot go before a court.</P>
      <P>I should like to see some little improvement in the amendment.  I do not know whether the statement, &ldquo;when he can be brought before a judge of the High Court&rdquo;, means that the commissioners must bring him or that he can bring himself.  There should be some method by which he can be brought before the court.  It is unfair to imprison a man unless he is wilfully evading his responsibilities.  If he is, nobody can have any sympathy with him.  If he is brought before the court the court will be able to determine whether he is or is not evading his responsibilities.  If the court holds that he is evading his responsibilities they will leave him in jail for the six months.  If they find that he is not, say, that he has spent his money and has none left, they will order his release. If he made £3,000 the year before last and had a loss the following year, there is an execution order for the tax on £3,000 although he had a loss the subsequent year and he would find it very hard to pay up.  I think myself that it is the very best type of citizen who spends what he earns.  I do not think the best people are those who save up all the money they earn. I think people who spend do a great deal more good for the time being.  I, therefore, would have a good deal of sympathy with the debtor if he were not wilfully evading his responsibilities.</P>
      <P>I should like to see two forms of certificates, one being a form to seize the goods, and no more.  Then if the sheriff reports back that he cannot find the goods, that he believes, for example, that the debtor has transferred them somewhere else or is hiding them or that he believes that the debtor has money and is hiding it, then a certificate could be issued for his arrest and he could be imprisoned.  If that happens, it would leave a great deal of discretion in the hands of the commissioners.  I am sure they would not exercise it unfairly.  It would be a better system than this complicated system of having one warrant for levy and one warrant for seizure of the body.</P>

      <P>I am very grateful to Senator Ryan for his exposition of the genesis of this particular form of execution order.  He has explained very clearly how it arose and the state of the law to-day regarding the matter.  He has pointed out that although the State inherited from the British Crown and the British State the right to imprison for debt due to itself, this State put a limit on the time for which a man could be imprisoned for such debt.</P>
      <P>I do not think there is any limit in regard to debts due to the State in England.  Senators are naturally worried as to how often this particular writ of execution would be put into effect and how often an income-tax payer could be put into prison, if the Oireachtas approves of it.  During the last seven years, from 1938 to 1945, I suppose there were almost 1,000,000 assessments made by the Revenue Commissioners.  They had powers of imprisonment.  They had power to go to the District Court and, as Senator Ryan pointed out, they had also power to put a man in prison without going to the court but, all told, out of all the people on whom those 1,000,000 assessments were made, five income-tax payers went to jail.  Arrests were authorised actually in 38 cases but I suppose the money came along when arrest was ordered and eventually only five income-tax payers had to be put in prison.  I do not suppose if we make this particular form of execution order the standard form for the High Court, that there will be any greater percentage of defaulters in the future than in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Ryan pointed out that the particular form, which we are asking the Oireachtas to approve for the High Court, has been the form for the District Court for almost the last 20 years.  He has pointed out that that particular form came under the review of the High Court in 1929 and that the Revenue Commissioners were upheld by the High Court in the action for which they sought approval.  The High Court at that time had actually before them that Form XX which was a rule of court for the District Court.  &ldquo;In my opinion,&rdquo; said Mr. Justice Sullivan, &ldquo;the district justices have power to <Col N="17" /> make a decree in this case in accordance with Form XX.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>One question involved in this is why we are not doing this by rule of court rather than by Act of Parliament.  A doubt arises as to whether we should approach the rule-making authority for the higher courts and ask them to make the same rule of court as has been made for the District Courts.  Somebody raised a doubt as to whether the rule-making authority for the higher courts had power to do it.  It seems always to be the function of lawyers to raise doubts but it is the function of poor politicians to resolve them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>Sometimes we do fairly well.  I was saying that it had not been made a rule for the higher courts, but it was made a rule for the lower courts. It came before the High Court in 1929 and Mr. Justice Sullivan is reported in the Irish Reports of 1929, page 182, as saying:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Form XX in the second part of that schedule authorises the arrest and imprisonment of the defendant should his goods when seized by the under-sheriff prove insufficient to satisfy the amount of the decree, with costs and expenses.  I am of opinion that, as debts due to the Revenue Commissioners have attached to them the rights and privileges that formerly attached to debts due to the Crown, and as the District Court has jurisdiction in proceedings to recover such debts when not exceeding £25, the rule-making authority have power to make the rule and form in question, and that the same are <i>intra vires</i> and valid. It follows that, in my opinion, the district justices had powers to make the decree in this case, in accordance with Form XX of Part II of the First Schedule to the District Court Rules. The question asked by the district justice should, therefore, be answered in the affirmative.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other judges agreed with Judge Sullivan in that judgment. However, although the High Court said that the rule-making authority for the District <Col N="18" /> Court has power to make the rule and form in question, a doubt has been raised as to whether the rule-making authority for the higher courts has that power and authority, so we are asking the Oireachtas to make this order.</P>
    <P>Of course, I hope that there will be no necessity for the Revenue Commissioners to put this particular writ of execution into effect, but it is of the utmost importance that the State should have the power to enforce the collection of debts due to the State. If one individual can effectively deny the right of the State to collect taxes due by him, then, naturally, every other citizen will have a grievance if forced to pay.  The best thing to do is to stop any such tendency before it becomes a general one.  By and large, the people of this State have paid up their taxes very well and the Revenue Commissioners have had to go to extremes in only five cases during the last seven years.  I think that is a good record and I hope they will not have to go to any further extreme in future.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Dea raised a question as to whether, instead of having one form, we should have two, that is, first of all that there should be a form which gave the sheriff power to distrain goods and then report back to the court for authority to seize the defaulter if no seizeable goods were available and the court were satisfied that he had the money.  Actually, the Revenue Commissioners have the power to distrain without going near any court and it is only in rather large cases that they would go to the court to get specific authority for seizure. If a defaulter owes a sum to the Revenue Commissioners under £25, they have power at the moment to go to the District Court and get from the district justice a writ directing the officers of the State to look for the goods and if they cannot get the goods to take the person and put him into jail.  We are asking for exactly the same sort of form and all that is being done here is to have the same modern form for the higher courts so that, when a man owes more than £25, the tax collectors can take the defaulter before the higher court and get exactly the same sort of writ returned against <Col N="19" /> him&mdash;power to search for the goods and if they cannot get the goods to take the person.  All that is happening by this legislation going through is to put the man who owes more than £25 in exactly the same position as the man who owes less than £25.  As Senators are aware, if a man owes over £25 he cannot be taken before the District Court.</P>
    <P>From every point of view, I think it is necessary to have this particular form of writ.  The Revenue Commissioners have convinced me about it.  I went into the matter very thoroughly and I am satisfied that, if we are to have an orderly collection of debts due to the State, this particular form is necessary, or at least is very desirable. As Senator Ryan pointed out, it is not altogether necessary, as without going near any court at all the special commissioners, under Section 165 of the Act of 1918, have power to direct, by a warrant under their hands and seal, that a defaulter should be committed to prison and kept without bail until payment be made.  Instead of operating that power of acting without going to the court, we want this particular form of order which the High Court will make when approached by the Revenue Commissioners and when it is proved before the court that the debt is lawfully due to the State.</P>

      <P>I am glad I moved this recommendation, though it is not my own, as we have had a very useful discussion and have heard the interesting historical points made by Senator Ryan and also those in the speech by the Minister.  One of the things I have watched with very great interest in the last 20 years is how conservative people can be when they become Ministers, how much respect they have for the laws passed in Great Britain in the past, how they are always ready to justify anything by explaining that it really is the same as what was there before, with a very slight difference.  I would probably act in the same way if I were Minister&mdash;which, thank God, I never will be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am in agreement with the views expressed by Senator O'Dea, who has put them better than I could express <Col N="20" /> them.  When we are going to the trouble of doing this, it is better to deal with the actuality.  The Minister himself has said that no one ought to be put in jail until it is perfectly certain that he could pay.  Apparently, there is general agreement on that and, much though I admire the conservatism, I think that we should bring the laws into ordinary commonsense phrases in which we could understand them, without the great number of Latin phrases&mdash;the various classes of writs&mdash;which Senator Ryan mentioned.  I cannot remember a quarter of them, but I have nothing but admiration for the way in which Senator Ryan was able to rattle them off.  I was very pleased indeed to find a lawyer like Senator O'Dea agreeing with me in favour of simplicity.</P>
    <P>Obviously, there is no object in pressing this recommendation though there was no harm in having introduced it.  There was one point which Senator Hayes raised and which Senator Kingsmill Moore wished to raise, but I forgot it, as I spoke at very short notice and without much preparation.  He was anxious to know whether the proper judicial authority had been consulted.  I understand from the Minister that they were consulted and they were doubtful if they had the power to make rules in this way.  I think that is an important point. I would be rather interested to know, in relation to the 38, five of whom went to jail, the others having paid, whether it was the relatives who paid.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>On that question, I make no apology for referring, once again, to the very present danger of inflation.  Frankly, I was not reassured by the Minister's attitude towards this matter by what he said on the Second Reading.  He said, in effect: &ldquo;I have committed no offence against orthodox monetary control over inflation; I have not borrowed from the banks and I have not printed notes,&rdquo; but surely the story does not end there.  The statistics show that there is a very marked danger of inflation.  My point is that the Government are to blame if they do not take every step possible to prevent a rise in the cost of living. I propose to show that they have not taken every step that might have been taken to do that.  Take the question of the return from money received from excess corporation profits tax. As compared with pre-war, the sum taken in excess corporation profits tax is, roughly speaking, £4,000,000 in 1945.</P>
      <P>If that represents only 50 per cent. of the increased profits, I say that £8,000,000 has been taken out of the pockets of consumers in the form of increased profits in the year 1945 as compared with the pre-war period, because, roughly, that is what excess corporation profits taxes are. No doubt there are certain variations in the standard of profits allowed, but, as a generalisation, excess profits are profits in excess of those earned before the emergency. My point is that in 1945 these had reached the alarming sum of £8,000,000, and that sum has been taken out of the profits of the public on a scarcity market.  To that extent, it has materially contributed to the increased cost of living.  We see there a definite indication of the source of inflation. My point is that the Government have been ineffectual in preventing it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister may say that price control has nothing to do with his Department. I have no doubt that manufacturers would say that there has been a most irksome form of price control. If there has been price control, it has not been effective in keeping prices down in the way that the ordinary consumer would wish.  We cannot, I suppose, undo what has happened in the past, but it is no answer <Col N="22" /> for the Minister to say that he has taken £4,000,000 in increased profits, and that he has given it back in the form of reliefs.  I suggest that there has been a very inequitable distribution of the burden.  Of course, the way to do it would be to take steps to avoid these increases, because every increase in the price level causes a whole host of troubles.  It causes labour unrest, it causes great hardship to rentiers and to the ordinary people living on fixed incomes.  It means the setting up of various kinds of tribunals, so that it is no answer for the Minister to say that he is giving back these increased profits in the form of reliefs.  It may be asked, what bearing this has on the past, and what is the good of <i>post mortems</i>?  I say that it has every good as a warning for the future.  I say that because I feel that this inflation may, at any moment, gain most dangerous proportions.  We cannot, and the Minister cannot, merely be satisfied that he has committed no offence against purely monetary orthodoxy.  I admit that he has not committed any offence against that very limited aspect of inflation.</P>
    <P>The statistics show what a real danger there is.  Why, even the legal tender in circulation has risen in three years by, roughly, £14,000,000, while the purchasing power in the hands of the banks has risen by a very marked amount.  All that takes the form of purchasing power and has a bearing on the scarcity of goods.  Until the scarcity of goods has passed, until we can see ample supplies of fresh commodity goods coming forward, I think that the Minister should hesitate to give these reliefs except to those with low fixed incomes.  I think there is great danger in promising to remove the excess corporation profits tax as from the first of next year except in so far as these excess profits are used in capital development.  That would be right and proper.  But, are we sure that all those people who have made excess profits are in need of this money for capital development?  Some of them are retailers.  Presumably, they are non-manufacturers whose need for fresh capital development is small, if not possibly non-existent.  I should prefer to see the Minister keeping the excess <Col N="23" /> profits tax for the present, taking it all and setting it to the credit of taxpayers who can prove that they require money for deferred maintenance or capital development.  Substantial sums should be held to their credit until the occasion arose for such expenditure. That, in my opinion, would be a very effective way of checking, from that quarter, the dangers of inflation.  Mind you, the danger of inflation is a nightmare. Manufacturers may be happy enough about it since they can pass on its effects to the consumers.  The Labour Party may be happy enough about it because through their power they can get increases in the wage level.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that is coming off.  I have a certain amount of sympathy with Senator Duffy's interjection because I think that the Labour Party got a rather raw deal under the standstill Order in the sense that it has not been effective in controlling increases in prices.  I understand that steps are being taken to remove or very much mitigate the effects of the Order and I understand when that comes about labour can counter to a large extent these dangers of inflation.  You have, however, a large bulk of people, civil servants, pensioners and thousands of others, who live on a fixed income and who would be caught in that vicious spiral. Although the Minister may not be the Minister concerned with this it is the concern of the Government as a whole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have great difficulty in finding out what, on broad lines, is the intention of the Government with regard to imports and with regard to increasing or tightening up the tariff barriers.  I have lately come across one or two instances where import licences have been refused for articles which have not been manufactured here on the grounds that they may be manufactured here in time to come.  That in itself undoubtedly has a bearing on the increased cost of living.  Call it what you like it is inflationary.  I am very alarmed at what I believe is <Col N="24" /> the tendency in Government quarters to further tighten up these tariff controls and by that means hand over the market to an increasing degree to a narrow circle of home manufacturers who are manufacturing for a limited market and who, in the nature of things, are not the people in many cases who produce at a scale which enables the lowest cost to be attained. In effect, that will further add to this very great danger of growing prices.</P>
    <P>I speak with some difficulty in this matter of the future tariff policy or even the present policy with regard to import licences because there is undoubtedly&mdash;I do not like the word &ldquo;conspiracy&rdquo;&mdash;but an understanding of silence among traders not to let me at least and others also know what is going on.  Occasionally, one hears things which indicate that the attitude of the average person who wants a licence or who wants quite legitimate advantages from the Government is not to get a black mark by agitating in reference to matters which he certainly may for the moment benefit from but which he himself considers unsound economics. That is the danger.  I do not want to enlarge this into a whole debate on the tariff position, but there is a very real danger there where you have a narrow market, a small population, and with the high protection we have got.</P>
    <P>Look at the case of the duty on wireless sets, for instance.  It is 75 per cent. other than for British sets, with a minimum of £7 10s 0d.  That is one instance of that protection and that is to protect, I imagine, a very small number of people engaged in the manufacture of wireless sets.  There is danger that the Minister may say that that has nothing to do with the Finance Department, but I hope he will regard it as his responsibility and the responsibility of the Government to peg this spiral.</P>
    <P>You have at present inordinately high prices and the Minister should not consider that inflation can come about only by abuse of the monetary organism. It can come about in a number of ways, and so far as the consumer is concerned it is the price <Col N="25" /> he pays that counts.  It is the duty of the Government to avoid, where possible&mdash;it cannot always, of course, control prices; it cannot control foreign prices&mdash;but it is their duty to avoid this danger and to control this rapidly-mounting price level.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Summerfield</NameTxt>
      <P>There is more material for thought in one statement giving the facts of experience than in the theories we have been listening to here.  Frankly, I am left puzzled at what Senator Sir John Keane is driving at.  I am going to give one instance where the actual information I have is worth more than all these theoretical statements.  We have had many statements made here from time to time about the inequity of high prices and I am not here to defend that section of the community, whether manufacturer or farmer, who took advantage of the acute economic scarcity to get abnormal prices, but let us realise that that is not confined to the farmer or the industrialist.  You have the jobbers and the hotel keepers.  What did they do during the years of the emergency? I do not defend this thing of high prices charged when articles were scarce.</P>
      <P>On my desk this morning I got a letter from my solicitor dealing with property which I use, owned by a Dublin bank, property which has had a rental of a certain amount over the past 14 years.  The bank acquired that property in ways that are known to those who deal with banks.  They are not responsible for inside or outside repairs.  For my own manufacturing processes I want a new lease of that property but this letter indicates that I am to pay 75 per cent. increase in rent over what I have been paying. An interview with the bank elucidated the statement: &ldquo;Circumstances justify us in looking for these rents.  We have another property from which we have been receiving £400 for the last ten years and we have just made a letting by which we will get £700.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These are facts not theoretical statements. Do these things not affect the cost of living?  Must not the article produced from these works in respect of which the increased rent will have to be paid reflect the increased cost? <Col N="26" /> What has the bank done to justify that exorbitant increased rent?  I certainly am not going to pay that increased rent demanded without having a full exposure of the facts.  If they insist on getting the increased rent I will have that exposure before I conclude the new lease.  We have heard a lot about £4,000,000 being got from the excess profits tax, but surely no one is better equipped than Senator Sir John Keane to know what the increased circulation of money generally has been.</P>
    <P>The fact remains that if the legitimate trader has made £100 excess profits the parasitic black marketeer who came in and cashed in on the emergency got £200, £300, and £400 and the State got none of that.  We know quite well that the attitude of the public in the last three or four years has been not &ldquo;where can I get goods legitimately&rdquo; but &ldquo;get me goods at any price.&rdquo;  I could cite cases where the legitimate trader, the manufacturer, perhaps, and the man who has paid on more than ordinary profits to the State sold articles say at £10 and the first buyer resold those articles again for £20 or £30.  The public were willing to pay that.  We are asked to accept the view by Senator Sir John Keane that the ordinary citizen was a helpless victim of the Government, in the first instance, and then of the rapacious shopkeeper and manufacturer and should I say the farmer.</P>
    <P>We have been living through an abnormal time.  There has been a huge increase in spending power.  Money was spent.  I did not get any of it in my business.  There has been that spending.  Try to get a room to-day in a Dublin hotel.  Where will you get it? It is not fair for Senator Sir John Keane or any other Senator, in a place where speeches are reported and where there is a public record to state more by insinuation than otherwise, that these great evils exist or to exaggerate evils that actually do exist.</P>
    <P>I make no defence but I say that industry will need, in spite of all the criticism it has received, all the reliefs it can get to face the future.  During the past seven years, the attitude of the community generally was &ldquo;Thank God for the Irish manufacturer.&rdquo;<Col N="27" /> There were goods available which, but for him, would not have been available at all.  Now, a certain section of the community are only too ready to forget what is due to the native manufacturer for providing those goods.  It is a case now of getting goods anywhere&mdash;I had almost said, except from the native manufacturer.  I hope that we shall never go back to the position when this country was a ranch for the production of cattle, while we exported people who should have been kept in employment here.</P>

It was a blessing for this country that there were people here in recent years who believed in that doctrine. There were splendid men in the Government which preceded the present Government.  They initiated some of our best industries and that industrial movement was accelerated by the present Government.  If we had not had those industries, what would have been the plight of the country in recent years?  Some other industries are merely developing and others are merely creeping.  It would be a sad day for the country, as well as for industry, if, because of short-sighted criticism, a flood of goods from God knows where were permitted to come in now and destroy those industries.</P>

      <P>Senator Sir John Keane raised an issue which is of fundamental importance.  Like Senator Summerfield, I think that he did not sufficiently clarify his point of view.  At all events, he did not do so so far as to enable me to fully understand his attitude.  My understanding of the effects of taxation on a possible inflationary situation is that, if the Government is able to draw off funds in the way of taxation, that lessens the possibility of inflation.  I gathered from Senator Sir John Keane that he found fault regarding the redistribution by the Government of some of the taxation levied.  He was inclined to <Col N="28" /> say to the Minister for Finance: &ldquo;Keep your taxation at the high level of last year and collect what you can by way of corporation profits tax.&rdquo; What is the Minister to do with the money if he collects it?  Is he to add to our surplus funds in Great Britain, as the Central Bank is doing, without getting services or goods in return? Is he to do, as is being done to some extent in a way which was long overdue, to redistribute the funds amongst that section of the community which needs redistribution most?  Some of the funds raised by way of taxation have come back to agriculture but what has come back is not adequate to meet the demands which Government policy makes on agriculturists by way of taxation and increases in wages.  I was surprised that Senator Sir John Keane did not advert to a potential cause of inflation which, to my mind, is a real danger.  I think we cannot ignore it any longer.  Inflation is made possible by permitting a situation to develop in which the currency available in the country increases out of all proportion to the goods available. That may be said to be coming about to a certain extent.  I suggest to Senator Sir John Keane and to the House that the greatest addition to surplus funds here has been made by money coming across from Great Britain.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>It is within the power of the Government to make a change and that is what is not being faced. The Minister is, apparently, quite satisfied with the situation.  He said that he would welcome any money which came in here.  Everybody recognises that there has been a considerable addition to the funds available for purchase purposes in this country by way of the money imported from England, by the earnings of our people in England which accumulated there and which they were unable to spend on goods there.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>That £13,000,000 might not have a considerable effect on the price level if we were doing anything to increase the available amount of goods.  But we allowed our people to leave the country, to earn money in Great Britain and to accumulate savings there and that money is being sent back here to play ducks and drakes with the economy of those who remained at work at home.  That constitutes a major contribution to this inflationary situation.  Then, countless persons are coming across from Britain to purchase farms, businesses, homes and anything they can get here. My information is that that movement has been greatly accelerated and absolutely nothing is being done about it.</P>
      <P>From what the Minister said the other day, I take it that he has no objection to that situation.  I should like to hear him on that matter.  We have a small population and we have certain resources in consumer goods and capital assets in the shape of land and property.  It will not require a considerable new importation to influence our economic and social life here.  I think that that is going on without any effort to check it and, apparently, without any real consciousness of it on the part of the community or even on the part of responsible people.  That is a situation to which we cannot close our eyes any longer.  I suggest to the Minister that the question to which Senator Sir John Keane referred, that of inflation, may become an increasing danger not only here but everywhere.

    <P>Senator Summerfield has left the House.  I wish that intelligent industrialists, such as he, would reach the stage when they would have a better appreciation of the meaning of words. When I heard him speak about this land being a ranch for the production of cattle and the export of human beings&mdash;well, I do not want to describe how I felt.  We have not done a great deal to change the situation with regard <Col N="30" /> to the ranches.  The truth is that we have exported far more human beings since we started to talk of abolishing the ranches than we did for some time before.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>There is an alternative and that is why I quarrel with the policy we are carrying on at present. There is in this country and there has been during the war a shortage of goods and a shortage of all kinds of services which should have been provided at home.  We shipped men and women out of the country, who, if we had kept them at home, would have earned a weekly wage and would have also produced goods against that weekly wage. It did not matter what kind of service they gave us&mdash;cleaning rivers, preparing work for the electricity supply services, the production of some years' fuel advance in the bog&mdash;if they did any or all of these things we would have something to show.  At least if we kept them employed here and paid them, the money would have been here and the services would have been provided. Instead of that we shipped them out of the country and they earned money in England.  When they sent notes back here, these notes were honoured by our banks and we gave to the families of these people the equivalent of the earnings which they sent home from England.  Here at home, however, there were no products against the money which had been earned in England.  That is where I find fault with the Government policy.  I must confess that the Minister for Finance is one member of the Government that I do not understand. I certainly say that I have very considerable admiration for the changes which he has made in Government financial policy but this thing is part of a whole.  I did not intend to go into that aspect of the matter if somebody had not led me on to it.  All these are issues in our economic, social and national life that are to a certain extent either being ignored or are not being sufficiently understood, in a way that would enable us to alter a policy that, to my mind, is not satisfactory.</P>

      <P>I do not know what Senator Baxter wants.  It is true that over the last five or six years a number of our people left the country and went to work in England.  We did not ship them out of the country, as the Senator says.  We did not ask them to go; we did not want them to go.  We offered them what living we could if they remained at home.  The Senator says that if we had kept them in the country they could have done so-and-so. Does he mean that we should have arrested them or put a ring of bayonets around the ports and around the Border to keep within the country those who went out of it, or what does he want?  The Government did its utmost during the war to continue the policy that it had been operating, as best it could, prior to the war.  That was, to develop a reasonable self-sufficiency in the essentials of life. The growth of unemployment during the war was due to the fact that by 1939 we had not so developed the resources of this country that we could provide the essentials of life for all our people and particularly the equipment necessary to develop our resources. Certain industries shut down which had been employing large numbers of workers.  The provision of housing ceased; the whole motor business practically shut down because petrol was cut off.  Even the railways had to go on short time because there had not been sufficient developments in the production of native fuel to keep them running.  Many other industries shut down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Workers were unemployed and the question arose as to whether we should say to them: &ldquo;Even though you are unemployed you must stay in the country and accept unemployment assistance or unemployment insurance.&rdquo; We had no alternative skilled work for motor mechanics who were out of a job.  We had employment for agricultural and turf workers, and under the Emergency Powers Acts we prohibited such workers leaving the country.  That was a very drastic power, indeed, but the Government had recourse to it only because they felt that the life of the whole community depended upon the production of sufficient fuel to enable the people <Col N="32" /> to cook their food without having to burn their furniture as people had to do in other countries.  We did not ship those who left out of the country.  We did everything to provide alternative employment for them.</P>
    <P>One other statement which the Senator made I want to contradict. He said that in the last five or six years as many people went out of the country as for several years before. The fact of the matter is that between 1922 and 1930 300,000 people left this country for America not to talk of those who went to England.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>None, because America would not let them in.  They shut down on emigration.  In the last few years there were about 250,000 permits issued to people to go from here to England.  Deducting the number of those who came into the country from the number who went out there was a nett emigration of 78,600.  That compares with the 300,000 who disappeared out of the country between 1922 and 1930.</P>

      <P>A very big number went into the Six Counties, but they are coming back.  They were counted in, because they had to have travel permits to go to the Six Counties, and the 250,000 who got travel permits include those who went to the Six Counties.</P>
      <P>It is, of course, the duty of the Government to watch everything that affects the economic, social and cultural life of our people, and one of the things we have been watching as best we can is what movement of foreign capital there is into this country.  While a few spectacular foreign investments in farms and houses have occurred recently, it has very little meaning in comparison with the amount of money we have invested abroad.  Senator Johnston will tell Senator Baxter if he likes that up to the end of last year we invested £140,000,000 outside the country during the war.  I think that very much less than the 100th part of that has been invested back here by outsiders.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>We have kept our eye on that movement and I can assure the Senator that the movement of capital into the country is nothing like 100th part of the movement of Irish capital for investment abroad over the last five years.  Senator Baxter put me a question on the last day as to what was my attitude about the movement of money into the country, as he called it. What has occurred in that £140,000,000 additional investments abroad, is not so much a movement of money to the country, but a movement of promises to pay into the portfolios of the banks, who have increased their external investments considerably during the war, into the portfolios of the Central Bank, which has increased its sterling holdings very greatly, almost £20,000,000 in this last five or six years, and into the portfolios of the Department of Finance which Department invests the savings deposited in the Post Office Savings Banks and the trustee savings banks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If I had my way, if my word was to control all activities in the country and outside it, we would not have accumulated in these portfolios these foreign assets during the war.  Instead of having increases in external assets, we would have translated them into capital goods, brought them back here for the development of the country and given remunerative employment to some of those men who left, and some of those who remained at home idle. There is no use in crying over spilt milk.  The fact of the matter is that in 1939, we had not reached a situation whereby we had capital equipment, acting on native resources, to the extent that would provide remunerative employment for all the people who were here in 1939 when certain works shut down and the alternative for the individual was to emigrate or to remain at home in idleness.  The alternative for the Government was to keep the man <Col N="34" /> at home in idleness or let him leave.  It was by no desire of ours that they left and it is no use for Senator Baxter or anyone else to say that we shipped them out of the country.  Let us talk realistically about what has happened and try, realistically, to discuss solutions for our problems.</P>
    <P>Senator Sir John Keane spoke about the dangers of inflation.  There are many definitions of inflation and there are many signs of its existence. It is naturally my job as Minister for Finance to keep tabs on the volume of money within the country and the activity which that volume of money shows in its action on goods.  There has been no increase here in the volume of money during the war due to the policy of the Government or the activities of the Central Bank or the commercial banks or the Department of Finance.  That is absolutely true. There was only a small increase in State debt during those years amounting in all to £16,000,000 or £18,000,000.</P>
    <P>There was an increase in our external assets of £140,000,000.  There was an increase of bank deposits in the commercial banks and in the Post Office Savings Bank and there is this £16,000,000 worth of increased State debt.  The three combined make up about £140,000,000.  There you have the thing equated&mdash;the increase in purchasing power available to the people in the form of notes, those deposits of the commercial banks and of the Post Office Savings Bank.  The £140,000,000 increased savings of the people is equated to £18,000,000 in the form of increased State debt and to £124,000,000 up to the end of last year in the form of increased external assets so that the big volume of savings held by the people in the form of notes, deposits in the savings banks, extra deposits in the commercial banks was due to the increase of the volume of money in England, not here. £16,000,000 of those savings was due to the activities of the Irish Government in increasing national debt, but the remainder of the amount, £124,000,000, one way and another, is represented by an increase in the British debt.</P>
    <P>There was one way we would have prevented that increase in saving, by <Col N="35" /> using the bayonet to keep the people at home.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>Please do not let the Senator interrupt me.  We could have detached ourselves from parity with sterling.  We could have appreciated our £1 in relation to the British £1 and we could have made it so that if a person went over to England, got £6 in English money and sent £4 back here, he would only get £2 in Irish money for it.  That could have been done and it would have set up a certain psychological handicap to people going.  Any step not even of such magnitude, but even half or quarter or one-tenth of the way towards it, would have been a very drastic step indeed. When all is said and done, the balance of gain, so far, has remained on the side of our keeping the existing parity with sterling.  Senator Baxter, in a certain mood and if he were not too careful, might plump for that appreciation of our £1 in order to stop emigration, but when the farmer sold his cow in England for £40 British and got only £20 Irish, he might change his tune.  Senator Sir John Keane, in a certain mood, might plump for appreciation of the Irish £1, but he would not be very long until he changed his tune if the banks, when they went to the Central Bank, got only half the number of pounds Irish for the British pounds they paid in. As I pointed out before, the big effect of changing the parity with sterling, up or down, is not so much&mdash;in the first instance, at any rate&mdash;to change the over-all international trade position but to make a very big difference between those who depend on exports for a living and those who depend for life and comfort on imports.  Appreciation or depreciation will affect those two classes differently, according to which you do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again, if there were a very delicate position in regard to our international balance of payments, there might be a big case to be made for examining the position, to see whether or not, in <Col N="36" /> order to keep the delicate balance, we should make new adjustments in our currency as against foreign currency. But that situation does not exist.  By and large, we have what is called a favourable balance of trade and we have a very big cushion of reserve investments abroad, which is sufficient to support our currency with the greatest of ease.  That particular reason does not exist for making a change at the present time.</P>
    <P>We could have stopped emigration to a large extent, we could have stopped the flow of purchasing power into the hands of our people on foot of work they did in Britain or goods they sent to England, by the appreciation of our currency, but I do not think that the game would have been worth the candle.  When we get down to it, if we want to improve the economic conditions of our people, if we want to bring down the prices of goods in relation to wages and salaries, the only thing to do is to get a capital development as quickly as possible that will produce consumable goods in the necessary quantity.</P>
    <P>Tariffs may be necessary in order to give our manufacturers a chance to build up; subsidies may be necessary in order to enable our farmers to produce the wheat and other requirements for our people; but whether it is by subsidy or by tariff, or by lending from the banks or from the State, all the measures it is necessary to take in order to build up our capital equipment should be taken.  I hope that the Minister for Industry and Commerce will continue to give encouragement to industrialists here to get ahead with their work and that the Minister for Agriculture will continue to give the same encouragement to farmers to produce the goods and other food as he has given in the past.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir John Keane Sir John Keane">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not in a position to go into that question in any great detail. The Minister for Industry and Commerce has under constant review <Col N="37" /> the trend of prices in particular industries and he has recently indicated, or certainly was discussing with members of the Government, the taking of further steps to inquire into the efficiency of industry as a whole and even into individual concerns.  However, the Minister himself will deal with that and I forget the details for the moment.  I think he made a public speech in connection with it and that there may be legislation or schemes of one kind or another involved.</P>
      <P>I would like to see certain prices falling pretty drastically, but I would like to see that happen because of an increase in efficiency.  Where it is necessary for a farmer, for instance, to get a certain price in order to continue in production, I would not like to see prices fall to the extent that would drive him out of production. Neither would I like to see the manufacturer, by some artificial driving down of prices, driven out of business. I hope to see both industrial and agricultural prices fall naturally, as industrial and agricultural efficiency increases.  I am hoping that one of the results of the State foregoing the collection of the excess profits tax will be to induce more people to go into industry and to create those conditions of competition which are the best guarantee the community has of reasonable prices.  With the best will in the world, I do not think the Minister for Industry and Commerce and his staff can control prices of commodities with the minuteness that he and that I would like to see.  Competition in industry is the best method of getting prices reduced.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, and a free market is not necessarily a market that has foreign competition.  I remember that by 1939 there were certain items of consumption which, although they had a 33? per cent. tariff against imports, were sold here at a cheaper price than they were in Britain.  I have absolute evidence of that because I know people in the Six Counties who came in to buy the articles.  A market is free if there is a sufficient number of native competitors.  They do not want outside active competition to keep <Col N="38" /> prices down.  However, if home manufacturers attempt to get into a ring&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash; the only way to break the ring would be by allowing them to feel the full weight of foreign competition.  In some cases&mdash;in the particular case that I have referred to&mdash;foreign competition would not have settled it because the native prices were lower.  If we could get industry going, if we could get sufficient capital into it, if we could get up-to-date machinery and equipment, I see no reason in the world why, in regard to a great range of industrial products, we should not produce them as cheaply here as any other country in the world.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephJohnston" hpid="Professor Johnston Professor Johnston">
      <NameTxt>Professor Johnston</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Minister whether he has any views on the inflationary effect of cheap money, and, in that connection, whether he has anything to say about the reduction in the interest paid on Post Office deposits which, I believe, are part of the Budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe that it is socially necessary to have public debt bearing the lowest possible rate of interest.  I believe that it is economically desirable for capital, in the form of houses and other public utilities of that kind, to be financed at the lowest possible rate of interest.  The higher the rate of interest on gilt edged Government debt, the greater will be the tendency for people to save in that form.  There is that consideration from the social point of view.  But people can save in several ways.  A man can buy an extra roll of cloth and not have it made into a suit; he can save by buying a piece of furniture or a house; he can save by buying a piece of a factory in the form of shareholding; he can save by improving his land or he can save in the form of buying Government debt.  From the social point of view it seems to me that if people invest their money and want to save in the form of <Col N="39" /> Government debt&mdash;I am talking now about normal times&mdash;and refuse to invest in ways which will give employment to their neighbours, then that will eventually force the Government to invest in some form or another in order to distribute purchasing power.</P>
      <P>It seems to me that the lower the rate of interest on State debt certificates the greater will be the tendency for money to circulate outside the State organisation: that Pat Murphy will give his pound to his neighbour to improve his land or to make a pair of boots or a suit of clothes for him rather than give it to the State.  If he gives it to the State it is not available to purchase the results of the labour of his neighbours.  The State then, if it wants the total products of the community to be purchased, must itself undertake some activity which will cost money.  It must undertake some industrial or public development utility, or else it must distribute it directly to the consumers, or to some section of the consumers.  That is merely on the question whether a high rate of interest or a low rate of interest is to be regarded as socially desirable. It is only one particular aspect of the matter.</P>
      <P>I do not believe that the Post Office depositors are seriously affected by the small reduction of interest that has been made on deposits up to £300. It amounts to about one and the one-fifth of a penny in the £ per annum. Instead of getting 6d they will get 4d and four-fifths of a penny, if I remember correctly, on sums up to £300. They will get 1¼ per cent. on the excess above £300.</P>
      <P>The average rate of interest on a total sum of £1,000 will amount to around 1½ per cent.  If, however, a person wants to save and does not want to accept the 2 per cent. up to £300, from the Post Office, we propose to offer him an investment in national Savings Certificates which will yield him £2 10s 1d, if held to maturity for 11 years.  It may be that during the year we will also offer a 2½ per cent. long term Government security.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are these three alternatives open to the person who wants to save <Col N="40" /> in the form of State debt of that kind. The Post Office Savings Bank is a State debt.  So that if that person does not want to accept the ordinary commercial bank rate, or the Post Office 2 per cent. he has the option of making an investment in national Savings Certificates up to £350 for each member of his family, bearing slightly over a 2½ per cent. rate of interest if held to maturity, and we may probably offer him the other 2½ per cent. in a long-term loan.  I think that these opportunities for saving are sufficient to prevent those who might save, squandering their money.  I would prefer to see people who, once they have cared for their families, given them sufficient food, clothes, and reasonable housing, keeping off the market for consumer goods at the moment and giving prices a chance to fall.  I would like to see them putting their money into these Saving Certificates, or in the Post Office or the commercial banks rather than squandering it competing for goods in short supply.</P>
    <P>I think I have answered Senator Johnston's question as to what my attitude is in regard to cheap money. If I get money from the Post Office, from Savings Certificates and from the long-term Government loan, if necessary at 2½ per cent., I will be able to re-lend that money for housing development and for public developments of all kinds.  It makes a very big difference to the rent of a house whether the rate of interest is 5 per cent. or 2½ per cent., or even if the difference is between 4¼ per cent. and 2½ per cent.  The last loan the Government gave for building houses was at 4¼ per cent. for 35 years.  It required 2/1 per week per £100 to repay it in 35 years.  Given a loan of £100 for 50 years at 2½ per cent. the weekly charge would be 1/4., so you have the difference between 2/1 and 1/4.  That is a very big reduction.  If we were forced to give more to the public for money, or if we offered people 4 per cent. or 5 per cent. for their money in the hope of inducing them to save, the prices of houses would go up accordingly.</P>

      <P>There is no longer any mystery about how to provide money, but one thing that is absolutely necessary if we are not going to misuse the power of controlling the volume of money, is the will to control it.  There is nothing easier than to turn out all the money we want either by way of Government notes or through the commercial banks but it would be disastrous that the volume of money should increase in a proportion greater than the increase in consumable goods.  The one thing I fear is that people, now that they know they have the &ldquo;know-how,&rdquo; may misuse the modern powers over which they have control.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our main effort must be to develop the output of consumer goods, and to do that we will require capital development. Any immediate effort on the part of any section of the community to grab for themselves more than they are at present entitled to will result in setting back future development. With a certain amount of consumable goods in existence, if certain people get more of them, somebody <Col N="42" /> must go short, and with the way modern life is so closely interlocked, selfishness on the part of a few can bring down the whole structure.  It would have terrific repercussions all through the economic life of the country if certain people should start a chain of price rises by demanding and securing for themselves a very much larger increase in their salaries and wages.  I hope that both the salaried people and the wage-earners throughout the country will see that it is only wise in their own interests not to go too fast about demanding that their salaries or wages should be increased. If such a campaign were started and were successful, the people who would suffer most in the long run would be those tied down to a wage or salary.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I am completely at a loss to understand why the County Management Acts are not being construed with this Bill.  There are references throughout the Bill&mdash;even on the next page in lines 5 to 12&mdash;to the County Management Acts, 1940 and 1942, and surely the whole law should be construed as one code.  This would be an appropriate time for the Minister to reply to some of the matters I mentioned in the Second Reading in regard to county management.  By the skilful introduction of a red herring, the Minister evaded those points.  There are many matters which it is impossible to consider adequately in connection with this Bill without knowing the manner <Col N="44" /> in which the Bill and the Management Acts are to be administered.  I asked whether there was to be a new public bodies Order.  That is a matter of vital importance&mdash;how that Order would operate <i>vis-a-vis</i> the manager and council.  The whole function of local government has been bound up by the Minister with the County Management Acts and why these Acts are not being construed with this Bill, I do not understand.</P>

      <P>Surely Senator Sweetman does not raise this question seriously on the Committee Stage of this Bill.  If it is relevant at all, it is relevant to the general principle of the Bill and might have been raised on Second Reading.  But it is not relevant, because the managerial code is quite a different code from the local government code. There are local authorities to which the County Management Acts do not apply.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps not.  I think that it should be included because there are important matters in the County Management Act which deal essentially with local government.  For example, there is the making of the estimate for the rates.  If my recollection serves me, that is part of the Management Act.  The estimate is prepared and brought before the council. The council are asked to approve of the estimate and, if they do not approve of it, the matter can be adjourned for six days.  Then, they either approve or disapprove.  That is a very essential part of local government. It may be worth considering the advisability of inserting that as one of the Acts.</P>

      <P>On Second Reading, the Minister denied that there was any principle in the Bill.  His contention was that the Bill had no principle and that it was simply a matter of going through it section by section, as in Committee.  Now, he says that this is a question affecting the principle of the Bill.  He cannot have it both ways even if he is Minister in Local Government and Public Health.  The Management Acts are interlocked with the Local Government Acts and Acts which make provision for the administration of local government and appointment of officers should be construed with the Local Government Acts even if, in one instance which the Minister has cited&mdash; vocational education committees&mdash; certain bodies are responsible to the Minister for Education.  It is reasonable to suggest that these Acts should be construed together.  The Minister's argument that the law officers of the Government know their business and <Col N="46" /> must be right would be quite invalid as an argument in any Parliament.  If that were to hold, no section could be criticised because members could be told that the law officers knew what they were doing when they framed it. That is a <i>reductio ad absurdum.</i>  It is a reduction of this House to a position in which we have to rely on the Minister's advice and assistance.  We do not ask his advice and we never accepted his assistance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>There could be nothing more absurd than the point now being raised.  Senators are contending that the County Management Acts should be cited with the Local Government Acts as one code.  It might as readily be contended that the Valuation Acts, the Rating Acts, the Electoral Acts and the Public Health Acts, which are all interlocked with the Local Government Acts, should be cited as part of one code.  That has not been the custom and there has been no precedent for doing so.  In order to avoid confusion and make for the convenience of those who must have a knowledge of those codes or who may have to ascertain the law in relation to such matters, it has been the custom to try to segregate the various divisions of what might be described as local government and to keep the provisions of the law which are immediately relevant to one section of activity together.  It seems to me therefore that this point has already been decided.  As Senator Sweetman stated, it was raised on Second Reading and it was decided when the Seanad agreed to the Second Reading of the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The Seanad gave a Second Reading to the Bill after the Minister had stated, as Senator Hayes has just said, that there was no principle involved in the Bill.  If we take the Minister's statement, what we gave a Second Reading to in these circumstances was a medley of sections which were going to be discussed again section by section in Committee.  Of course, what is in the Minister's mind is perfectly clear.  He is trying to avoid discussing the County Management Act because he has made up his <Col N="47" /> mind that the Act, as originally drafted and put into operation by him, is not the Act that he wants.  What he wants to have in regard to local government is something that is not in his Bill, something that he has been forced by local authorities to accept, as a proper principle for the management of councils. He is being forced into that position and he does not want to admit that and I have a certain amount of human sympathy with him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>Here again one is embarrassed in an examination of this Bill by statements by Ministers with regard to fundamental forms.  We are told that there is a project on foot&mdash;in fact we are promised a White Paper on it.  Incidentally, if the Minister wants to know, it is not a legitimate attitude to reply to criticisms of mine in regard to the Bill to take the Bill section by section and to ask where these matters are provided for in the Bill.  He failed deliberately to answer points of principle raised on the last stage.  I am raising these questions of principle now.  We are told there is a scheme on foot for the appointment of three Ministers.  Is it not quite possible that that scheme may affect the definition of &ldquo;Minister&rdquo; in line 30? Would it not be wise and would it not avoid future legislation to have some method by which, if other Ministers are appointed, the definition would cover any Minister to whom duties under this Act might fall?  Is it not quite possible that, under any reform, services in connection with roads and bridges might fall on one of the new Ministers, and that the overriding powers of abolishing local authorities might fall on the super-Minister, if there is going to be one super-Minister among the three?  The whole thing makes one wonder whether when these new Ministers are appointed and the new reforms come into effect, the limited definition of &ldquo;Minister&rdquo; given in this Bill will be satisfactory or <Col N="48" /> adequate or whether we may not require fresh legislation to deal with the new reform.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot understand what Senator Sir John Keane is driving at, especially in relation to the definition of &ldquo;Minister&rdquo; contained in this section.  If Senator Sir John Keane will read Section 2, he will see that the word &ldquo;Minister&rdquo; is defined to mean &ldquo;Minister for Local Government and Public Health.&rdquo;  In other words it is what is called a definition section.  Instead of writing out at length in each section of the Bill the words &ldquo;Minister for Local Government and Public Health&rdquo; the word &ldquo;Minister&rdquo; simpliciter is inserted. Whatever future changes may be made in local government, they must be dealt with when the time comes by legislation.  At present we are dealing with this Bill.  At the moment there is a Minister for Local Government and Public Health and this definition of Minister covers the present Minister for Local Government and Public Health.  I cannot see what anything that may happen in 12 months or two years' time has to do with the definition set out in Section 2 of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>This section has another objectionable feature which I have pointed out in regard to many other Bills, namely legislation by reference.  The expression &ldquo;reserved function&rdquo; is not defined in the Bill, but we are referred to a definition in another Act.  In the same way the expression &ldquo;voluntary civic improvement fund&rdquo; is not defined and we are referred for its definition to another Act.  That whole method of drafting legislation involves an interminable amount of very unnecessary trouble for people who have to consider that legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There would be some sense in that method of defining &ldquo;reserved function&rdquo; if the County Management Act were being construed with this Act.  But this House having decided a moment ago, by passing Section 1, that it is not going to be so construed, we should ensure that a definition in respect to &ldquo;reserved function&rdquo; is included in <Col N="49" /> this Bill.  There are other matters which are defined by reference in the same way and in respect to which a definition should be included in this Bill so that the Bill will be one homogeneous whole and so that it will not be necessary to go chasing around after another Act to find out exactly what a particular set of words mean.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel that I should call attention of the Chair to the fact that on the last occasion when this Bill was before the House on Second Reading, I did deal with what I thought was the main objection taken by Senators to the Bill.  That was the allegation that this Bill was in some way unduly fettering local authorities in the discharge of their responsibilities. I dealt with that in the only way in which a general allegation of that sort could be dealt with&mdash;by going over the Bill section by section and asking those Senators who had made themselves responsible for that charge to show in what way the terms of the sections bore out their allegation.</P>
      <P>Having dealt with that one objection, which I thought was the major objection raised, I would have proceeded to deal as clearly and as comprehensively with the other objections which some Senators have taken to the Bill, but, Sir, you reminded me at about ten minutes past nine that it was proposed that the Seanad, at 9.30, should take some other business, and I had to allow these unfounded criticisms like those of Senator Sir John Keane to go unanswered.  I think it is very unfair that these allegations should be made by the Senator now, when I had not an opportunity of dealing with the points on the last occasion.  I think that I have dealt very effectively with the major criticisms of the Bill, but seeing that I was not permitted to deal with the other points, perhaps I can do so on the Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>As to the particular point which the Senator has raised in relation to this section, I think it would be absurd to ask the Oireachtas to legislate in anticipation of legislation which is not even yet before either House of the Oireachtas and the <Col N="50" /> prescribed terms of which no person at this moment is aware.  We should then be legislating for a figment.  How could we possibly determine what is going to be another measure unless we are to assume that the measure, as introduced by the Government, will be passed by both Houses without amendment? That is precisely what Senator Sir John Keane is asking the House to do, and it would be an unwarranted infringement on the rights of this House.</P>
      <P>I think that if the Minister for Local Government came to the House and asked the Seanad at this stage to accept proposals based on the assumption that at some future time the House is going to pass legislation which would take a particular form, the first person to object would be Senator Sir John Keane himself, and I am indeed surprised that a person of his standing and experience should make such a suggestion at this stage of the Bill.</P>

      <P>I would like the Minister to deal with this point which I raised about the estimate of expenditure before a county council the headings of it and the analogous operation of the power of virement. The situation has proved most unsatisfactory. So far as a council is concerned it is satisfactory enough, but when an estimates committee takes the estimates and gives them prolonged and detailed study for a number of days, as I know one estimates committee has been doing for many years, it is necessary for them to have more detailed information than is contained in the ordinary form provided under the Public Bodies Order, yet, nevertheless, those details can be changed in the course of the year without any reference to the estimates committee or the county council, and I would seriously suggest to the Minister that there should be in the Public Bodies Order more than the four main headings, roads, public assistance, public health and general purposes.</P>
      <P>There should be provision for more detail and if I might use the word sub-detail when the estimates are being varied.  The effect of that provision would be that money allocated to one sub-head could not be transferred to another sub-heading without the specific authorisation of the chairman of the council concerned.  It appears to me that would be in conformity with the practice in the Department of Finance in regard to central taxation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want also to ask the Minister whether he has considered the legal position on insurance bonds since the last day.  It does appear to me that the insurance companies, when an Order has not been strictly adhered to for some time, might not be bound to honour a fidelity bond where the council had been aware of breaches of <Col N="53" /> it, as breaches do occur, in regard to the 48-hour rule, and the new Order should be framed bearing that in mind.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LouisODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>

I understood that he was contending that there should be, within the provisions of the Public Bodies Order, powers for the county managers to exercise the power of virement.  I am going to say, in reply, that while that power does exist in regard to the expenditure of State money and money provided by the Oireachtas, nevertheless, the power is comparatively narrow in its scope in so far as the amount in respect of which this power may be exercised, is comparatively small.  As the Senator pointed out, the power can only be exercised within certain narrow limits, but now I am asked that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Now, I gather that the point is that the power should only be exercised by the manager in consultation or by agreement with the chairman of the council.  I should have to consider that matter before I could come to any decision in relation to it. Certainly, it is a power which would have to be circumscribed very closely and I do not know whether we could deal with it under the Public Bodies Order or whether we would have to amend the existing County Management Act.</P>
      <P>Section 25 of the Act imposes certain limitations on expenditure and sub-section (2) goes on to provide:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Save with a consent given by resolution under the foregoing sub-section of this section, the total amount of money expended and <Col N="54" /> liability incurred by the council of a county or by an elective body in any local financial year for any particular purpose specified in the estimate of expenses for such local financial year shall not exceed the total amount specified in the said estimate of expenses in respect of that purpose.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is already provided under that sub-section that the allocation of the moneys as between one section and another can be varied by the resolution of the council of the county, but it would be another matter to allow this variation to be exercisable otherwise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Apparently I have not made myself clear at all as to what I meant in regard to the transfer of money from one estimate to another. As I understand the legal position at present, the council must be consulted again under Section 25 (2), if the manager wants to exceed the amount already allocated, say, for public assistance.  Supposing, however, in a particular year the council decides to allocate £50,000 for public assistance, the council has made that decision as the result of the estimates committee considering that the £50,000 was to be made up of various items. Supposing we take it that one of the items is £18,000 for salaries and another is £20,000 for home assistance.</P>
      <P>As I understand the law as it is at present, the manager can decide to spend only £16,000 on home assistance and to spend £22,000 on salaries.  Then, because the total of both does not exceed the amount adopted by the council under the Public Bodies Order Schedule, he is perfectly entitled so to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the matter can be dealt with very clearly by the Minister in reply to one question.  The estimate of expenses provided under the Public Bodies Order contains six separate sub-heads: road charges, public assistance charges, mental hospital charges, health charges, housing charges and general purposes charges.  If the total amount granted by the council in the rate made <Col N="55" /> for public assistance is £50,000, is it not the position that the manager can allocate that £50,000 within public assistance in any way that seems fit to him, without going back to the council?</P>
    <Speaker pid="LouisODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, that is the law.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that is a very doubtful point.  If the wording of Section 25 is considered, it will be seen that the estimate of expenses relates not to expenditure on any particular service but to expenditure on any particular purpose.  If Senators would look at Form E, Estimate of Expenses, on page 117 of the Public Bodies Order they will see a number of services mentioned, general categories of services. To take that to which Senator Sweetman was referring&mdash;public assistance charges&mdash;Senators will see that these are set under four sub-headings:&mdash;(1) district institutions, (2) home assistance, (3) medical assistance, and (4) assistance in extern institutions.</P>
      <P>It would seem to me that these sub-heads specify the particular purpose for which the money is to be expended. I certainly should be very doubtful as to whether a county manager would be justified in expending moneys which, say, had been appropriated for the purpose of home assistance on medical assistance unless he had the express consent of the council by resolution in accordance with sub-section (2) of Section 25.  I certainly think that he would not be justified if the council had voted the sum of £22,000 for home assistance&mdash;that, I think, was the figure mentioned&mdash;in appropriating that for salaries.  There is not, by the way, under the general heading any provision for salaries under public assistance charges.  I think that perhaps the example is not a good one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I admit that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I certainly think that he would not be justified in underspending on home assistance for the purpose of overspending on, say, salaries.  I am not prepared to say that he might not be allowed a reasonable latitude as between district <Col N="56" /> institutions and home assistance or medical assistance, because these things do perhaps overlap, but where there is a very clear distinction between one particular purpose and another, I think the manager would not be justified in exceeding the amount allowed by the council under that particular sub-head.  Again, I am still at a loss to see what precisely is the point which the Senator is anxious to make.  If his contention is that the manager might be allowed a reasonable margin, then I think he might be allowed a fairly generous margin and a fairly generous discretion as to which of these particular sub-heads he would spend the money on.</P>
      <P>I think that we should have to amend the County Management Act, however, to allow that to be done, but if his purpose is that the council should be allowed to vary the expenditure of the moneys provided under the estimates, as between one particular purpose and another, I think that comes in under Section 25.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LouisODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister reconsider the matter between this and the Report Stage, because I always thought that public assistance was defined as including home assistance and medical assistance?  I always thought that if there was an estimate, no matter how it was divided up, for public assistance that the money could be spent on public assistance, no matter what the charges were, whether for salaries, hospital expenses or any other.  I think that, if a sum of £50,000, say, is set aside for public assistance, the manager can spend it either on salaries, hospitals or in any other way.  I may be wrong in that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The estimate of expenses is dealt with by Form E 1 in the Public Bodies Order to which the Minister has referred.  That estimate is arrived at by the council on a report from the estimates committee.  The estimates committee, in preparing that report, go into very much greater detail than that set out in Form E 1. What I want the Minister to do is to ensure that, in his new Public Bodies Order, if the manager is going to depart from the schedule of estimates that he puts up to the estimates committee <Col N="57" /> he must get the consent of the chairman of the county council before doing so.  I agree that if his departure means that the total expenditure under the heading is going to be greater than that, then the council must be brought in under sub-section (2) of Section 25.  If the manner of the expenditure is going to be changed in such a way as to completely alter the schedule that was put before the estimates committee, then I feel that, unless the manager has to go back either to the chairman or the estimates committee, the work of the estimates committee is going to be futile.</P>
      <P>I have a particular case in mind. Prior to the last estimates meeting of the Kildare County Council, the estimates committee considered not merely the details under the headings in Form E.1 but went into much greater detail, and considered in respect of medical assistance how much it was wise to spend on, for example, certain dispensaries.  There were certain recommendations adopted by the estimates committee.  It appears to me that as the law and Orders are at present, those recommendations so adopted are not in any way binding on the executive of the local authority. I think the Minister will agree with me that if the estimates committee is going to fulfil a useful function there must be some certainty that what is proposed by it and summarised in Form E.1 will be adhered to by and large.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree from the Minister's point of view, that there must be some give and take.  I suggest that the proper give and take within the sub-heads and only within the sub-heads of Form E.1 is the consent of the chairman of the council.  I am not going to ask the Minister to deal with that point now because it does not arise directly, but it will arise directly in respect of his Public Bodies Order.  I must confess that when I first read this Bill I did not understand that every regulation there was meant to include anything so very formal as a Public Bodies Order.  I understand now from the Minister that these regulations are intended to be included in the Public <Col N="58" /> Bodies Order of 1902 which is the basis of the work of local government.</P>
    <P>I would press the Minister to see that a serious Order like that should be tabled so that the Houses of the Oireachtas may know the method under which the executive functions are going to be carried out.  There may be under another Act provision for tabling it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir John Keane Sir John Keane">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel that this is a very important matter.  It is important in this way.  This Public Bodies Order will presumably be laid on the Table of the House&mdash;it will not be in the Act as such&mdash;and the only way in which the matter can then be discussed is the usual procedure by way of motion for annulment.  I speak subject to correction there, but I think I am right.  I think it is very important that we should have this opportunity now of getting knowledge on what are the Minister's intentions on this matter.  I listened to him and I thought he was delightfully vague when answering the Senator a few moments ago.  He said &ldquo;I think&rdquo;.  He did not seem to know.  He may know, but he did not speak as if he did.  He said: &ldquo;I think the county manager has power of making changes within a limited degree.&rdquo;  There must be something more specific than that. Surely there are specific limits under which is laid down this power of virement and outside of that he has to get some authority to make these changes.  I can quite understand what is meant by the Public Bodies Order. Under the heading of health charges there are set out six sub-headings.  I call them sub-headings; they are really groups.  Surely the Minister is not allowed to transfer the service under (2)&mdash;&ldquo;The prevention and treatment of disease&rdquo;&mdash;to (4) &ldquo;The medical treatment of school children.&rdquo;  They are definite sub-heads and as I understand it&mdash;though it is some years since I was familiar with local authorities&mdash; they are definite sub-heads which are passed and approved by the estimates committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>You have an analogy in our Public Estimates.  You have certain powers of virement vested in the head of a Department and outside of that it is <Col N="59" /> either illegal to go or the Minister for Finance has to give approval.  I wish the Minister would deal more specifically with point (1).  Within what limits has the county manager power to change, to transfer money from one sub-head to another, and if he wants to go outside those powers whose authority has he got to obtain?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there any provision under another Local Government Act by virtue of which these regulations are detailed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The Public Bodies Order is made in the general exercise of powers vested in the Minister by the Local Government Acts of 1925 and 1941&mdash;or 1925 to 1946 as they will be after the enactment of this Act.</P>
      <P>A great deal of confusion has arisen in this debate because this word &ldquo;virement&rdquo; has been used.  It is a technical term, applicable so far as I know only to the expenditure of moneys from the Central Fund and in accordance with the provisions of the Appropriation Act for the year.  There is nothing exactly comparable with it under our local government or county management code.</P>
      <P>The nearest approach there to it is the power to which I have referred under Section 25, whereby the council of a county or an elected body may allow expenditure in excess of the original provision upon a specific purpose. The manager, as such, has no power of virement but I did say in reply to Senator Sweetman that I thought it would be reasonable that within a very moderate margin the manager might in practice spend a little more on one purpose than was originally provided, in order that the work of the council for instance might not be held up.  It would, I think, be necessary for the manager, if he wanted to fully safeguard his position, to have this excess expenditure confirmed by resolution of the council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="60" /> Now, in expressing that opinion and in putting myself, so to speak, in the position of a member of a local authority or elected body, there is no suggestion that the Minister is not aware of what the provisions of the section are.  He is, but I was endeavouring to deal with the position which apparently has occasioned some difficulty in County Kildare but which has not in that particular form been the cause of any difficulty elsewhere.  I want to say it has not in that particular form because Senator Sweetman's suggestion was that we should extend the system of estimating expenses under Form E in such a way that each particular work will be specified, that, for instance, if instead of public assistance charges we take road charges or perhaps health charges; that instead of, say, expenses to be incurred in the general category &ldquo;road charges&rdquo; the manager should specify either roads A, B and C, or by a particular number in some other way designate particular road works which he proposes to carry out or which he desired the county to provide.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>He does, in his submission to the council, but they come in here under the Public Bodies Order in a general category under one or other of the particular classifications. As the Senator has reminded us he does designate them, but the Senator wants the Public Bodies Order to go further and to say if money is provided for roads A, B and C, the precise sum provided for each particular road will be spent on that road.  I think that that is really what the Senator asked.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Not quite&mdash;that the sum indicated will be spent unless somebody representing the council says otherwise, because the council has already said that the precise sum shall be spent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>In respect of the nature of the expenditure.  The <Col N="61" /> Senator suggested, I think, that the manager should not be permitted to expend more money on Road A than he originally requested and, correspondingly, ought not to be in a position to spend less money on Road B in order to make good an excess expenditure on Road A.  I think that that was the Senator's suggestion.  I want to be as clear as possible on that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>In my view, that would make administration of a county by a county manager virtually impossible. Suppose, instead of roads&mdash; where the expenditure upon each particular work would be significant&mdash;we take the question of the repair of pumps.  Would the manager have to set out in detail the cost of the repairs which might be required to each particular pump during the year?  If, by any chance, the expenditure required to repair a particular pump was much greater than was originally anticipated, would he have to allow the other pumps to go unattended?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has now made clear that I misunderstood him.  I thought that he was referring to a particular class of road rather than to a particular road.  I was not referring for example to the Naas to Kilcullen road as distinguished from the Naas to New-bridge road but rather to a particular class of roads or class of pumps.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Then I do not see how the difficulty arises because, in Form E, we have &ldquo;ordinary road works&rdquo; and, under that, &ldquo;repair and improvements&rdquo;; then &ldquo;special grant works&rdquo; (Road Fund and other Government grants); main roads not in charge of a county council, and &ldquo;other expenses&rdquo;.  This is a sort of global item containing, perhaps, a sum for contingencies, which would seem to allow the manager a certain amount of discretion.  If Senator Sweetman's view is that the manager should be allowed to spend a stated sum upon a prescribed category of works or a prescribed kind of work or in relation to a particular type of work, that is already provided for in the second column of <Col N="62" /> the estimate.  I was saying that this is a difficulty which seems to be peculiar to Kildare because in other councils we have the opposite complaint&mdash;that column 2 binds the managers too tightly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>We are also having that complaint from some members of local authorities who say that it binds the manager too tightly and that they would rather the manager had a reasonable discretion within the category set out in the first column.  That would be rather more in accordance with the discretion which a Minister and head of a Department have in relation to a Departmental Vote.  There, within the whole range of the Vote, the power of virement may be exercised.  Here, if we were to say that the manager would have discretion to spend money on any particular object coming within the category of services&mdash;roads, public assistance, mental hospitals, etc.&mdash;he would have something comparable, but not exactly equivalent, to the power a Minister or head of a Department has in relation to a Departmental Estimate. This question may arise when the auditors will have had time to consider the full implications of the Public Bodies Order as it stands.  It may be necessary to modify the Public Bodies Order in some way.  The general pressure at the moment is not to modify it in the direction Senator Sweetman desires but in such a way as to allow local authorities and their manager a wider discretion in the expenditure of moneys within the broad category of any particular service.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidJohnMadden" hpid="Mr. Madden Mr. Madden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Madden</NameTxt>

      <P>Neither Senator Madden nor the Minister understands my view.  I seem to be unable to express it clearly.  Certain figures were put before the estimates committee of <Col N="63" /> the county council.  These figures were extended in much greater detail in E.1. When they were adopted, we were told that that did not matter at all, because, so long as they were within form E.1., it was all right; the manager was not bound to keep to them.  If that be so, what is the use of having details put before the estimates committee?  The Minister has, without realising it, solved one of my problems.  He referred to the fact that these matters were being considered in view of the audit by his Department.  My main trouble arose in respect of a case in which the Kildare County Council decided that a file should be submitted to the Local Government auditor to see whether there should be a surcharge because the county council's direction had not been complied with.  When we hear the decision on that file, we shall know more clearly how this &ldquo;extended detail&rdquo; will work.  Therefore, I shall not take up any more of the time of the House on this question.</P>

There may be a particularly bad stretch of a road, the remaking of which might be estimated for at £1,000 per mile.  It could happen, as it did happen in my own experience, that the repair of these particularly bad stretches could be carried out at a considerably smaller expenditure. It could happen that works estimated at £37,000 could be carried out for £34,000 or £35,000.  I should like to know from the Minister, if there is a saving of £5,000 under the heading of &ldquo;Road Charges Account&rdquo;, would it be possible for the county manager, without the knowledge of the county council, to devote that money to work for which he had underestimated? Would it be possible to expend the sum saved under one particular heading on another heading, the expenditure on which was underestimated, without the council knowing it?</P>

      <P>Section 3 of the Bill says that the Act &ldquo;shall come into operation on such day or days as may be fixed therefor by Order or Orders of the Minister either generally or with reference to any particular purpose or provision and different days may be so fixed for different purposes and provisions of this Act.&rdquo;  Then Section 6 says: &ldquo;The Minister may by Order make such adaptations&rdquo;&mdash;and Senator Sweetman wishes to add: &ldquo;within 12 months after the passing of this Act,&rdquo; but the Act might not come into force for two years.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>In my opinion, this amendment is absolutely unnecessary. In no Act up to the present has such a clause been inserted in the numerous sections empowering Ministers to adapt by Order enactments in force. It is quite possible that cases may arise more than 12 months after the coming into force of this Bill in which an adaptation Order would be necessary in respect of some statutes.  It is quite clear that different Acts may come into practical operation at different times.  The Minister might find that there was some expression in the Act which was not in conformity with the provisions of this Act of 1946.  A simple example of the adaptation of Acts is this.  Supposing, in an old Act, the words &ldquo;lunatic asylum&rdquo; occur, in later legislation these lunatic asylums are described as mental hospitals and the Act could not be applied because the words &ldquo;lunatic asylum&rdquo; are in it.  Therefore it is necessary to make an Order adapting the words &ldquo;lunatic asylum&rdquo; to be read and construed as if they were the words &ldquo;mental hospitals&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That may happen at any time after the passing of this Act, and I cannot understand why the Minister should be required to sit down immediately after the passing of the Act and proceed to make an Order adapting every Act which has been passed in previous years to bring it into conformity with this Act.  The whole idea of the adaptation of Acts of Parliament is to make the new Act workable, so that it will not be obstructed or hindered in its operation by any previous or old Act.  In other words, the Minister is to be empowered by Order to adapt the old Act so as to make the new Act workable.  That may not be necessary for 12 months, and I do not see why the Minister should be restricted to 12 <Col N="67" /> months.  If he were restricted it would defeat the intention of the section itself.</P>

I think the amendment is faulty, as Senator O'Dea has pointed out.  I will be quite prepared to say five years instead of 12 months if that is desired, but there ought to be some period during which the Minister and his Department will be satisfied that this Act is unworkable.  It seems, in general, a mistake that there should be a continuing power to make Ministerial Orders which will alter statutes.</P>

      <P>There is no desire to impair the putting into operation of this Bill when it becomes an Act.  We all agree that with the complexity of modern legislation it is not always possible to bring every point into an Act, although sometimes not everything is put in.  Restriction to some period of time is desirable in itself, and I think Senator Ryan will agree as a matter of principle.  As a matter of expediency, 12 months may be too short, but certainly it is necessary to make some restriction on the general power to legislate by Order.  That is the point in the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I said I was not accepting this amendment because I did not think it was necessary.  I gather now that the core of objection to the section as it stands is that it is undesirable that a Minister should be given unrestricted power to legislate by Order.  As Senator O'Dea points out, the Minister is not given unrestricted power by the section, because it does provide that every Order made by the Minister shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas, and if a resolution annulling is passed within the prescribed time then the Order will be annulled, but without prejudice to the validity of anything done previously under it.  To come down to general principles that it is wrong that a Minister should have power not limited by time to make adaptation Orders, if that is a procedure which is wrong in principle, all I have got to say is that its <Col N="69" /> paternity is a befitting one because I find that in the Local Government Act, 1925, for which I had no responsibility&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but for which other members of the House might have responsibility, I find that the Minister may, by Order, make such adaptation of any existing enactment (including any local Act) as appeared to him necessary or expedient for carrying this Act into effect.  If that is wrong in principle, then it has been fittingly conceived.  I do not think it is wrong; I think it is a wise provision, because, after all, we have to bring the whole constituent parts of a code into consistent relation to each other.  It is possible, because, for instance, institutions may change their names, that there may be minor inconsistencies of that sort arising.  To remedy these, are we to have to introduce a Bill and bring it through both Houses of the Oireachtas and have it formally enacted as an Act in order to change the name of a county council or to adapt other provisions under the 1898 Act in relation to functions which it would discharge under an Act of 1941 or 1946?  I should think that the time of the Oireachtas is much too valuable to fritter it away in that sort of vexatious procedure.  But I do admit that the Oireachtas ought to have an opportunity, if it thinks it is necessary, to consider what the Minister has done under such a power as it is proposed to give him under Section 6 and, therefore, sub-section (2) of this provides that the Minister's Order will be laid on the Table of the Oireachtas and that either House will have an opportunity of considering it and, if in its wisdom and discretion, it decides that the Order is not one that should be made, it can annul the whole business and compel the Minister to have recourse to the ordinary course of legislation.  That is why I said I did not think the amendment was necessary. When Senator Sweetman put it down, he apparently did so without having even read the section.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (1), line 41, to delete the words &ldquo;statutory or other&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I put this down as I cannot understand the meaning of those words in the context.  An enactment is a Bill which has been turned into a statute by the Oireachtas.  If we look at the Bill, we find it says: &ldquo;Bill entitled an Act ...&rdquo; and then: &ldquo;Be it enacted by the Oireachtas as follows&rdquo;.  Once a Bill is enacted by the Oireachtas, it is an Act.  An enactment is an Act or any part of an Act, it may be a section or sub-section; in other words, an enactment is law made by the Oireachtas.  It must necessarily be made by statute and therefore an enactment is of a statutory character and to say: &ldquo;statutory enactment&rdquo; is tautology, as there is no other kind of enactment but a statutory enactment. Therefore, the words: &ldquo;statutory or other&rdquo; have no meaning, in my submission, in relation to the word &ldquo;enactment.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>These words may not have been used in previous Local Government Acts&mdash; the Local Government Act, 1925 or the Local Government Act, 1941.  Section 54 of the latter Act, sub-section (1) says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Minister may by Order make all such adaptations and modifications of any enactment in force immediately before the commencement of this section as appear to him to be necessary or expedient for enabling this part of this Act or such enactment to have full force and effect.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The same section appears in the Public Assistance Act, 1939, Section 89.  In the County Management Act, 1940, however, there is a variation, because Section 37 (2) says:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="71" />&ldquo;The Minister may by Order make, in respect of any enactment or Order in force at the commencement of this Act in relation to councils of counties, all such adaptations of and modifications in any such enactment or Order as appear to him to be necessary or expedient for carrying into effect the provisions of this Act so far as they relate to such councils.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It appears to me that it was intended here by the draftsman to give the Minister power to make adaptations in an enactment or in a statutory Order. Having called the Minister's attention to this matter, I think his intention can be carried into effect if the words &ldquo;statutory or other&rdquo; are deleted and an addition made to the section by putting in the words &ldquo;or Order&rdquo;, so that the sub-section would then read:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Minister may by Order make such adaptations in any enactment or Order in force at the passing of this Act and relating to any matter affected by this Act as are in his opinion necessary to enable the enactment or Order to have effect in conformity with this Act.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In order to carry out that, I think it is necessary for me to withdraw my amendment, if the Minister would undertake to look into the matter and on the Report Stage bring in whatever amendment he considers necessary.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I put this amendment down because I am not quite clear, on the section as phrased, whether a county council has any right to make an additional separate charge as well as any separate charges that may at present be existing, <Col N="72" /> or whether the effect of the section is to ensure that there cannot be a new separate charge.  If the situation is at present that under the existing law and under this section there can be a separate charge in the future, I agree with the Minister that my amendment is unnecessary.  If, however, there cannot be a separate charge, I think there should be some provision enabling the council to determine that a particular service for a particular area would be paid for by that area, if the council, with its knowledge of local conditions, so decides.</P>

      <P>In sub-section (1) to add at the end of the sub-section in line 42 the words &ldquo;health districts&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>My amendment is put in here for the purpose of having the Minister consider the matter and I am sure that, after he has given it consideration, whatever he decides will be quite satisfactory to me.  As Senators know, there is a county-at-large charge which is levied on the entire county, urban and rural. Section 9 of the Local Government Act, 1925, defined a county health district as a county area exclusive of urban areas. Many Acts have been passed which, in my recollection, state that the expenses shall be leviable by means of the poor rate, without defining any particular area.  Now, if there is no particular area prescribed, it appears to me that, under that section, it must be made a county-at-large charge and, therefore, would be leviable on the urban districts as well as on the county.  It occurred to me that that could be unfair to the urban districts and I put down the amendment so that the Minister would give it consideration.  Probably he will know better than I will whether it should stand or whether the words &ldquo;health districts&rdquo; should be put in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>To deal first with Senator Sweetman's point, the sub-section in the Bill is merely a restatement, in appropriate form, of the existing law.  The law as it stands&mdash; sub-section (1) of Section 45 of the Local Government (Ireland) Act, 1898, provides that:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The expenses incurred by the council of a county at large in the <Col N="73" /> execution of this Act, or otherwise in relation to their business, which are not union or district charges, nor the excluded charges hereinafter mentioned, shall, where no provision is otherwise made by law, be raised equally over the whole county, and shall be called county-at-large charges.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The purpose of the section is to restate the law in the form in which it is appropriate to the existing conditions, and to restate it, I think, more concisely. It provides that the&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;expenses of the council of a county shall, save where it is otherwise provided by law, be charged equally over the whole of the county&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>It is not our intention to change the law, and it is not our intention to allow local authorities to determine for themselves that charges which, under the existing law, would be county-at-large charges shall be imposed upon a particular district.  In general, these county-at-large charges are incurred in respect of services which are general in their application.  There might be the possibility of abuse at one time or another if it were left to a particular section in the county council or a local authority to decide that only one portion of the administrative area over which it has jurisdiction would be made liable for the expenses of services which, as I have indicated, would be of general application.  For that reason, I cannot accept Senator Sweetman's amendment.</P>
    <P>With regard to the point raised by Senator O'Dea, I am afraid that I shall have to take the same attitude, though I will look into the matter and see whether a case can be made for ensuring that expenses which would not be proper to an urban district would not, by reason of the action of the county council, fall on an urban district.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I fail to understand the effects of the section without this amendment.  I can quite see the Minister's point with regard to the cost of something that is already provided as a general county-at-large service being distributed over the whole county. What I want to know is, if a service is <Col N="74" /> provided for a specific area, can the charge for that be made only on that area without amendment?</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasHonan" hpid="Mr. Honan Mr. Honan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to raise a point with regard to the allocation of the county rates in reference to urban areas.  Paragraph (b) of sub-section (6) provides that:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The amount of the expenses to be charged on the urban area or each urban area (as the case may be) shall be the amount which bears to the total amount of the expenses the same proportion as the valuation of such urban area bears to the valuation of the area of charge.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>My point is that when the county council makes its demands on the urban council, the demand is on the gross valuation.  In Ennis we have a gross valuation of £14,000.  The effective valuation is £12,000.  That is due to the fact that we have a lot of stores and big buildings in the town which are valued annually, but out of which we get no rates because they are unoccupied.  The rates on them are not paid by the owners because they are not liable for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The result is that the rate on those unoccupied buildings has to be paid by the general body of the ratepayers. Our point is that the county council demand should be on the effective valuation of the town, which, as I have said, is £12,000, and not on the gross valuation of £14,000.  It seems very unfair to expect the general body of the ratepayers to pay rates on the £2,000, the difference between the gross and the effective valuations.  If <Col N="75" /> the county council were to strike a rate on the effective valuation of the whole county, then everyone would be bearing his proportionate share of the burden of rates.  It would mean that every town and village in which there are vacant premises, such as we have in Ennis, would get relief and that nobody would suffer if that procedure were adopted.  It would mean that the rate would be spread equally over the whole rateable area of the county council.  I hope that the Minister will meet my point and give some relief in the direction I ask.  It is a great injustice on people in urban areas to have to pay rates on a valuation which is not an effective valuation at all.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LouisODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Honan has raised a very important point.  It is a surprise to me that the difference between the actual poor law valuation and the rateable property is so small as £2,000 in the urban area of Ennis, because in any town where a great number of houses were erected under the Housing Acts rates are paid on only one-twentieth of the valuation in the first year.  The full rate on them is not paid for quite a number of years.  In the case of new buildings, rates for the first seven years are paid on only one-third of the valuation.  I know that under the Towns Improvement Acts of 1847 and 1854, land in an urban area is only rateable for one-quarter of the poor law valuation.  In addition, vacant buildings are not liable for rates.  That seems a hardship &mdash;that urban authorities can only levy rates on certain property, and yet the demand made on them is in respect of the gross valuation in their area.  I think the Minister should look into that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two or three points that arise for consideration in this connection.  The first is that it is quite impossible to tell when expenses are being apportioned, what valuation would be effective and what would not be effective.  Therefore, I think the only reasonable basis for apportionment is this: the facts which are definitely known at the time that the rates are being struck.  These facts <Col N="76" /> are: The valuation of the county area and the valuation of the urban area. They can be immediately related to each other and for that reason it is the most convenient, expeditious and simple way of dealing with this problem. The other point is that in so far as towns might be over-valued the urban councils have the remedy in their own hands by asking for revaluation which would dispose of this problem of vacant, unoccupied and over-valued hereditaments.</P>
      <P>There is the third consideration which perhaps has not been adverted to yet and that is if we are to base apportionment on the effective valuation, perhaps the effective valuation of a county council might be found to be proportionately much less than the gross valuation. For instance, it might be a moot point as to what extent agricultural land pays rates and whether it might not be held to be devalued to the extent of two-fifth or three-fifth.</P>

We did consider whether we could not make one common section applicable to county areas and urban areas but if the Senator will consider Part II of the Bill he will see that although the operation of that Part which relates to the county fund and the county rate ends at Section 14, under Sections 15 to 24 the subject matter relates to rating by urban authorities.  The assumption is that some time when the local government law is consolidated we shall have one whole Part, book or volume dealing with local government law as applying to counties and another one dealing with local government law as applying to urban areas. Though this means a certain amount of duplication, we feel it is better it should stand in that way.  It will not need the same amount of disentangling later.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 6:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (1), page 8, line 57, after the word &ldquo;month&rdquo; to insert the words &ldquo;not exceeding six months in all&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The section to which this amendment is submitted deals with the rating of vacant premises.  It provides that, where a house is unoccupied at the time the rate is being struck, the rate will be levied on the owner of the house but he will be entitled, having paid the rate, to a refund of one-twelfth of the amount paid in respect of each month during which the house is unoccupied, provided it is unoccupied in certain circumstances&mdash;that is to say, because it is being repaired or altered, or because additions are being made to it, or because the owner is unable to get a suitable tenant having regard to the provisions of the Rent <Col N="80" /> Restrictions Act.  I think that that is a bad principle to insert in legislation &mdash;that a person may hold a house out of occupation at a time like this on the pretext that he is making additions or alterations, or doing repairs, or because he cannot get a suitable tenant having regard to the provisions of the Rent Restrictions Act.  There is no objection to that claim, provided it is reasonably limited.  The purpose of the amendment is to ensure that the period during which the allowance will be made will be a maximum of six months.  It has been the practice in parts of County Dublin to hold premises out of occupation for ten out of 12 months.  I know a case in which, some years ago, a house was normally let at £70 a year.  That was a big rent, in my opinion, having regard to the character of the house and its value. The owners came to the conclusion that they could do much better by holding it out of occupation for the greater part of the year.  They set the house for the months of July and August at £40 per month and they saved rates for ten months of the year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>I could go into the details but I do not think it is necessary. What we are dealing with is the principle&mdash;whether a person is entitled to hold his house out of occupation for an unlimited period because he says he is doing repairs or alterations.  In the Bill there is no limit to the period. It is a question of allowing one-twelfth of the rates in respect of each month during which the house is unoccupied. <Col N="81" /> I am endeavouring to secure that the house will be kept out of use for a limited period only and I am suggesting six months as that period, which seems to me to be reasonable in normal circumstances.  I understand that, in the City of Dublin, it has been the law up to the present&mdash;I assume it is being altered now&mdash;that a remission of rates was given for six months only.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as Dublin was concerned, the remission of rates was limited to six months.  I think that that six months' limit is being taken away by this Bill and that it will be open to any owner of a house in Dublin to hold his premises out of use so long as he is able to say he is doing so because of inability to let it to advantage having regard to the provisions of the Rent Restrictions Act or that he is held up in a contract for repairs or alterations or additions.  It is quite easy to get a good excuse now for non-completion of a job which involves alterations or additions because of the difficulty in getting building materials.  If he holds his house out of use on those grounds, he should be liable for rates after a period of six months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LouisODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>The law always was that, if a house or premises was unoccupied, it was not liable for rates, no matter how long it remained unoccupied. Then the Increase of Rent and Mortgage Interest Restrictions Act of 1923 contained a provision that, if a house was subject to that Act, and was unoccupied, it was not to be liable for rates.  The 1926 Act provided that it was to remain free of rates for a period of six months if undergoing repairs or if the landlord was unable to get a tenant at the standard rent.  If a tenant offered the standard rent, he was bound to accept him.  Most people thought that an owner was entitled to six months free of rates in every year in these circumstances.  However, a case came before Judge Comyn in the Circuit Court and he held that an owner was entitled only to six months' <Col N="82" /> freedom from rates in all.  If a house was unoccupied for three years, he could only get remission of rates for six months.  That decision was not appealed and has never been reversed. In the last Rent Restrictions Act, the Minister in charge excluded all mention of legislation regarding rates because this Bill contained an omnibus provision dealing with every hereditament, whether house, store or land. Whatever the effect of Senator Duffy's amendment in regard to Section 23 would be, I should be inclined to oppose it in the case of Section 14 because there are towns in different parts of the country where it is very hard to get a tenant for a premises. It would be hard if the owner were bound to pay rates while the house was unoccupied because of inability to get a tenant.  That difficulty arises in certain small towns.  I think that Senator Duffy should not press his amendment in relation to Section 14.</P>

      <P>Does the Senator suggest that there are areas in the country in which houses are so plentiful that the owners cannot get tenants for them? Surely the principle which Senator Duffy is endeavouring to have inserted in this legislation is perfectly sound, that houses shall not be held empty by the owner while there are people desirous of obtaining houses at the standard rent?  That seems a very reasonable proposition to put before the Government. I am rather surprised to hear that there is a number of houses vacant in the part of the country from which Senator O'Dea comes and that the owners cannot get tenants for them. I wish these houses were in Dublin.  I can assure the Senator that the people in Dublin are very anxious to get houses.  We are desirous of ensuring that owners shall not be allowed to leave their houses idle and escape from paying rates simply because they wish to hold them vacant in order to get a rent which most prospective tenants would not be able to pay.  I think the principle enunciated by Senator Duffy in stating his case for the amendment is one that the Minister should accept.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the intentions of Senator Duffy could be effected by <Col N="83" /> another amendment of the section rather than his own, an amendment which I would urge the Minister to introduce on the Report Stage.  This section provides that the owner on paying the rate</P>
      <P>&ldquo;shall be entitled to claim and receive from the council of the county, a refund of one-twelfth of such rate in respect of every completed month during which the hereditament is unoccupied either for the purpose of the execution of additions, alterations or repairs thereto or because the owner is <i>bona fide</i> unable to obtain a suitable tenant therefor, in the case of a hereditament to which the Rent Restrictions Act 1946 (No. 4 of 1946) for the time being applies, at the maximum rent for the time being permitted under that Act, or in the case of any other hereditament at a reasonable rent.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The section provides, therefore, that the owner is entitled to claim and receive a rebate in respect of certain periods during which the house is unoccupied for certain reasons but there is no provision in the section&mdash;a provision which I suggest should be in it &mdash;giving the council power to decide whether or not the house is unoccupied for the purpose of the execution of additions, alterations or repairs or whether it is unoccupied because the owner is unable to obtain a suitable tenant therefor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The section says the owner is entitled to claim and receive a rebate in respect of every month for which the house is unoccupied for certain reasons. The council may say: &ldquo;You can get a tenant&rdquo;, whereas the owner may hold: &ldquo;I cannot get a tenant&rdquo;.  The section is silent as to how that conflict is to be decided.  I, therefore, would suggest that the sections should be amended in some way so as to confer on the county council the power to decide whether the house is vacant for the purpose of the execution of additions, alterations or repairs, or because the owner is <i>bona fide</i> unable to obtain a suitable tenant.  If the council is satisfied that the house is vacant for these reasons, then it would be an injustice to the owner to restrict the <Col N="84" /> period to six months, as Senator Duffy seeks in this amendment.  I think the section itself is vacant, if I may use that word, because of its failing to contain some provision for the purpose of enabling a determination to be made as to the accuracy of the contention of the owner for exemption&mdash;whether the house is vacant because of additions, alterations or repairs, or because he is unable to get a suitable tenant.</P>
    <P>I, therefore, suggest that Senator Duffy should withdraw his amendment, and that between now and the Report Stage the Minister should consider the possibility of inserting in the section some provision which will place the power of determining whether a house is vacant for the purposes mentioned in the section, on the local authority.  It might be amended by a provision of this type: &ldquo;Provided the owner can satisfy the county council that the house is vacant because of additions, alterations or repairs, or because he is unable to obtain a suitable tenant at a proper rent, he shall be entitled to receive from the county council a refund of one-twelfth of the rate in respect of every completed month during which the house is so vacant&rdquo;. I think that would be a solution and it would give certainty to the section. Otherwise, I fear there will be a great deal of controversy between the owner and the county council in respect of refunds of rates.  If Senator Duffy's amendment were accepted, an injustice would be done to an owner whose house is vacant through no fault of his own.  I suggest that Senator Duffy should withdraw his amendment, and that the Minister might seek to amend the section on the lines which I have indicated on the Report Stage.</P>

      <P>I am endeavouring to understand the Senator.  His argument <Col N="85" /> appears to me to bear that meaning and no other meaning.  So far as the enforcement of the local authority's rights are concerned it is simple enough.  The owner says: &ldquo;My house is vacant because I have been doing certain repairs and I am entitled to a certain refund.&rdquo;  The council then says: &ldquo;We do not believe you.&rdquo;  The ordinary court of law, to which both parties will have recourse if there is a dispute, will decide that point.  I am concerned with the gentleman whose house may be vacant from now until the 31st December, 1950, when the Rent Restrictions Act expires, if it expires then.  If not the good old game goes on for the next five or ten years because there is no limitation placed on this Bill and the owner is entitled to a refund of one-twelfth of the rates which have been levied in respect of each month during which the premises have been vacant for the reasons stated, without any limitation of time. How Senator Ryan is going to get over that puzzles me.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>I think if some research were done on this question, it would be found that the late Mr. Kevin O'Higgins agreed with me many years ago to insert this provision protecting an owner against being forced to take an unsuitable tenant.  I still think that there is considerable force in the contention I then made.  I am not dealing with the aspect of repairs; I see Senator Duffy's point that the repairs may go on for a very long time.  But take a very large house, a mansion. Surely it is reasonable that the owner should have some choice of tenant. He could not be expected to let a house of that character, with all its amenities and its lay-out for a person of substantial means, to a tenant who is only paying an inadequate rent and who is not in a position to occupy such a house in a suitable manner and in conformity with the class in the community for which the house was built. I think that difficulty was got over, if my recollection is right, in the past by a valuation limit.  I am a little bit vague about this but the Minister can consult his advisers about it.  I think that rates had to be paid where the house was below a certain valuation. <Col N="86" /> The suitability of the tenant did not apply in certain cases.  Over a certain valuation, covering large houses, the question of the suitability of the tenant alone entered.</P>

      <P>I may be wrong but my recollection is this, that rates had to be paid on houses below a certain valuation.  That was to prevent ordinary houses for people of moderate means being put on the market. Otherwise rents had to be paid, and there was an obligation to pay rates. I think the matter could be considered in the light that vacant houses should have to pay rates if they are below a certain valuation.  Houses above the valuation should be exempt from rates if the owner was unable to find a suitable tenant.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as this amendment is concerned, it is really in connection with the suggestion made by Senator Ryan that I want to say anything. It appears to me, from consideration of the section, that what the section as framed at present does provide is that in effect the owner of the premises has to satisfy the local authority, because the section provides that the rate must be paid and if the owner satisfies the local authority he is keeping it vacant for repairs, that he wants to let it and cannot get a suitable tenant, then the only thing is that he gets the rent back.  I do not know why Senator Ryan wants the section amended to meet that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a point which would meet Senator Duffy.  I do not know why the words <i>bona fide</i> are inserted with regard to the qualifications of tenants.  Would it meet Senator Duffy's point if the <i>bona fide</i> were also inserted in regard to the execution of additions, alterations and repairs?  He seemed to visualise a case where there was going to be a time difficulty in the matter of repairs owing to the present supply situation, and if we had the words <i>bona fide</i> to cover repairs and alterations as well as qualifications of the tenant, <Col N="87" /> I think we might be meeting Senator Duffy to a substantial extent, but I would strongly oppose indeed any suggestion that the overriding authority of a court should be taken away from this section.  The section is correctly phrased in my view, throwing the onus on the owner to prove his case, but, equally, it is only right that that owner should be able to appeal to the court if the local authority is being unfair in their determination of his grounds for an abatement or a refund, to be more accurate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>With respect to the suggestion made by Senator Sweetman in aid of Senator Duffy, I should like to point out that the section as worded repeats the phraseology of four other statutory provisions dealing with this particular problem, and I think that for the sake of uniformity we must adhere to the section as it stands in that regard.  Apart altogether from that, I do not think that it is necessary to raise any question as to the <i>bona fides</i> of the additions, alterations and repairs.  Those are physical matters that can be tested and confirmed by visual inspection.  If the additions are not there, they are not <i>bona fide</i> additions and if they are, they are <i>bona fide.</i>  I do not think, therefore, that there is much credit in that particular suggestion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Sweetman has stated very definitely what the purposes of the section and the ideas behind it are, following the point in that regard given by Senator Ryan.  The purpose of this section is to make vacant or non-usefully occupied premises liable for rates and impose upon the owner of these premises, that is, in this context, the person entitled to occupy them, the liability to pay the rates. He must pay those rates in any event. I think to that extent, Senator Duffy should be satisfied, because hitherto in certain circumstances he was not bound to pay any rates at all.  The next question that arises is this: surely we are not going to require the owner of property which he cannot use to pay rates in respect of it, bearing in mind that the rate is a rough assessment, if you like, on either the income or the <Col N="88" /> assumed benefit to be derived from the occupation of property?  If one cannot occupy the property beneficially it seems to me that your whole case, the fundamental case, for making the property rateable disappears.</P>
    <P>There have been certain encroachments on that principle since the first Mortgage and Rent Restrictions Act was passed and we have gone further in relation to it under certain of the city Acts than even the original Mortgage and Rent Restrictions Act went, but I think we can draw a very definite distinction between the property situated in a county or a small urban area and property situated in a county borough.  As has been pointed out, it is not always easy to get a suitable tenant for property, particularly large buildings, large dwellinghouses, in the country areas and in urban areas.</P>
    <P>Senator Honan, on an earlier section, referred to the position in Ennis. There are large stores comparatively unoccupied or perhaps totally unoccupied there.  That is a common experience in regard to most of our small towns.  The point arises, therefore, whether you are going to encroach so drastically upon what is originally the fundamental principle of the rating law, that you assess a man for rates upon the benefit which he derived from the occupation of the property, when in fact he derives no benefit at all from that occupation.</P>
    <P>We have taken the line here that, in certain circumstances&mdash;first of all, where he is unable to get a suitable tenant so that so far as he is concerned the property might as well not exist, so that it might be better for him to pull the whole thing down, or secondly, where he is engaged in improving the property so that he may more easily be able to secure a suitable tenant&mdash;he will not be bound to pay rates during the period he has the premises unoccupied for those purposes.  I think that is a perfectly reasonable position to take up and I cannot see any real public benefit in imposing any limitation upon the operation of that principle. It is quite possible that, for one reason or another, the person may <Col N="89" /> not be able to carry out the additions, alterations or repairs within the period of six months.  It is quite possible also that he may not be able to get a suitable tenant within a period of six months.  The position the owner is in is that he has to show cause before he can get a refund.  The money is paid, in the first instance, to the county council in the case of Section 14 and he has to make his case to the county manager before he can get a refund.  Every refund which the county manager makes will be subject to audit and, therefore, the county manager will satisfy himself beyond any reasonable doubt that the conditions of the section are being fulfilled.</P>
    <P>I have a certain amount of sympathy with the point of view which was urged here by Senator Ryan.  It has been indicated to me that in a certain county borough it is very difficult for a person who is entitled to a refund, under a corresponding provision in that City Act, to secure the refund.  It might be, perhaps, that some part of that difficulty arises from the form in which these sections were drafted originally.</P>

      <P>Perhaps Senator Sir John Keane would allow Senator Ryan to correct me, if I am wrong.  I understood the Senator to suggest that there was a certain vagueness about the section as at present drafted, which made it somewhat difficult to say when this determination had been made and, therefore, if a person wanted to take his case to court he would be somewhat uncertain&mdash;I do not know exactly how the lawyers would put it&mdash;as to the particular fact upon which he would ground his claim.  Perhaps it is advisable that we should have some sort of preliminary determination, whereby a manager acting on behalf of his local authority&mdash;this would be a managerial <Col N="90" /> function&mdash;would say: &ldquo;I find that these premises, though unoccupied, are not unoccupied for any of the purposes which would entitle you to a refund&rdquo; and there might be an appeal from that to the local Circuit Court on the matter. If that is what Senator Ryan had in view, I would certainly be prepared to consider an amendment on the Report Stage which would prescribe some sort of procedure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I did not make myself quite clear.  The section provides that the owner must pay the rates in the first instance to the county council, whether the premises are occupied or unoccupied.  If they are unoccupied, for certain reasons, he is entitled to get a refund of one-twelfth in respect of each month during which they are vacant.  The local authority will make the refund.  The section provides that the owner shall be entitled to claim and receive from the local authority a refund in a certain event.  In the first place, who is to decide whether the event has happened, on the happening of which the owner who has paid his rates is entitled to receive a refund?  It is easy enough for the local authority to satisfy itself, if the premises are alleged to be vacant by reason of additions, alterations or <Col N="91" /> repairs.  They are, as the Minister said, visual matters which can be ascertained quite easily and about which there can be very little dispute.</P>
      <P>There might, however, be very great dispute about the ability of the owner to obtain a suitable tenant at a reasonable rent.  That question would involve a great deal of evidence on the part of the owner who was applying for the refund and, perhaps, a great deal of inquiry to test the owner's evidence. If the owner should say: &ldquo;I cannot find a suitable tenant at a reasonable rent,&rdquo; the local authority may ask: &ldquo;What rent were you looking for; what tenants made application to you and what rents were they prepared to pay?&rdquo; Then it would be a matter for the local authority to say to itself: &ldquo;What would be a suitable rent for these premises and who would be a suitable tenant?&rdquo; These are questions of fact which the local authority would take it upon itself to decide before making the refund.  The local authority&mdash;in other words, the county manager&mdash;may sit tight and do nothing, with the result that the ratepayer would be compelled to go to court to seek a refund.  Then the circuit judge or the district justice would have to hear this matter over again.  Even at the risk of giving the benefit of the determination to the local authority, I say there should be some certainty in the section as to the determination of these facts, so that there will not be endless lawsuits on the point.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I first spoke on the Senator's amendment, and I think that we are on it still.  My idea is to make the section work, to prevent the possibility of unpleasantness and litigation between the ratepayers and the local authority.  I may be wrong, but even at the risk of being wrong or, perhaps, unjust, I would like to be certain.  Therefore, I suggest that the section should contain some provision for the determination of these questions of fact by some authority, and that that authority should be final.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the only substantial <Col N="92" /> point that was made in regard to the amendment was that which was made by the Minister when he said that rates are valued on the advantages which the ratepayer derives from his property.  That is the principle, but it has been forgotten for a long number of years.  I have known farmers whose cattle were seized for rates and who, on the following day, got home assistance from the local authority that seized them.  Surely, it is not the practice to levy rates only in relation to the advantages derived from property. That may be true in regard to investments in house property, but it is not true in regard to landed property. There are houses in the city, some of them no doubt outside the provisions of the Rent Restrictions Act, which have been held out of use for two, three and four years because the owners were demanding rents that nobody in the locality would pay.  In those circumstances the houses became vacant.  Most of us remember areas in the central part of Dublin, shops for instance in Grafton Street, which were vacant for years.  In fact, at one stage those vacant shops were becoming an eyesore in the heart of the city.  It occurred to me that the local authority, if it had the power, should exercise it to compel the owners to seek tenants or else dispose of the property.  If the local authority had not that power then it should be conferred on it.</P>
      <P>That is also true of places other than Dublin.  It is true that for one reason or another house property is held out of use because the landlord hopes, particularly if he has a number of houses and in that way has a monopoly of a certain type of house in a small town, to force rents so much that his income will be increased substantially. I am anxious that such anti-social conduct would not be permitted, and that this Bill would ensure that a time limit will be placed on the circumstances in which the owner of property can go to the local authority and demand a refund of rates which he has already paid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with the Minister that part of my purpose is achieved when the owner is, in the first place, required to pay the rates.  When the rates are <Col N="93" /> struck by the local authority, the demand note is served on the owner of the property.  If it is not occupied at the time the rate is struck, the owner is required to pay the rate which is leviable by the local authority.  I agree that that is a big achievement. The next step lies with the owner.  He goes to the local authority and makes the claim that he is entitled to a refund because, in certain circumstances which are within the section, the premises are vacant. I want a limitation placed on the period in respect of which that claim will be valid.  I am not making the claim for any personal reasons, or for the purpose of getting at somebody, or at any particular class, but rather for social reasons which are comprehensible to every member of the House at a time when we have passed a Rent Restrictions Act in order to prevent the exploitation of people looking for vacant houses.  That Rent Restrictions Act does not apply, in certain circumstances, to business premises.  I am anxious that business premises will not be held out of use in the important thoroughfares of our cities and towns, so far as we can make it unprofitable for an owner who unreasonably holds these premises out of use.  I would strongly urge on the Minister to look into this matter again from the point of view of the community and of the amenities in our cities and towns.  No person should be allowed to go on for 12 months or for two or three years saying that he was improving his property, or that he was doing alterations that were going to be very slow or tedious, that he wanted to get tradesmen back from France or Italy to put in ornamental ceilings, or that he was waiting to buy fireplaces in some auction room in London. None of these reasons should be accepted as a reasonable ground on which to seek remission of rates.  It is true, no doubt, that there is no definition of the word &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; in the Bill.  In the last analysis, it is a question for the courts to determine what is or what is not reasonable.  I ask the Minister to say that the court may decide that within some limitation. I do not want to adhere strictly to the term of six months if a case <Col N="94" /> can be made for making it 12 months, but I am unwilling to see a longer period than six months or 12 months allowed to give effect to the provision in the section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir John Keane Sir John Keane">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Duffy has widened the whole purview of this matter.  In so far as he was anxious that houses should not be kept empty as dwellings I was to a certain extent in sympathy with him.  I would be quite prepared to see that houses below a certain valuation should pay rates, if kept unoccupied.  But the Senator is extending this now to business premises.  Surely, that is a totally different matter.  Trade, for example, may easily languish in a quarter because it was found totally unprofitable to try to carry it on.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LouisODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir John Keane Sir John Keane">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think Senator O'Dea has got my point correctly. I am not objecting that owners should have to pay rates in advance.  I am not objecting to having to pay rates in advance, but what I am concerned about is the right to recover rates already paid in advance on vacant premises.  Whatever argument there may be in favour of having to pay rates on dwellings, it is most unreasonable to compel a landlord to let a business premises when there is no demand in the district. That is utterly impossible.  There may be nobody forthcoming.  There may be no trade there or the district may become an unfashionable quarter. Why should there be any pressure placed, in such a case, on the owner and the landlord to let?  That is utterly unreasonable.</P>
      <P>In considering this matter, I should like the Minister to tell the House what is the existing law in regard to rates on vacant premises.  I thought that rates had to be paid on premises below a certain valuation and that premises above a certain valuation were exempt, but I wonder am I wrong.  What is the existing law?</P>

      <P>On Section 14, I would like to know exactly what we are doing because the provision here states if the house is subsequently let and any rate is unpaid.  I would like to know what that means.  Does it mean that if the rate is refunded to the owner that it is held to be unpaid in respect of the period during which it is refunded? It should be made clear that if the rate is refunded, the rate will be presumed to have been paid in respect of the period for which it was refunded.</P>

      <P>Then that should be made clear.  There is another reference here which states that notice may be served on the tenant and the rent collected from him until all the arrears are paid.  The existing law is that the subsequent occupier is only liable for two years' rates.  Is it the intention of the Minister to repeal that section, or is the tenant to be in the position of a subsequent occupier and liable only for two years' rates?  The law should be consistent in that matter and the House should know what we are doing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Senator will bear with me for a moment, I will explain the position.  It may happen that premises are unoccupied and that the owner does not pay the rates, and therefore, since he is not paying the rates, we must assume that he would <Col N="96" /> not be entitled to a refund.  The owner, therefore, owes rates to the local authority.  Subsequently he lets the premises and what is provided in sub-section (2) is that the occupier, in lieu of paying rent to the owner, will satisfy the claim of the local authority against the owner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LouisODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>That is for two years. Supposing a house was vacant for six years and no rates paid on it, is the local authority entitled to claim six years' rates from the subsequent occupier?  That should be made clear because it is not consistent with Section 20 of the Act of 1864 which refers to rates limited to two years.</P>

      <P>Yes, and I wanted to include the two for the purpose of saving expense.  I wish to insert the words: &ldquo;To which the Towns Improvement Clauses Act, 1847, applies&rdquo;. This is an important section, because there are different old Acts and some of them are hard to find.  We have the Galway Town Improvements Act, passed nearly 100 years ago, and that made provision that where a lease was given a tenant the landlord was bound to pay half the local rates, that is to say, the town rates&mdash;for paving, repairs, sanitation and improvements. That is still the law and, so far as our town is concerned, there must be an adjustment of rents held under lease. I am sure that applies to several other towns also.  One of the difficulties about this Act is that there are only about two copies in existence.  It is not published in the official reports of the English Parliament.  It is very hard to get it and very few people know about it.  I am sure the same thing applies to other towns.  I think if the Minister could amalgamate the two things referred to as an urban area or a town which comes under the Towns Improvement Act it would be a good thing.</P>

      <P>I move amendments Nos. 13, 14 and 16 as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>13.  In sub-section (1) to add at the end of the sub-section the words:&mdash;&ldquo;or with the consent of the Minister borrow the deficiency by means of a loan repayable within two years from the raising thereof.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>14.  In sub-section (3) to add at the end of the sub-section the words:&mdash;&ldquo;unless they shall raise the amount by means of a loan in the manner provided for in sub-section (1) of this section&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>16.  In sub-section (6) to add at the end of the sub-section the words:&mdash;&ldquo;or raise the deficiency by means of a loan in the manner provided for in sub-section (1) of this section&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The section provides that, after an inquiry is held and the county council is directed that the rate is insufficient, they are to be asked to levy and collect another rate.  The expense of that would be very heavy in some counties. In our county, the making of the rate costs about £1,500, £600 being due to adjustments owing to the agricultural grant.  The making of a new rate would cost about £600.  That would pay interest on a large sum of money.  I should prefer the Minister to give power to the council to raise the necessary <Col N="100" /> amount by loan repayable in a year or two years.  That would be in ease of the council.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I should be very reluctant to agree to that proposal.  I am not certain that, if it should become necessary to avail of the powers under this section, it would be so expensive to make a supplementary rate.  We may take it that proceedings under the section would be fairly expeditious and that it would be only in an extreme case it would be necessary to make a supplementary rate at all.  The rate would, probably, be made before the actual applotments had taken place. Apart from that it would be rather bad practice if we allowed either the council or the commissioner administering its affairs to borrow for this purpose. It is conceivable that, in order to evade meeting their proper obligations in a particular year, the council of a county might strike an insufficient rate and then come along, under some such provision as Senator O'Dea suggests, and say: &ldquo;We shall raise a supplementary sum by borrowing&rdquo;.  The principle is that moneys should not be borrowed unless proper provision is made to raise the revenues to repay them.  If you allowed a local authority deliberately to refuse to make provision to meet its current liabilities and permitted them to borrow for that purpose, you would be rather stultifying yourself.  I shall look into this matter in view of what the Senator has said as to the cost but I do not promise to do anything about it between now and Report Stage.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 15 and also amendments Nos. 45 and 46 as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>15.  In sub-section (5), line 42, after the word &ldquo;Act&rdquo; to insert the words &ldquo;as amended by this Act&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="101" /> 45.  Before Section 95 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>()  Section 44 of the Act of 1941 is hereby amended by the deletion of paragraph (a) in sub-section (1) and the substitution therefor of the following paragraph:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  The Minister, after holding a local inquiry into the performance by the local authority of their duties and after publishing any report made to him by the inspector who held such local inquiry, is satisfied that such duties are not being duly and effectually performed or.</P>
    <P>46.  Before Section 95 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>()  Section 45 of the Act of 1941 is hereby amended by the deletion of sub-section (2) and the substitution therefor of the following sub-section:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(2)  The day fixed under this section for the holding of a new election shall be any day within the period of twelve months after such removal.</P>
    <P>I put down those amendments to raise a matter of principle.  That matter arises in connection with Section 30.  It did not seem to me that the proposal to delete the section completely met the case I have in mind.  I am not prepared to take the line that there are no conceivable circumstances in which it might be necessary to provide for the striking of an adequate rate, particularly to meet services required by law.  It has always seemed to me that the present system by which the Minister can hold an inquiry, make his own comments on the report of the inquiry, which comes to him secretly, and then by Order abolish a local body and keep it abolished for approximately three years is most undemocratic and extremely unsatisfactory.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that, in accordance with democratic principles, the only conceivable ground on which a local body should be abolished is because it is not carrying out the purpose for which it was elected and that the people who should ultimately decide what kind of body they require in a <Col N="102" /> locality are the electors, according to law.  To my mind, if there is an inquiry, that inquiry should be held by a person who will know that his report will be made public.  If the Minister considers that the nature of a report is such that the local body should be abolished, then the report should be made public.  The reason for making it public is the desirability of placing the electors in a position to know the reasons why the persons whom they elected have been removed from office and within a period, which I think should not be more than 12 months, they should be given an opportunity of electing other persons who will carry out the duties of that body.  It may be said that the local electors may refuse to elect a suitable body.  My answer to that is that, if that be so, you should abolish local government altogether or let them have their way. Coercion from central sources is not calculated to produce a healthy system of local government.</P>
    <P>The position at the moment is that nobody knows what the nature of the independent report is.  All they know is the comment that the Minister or the Parliamentary Secretary thinks fit to make.  Then, obviously, it could become simply a Party issue and it would probably be forgotten, in any case, by the time five years have elapsed.  I want to raise three points. Clearly, they would apply to the operation of Section 30 if by any miracle the amendments were carried. This is not the age of miracles, but this is the time to put forward what you believe is a sound principle.  It is the only occasion on which it can be done.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;For the purpose of Part IV of the Act of 1941 an Order under sub-section (4) of this section shall be deemed to be an Order under Section 44 of that Act.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That is deemed to be under Section 44 of the Act of 1941.  This amendment proposes that after the word &ldquo;Act&rdquo; the words &ldquo;as amended by this Act&rdquo; shall be deemed to be an Order under Section 44 as amended by this Act. Section 44 is not amended at all. There is, of course, the addition of a certain paragraph later on in respect of Section 44, but you are only deeming it to be an Order under it.  It is not an Order under it.  It is a kind of notional Order under it.  I would suggest that the section is all right as it stands and the amendment does not improve it and is unnecessary.  I do not understand it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the case for discussing these three amendments is this: Section 30 proposes that, under certain circumstances, the functions of a local authority shall be taken over by the Minister.  That is what Section 30 means.  Amendment No. 15 is rendered necessary by the fact that Senator Douglas wants to introduce a new section later on in accordance with amendments Nos. 45 and 46, which would ensure before a local body had its functions taken over, certain things would have to happen.  If these provisions were accepted and a local inquiry held, the report of the inquiry should be published and the local body should be abolished but a new election should be held within 12 months.  If <Col N="106" /> this section was implemented, then the powers the Minister seeks would be granted and we would ask that Section 30 be completed.  It is in that way that amendments Nos. 15, 45 and 46 may be discussed together.  That is a common practice on the Committee Stage of Bills.  The Minister knows that before he proposes the abolition of a local body and takes over power to strike a rate, he is asked to agree with the principles of amendments Nos. 45 and 46.  If he does, the objections to Section 30 as it stands disappear. Perhaps that is clear now?</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 17:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="108" /> At the end of the section to add a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>()  A copy of the report of any local inquiry under sub-section (1) of this section shall be sent to the rating authority concerned at least 14 days before the issue of a notification under sub-section (2) of this section.</P>
    <P>This amendment must be viewed against the background of forthcoming local government reform.  The Minister has said, earlier in the debate, that I was attempting to anticipate legislation.  I certainly think that by this Section 30 he is attempting to anticipate legislation&mdash;as I admit some of us are&mdash;before the other House which is only held up for the moment and which proposes to make a totally radical departure in the principles and the spirit of local government.</P>
    <P>That legislation proposes, without consulting the local authority, to impose burdens of undisclosed and untold magnitude on the local authority, and, in view of that possibility, the Minister is now taking power to abolish without giving reasons such local authorities as refuse to accept burdens of heavy magnitude with regard to which they have never been consulted.  As a generalisation, I say that is a radical departure from the spirit of local government.</P>
    <P>Hitherto, in the process of development, local authorities have been, by and large, consulted in respect of services which they have to undertake. I would like, at the outset, the Minister to say why he has departed from the section and substituted this section for Section 23 as it was in the original Bill he introduced.  The measure as introduced imposed on the local authority the obligation to strike an additional further rate if the original rate was insufficient, and there the matter ended.</P>
    <P>The Minister has always had certain powers to abolish local authorities but not in the manner intended here, and he now comes along with his dictatorial proposals to abolish&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>On a point of order, Senator Sir John Keane is moving <Col N="109" /> amendment No. 17, which is to add to the section dealing with a local inquiry. I submit he is discussing the section although it has not yet come up for discussion.  It is a question of a point of order.</P>

      <P>A suggestion has been made and more or less agreed to that we take the Hire Purchase Bill and <Col N="110" /> finish it to-morrow night.  It is suggested that we resume the Local Government Bill to-morrow at 3 and that we should not sit on Friday.  The Minister for Local Government will not be available on Friday and we have to contact the Minister for Industry and Commerce who is speaking in the Dáil at the moment, but we have taken it for granted that he will be available.</P>
