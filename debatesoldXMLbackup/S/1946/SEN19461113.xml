      <P>Senators will be aware generally from the discussion in the Dáil and from Press reports of the purpose for which this Bill is introduced. No doubt, however, they will be desirous of some detailed information on the main aspects of the Bill, and, in furnishing this, I wish to take the opportunity to correct certain misapprehensions which the debate in the Dáil showed to exist.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First, I should like to say something about the present state of the telephone service, which is frequently now the object of severe criticism.  I know that the standard of service generally is not as high as we would wish.  Trunk calls suffer heavy delay; calls in the Dublin automatic area are often difficult to obtain and when obtained sometimes break down; there is at times delay in answering subscribers dialling &ldquo;O&rdquo; or &ldquo;31.&rdquo;  This deterioration is due to the fact that for more than six years it has been almost impossible to obtain supplies of equipment in the <Col N="4" /> quantities needed and during that same period traffic has grown at a phenomenal rate.  Between 1938 and 1945 trunk calls increased from 3,300,000 to 7,118,000 and local calls in the same period increased from 30,000,000 to 48,000,000.  Extra traffic on such a scale could not be carried satisfactorily without an enormous expansion of our telephone system all over the country.  We entered the war period with what then represented three years' reserve supply of equipment, but the huge demands for military and Gárda circuits, coupled with the growth of traffic, soon swallowed up this reserve.  From then on every extra call meant an extra load on the existing system and as calls continued to mount at an unprecedented rate the standard of service was bound to suffer.  The surprising thing is not that the standard deteriorated under these conditions but that it was possible to avoid a breakdown.  I say with confidence that there is not a single other commodity or service depending almost entirely on imported raw material which has been supplied to the public in quantities equivalent to double the pre-war supply, even with a reduction in quality.  That it has been possible for the telephone service to do this is due to the foresight shown in ordering reserve supplies before the war; due to the ingenuity of our engineering staff in prolonging the life of items of equipment long since due for replacement and devising new methods to make it carry a heavier load; and due to the whole-hearted co-operation of the operating staff.</P>
    <P>This staff has been working under difficult conditions with outworn and inadequate equipment striving all the time to give the public the very best service possible.  I would say to the staff to respond to criticism and unfair abuse as Cuchulainn did when abused in battle by his charioteer and to maintain their efforts to cope with a very difficult situation.</P>
    <P>While on this subject I would like, if I may, to correct a common misapprehension regarding delay which subscribers sometimes experience when they dial &ldquo;O&rdquo;.  Many subscribers are under the impression that because they do not get the engaged tone there is no lack of equipment and that the delay <Col N="5" /> is due therefore either to neglect by the staff, or to lack of staff.  This is not so.  When a caller dials &ldquo;O&rdquo; a lamp lights on a number of switchboards in the Trunk Exchange and an operator at any one of these switchboards can answer the call.  But our trouble is that frequently so many lamps are lighting together that all cannot be answered quickly.  Clearly, the number of operators that can be employed answering calls is limited by the number of switchboards; and until we can get more switchboards for the Trunk Exchange delay in answering cannot be avoided at busy periods. Contrary to the view sometimes held by people with inadequate knowledge, there is no effort whatever to stint staff.  Staff is provided on the most generous scale, the only limiting factor being the capacity, with limited equipment, to train them.</P>
    <P>The trouble being experienced by users of the Dublin automatic system is due purely and simply to the facts that a load is being imposed on the automatic exchanges which they were never intended to bear and that many parts of the equipment in the exchanges need renewal.</P>
    <P>The position at other exchanges is similar; equipment is in need of extension or replacement at almost every exchange of any size throughout the country.</P>
    <P>I have dealt at some length with the present state of the telephone service so that the volume of work to be carried out before universal improvement can be effected may be appreciated.  To any reasonable person the causes of the present unsatisfactory conditions are self-evident and sufficient, and it is equally clear that the deficiency of five years or more cannot be made good in a day or month.  What can be expected is that nothing will be left undone to speed the work of renewal and extension and to bring the service to a high pitch of efficiency in the least possible time.  This is our object and it is for this purpose, as well as to provide for a huge increase in the number of subscribers, that a sum of £6,000,000 is now being sought which we expect to spend in the next four to five years.  The total cost of the scheme which has been planned will be not less than <Col N="6" /> £10,000,000 but, in accordance with practice, only the amount estimated to be spent in the next four to five years is asked for in this Bill.  As a measure of the volume of expansion which it is intended to carry out, I may remark that the total outlay hitherto on the telephone service since it was taken over from the National Telephone Company in 1912 has been £3,500,000.</P>
    <P>The annual charges on the capital expenditure proposed will, of course, impose a heavy burden on telephone revenue for many years ahead but I am confident that revenue will rapidly increase, and although a loss may be incurred for a few years it will quickly be overtaken as more plant becomes revenue-earning.</P>
    <P>The development scheme planned provides for trebling the number of subscribers, but plant and equipment will be so laid out that a much bigger number can readily be catered for if the demand exceeds our expectations. While this will be done we shall, like all telephone administrations throughout the world, guard against providing plant too far in advance of its being required.  Obviously, there is no advantage to the users of the service in having extensive equipment lying idle for many years with heavy charges for interest and depreciation throwing an unnecessary burden on telephone revenue and perhaps preventing tariff concessions which might otherwise be possible from being given to subscribers.</P>
    <P>I fully recognise that the best advertisement for the service will be to give satisfaction to existing users and this we intend to do.  We shall give &ldquo;demand&rdquo; service on trunk calls; that is, almost every trunk call from any point to any other point will be connected without the caller having to leave the telephone.  Kiosks and call offices will be provided extensively on a most generous scale; continuous service will be given at all but the very smallest exchanges and for this purpose automatic exchanges will be installed instead of the present manual ones.</P>
    <P>The size of the programme of work which must be carried out in order to effect these improvements and to cater <Col N="7" /> for new subscribers in the numbers expected can be gathered from the figures of cost which I have given, and from the following details:&mdash;</P>
    <P>New underground cable containing subscribers' circuits will have to be laid in every city and town; and more than 600 new automatic and semi-automatic exchanges as well as about 50 special manual exchanges to deal with trunk calls, inquiries, etc., must be installed. To house the large automatic exchanges, about 130 new buildings will be needed, and accommodation for the manual exchanges will involve either the extensive alteration of existing premises, the acquisition of additional premises or the erection of new buildings. The trunk network must be increased six to eight-fold and this will involve laying underground trunk cables extensively.  To give a satisfactory service on cross-Channel calls a new submarine cable will be laid.</P>
    <P>The main headings under which the £6,000,000 asked for in this Bill will be spent and the amount under each heading are as follows:&mdash;New exchanges and buildings, £2,072,000; trunk circuits, £2,400,000; subscribers' circuits, £1,360,000; kiosks and call offices, £275,000; other works, £245,000, giving a total of £6,352,000, which has been rounded down to £6,000,000.</P>
    <P>The works programme for buildings alone is a huge one and in order to secure the utmost speed in executing it the Commissioners of Public Works, who are, of course, responsible for buildings, have set up a special section comprising experienced technical staff to deal with Post Office buildings alone.</P>
    <P>As regards plant and equipment, I must explain that major improvements will take a considerable time to effect. Apart from the building problem, manufacture and installation of a major automatic exchange takes, under the most favourable conditions, about 18 months; a trunk cable from Dublin to Cork will take two to three years to manufacture and lay.  I should say, too, that, contrary to the view of many people, the supply position is as yet far from satisfactory.  Lead required for cables, and steel pipe to house the cables, are scarce and difficult to obtain <Col N="8" /> in the quantities we need.  No effort is being spared to secure the maximum supply available, and representatives of our engineering branch and stores department have paid frequent visits to England with a view to securing the earliest possible delivery of materials required.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, while the various phases of our works programme will so far as possible be advanced concurrently, some few years must elapse before the service can be made universally satisfactory.</P>
    <P>Considerable progress has already been made with the Department's plans.  Extensions of all the Dublin automatic exchanges are at present being carried out and will, we hope, be completed by next summer.  Contracts have been placed for new exchanges in Cork and Waterford.  Automatic exchanges are on order for another 20 towns.  Arrangements are being made for laying underground trunk cables, which will permanently eliminate delay to trunk calls on the routes concerned. Sites are being obtained for new exchanges in various towns.  Arrangements have been settled in conjunction with the British Post Office for laying a new cross-Channel cable next year which will enable a &ldquo;no delay&rdquo; service to be given on cross-Channel calls.</P>
    <P>In proceeding with long term plans which cannot fully mature for many years, the Department is not overlooking the need for giving earlier temporary relief where possible.  Pending the installation of the 600 automatic exchanges proposed, which will take many years to effect, a better service must be given to existing subscribers and new subscribers must be catered for.  To meet this situation the existing manual exchanges are being replaced or enlarged to the utmost extent possible. Already 18 large manual exchanges and numerous smaller exchanges have been dealt with.  To improve the trunk service in advance of laying cables, 30 three-channel carrier systems have been obtained recently and 30 more are on order.  When the necessary overhead wires are erected and these systems installed, a substantial reduction of the delay to trunk calls in many areas will be effected.</P>
    <P>In Dublin, the work of erecting the <Col N="9" /> new trunk exchange buildings in St. Andrew Street will begin next year but it will be some years before the building is completed and the elaborate equipment required is installed.  In order, therefore, to take time by the forelock we have placed an order for a large part of the equipment intended for St. Andrew Street exchange and this will be installed temporarily at other premises in Exchequer Street which during the war housed the censorship staff.</P>
    <P>I should like to say something about the possibility of giving telephones to the thousands of people whose applications we hold.  During the emergency we had to impose restrictions on the connection of new subscribers although we did succeed in meeting all really essential demands for service by public authorities, doctors, etc., as well as a substantial proportion of applications for business lines.  I may mention that most if not all other telephone administrations had to apply similar restrictions; and it is of interest to note that in the United States of America, which is one of the largest manufacturers of telephone equipment, there were about 2,000,000 people awaiting telephone service shortly after the end of the war.</P>
    <P>The time which must elapse before all applications can be dealt with varies from place to place according to the plant position in different areas. Already waiting applicants have been dealt with in those areas served by small exchanges which can be fairly readily enlarged.  In Dublin, all applications for business lines in the Dún Laoghaire, Rathmines and Terenure areas will be dealt with shortly and when the extension of the automatic exchanges is completed next summer, we shall make rapid inroads on the arrears of applications.  Other areas will be dealt with as rapidly as new exchanges can be installed or the present exchanges enlarged.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I may say that the plans are ready to provide a first class service for all subscribers and to encourage and cater for an extension of the telephone system on the widest possible scale.  The money asked for in this Bill is required to carry out these plans.  In the five year period we <Col N="10" /> propose to have installed (a) a telephone call office in every Post Office. This scheme includes 900 new call offices and (b) we propose also to have installed within that period all equipment required to deal with any public demand that is likely to arise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>Before entering upon this Bill, as I happen to be the first Senator to speak to-day perhaps I might remark upon the really beautiful work of restoration that has been done in this Chamber during the recess.  A word of congratulation is due to the Cathaoirleach and the officers of the House for the way in which that work has been carried out.  I feel sure the House, as a House, would be glad to give a word of praise to the Office of Public Works, for what has been done here.  It is a great thing to observe that there survives still among Dublin workmen the tradition of fine work for which the city was once famous.  We are proud to see such splendid work done here.  I know that the Clerk devoted a great deal of his time during the vacation to it.  One of the dearest wishes of his life was to see the ceiling restored as we now have it.</P>
      <P>With regard to this Bill, quite plainly it must be passed.  The Minister's speech sounded rather like a number of aspirations.  He hopes in the future to do every single thing that everybody asked him or any other Minister for Posts and Telegraphs to do.  I hope he will be successful and that he will get every assistance from everybody concerned.  I trust that the shortage of materials which now hampers him will disappear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have to recognise that the telephone is really as much a part of modern house equipment as a water supply or lighting.  It is the aim of the Minister to make the telephone almost as widespread as a water supply or lighting.  The Minister spoke of the staff.  As a rather substantial user of the telephone, I have always found the staff willing, courteous and helpful. They have, of course, been hampered by bad equipment and in many cases, I think, by insufficiency of space.  The Minister said they reacted like Cuchulainn, the ancient hero, who had a charioteer who was hired to abuse <Col N="11" /> him and spur him on to greater efforts. But there is a great difference between Cuchulainn and the unfortunate Post Office telephonists.  Cuchulainn was a god and was not subject to the frailties of human nature.  The Post Office official is a person who needs to eat and even to drink and who needs good treatment.</P>
    <P>I suggest that neither praise nor blame will be effective in making the telephone service better without a better provision of payment and better treatment for the staff.  The Post Office has the disadvantage of being the Cinderella of the services.  It is the only one of the services which runs on a business basis and it is one of the services in which the members are worst paid.  I feel that the Minister's tributes and the tributes of everybody else will be looked at rather askance by the hard-pressed staff unless they are accompanied by something of more substance than either praise or blame.</P>
    <P>Apparently, we are becoming more and more closely connected with England. I think it was the Minister's friend, Tom Kettle, who once said that Ireland was separated from England by the Irish Sea, the Tory Party and the Act of Union.  Now that the Tory Party and the Act of Union have gone, we seem to be coming closer to England every day.  The improvement in the telephone service will come gradually and when the Minister realises his ideal&mdash;as I hope he or some other Minister will&mdash;of providing three times as many telephones, it strikes me that the telephone service will be even more self-supporting than it is at present. Anyone who has business or even non-business calls to make will find that the telephone service is much more satisfactory and in the end much cheaper than the telegraphic or telegram service.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister would be able to extend it further if one at least of the charges could be reduced.  The one which deters people from getting in a telephone is the initial charge of £5 a year, which is equivalent to 2d. a call at a public call box for 300 calls every three months.  People who have a considerable number of calls to make do not regard the £5 as very much, but <Col N="12" /> those who have a comparatively small number think the £5 is a substantial expenditure.  That initial charge may hamper the development of the telephone service when materials are available. When this development the Minister has indicated has taken place, perhaps he could look into the question of reducing that particular charge.</P>
    <P>He told us that staff was provided on the most generous terms.  Speaking as a person with some experience of the Department of Finance, I have the greatest difficulty in believing that.  I want to cast no aspersions whatever on the Minister's veracity, but if the Department of Finance is providing staff on generous terms to any Department there must be something remarkable about it.  Perhaps the Minister would let us into the secret or tell his colleagues how it is done, as the Department is departing from its usual practice. Surely no profit should be made on a service such as the telephone service. It is very embarrassing in the country in certain areas to find that the service exists only up to 7 or 8 o'clock in the evening.  There is the possibility of ringing up from the Gárda barracks, but that puts a certain burden on the Gárdaí, although they generally are very courteous about it.  I hope the plans the Minister has in mind will be capable of achievement and that, in achieving them, he will consider that a service which makes a profit should give more generous treatment to those who are engaged in operating it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Summerfield</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously, comment on a Bill of this kind could be directed from many angles and Senator Hayes has directed it from angles which I do not propose to follow.  I would like to join with him, first of all, in his meed of praise to those responsible for the lovely work we see around us in this Chamber.  I think we all join in expressing sympathy with the Minister before us to-day on the very difficult time his Department has gone through in the past few years.  Whilst congratulating him for the excellent work his staff have done, I do not think he will be offended if I remind him that much of the inconvenience the public has put up with in the past few years has been tolerated simply in <Col N="13" /> the hope that, as and when the war conditions ended, the things which gave legitimate cause for growling would speedily be removed.</P>
      <P>Frankly, I am alarmed that this Bill is going to mean an extension.  If the telephone service has three times the existing number of subscribers, I hope that does not mean that the bulk of the money for this development will go towards providing those extra subscribers in such a way that they will have just as much cause for complaint as the present subscribers.</P>
      <P>I feel the Minister might give us a little bit more emphasis on what he intends to do in regard to those subscribers, business and others, who have had a service over the past few years that did not give them value for the money they paid.  The existing subscribers should be given the best possible service before there is any extension at all.  I do not mean by that that there should be no extension to new subscribers in the cities and other centres, but before any large-scale extension is made in the creation of new telephone areas, everything should be done to perfect the service to those who have endured an imperfect service over the past few years.  They have been paying for something they did not get and I will not elaborate on that as anything I say can only emphasise my point that there is legitimate cause for complaint.</P>
      <P>We all have had the unfortunate experience of waiting hours for trunk calls.  What that has meant in loss of money to business concerns no man in this House can compute.  Many big contracts have been lost and many big business deals have failed to mature because men could not contact their opposite numbers in time.  That has been put up with, not merely reasonably but with a great degree of cheerfulness, because of the existing difficulties. The business community and the general community would express the wish that a perfect service should be provided for existing subscribers. Then, by all means, let us have the widest possible extension of this wonderful service right through the State.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Counihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no complaint <Col N="14" /> to make against the Post Office or the Minister, but would ask the Minister to consider favourably the request which has been sent to him from the national executive of the cattle trade, to get a priority service on the fair day from the different fairs to the shipping companies. We feel that there could be half an hour or an hour given to calls from the cattle exporters on the fair day.  There is no fair held in any town more often than once a month and the half hour or hour would not cause great inconvenience.  The majority of the traders in the towns concerned would be glad to give the facilities which the cattle traders are looking for.</P>
      <P>Trains and buses are run at scheduled times and sometimes these people, when coming to a fair, put on a call at about 9.30 in the morning and it does not mature for a couple of hours.  They are anxious to have the call early so as to carry on their work. They must get into communication with the shipping companies to find out what space they can have for the export of their cattle that day or the next day. It is only in regard to calls to the shipping companies that I am asking the Minister to consider this proposal and I am not asking him to make any definite statement now, but to consider carefully the request which has been sent to him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGee</NameTxt>
      <P>I am rather anxious regarding what has been said by my predecessors and not at all too happy about the remarks of Senator Summerfield. The citizens of Ireland who have borne without any telephone for a long number of years should be the first to be considered in any improvement.  Of course, I know we do not belong to the selfish class but, unfortunately, there are times when any worm will turn.  Human and humane considerations arise in scattered and remote dispensary districts where people are not able to contact a medical officer without going seven or eight miles and they should be the first consideration.  The Minister will receive motions from the county council, of which I am a representative, asking for a telephone connection with every dispensary doctor and priest, to every chapel area in the <Col N="15" /> county.  It is over eight or ten years since we first sent it up.  I would like to take this opportunity to remind him now that those of us who are blessed with the telephone know the grievances which business people must have, but a connection to dispensary doctors and urgent cases would save five or six miles, the sending of a car for the doctor and possibly its return for a second time.  We have fought for a long time for a service for the rural parts and it is almost inhuman that houses where there is neither electric light nor sewerage have also no opportunity to ring up the doctor.  Unless a neighbour has a telephone, one has to travel six or seven miles.</P>
      <P>I was delighted to hear the Minister talk about rural extensions, but was uneasy when I heard him detailing what is to be done for Dún Laoghaire and Dublin.  Dún Laoghaire is not far from Dublin and could do almost without any telephone.  Why he spoke of the details in regard to Rathfarnham and so on is a mystery to me.  It is almost like the Minister for Industry and Commerce, who gave them petrol <i>ad lib.</i> in the past, to the detriment of the rural population.  I have had personal experience of the Minister in the past in relation to some claims I had on him, and I hope he will not forget us and that he will not kow-tow to those in Dún Laoghaire and Dublin.</P>

      <P>I would like to join with other Senators in paying tribute to the work done in the House and congratulate those responsible for the overseeing of this work.  I would particularly compliment the Office of Public Works for encouraging work of this kind to be done.  It is an example of what can be done by the workers of this country and it should be given every encouragement. I hope that the expressions of approval we have made in the House will be conveyed to those responsible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If I were to take seriously the remarks made by Senator McGee, I would say it is a pity he was not made Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, as then we would have a telephone at every cross-road and perhaps in every field.  It is amazing that we are all more or less ready to criticise, and as <Col N="16" /> a pretty heavy user of the telephone and one inclined to be very critical, I feel inclined to apologise not only for anything I may have said in the past but for the things I thought in the past, in my ignorance of the difficulties confronting the Minister and his staff. I am quite prepared to admit that the service is far from perfect, that it never was perfect and that, even in peacetime, there was plenty of room for improvement, but having heard the Minister's statement I think that, instead of an attack on the Department, we should congratulate him and his staff on the marvellous results they got, despite the difficulties of the past six or seven years.  It was a very creditable effort, when you take into consideration that they had practically no resources to fall back on in proportion to the task ahead of them.  They must have had considerable foresight and have laid in a considerable amount of raw material, but they were unable to get any extra supplies over that period. While the results may not have come up to the expectations of many people, there was a really creditable effort by the Minister and his staff.</P>
    <P>We may find fault here, but a lot of the criticism could have been avoided if the simple explanation given by the Minister had been given five, four, three, two or even one year ago.  I think it is necessary to explain these things to the people.  I have often dialled &ldquo;0&rdquo;, without getting the desired results and, finding the telephone buzzing all right, I thought it meant that the operator was not bothering to pay attention to the call.  I understand now from the Minister's statement that it is physically impossible to improve it, that is cannot be done since there is not sufficient accommodation on the switch boards for a sufficient number of people to deal with calls.  I believe many of those who have been critcial in the past would accept the explanation. It should get the fullest publicity and, if possible, it should be circularised to every telephone subscriber. In that way, much of the unpleasantness would be avoided.</P>
    <P>Senator Summerfield said that a lot of people have suffered considerably. We all agree with that, but he goes on <Col N="17" /> more or less to accuse the Minister of obtaining money under false pretences</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrederickSummerfield" hpid="Mr. Summerfield Mr. Summerfield">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quirke</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, and some of mine, too, unfortunately; but the point is that, while we may all be grousing and grumbling at the service, if we had the figures giving the number of people who in their fury threw out the telephone, I think it would be a very small number.  We are all grateful to God for small mercies and, in view of the facts put before us, we should be more grateful that we have had even a middling service during such a long period of general difficulty.  Senator Hayes said that the Minister's speech was a series of aspirations.  He hoped the Minister would be successful.  We all hope for that and it is a creditable thing to find he has such an extensive programme in front of him.  If the supplies are available, and I understand there is every reason to believe they will be, the Minister's hopes will be realised and, as a result, we shall have the telephone available, as it is in many other countries, not alone to professional people but to manufacturing concerns and to farmers.  In connection with priorities, I think that a fairly reasonable arrangement has been made.  Priority has been given to certain sections, including doctors, hospitals and establishments where large numbers are employed.  I ask the Minister to go one step farther and increase the number of priorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I realise that that will cause difficulties at the other end but I think that there is every reason why veterinary surgeons should be included in that list.  The veterinary surgeon has to attend calls very suddenly.  We are largely dependent on our export trade in live stock.  As most people are aware, we have been producing horses worth thousands and thousands of pounds.  During the last 100 years, the produce of the Irish bloodstock industry has made a name for this country in every country in the world. If employment is to be taken into consideration, regard must be given to the employment given in the live-stock industry. The services rendered by a vet. to valuable live stock deserves <Col N="18" /> the serious consideration of the Minister and I suggest that he include the veterinary surgeon in the priority list. In case Senator Counihan accuses me of siding with the Irish Bloodstock and Horse Breeders' Association, of which I am a member, I may say that I am also a member of the Cattle Traders' Association, and I believe that a good argument could be put up for the suggestion made by Senator Counihan.  It is very important that the shipping companies should know the number of cattle to be shipped on a certain day; otherwise cattle dispatched from country fairs will arrive at the port to find that there is no accommodation available.</P>
    <P>I do not know the ins and outs of the machinery attached to the telephone service but, if it were possible to give priority to the town where a fair was being held, it would serve a very useful purpose from the point of view of the live-stock industry.  At present, cattle dealers at a fair have to go into the post office and wait for hours to get a call through.  That means that special trains and boats are held up and it is a general impediment to the farm industry.  I am concerned with the convenience it would be to the cattle traders but I am also seriously concerned with the smooth running of the industry as a whole.  If there is to be any such thing as satisfactory progress, so far as fairs are concerned, anything that can be done to facilitate cattle traders in the dispatch of cattle to the fairs would be very helpful.</P>
    <P>Senator Hayes referred to the staff and said that he found them on all occasions very courteous.  I must say the same.  There was a suggestion that they were underpaid.  I do not know anything with regard to the payment of the staff, but I do think that, in country post offices, the situation would merit consideration with a view to increasing the wages.  A considerable amount of responsibility is placed on the shoulders of the person who happens to be postmaster or postmistress in a village.  I myself have come in contact with cases where the salary attached to the post was, certainly, not in keeping with the responsibility. With regard to the remuneration of the staff, I do not know anything about it. <Col N="19" /> While you may sometimes find yourself getting hot under the collar and getting rid of a certain amount of abuse, which is quite unjustified, on the telephone, I have never had anything in reply but courtesy and civility. Rather than criticise the Post Office Department for what they have not done, we should congratulate them on what they have done under very serious difficulties.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCrosbie" hpid="Mr. Crosbie Mr. Crosbie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crosbie</NameTxt>
      <P>It is rather difficult to be critical of a Minister who comes before the House and so frankly admits and explains the shortcomings and failings of his service.  As Senator Hayes and Senator Quirke mentioned, it has been the experience of nearly all of us that, whatever may have been the technical shortcomings of the service during the war period, we received nothing but courtesy from the staff.  I should go further than that and say that we have received more than courtesy.  In difficult circumstances, we have received much helpfulness.  I have experience of operators who went to a great deal of trouble to make inquiries and to effect connections. However, the Minister is inclined to place all the blame for the shortcomings of the telephone service on the six years of war, during which it was impossible to obtain telephonic supplies. It must be pointed out, however, that the demand for the telephone was increasing year by year over a certain number of years.  During seven years in which this Government was in charge of the telephone prior to the war, it was quite obvious that public demand for the telephone service was growing.  There was one very vital year before the war when it was practically certain that nothing short of a miracle could save us from a world war and during which the Minister for Industry and Commerce warned individuals in business and in trade to obtain as large supplies as possible.  I should have thought that the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs would have taken that warning to heart.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards this Bill, everybody will approve of the Minister's scheme for improving and extending the telephone service so far as possible.  Unlike Senator Summerfield.  I am not in the <Col N="20" /> least perturbed by the fact that the Minister intends to extend the service, particularly, to the rural areas.  I see no reason why that programme should not be carried out concurrently with the improvement of the service to existing subscribers.  What does give me a certain amount of uneasiness is that subsequent to the debate on this Bill in the Dáil, where the Minister was subjected to much rougher criticism than he has been in this House, there appeared in the Government organ what was, obviously, a departmental hand-out to the effect that the Department were engaged on experiments in the Dublin mountains with wireless telephony with a view to adopting a wireless telephonic system. I have no objection to progressing from the ordinary land wire telephone to the wireless telephone but I think it gives cause for alarm that a Department which admits that its existing system is far from perfect and which sees very little prospect of improving that system with any degree of rapidity should be engaged in experimenting with wireless telephony before it is able to bring its ordinary land telephones up to proper standards.</P>
    <P>There is one question which I should like to put to the Minister.  Perhaps he would enlighten me on the matter when replying.  It would be a source of gratification to many subscribers if this matter were explained&mdash;why it is impossible to book a fixed-time cross-Channel telephone call.  We know that during business hours certain business firms are given and, quite rightly so, fixed-time cross-Channel calls.  That being so, many subscribers are worried and fail to understand why it is that in the case of private subscribers the Department refuses to accept fixed-time cross-Channel calls during non-business hours, even when a telephone call is requested for as long ahead as 24 hours.  I think it would relieve a lot of criticism if the Minister could explain why that is so.  There may be a good reason for it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHonan" hpid="Mr. Honan Mr. Honan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>My first reaction, like that of other Senators, is to congratulate the Minister on the introduction of this very comprehensive Bill, the <Col N="21" /> object of which is to improve the telephone system.  Some years ago I myself was rather critical of the service, but then emergency conditions quietened us all on these matters.  So far as my own area is concerned, we have no complaint to make as regards local calls, either as regards the efficiency of the service or the punctuality with which the calls are received.  As regards trunk calls, however, my part of the country is very poorly served. It is a county where we have big changes in population.  In the summer time there is a very big influx of people to Kilkee, Lisdoonvarna and Lahinch. During that period the service for trunk calls is poor indeed.  The delay works out something like this.  In the case of calls from Kilkee and Lisdoonvarna to Dublin during the summer season the delays are as much as five and six hours.  These delays cause serious disappointment to people.  Even in the case of calls from Limerick to Ennis&mdash;only 20 miles distant&mdash;there are delays of two and three hours.  At present the delay in getting a call to Dublin is from 1½ to 2 hours.  The trouble, I understand, is due to want of outlets from Dublin to Limerick and Galway.  To meet that situation there would be required four more trunk lines to Limerick and two more lines to Dublin.  At present there is only one line to Dublin for the whole of County Clare, and four to Limerick. Unless something is done before the next summer season there will, I am afraid, be cause for serious complaints from Kilkee, Lisdoonvarna and Lahinch.  At present there is only one line from Kilkee and Kilrush to Ennis during the summer season.  Both offices would require two independent lines.  There has been some talk of an extension to some of those smaller places.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Senator Summerfield that, in view of the conditions I have mentioned, it would be a very good thing if the existing services were improved.  I think that some of the other services mentioned might wait. Otherwise, the effect will be to clutter up the post office at Ennis which is one of the most congested post offices in Ireland.  I appeal to the Minister to do something to improve the position <Col N="22" /> with regard to calls from Lahinch, Kilkee and Ennis to Dublin.</P>
    <P>As I have said, there is only one trunk line from the County Clare to Dublin.  At present if you try to call Dublin you find that the office you want to get in Dublin is closed by the time you get the call.  In the old days, of course, the service was, I suppose, all right when the numbers of telephone calls were comparatively few.  The position at present is that almost every modern house has a telephone.  I think it was Senator McGee who suggested that telephone calls to doctors should come first.  I think that in the whole of the County Clare there is only one doctor's residence that is not connected with the telephone service.  I think that as regards all essential services&mdash;doctors and others&mdash;they are reasonably well served.  I do want to say that if there is not some improvement in the trunk line system before next summer season there will be a strong feeling against the telephone service in my part of the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>Unlike Senator Summerfield and Senator Counihan, to whom delays on the telephone may mean big money, I speak on this subject as a private user.  I use the telephone mainly for private purposes.  I feel quite satisfied with the automatic service.  What I complain of is the exasperation, amounting almost to infuriation, as regards the length of time that I sometimes have to hold on before the call comes through.  On occasion, I have timed myself.  I have often had to hold on for a quarter of an hour.  That, in my opinion, is the cause of complaint so far as most people are concerned.  It makes one almost demented to be kept hanging on in that way.  It may be some time before we get relief in that direction. There is a suggestion which I have to make to the Minister, and it is this: could he not get his technicians to examine whether it would not be possible to answer these calls and say: &ldquo;We cannot connect you now; if you give your number we will call you in due course.&rdquo;  If that were done it would relieve a large body of people from the personal annoyance which they suffer at present.  I think that complaints <Col N="23" /> would almost vanish if people could be relieved of the frustration that is caused by having to hang on.  I have not any technical knowledge, but it strikes me that that should not be a difficult matter to arrange&mdash;that is to say, that the operators should pick up calls when they are made, take down the number and say that there will be a delay of half-an-hour.  People would not mind the delay.  What they do mind is having to hang on for half-an-hour. I should be glad if the Minister would have that aspect of the question examined.</P>

Ar an gcéad dul síos, is maith liom an scéim atá beartaithe ag an Aire le seirbhísí agus buntáistí an telefóna a leathnú go mór tríd an tír.  Is scéim mhaith iomlán í agus nuair a chuimhníos duine ar achar na tíre, shílfeá gur scéim í ar féidir í a thabhairt chun críche taobh istigh de achar réasúnta ama.</P>
      <P>Ag an am chéanna, is follas nach é an tAire an máistir sa scéal.  Brathann a lán ar cé acu a mbeidh an goireas agus na fearaistí riachtanacha le fáil gan mórán moille.  Ní mórán is féidir leis a dhéanamh ina thaobh sin, go háirithe ós ar thíortha coigríche atamuid ag brath maidir le goireas is fearaistí.</P>
      <P>Ach abair go mbeadh fáil ag an Aire ar na riachtanaisí úd atá i gceist agam, níl fhios agam a bhfuil dóthain ceardaithe ar fáil againn leis an obair a dhéanamh taobh istigh d'achar réasúnta. Muna bhfuil, ní mé a bhfuil aon réiteach sásúil déanta leis na hoibrithe riachtanacha a chur a dtréineáil.  'Se an dara rud a thaithníos liom maidir leis an mBille agus le óráid an Aire go bhfeictear go mbeifear i ndon an scéim mhór seo a thabhairt chun críche ar sé mhilliún punt.

Tá eolas cuid mhaith agam ar chúrsaí na tuaithe chomh maith le cúrsaí an bhaile mhóir. On eolas atá agam, impím ar an Aire féachaint chuige go bhfuighe an tuaith tosach an oiread agus is féidir.  Seans go bhfuil sé iontuigthe go gcaithfidh na daoine a bhfuil iarratas istigh le fada acu ar telefón an tseirbhís a fháil i dtosach.  'Na dhiaidh sin, bíodh go gcuirfí as ar feadh tamaill do dhaoine sna bailte móra, measaim go mba chóir abair caoga faoin gcéad nó níos mó den ghoireas agus seirbhís nua a thabhairt do mhuintir na tuaithe.</P>
    <P>Is maith liom go bhfuil sé socair ag an Aire a bheith an-chúramach maidir le caitheamh an airgid seo.  D'fhéadfadh sé, b'fhéidir, mar mholadh dhó, a lán fearaistí agus gléasanna a cheannach le chéile.  Tá an locht seo ar sin: go mbeadh sé &ldquo;ag reoidh a chuid rachmais&rdquo; mar deirtear i mBéarla.  Agus thairis sin, ní fios cé na feabhais a thiocfas gan mórán moille ar ealaíon an telefóna agus ba chóir dúinn a bheith réidh le feidhm a bhaint as na buntáistí nua sin.</P>
    <P>Támaid ar fad sásta gur moladh lucht freastail na dtelefón an oiread agus a moladh iad.  Cheap mé féin gur i nGaillimh amháin a bhí seirbhísigh thar cionn.  Bíodh sin mar atá, ba mhaith liom a admháil chomh sásúil agus atá na seirbhísigh úd i nGaillimh. Ba deacair iad a shárú maidir le béasa agus éifeacht.  Agus ba mhaith liom a admháil freisin chomh sásúil a déantar obair an telefóna i nGaeilge.  Déarfainn nach bhfuil seirbhís níos fearr, agus gach deacracht a chur san áireamh, in aon áit sa tír ná tá le fáil againn.</P>
    <P>Maidir leis na casaoideacha i dtaobh na seirbhísí, ba mhaith a liom a mholadh don Aire go gceapfadh sé duine éigin mar oifigeach caidrimh Poiblí le deacrachta na seirbhísí a mhíniú don phobal, le scéimeanna nua a mhíniú agus le casaoideacha i gcoitinne a fhreagairt.  Tá a leithéid d'oifigeach ag Córas Iompair Éireann agus obair an-shásúil á déanamh aige.  Is nós nua é, b'fhéidir, ag Comhluchta móra agus Seirbhísí poiblí, a leithéid seo d'oifigigh a bheith acu.  Ach ar mhaithe leis an bpobal agus ar leas na seirbhíse ar fad, b'fhiú a leithéid de cheapachán a <Col N="25" /> dhéanamh.  Sílim gurb é an Seanadóir Ó Cuirc adúirt go ndéanfadh sé a lán maitheasa dá mbeadh an t-eolas a nochtuigh an tAire inniu ar fáil ag an bpobal i bhfad ó shoin.  Aontuím leis agus dá réir sin iarraim ar an Aire machtnamh a dhéanamh ar mo mholadh-sa.</P>
    <P>Is maith liom gur thagair an Seanadóir Ó hAodha don chíos chúig phunt a baintear gach bliain de na Síntúsóirí telefóna.  Is rud é nár thuigeas ariamh &mdash;céan fáth a mbaintear an táille sin amach bliain i ndiaidh bliana.  Thuigfinn go n-iarrfadh an tAire suim éigin mar urrús ar an ngléas telefóna a chuireann sé ar fáil agus thuigfinn go n-iarrfadh sé íocaíocht éigin as ucht deasú sreanganna agus mar sin dhe. Ach tá an táille átá á ghearradh cheana ro-throm agus, thairis sin, mar dúirt an Seanadóir Ó hAodha, stopann sé a lán daoine ar telefón a chur isteach.</P>
    <P>Thairis sin, níl le rá agam ach go bhfuil súil agam go n-éireoidh leis an Aire an scéim atá beartaithe aige a thabhairt chun críche gan aon romhoill agus go mbeidh ar a chumas é a dhéanamh chomh saor agus a mheasann sé.</P>

      <P>Possibly I am the first member of the House to speak in this debate who cannot boast of having the facilities of a telephone in his home, but then, when you live in the fastnesses of the country, obviously the amenities available to city residents, of whom Senator McGee spoke and perhaps described very well, are not available there and one has to put up with conditions that might be very unacceptable to city people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One note struck in this debate to which I take the strongest exception, was that struck by Senator Summerfield. I do not know whether he is very clear now about what he said, or whether he said it with the deliberation which a statement like this merited before it was given the publicity of the House, but I must say that if it were the policy of the Minister with regard to the extension of the telephone service, I would take very violent exception to it.  Senator Summerfield's point of view apparently is that those who have this amenity&mdash;and if we so <Col N="26" /> describe it, it is much more to Senator Summerfield&mdash;feel that the service has to be improved before it can be enjoyed by any new subscriber.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrederickSummerfield" hpid="Mr. Summerfield Mr. Summerfield">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what I gathered from the Senator&mdash;that that is what he meant.  I hope his attitude in this matter is not truly representative of his general attitude towards the people who are making their contribution to this service without getting the enjoyment out of it that people in the more densely populated areas receive. Naturally, the attitude of the country member of this House with regard to a proposition like this is: &ldquo;When will the more remote rural parts of the country have the facilities available to them that they are entitled to receive and that are enjoyed by a great many other citizens?&rdquo;</P>
      <P>How long will it take until the people in the country can have telephones installed? My view is that people in the cities and built-up areas are so close to each other that they do not require the telephone so much as the widely scattered populations.  I suggest that telephone facilities should be made available first to the people in the country districts.  If you want to keep the people in the country where they are, this is one of the ways in which life might be made more tolerable for them.  In Dublin City, people have merely to step across the tram-line to talk to their neighbours on business or otherwise, but in the country areas we have to travel miles to carry out what may be very urgent business.  What Senator McGee says is quite true&mdash;the doctor, the priest and the vet in the rural districts may have to cycle six or seven miles in the dead of night or in the early hours of the morning. That inconvenience could be avoided by an improvement, an extension, in our telephone system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a need of improvement in <Col N="27" /> the service.  I can speak only from my experience of the use of the telephone in the city, mainly in the city, not very much in my native district.  I cannot say I have actually experienced incivility, but I have had certain evidence in the city.  I think there is considerable evidence of an appearance of lack of courtesy.  Whether the Minister's lack of attention is lack of courtesy, whether the Minister's explanation to-day is a full explanation or not, is something I am not able to say, but I have, with my watch in my hand in a private hotel, waited for 20 minutes to get a call to a place not very far away.  There are people in such places all over the city who are complaining very bitterly about lack of attention to calls, especially up to midnight.  It ought to be possible to overcome that unpleasant experience on the part of telephone users.</P>
    <P>I agree absolutely with Senator Hayes, and the Minister might as well face up to this aspect of his task.  As regards his service as a whole, I do not think the people employed in it are anything like adequately paid.  I think the telephonists and others are not getting enough to enable them to live decently.  If they are getting what is barely able to maintain them at the subsistence level, people placed in that position will not be concerned very much about the kind of service they give, and they cannot be blamed for that.</P>
    <P>If you want courtesy and civility in your telephone service you have to recruit a very good type of person and you must pay that person decently. There is competition in that type of service and there will be more competition and if the Minister wants a satisfactory service he will have to pay those employed in it more than he is paying them.</P>
    <P>Senator Hayes made another good point, and that is with regard to a reduction in the cost of installation.  A rural post office may serve a district miles in extent and in districts that are remote from towns there ought to be every encouragement given to individuals to install telephones in their homes.  For people who may not be engaged in commercial business or in <Col N="28" /> farming on a very big scale, it is debatable whether they should install a telephone or not, but it would be a considerable convenience for the district.  It might be possible to make certain houses serve a district where there is a scattered population, but that will only be possible by the Minister giving these people facilities that have not been available so far.</P>
    <P>The Minister indicated that an extension of the service is to be operated over a number of years. Possibly we will have to wait for a period long after he has gone out of office, long after his Government have given way to another administration, before this scheme can be completed.</P>

      <P>That is just what I was coming to.  The Senator said &ldquo;Oh, no.&rdquo;  I am afraid there is an attitude of mind in a service like the Post Office to ration out the work, to do so much this year and so much next year and the year after, employing a certain number of technicians, a certain number of labourers, and spending just so much money.  They calculate just how much they will spend year after year for ten years, the period necessary to carry this scheme into effect.  There was a shortage of supplies during the war period, but I presume that it would not have been so grave but for the disastrous fire and the loss of stocks.</P>

      <P>Anyhow, there will be a shortage for some time but it will not extend for five or ten years.  I suggest that in 12 or 18 months we will have reached the stage when there will be ample supplies. There is evidence already, in regard to rubber and other supplies, that the shortage is not so great.  Soon there will be a free flow and our technicians and labourers will not be able to use all the materials available.  It should be possible to make a calculation as to how far away that day is and, for goodness' sake, let the Post Office, then, instead of letting the labourers go to England, give them jobs with picks and shovels to lay the cables and build <Col N="29" /> the exchanges needed to house this expanding service.  Apparently, according to the plan, that is not going to be done.  This is not the policy of the Post Office alone.  I am afraid it is the generally accepted policy that, if you employ too many men this year, you will have them unemployed the next year, so in order to prevent that you must cut down the amount of constructive work in any year.  That is all wrong and I hope that it will not be the policy of the Minister.  I do not know what hidden hand or what slap-dash economic theory produced that doctrine, but in some invisible way you can see the influence of it in our life.  Sometimes you can see that the Electricity Supply Board have that policy, too.  Before his term as Minister comes to an end at the end of the five-year period of office of the Government, the Minister will have much more than ample supplies of raw materials for the development of the service.  He is getting the money here. There ought to be enough men in the country to get on with the job and it should not take anything like ten years to complete, and when that is done there will be much more work to be added.</P>
      <P>There are various aspects of the whole telephone service of which we could be critical, but the Minister makes an excuse for the short-comings and disabilities his staff have had to labour under.  It is right that we should be fair in our examination of the position, but it would be the greatest possible mistake for us to assume that the shortages of materials and the defects on the engineering side of the service to-day are responsible for many of the complaints we hear about.  The Minister and his executives should not make excuses for the defects, but should search them out and, when they discover them, they should try to eradicate them.</P>

      <P>Ní dóigh liom go bhfuil an tarna tuairim, ná gur gá é an fóirleathnú seo atá beartaithe ag an Aire.  Bhí a lán cainte faoi na mion-rudaí a bhaineann leis an seirbhís agus na lochtaí atá ann, nach féidir leis an Aire ná an Roinn iad a <Col N="30" /> leigheas fá láthair.  Do réir na ndaoine a dhéanann machtnamh ar an scéal, is iontach an rud é go bhfuil seirbhís chomh maith sin ann le cúig nó sé bliana.</P>
      <P>Ceann de na neithe gur mhaith liomsa eolas d'fháil ina thaobh&mdash;an t-airgead.  Tá caint ar mhion-rudaí&mdash; fiú amháin ar an &ldquo;dial O&rdquo;, ach ní raibh mórán á rá faoi an £6,000,000 atá beartaithe a chaitheamh ar an seirbhís seo.  Caithfidh an t-airgead san teacht as áit éigin, ar an seirbhis do dhíol aisti féin nó as creidiúint an phobail. An gcaithfidh an sean-chapall bán an rud seo a iompar, i dteannta na rudaí eile?  Níor mhiste scrúdú a dhéanamh ar an bpointe sin, agus béidir go n-inneosadh an tAire dúinn, maidir le caitheamh an £6,000,000 cé air go mbeidh ar deire an tsuim mór sin a sholáthar.  Fágaimse faoin Aire féin é sin a insint dúinn.</P>
      <P>Bhíos chun caint a dhéanamh ar an gcostas atá ar gach duine a bhfuil telefón aige, an costas chun an telefón a chur isteach in a theach.  Tá telefón im thigh-se le breis agus 20 blian agus tá breis agus £100 díolta agam.  Ní dóigh liom gur liomsa fiú amháin an cluasán a chuirim le mó chluais.  Is rómhór an t-ualach é an £5 a dhíol gach bliain agus gan aon rud nua curtha isteach don té a dhíolann é.  Mholfainn go ndéanfadh an tAire machtnamh agus stuidéar ar an bpointe sin&mdash; laghdú ar an gcostas chun telefón a chur isteach agus gléasanna nua a chur ar fáil ó am go ham i dtreo is go bhfuighidh gach duine luach a chuid airgid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tá rud eile gur mhaith liomsa eolas a fháil air.  Tá sé beartaithe £6,000,000 a chaiteamh ar an scéim seo.  Is cinnte go gcaithfear cuid de sin ar obair a sholáthar, ar shaothar lucht oibre, ach is cinnte go mbeidh méid áirithe dá caitheamh ar na gléasa a bhaineann leis.  Cá bhfuighfear na neithe sin? An thar lear a thiocfaid agus an t-airgead a bheith cailite d'Éirinn ar fad?  Nó nach féidir monarchana a chur an bun anseo in Éirinn chun iad a dhéanamh agus iad a sholáthar le n-ár ndicheall féin?  Ba chóir go mbeadh cuid de na rudai á ndéanamh anseo agus gan gach aon ní a <Col N="31" /> bhaineann leis an telefón a cheannach thar lear.  Dá mbéadh na monarchana againn, bheadh obair ann do na daoine agus bheimís ag coimeád ár muintir i bhfus.</P>
    <P>Is baolach go bhfuil an rud céanna ar siúl ag cumainn gnótha eile ar nós an E.S.B. agus C.I.É., agus ní léir cén fáth nach féidir monarchana a chur ar bun chun cuid de na gléasanna a chur ar fáil dar ndéantus féin.</P>
    <P>Ag tagairt den tseirbhís a leathnú fén dtuaith, táim ar aon intinn leis na daoine a labhair.  Is minic a chloisimíd faoi n-a olcas agus atá an saol fén dtuaith, chomh huaigneach is atá sé, gan cothrom le fáil acu agus gan caoi ag na daoine chun taithneamh an tsaoil a mhéadú.  Ceann de na rudaí is mó a dhéanfadh oriúnt do na daoine fén dtuaith is ea an telefon, chomh maith le solus aibhléise agus uisce a bheith le fáil sna tithe.  Ceann de na neithe is mó a dhéanann áis na ndaoine san Ioruaidh agus sa tSualainn go bhfuil telefón i ngach tigh, go bhfuil solus aibhléise acu agus go bhfuil na neithe sin chomh fóirleathta ansin go bhfuil an gnáthshaol faoin dtuaith níos taithneamhaí dóibh.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom go mbeadh sé mar bhun-pholasaí ag an Aire seirbhís an telefóna a leathnú ar fad fén dtuaith, go mbeadh i ngach paróiste dhá áit nó trí in ar bhféidir le daoine, de ló is d'oíche&mdash;is cuma gnó práinneach dochtúra nó leighis, sagairt, nó gnáth-ghnó saoil an duine é&mdash;úsáid a bhaint as an telefón laistigh de leath-mhíle nó míle dá áit chomhnaithe, munar féidir é bheith in a thigh féin.  Ba mhaith liom go mbeadh sé sin mar pholasaí ag an Aire agus faoi chúram na Roinne, nuair a bheidh an leathnú á dhéanamh ar fuaid na tíre.</P>
    <P>Is maith an rud é go bhfuil an tAire agus an Rialtas sásta an £6,000,000 a chur isteach i rud mar seo, mar is deimhniú é go bhfuil fonn orthu dul chun cinn le seirbhís a sholáthar don phobal agus an saol a fheabhasú trí sheirbhísí den tsaghas sin a leathnú.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to join with the other speakers in congratulating the Minister on having brought this Bill forward, to provide £6,000,000 <Col N="32" /> to develop further what has become almost an essential service.  We have heard&mdash;and we have seen in the papers from time to time&mdash;complaints in regard to these services in the past.  The mere passing of this Bill will not remove all the causes for complaint, but when we consider this Bill we should try to do what we can to ensure that, in the future development, there will be no cause for complaint.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many Senators who have spoken already have attributed most of the causes to the war conditions.  That might be the case but my view is that the complaints are due to the rapid expansion of the use of the telephone. In the original plans for housing and equipment, that expansion was not provided for.  Therefore, the demand on the staff and on the housing capacity of the Department led to the complaints of which we have heard.  I should like to suggest to the Minister that, in the drawing up of future plans, his direction to his staff should be to be generous.  When providing a service for a particular area, they should not confine themselves to planning to meet the immediate demands.  Much of our expenditure on this service and other services&mdash;particularly the public health services&mdash;is due to the fact that, in preparing our schemes&mdash;sewerage schemes, water schemes, road schemes and so forth&mdash;we planned for the immediate present and did not look forward sufficiently. As a result, these plans have to be reviewed and extensions made, with greater cost.  The Minister's direction to those drawing up the plans, particularly for the rural areas, should be to be generous and to look forward to further developments rather than to the immediate demand.  The phone has become almost an essential service and some speakers have urged that the rural areas should get first consideration. It is a very important service in a rural area&mdash;more important than it is in a town or city.  Every post office in the country should be provided with a public phone.  The Minister has outlined his plans and provision is made for that but, in the putting into operation of these plans and in the spending of this money, a great deal will depend on the foresight and pre-vision displayed <Col N="33" /> in connection with the ultimate expansion of the system.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanRuane" hpid="Mr. S. Ruane Mr. S. Ruane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Ruane</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this Bill. With Senator Hayes, I agree that we shall all be delighted if the Minister's hopes of being able to implement the promises made by his predecessors and by himself are realised under this scheme.  There is no denial that the provision of £6,000,000 for development of the telephonic system is rather ambitious.  We hope that the Minister's belief that he will be able to spend the money usefully within five or six years will be borne out, but we cannot forget that, as far back as 1938, there was provision made of £1,000,000 for the development of the telephone and that that sum, according to what we have heard, has not yet been expended. If, since 1938, it was not possible to expend a sum of £1,000,000, we cannot be considered hypercritical if we are sceptical as to the possibility of usefully expending £6,000,000 within five or six years.  There is no doubt that the telephone service, generally, during the emergency period was far from satisfactory.  Considering the obsolete equipment, or the lack of equipment in many areas, we cannot hold the Minister solely responsible for that save in so far as his lack of foresight in the years prior to the war, as Senator Crosbie pointed out, resulted in a failure to procure equipment at that time which could not be procured during the emergency period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If I have any fault to find with this Bill and the Minister's introductory speech it is that attention seems to be mostly confined to Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Waterford and the larger areas. I agree with Senator Baxter and Senator Hawkins that the Bill would be far more attractive to Senators from rural areas if it had a greater rural bias.  I see no reason why there should not be a telephone in every post office in rural areas and in every sub-post office.  Within the past eight or ten years, people in the rural areas have become telephone-minded.  They frequently have to go into a town, four or five miles away, to summon the services of a veterinary surgeon who may live four or five miles distant from that town.  I know of cases where such <Col N="34" /> people had to wait for a call between two towns, distant about seven statute miles, for one and a half or two hours.</P>
    <P>Senator Honan said that there were no complaints in his county as regards local calls, that the complaints were as regards trunk calls.  In my county, it is easier at times to get a trunk call than to make contact with a town from seven to 15 miles distant.  For that reason, it is necessary that the service be improved in the rural areas.  That improvement should include the provision of public kiosks so that when the post office closes down at 7 o'clock or the telephone service goes off for private subscribers at 10.30 p.m. people who want to use the phone may not have to go to the Gárda barracks and ask permission to use the phone there. In country areas, doctors have frequently to be summoned hurriedly.  If, in the sub-post office, there was telephone connection with the nearest town, matters could be expedited.  In case of serious illness, people have sometimes to go into town to try to obtain the services of a doctor.  The doctor may be out on another call. They may then have to get on the telephone to a doctor in an adjoining town and from three to five hours may be lost in that way.  That could be avoided with the extension of the telephone system in rural areas through this scheme.  I hope that the question of cost, or return, will not be a deterrent to the Minister's Department in making the necessary extensions.</P>
    <P>I know that the Minister is anxious to make the telephone service attractive. Apart from the extensions of which I have spoken, I know of no better way of making the service attractive than by cutting down the rather exorbitant charges that at present obtain for installations and for calls.  Senator Hayes referred to a charge of £5 for installation.  I know of a case in a rural area in which a county councillor was anxious to install in his home a telephone which would be mostly used in the interest of his constituents.  The cost of installation, a year's rent and overhead charges ran into £11.  If those high charges obtain, I have every doubt that the service will be as generally availed of as it otherwise would be.  When all is <Col N="35" /> said and done, the Post Office should not be out to make profits in this matter and, if any profits are made, they should go to the benefit of the subscribers and those availing of the service.</P>
    <P>I trust the Minister's hopes will be realised in providing the service the country needs and that we shall be put in line with other countries.  I am afraid that, at present, we are very much out of step with them so far as the telephone service is concerned. The Minister is entitled to, and will receive, the co-operation of everybody in working out his scheme, provided he does not stint himself as regards the areas referred to by Senator Baxter and Senator Hawkins and the areas for which I now plead.  The isolated districts are entitled to consideration in this matter and, even though at the outset they may not be productive of profit, the eventual results will, certainly, justify any expenditure undertaken in making the necessary extensions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that those who have complimented the Minister, just as those who have criticised his Bill, suffer under the delusion that the purpose of the measure is to provide £6,000,000 for telephone development. That is not the purpose of the Bill.  Its purpose is to provide a sum &ldquo;not exceeding £6,000,000.&rdquo;  There is no guarantee that the Minister will spend £60. He has been spending at the rate of £100,000 during the past ten years and unless an atomic bomb is placed somewhere in the Department there is no hope he will expand the service further during the lifetime of the present Government.  It seems to me that we are discussing this matter as if we were living in the middle of the last century. Who believes that the telephone system 20 years from now will be the kind of system we have to-day?  I do not believe for a moment that, amongst all the other scientific developments in the world, the telephone system will remain unaltered.  I believe that there will be considerable alterations in the whole conception of the telephone and in methods of communication during the next 20 years.  Before we agree to the expenditure of any sum, we ought <Col N="36" /> to urge the Minister to find out from the scientists what their view is as to the lines along which the telephone system is likely to develop.  I am informed&mdash; I speak subject to correction by the Minister&mdash;that there is nobody with scientific knowledge in the employment of the Post Office and that some of the most technical posts in relation to telephones are held by civil servants without any training whatever in technical matters.  If you want technicians, you have got to pay them and that is one of the things the Post Office dislikes doing.</P>
      <P>Many years ago, I was a member of a commission which inquired into the administration of the Post Office.  The evidence given in the course of that inquiry was that the telephonists were allowed to sit at their desks for hours at end until they fainted in their seats, when they were carried to a rest room. That evidence was given at a commission, of which I was a member, appointed by the previous Government. I cannot see that an organisation which takes that view of its responsibilities towards the persons who serve it is likely to proceed along an intelligent, progressive line when they get the handling of so vast a sum of money.  It seems to me, therefore, that we ought to urge, on the rare occasions on which we can say anything at all about the administration of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, that they should consult technicians and scientists in relation to the use of the telephone and the system of telephonic communication which we have in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then there is the question of overhead or underground lines.  Whenever there is a storm the overhead lines fall.  The time we need doctors and vets. most urgently is the time we have no telephones at all; the whole system is in a state of collapse.  I disagree with Senator Baxter and others as to the purpose of a telephone system.  I do not think that the cure for the disease, referred to by Senator Baxter, is to install a telephone exchange in every sub-post office.  The cure, obviously, is to have a doctor, a vet. and a nurse in every village.  The cure for this disease is a properly organised social <Col N="37" /> service, not a telephone exchange.  The greatest demand for the telephone, so far as I know, comes from bookmakers and those who want to back the favourite on some English race.  That is the biggest demand on the telephone in many parts of the country.  I have no anxiety to vote public moneys for that purpose.</P>
    <P>I want to see public money which is voted expended in the best possible manner.  With all respect, I would say this that, before we commence to spend larger sums of money on private telephones for bookmakers, we ought to make sure that we are giving the ordinary citizen the best service that the State can provide.  We are not doing that.  If I write a letter to-day to some parts of the country, even to important towns in remote parts of the country, I have no guarantee that it will be delivered before next week.  A man told me that he wrote a letter in Dublin to an important town in the country on a Friday.  It reached the town on Monday, but it was not delivered and was not due for delivery.  If we are going to vote these large sums of money, it seems to me that we ought to start with first things first.  The first thing to provide is an adequate daily service of letter deliveries.</P>

I want to give him the money for other purposes, and I think I am entitled to point out to the House that we ought to urge on the Minister that there are other claims on the Post Office, claims that are more pressing, more important and more vital in the public interest than the expansion of the telephone system in the manner that he is proposing, particularly having regard to what I said at the beginning, that I believe the present telephone system will be out-moded 20 years from now.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidJohnMadden" hpid="Mr. Madden Mr. Madden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Madden</NameTxt>
      <P>So much has been said on this Bill during the last two hours that there is very little left for me to say.  I do not think any Senator, with any sense of responsibility, could oppose the granting of the sum of money asked for for the extension of an important and essential service. Nobody with a national or even an international outlook could do that. Only recently a Minister said that this question of insularity had now passed. I support previous speakers in impressing on the Minister the importance of creating an atmosphere of sympathy so far as the rural areas are concerned. With regard to local post office services, I do not know what people would do were it not for the co-operation they get in the local Gárda stations.  That applies particularly in the rural areas. After 7 o'clock in the evening people who require to make calls must do so at the Gárda station.  It may be a call to know if there is a bed available for an urgent case in the Limerick County Infirmary, or it may be an urgent call about some other matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I strongly support the plea that was made by Senator Hayes for better pay for those employed in this service. Quite a number are very badly paid. If you want good service, courtesy and co-operation you must have a contented and a reasonably well-paid staff. I know two girls who are employed in a post office in a certain large town.  I do not know exactly what their status is, or whether the Minister has any responsibility for them.  In fact, I do not know by whom they are employed, but they have to work a very long day on six days of the week and do so many hours' duty on Sunday.  They are employed at the slave unchristian wage of 10/- a week.  Now, if conditions such as these obtain in other towns and villages&mdash;young girls of 18 or 19 years of age working eight hours a day for the slave wage of 10/- a week&mdash; is it any wonder that you should have discourtesy, want of co-operation or sympathy?  I would imagine that these poor little girls suffer from weakness and exhaustion.  If there was a bus service running in their town they would not have enough money to pay their fare from the post office to their homes.  I know a girl who was employed <Col N="39" /> for three years in that way. Her health became impaired and she had to give up the work.  Was it any wonder in view of the fact that she had to try to exist on a wage of 10/- a week?  I hope that, when we vote the money asked for in this Bill, the manner in which it is to be expended will be inquired into by the Minister. Some part of it, I think, ought to be employed towards improving the conditions of girls such as I speak of.  It is too bad that very well educated girls should have to try to eke out an existence on such wages.</P>
    <P>On Saturday last I had some business to do at the county council offices in Limerick.  I asked the girl there please to ring up the Gresham Hotel, Dublin, as I wanted to make arrangements for my visit to Dublin to attend this meeting of the Seanad. There was a wait of ten minutes.  I asked her please to ring again and see what was the cause of the delay.  She did so, and got the reply that I would have to wait one and a half hours.  I said that I was not going to sit there for one and a half hours in order to contact the Gresham Hotel.  That does not always happen, I must say.</P>
    <P>I do a lot of work on the telephone, and on the whole I find it reasonably good.  We cannot expect absolute perfection in every service.  Human nature itself has its limitations.  We all make mistakes.  I would say that, on the whole, the service is good.  The officials are tactful and there is a spirit of co-operation amongst them.  I do want to say again that I have absolute proof that girls are being employed in this service at the slave unchristian wage I have mentioned.  It is horrible to contemplate that lovely young girls, with a secondary education, should be treated in that manner. The Minister may not know of this but I can give him the name and address of the post office.  I am sure that he knows nothing about it.  If that sort of thing is going on over the country, then I suggest it ought to be rectified.  If you have a well paid staff you will have efficiency and courtesy, and the whole scheme will work harmoniously.</P>
    <P>There is a great deal of talk about <Col N="40" /> the flight from the land.  250,000 of our people have gone to work in England. Senators are obliged to call to the Department of External Affairs on behalf of people who are seeking permits to leave the country.  If some of the services which are being provided for Dublin and Dun Laoghaire could be extended to the country areas, then our people might be encouraged to remain at home.  The aim should be to get the people back to the land, and so preserve the race of the MacCarthys and the O'Donnells who are disappearing from the land as if from a pestilence.  I hope that these few points will be considered by the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnOReilly" hpid="Mr. P.J. O'Reilly Mr. P.J. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to join with other Senators in congratulating the Minister on the introduction of this Bill.  There certainly has been a need, for some time past, for a considerable improvement in the service.  The Minister's explanation of the difficulties is, no doubt, reasonable. There are some minor remedies which I think were always possible, and which, I think, are now possible. I should like to call the Minister's attention to one of these.  I had the experience of having to wait a quarter of an hour outside a kiosk while two or three girls were sending a message to people living a comparatively short distance away.  The operator probably did not know the nature of their conversation, but it was simply an ordinary conversation between boys and girls.  I have had that experience again and again.  That leads me to suggest that there is a good deal in what Senator Sir John Keane mentioned, namely, that there ought to be some way of intimating to the operator that there is a trunk call waiting.  I wonder if there could be some rearrangement of the design of the kiosks, one part being allocated for ordinary local calls and another part reserved for trunk calls?  If that could be done then the type of delay that I refer to could be avoided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One Senator referred to experiments which, he said, were being carried out by the Post Office Department in the Dublin mountains.  It struck me, listening to the Senator, that the <Col N="41" /> Department may have a very good idea in the carrying out of these experiments. For example, in the case of the extension of electricity to individual farms, very considerable expense is involved, whereas if the houses on these farms could be connected within a small space, there would be considerable economy in the wiring effected.  I am just wondering whether it would be possible to send messages by wireless to remote areas instead of by the ordinary telephonic method, and then relaying them from those areas to substations which could be comparatively near.  That might be a possible way of extending the service to rural areas without incurring too much trouble. There is a difference of opinion as to whether the present system with all its defects, if you like, should be extended, or whether there should be concentration on the improvement of the existing system.  If I might mention a parallel case, that is the case of the E.S.B., I think the problem is somewhat similar.  In that particular case people are rationed and severely rationed.  That whole service is unsatisfactory at present owing to the failure of the E.S.B. to provide current for increased power.  I suggest that if we extend too rapidly, before the necessary equipment is available, we may have a somewhat similar difficulty arising in connection with this service.</P>
    <P>I would like to mention in connection with the facilities that are available at Civic Guard stations, that the policy regarding calls made at them late at night seems to differ according to the temperament of the particular sergeant in charge.  One man may be of the good humoured type.  He will say &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; and let the call be made. Another man will insist on having all the regulations complied with.  If it were frankly recognised that, in a case of urgent calls, people would be entitled to make them at the barracks, that might help to smooth away the differences that exist at present.  Perhaps something could be done in that direction so that people would not feel that they were under a compliment when asking for permission to use the telephone in a Civic Guard barracks.</P>
    <P>I had the experience at Tramore last <Col N="42" /> year and in previous years of waiting as long as four hours to get a message to a place 30 miles away.  I think I could have walked to that place in the same time.  That occurs every year. The reasons are similar to those mentioned by Senator Honan.  There is a tremendous influx of people at certain periods and I think it should follow that during these periods there ought to be additional staff.</P>
    <P>Talking about staff, not long ago in Dublin I called into an office not very far from here and I noticed that a telegram could be dispatched from that office.  I handed in a telegram and I was told it could not be delivered under two hours.  The girl in charge was almost demented with the amount of work she had to do.  There were a dozen people in the office and she was asked to do all sorts of things.  One lady complained that she had walked two miles in connection with a savings certificate and she was told that nothing could be done there about it.  I do not say that is a typical case, but it is a case where definitely there was need of more staff.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to charges. I have a telephone in my house and it is used purely for private purposes.  It costs £12 a year, sometimes up to £14. People engaged in business would, perhaps, resent the suggestion, but I think it is a fairly reasonable one, that the Minister should consider increasing slightly the rentals to people engaged in business.  A slight increase would hardly be felt and it gives relief to private people.  I believe many more people would be inclined to take the telephone in such circumstances.</P>
    <P>I think it is necessary to issue instructions that young people&mdash;possibly there may be other people as well&mdash; should not be allowed to hold the kiosks, particularly on cold winter nights.  Something should be done about it.  It might be possible to enable others to get in touch with the telephone operator, so as to let him or her know that the telephone facilities in the kiosk are being abused.</P>
    <P>I must say I have received the greatest courtesy from all the officials concerned.  I cannot recall any particular <Col N="43" /> instance to the contrary.  Perhaps the cases to which I have referred are cases where the operator had a soft heart.  He might have been unaware of the fact that there were people inclined to lose their souls through using bad language, having regard to the coldness of the weather and the delay experienced through those young people abusing the telephone facilities.</P>

      <P>Perhaps I, also, will be permitted to compliment the Cathaoirleach and his staff on the beautiful way in which the Seanad Chamber has been decorated.  I note with pleasure that the historic Georgian type of decoration has been preserved.  One almost feels that Senators should come into this Chamber dressed in wigs and ruffles.</P>
      <P>Senator Hayes referred to wages. Our wages, on the whole, are not bad, and I have here a list which may be of interest.  Girls of 16 years get £2 6s. 8d.  That increases until at 17 they get £2 10s. 10d.; at 18, £2 19s. 3d.; at 19, £3 3s. 5d.; at 20, £3 6s. 7d.; at 21, £3 9s. 8d., and then it goes gradually to a maximum of £4 6s. 6d.  We are constantly recruiting people for the service.  I suppose it is like other services where you have girls, a great many of them get married and you have to keep getting other girls.  We have a free hand in the matter of recruitment and the only thing that limits us is the number of switchboards&mdash;apparatus. If we had additional apparatus we could improve the position.  That is one of our greatest difficulties.</P>
      <P>It was stated that we employ girls at 10s. a week.  Those girls are not our employees; they are employed by subpostmasters, and wherever we can use our influence on these people we do so.  We are always glad to know of cases where girls are underpaid and we always take as strong a line as possible to try to make people pay proper wages.  Of course, those girls who receive such small wages get their food as well&mdash;it is an indoor service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Hayes referred to deposits. The deposit used to be 30s., but we found at the beginning of the war that <Col N="44" /> there were certain bad debts and we were not anxious to expand the service. The sum was raised to £5.  For business firms we make the distinction that Senator O'Reilly mentioned, and business firms are charged £6 10s.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>When we expand the service we intend to examine that situation very closely.  The Senator will realise the difficulty of hitting on the right price to charge.  If we come to a certain point there might be a loss, which would be continuous.  We want to try to keep the price as low as possible, while at the same time making a profit.  That is a matter for further consideration later on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>It is being examined?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>It is, and I am very anxious to carry it out, too.  A complaint has been made as to the limited hours.  When we get the automatic system working, it will be continuous, night and day.  We shall try to make it an all round the clock service wherever it is possible.  I think those who were inclined to pit the country against the towns did not realise that the two services run very closely together.  If you improve the services at the centre, if the central exchanges are improved, the improvement works right through the trunk system all over the country. The fact that we are putting telephones into 900 post offices that did not have them before indicates that our policy is very definitely one of decentralisation as far as we can do it.</P>
      <P>We are aiming at avoiding delay and trying to give service on demand so that we will not have to resort to other expedients, such as were suggested by Senator Sir John Keane, of asking people to come back at a certain hour. That is a very difficult arrangement, because calls would keep heaping up and you would be accumulating your appointments two hours ahead.  You would really be postponing your problems and absorbing the switchboards and have the employees doing something which in the end would only make more trouble.  It is difficult to see how that suggestion could be carried out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="45" /> Senator Counihan would like to have priority for the cattle trade on fair days.  I would like to do that.  I have a family weakness for the cattle trade and I would like to see every facility given to that trade.  I do not, however, see how it could be done generally unless special arrangements could be made with individuals.  Fair days constantly occur and it would be difficult to fix definite hours.  I understand our people are quite willing to examine this matter and if anything can be done for the cattle trade I will urge that it should be done.</P>
    <P>Senator McGee mentioned the position of doctors and he said they should get special treatment.  So they do.  I do not remember refusing a doctor anywhere when he asked for a telephone. At the beginning of the war, when we first had to put restrictions on, I insisted on putting doctors and hospitals at the top of the priority list.  After that we put on people who had the largest content of employment.  Wherever we can we deal with veterinary surgeons and give them every facility. That is a rather scattered occupation and I think we can give more attention to it now.  We ought to be able to fit them in.  It is an important occupation because our live-stock trade depends on them for attention and I agree that they should receive every consideration.</P>
    <P>I am grateful to those Senators who showed so much appreciation of the work of the staff.  It is the Minister's job to take all the knocks that come. The Minister does not mind it very much but when you feel that abuse is being passed on to the staff you get annoyed, especially when you know that the staff are doing everything possible to carry out the work efficiently.</P>
    <P>Senator Crosbie referred to the experiments that are being carried on in the matter of wireless telephony.  The Post Office really has nothing to do with that and the Government are not responsible for what appeared in one of the papers and what was contradicted on the next day.  It is true we take a sympathetic interest in the matter and we would not place any obstacle in the way of these experiments <Col N="46" /> that are being carried out.  We are watching the matter very carefully. Possibly it may give us a solution of some of our most difficult problems if the firm interested in the experiments are successful and are able to bring the results that are achieved into the region of what would be a commercial proposition.</P>
    <P>It is not true to say that we have not got scientific experts in the telephone department.  You could not run the telephone system unless you had.  That system is becoming more and more complicated every day.  Our senior man, Mr. Monaghan, is one of those who has been actively engaged on research work as well as carrying out the work of the Department.  Apart from him we have quite a staff of expert engineers who are constantly watching for every improvement.  It is true, as Senator Duffy said, that changes are coming along very rapidly.  I had one example.  Early in the emergency we had special concrete ducts made to carry underground cables.  While we can still use these ducts, substitutes have been found in steel-covered cables.  We can use up the concrete ducts that remain, but the steel-covered cables are a great advance and they make it much easier to carry out the underground cable work.</P>
    <P>Senator Honan referred to certain difficulties in County Clare, particularly in Ennis.  That position is pretty difficult all right, but we have it under active consideration.  At present the delay in calls from Ennis to Limerick goes to 1½ hours in the busy periods and from Ennis to Dublin 2¾ hours.  On the Ennis-Rineanna line there is now no delay; at the very maximum there might be a delay of 15 minutes.  The delay on calls from Ennis is due to the unavoidable cause of delay operating generally, namely, shortage of trunk circuits.  Proposals for additional circuits between Ennis-Dublin and Ennis-Limerick have been included in our telephone capital programme for some time, but so far it has not been possible to provide them. The question of installing carrier equipment on this route is now being examined.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="47" /> I can assure Senator Ó Buachalla that at least 50 per cent. of the improvements will go to the country and when we improve the centres it will be reflected in the whole service. I am very glad to hear that the service given in Gaelic in Galway is so good. The Senator suggests that a public relations officer be appointed.  I think that it will be time enough, when we have dealt with the arrears and the normal flow, to launch on a publicity campaign which would justify a public relations officer.  We hope to deal with all the arrears in about 18 months and after that it would take about five years to get all the equipment into place, so as to be ready to deal with any demands which might be made upon us.</P>
    <P>Senator Baxter seemed to think that the shortage of supplies was due to the fire.  It was not.  The material destroyed by the fire was not very large and, as a matter of fact, the shortage was due to the six years' war. We had three years' supply actually in store and, by a stroke of luck, at the very last minute we were able to get extra cable, so that we were able to carry on for six years with the three years' supply.  It would not have been reasonable to ask for anything more. It is all very well after the event to criticise people, but when an officer is responsible to the accounting officer for the amount of money going to be spent for stores, I think a supply for three years was a pretty fair estimate to make and it might easily be regarded as extravagant to lay in any more.</P>
    <P>Senator Ó Siochfhradha asked where the money is coming from.  It is really a loan from the Department of Finance and must be accounted for in the Budget, when raising money by taxation. It is a loan to the Department, which pays it back by terminable annuities, which appear from year to year in the Estimates.  The Senator also suggested that we could make the equipment at home.  All possible equipment that can be made in our factory is made, but there is very elaborate machinery required which is not made in this country.  That would <Col N="48" /> be a question for an electrical industry being established outside the Post Office and, if that did happen, we would probably become their best customers, as in the Government service we naturally like to purchase all the home-produced objects we can.</P>
    <P>A very considerable amount of the money will be spent on labour, when you consider that we will be increasing our workers by one thousand and that our staff also will have to be increased by one thousand, so the money will not be spent entirely on the importation of foreign material.</P>
    <P>Senator Hawkins suggested that our plans should be laid in such a way that, when they have been carried out, we would not be limited in any way in taking on calls.  That is our aim and, in five years' time, no matter how big the demand, we will be fully able to cope with it.  Senator Ruane did not realise that it was impossible to spend money during the war, as we had not the supplies and could not put in extra equipment.  The £1,000,000 which we got before the war was spent, all but an inconsiderable sum, so one cannot accuse the Department of parsimony in not spending all we should have spent. That is by no means an indication of our rapid growth in the future.</P>
    <P>Regarding the use of the Gárda barracks, it is not really permissible, except for the most urgent calls. Abuses have crept in, in the holiday centres, where people used the barracks for sending calls which were not urgent, and restriction or warning has to be given to the public that the service in the barracks may be used only for accident, sickness, deaths or matters of extreme urgency.</P>
    <P>Senator Duffy was pessimistic about the rate at which we spend the money, seeing it was a sum of not more than £6,000,000.  The scheme really covers £10,000,000 and as soon as we have exhausted £6,000,000 we will just go and get the rest and I think there will be no difficulty about it.  I have already mentioned the Senator's point about the payment of girls.  The usual hours with us are about seven hours, and if they are kept for overtime they are paid extra.  I think his example <Col N="49" /> of the conditions being such that girls fainted is quite absurd.  It is certainly out-of-date and has not occurred within the last ten years.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Reilly raised the question of using the wireless.  Wireless telephony is at the experimental stage and, from inquiries I have made in other countries, I find that for long distances it is pretty expensive at present.  Wireless telegraphy, however, is actually used for very out-of-the-way places in the islands.  It is difficult to know what to do in the case of summer resorts, where for most of the year the equipment is fully equal to the service and only for very short periods is the equipment not sufficient and the delay considerable&mdash;as in the case mentioned of the delay in Tramore for four hours.  I shall have the matter examined, but it must be remembered always that we cannot be extravagant in giving a service which can be used only for a very short time and then will lie idle for the rest of the year.</P>
    <P>The question of idle conversations on the telephone was mentioned.  That is something that has come up from time to time.  We have found a remedy in the kiosks in Dublin, where there is now an automatic cut-off after five minutes, so as to give the next person a chance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>During the emergency special provisions were found necessary, on the dissolution of the Dáil, to ensure that members thereof would remain in office until a general election had been completed. Certain other provisions were found necessary to facilitate voters at a time when transport was deficient and to expedite the counting of votes.  The purpose of this Bill is to repeal those temporary provisions which related to the emergency.  One of the principal objects of the Bill is to enable the Dáil to be dissolved immediately upon the calling of a general election and until a new election takes place.  By that means the unvarying tradition in regard to elections will be operative once more.</P>
      <P>In connection with this measure we found that some provisions were very effective and, in our opinion, should be part of the ordinary electoral law of the land.  Therefore, this Bill also effects certain minor consolidations and makes certain temporary provisions part of the permanent law.  I will now indicate what those provisions are.</P>
      <P>Section 2 of the Bill deals with hours of polling.  Prior to the emergency, under the existing electoral legislation, the hours of polling were declared to be from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. and the Minister had no power to vary them save in some circumstance of extreme emergency. We feel that circumstances may arise which could not be defined as extreme emergency, such as a general election held during harvesting operations or during a transport strike when it is desirable to give the Minister power to postpone the closing of the poll to 9.30 p.m.  In the ordinary course of an election held in June, which is the usual time for general elections not held for special reasons, the Minister would not be likely to exercise that power.  But members of the House can conceive circumstances when that extra time might make a considerable difference in securing a good poll.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="51" /> Section 3 deals with the counting of votes at a general election or by-election. Prior to the passing of the emergency Act votes could be counted outside a constituency by the returning officer responsible.  The time at which the ballot boxes were to be opened was not defined precisely.  The returning officer was not compelled to open the boxes and commence the counting within a specified period.  The counting could be adjourned at 7 p.m. on the evening of the first day of counting unless the returning officer and the agents of all the Parties concerned were in agreement that it should continue. This section requires the opening of the boxes and the counting to commence at 9 a.m. on the morning succeeding the day of the poll.  It requires the votes to be continuously counted and dealt with until 11 p.m. Thereafter the counting can continue subject to agreement with the agents of the Parties and the returning officer. The effect of this provision should be that, in the ordinary way, the result of an election in a constituency could be announced in 48 hours.  Section 4 deals with the issue of polling cards&mdash;cards sent to each registered voter indicating his polling place and the number of his vote.</P>
    <P>A temporary measure was passed during the emergency, applicable to general elections, but not to by-elections, enabling these polling cards to be issued.  The purpose, as members of the House will know, was to acquaint voters with the new polling places provided because of transport difficulties and of the necessity of having the maximum distance between polling places and persons' residences not more than from one and a half to two and a half miles.  We consider that polling cards should be provided for as part of the ordinary electoral legislation.  We think that it is a good thing that the returning officer should notify each voter where he should go to exercise the franchise and the number of his vote.  It is true that election literature sent by various Parties and candidates can be so widely distributed that the electors will, in the ordinary way, be informed as to their <Col N="52" /> polling places and as to the numbers of their votes.  But, in many cases, this literature is not universally distributed. If a voter comes to a polling booth carrying with him his polling card and not a leaflet that, to some small degree, increases the secrecy of the ballot.  I should make clear that the possession of a polling card does not indicate that the person necessarily has the right to vote.  The question of the right to vote is still decided by whether the person's name is on the register or not and no action can be taken against a returning officer who fails to issue a proper polling card.</P>
    <P>Section 5 deals with the appointment of deputy returning officers.  Under pre-emergency legislation, a returning officer could appoint a deputy but he was not required to appoint a deputy where votes in more than one constituency had to be counted under his supervision.  It would be possible for a returning officer to proceed from one constituency to another in order to supervise the opening of the ballot papers and the counting of the votes. In that way, the result of an election could be delayed.  Section 5 provides for the appointment of deputy returning officers in such cases.  Section 6 is consequential on Section 5.</P>
    <P>Section 7 makes it easy for the Minister to appoint a returning officer should an existing returning officer become ill or incapacitated.  Under pre-emergency legislation, the Minister could use his general emergency powers but there was no specific provision in the electoral Acts to enable him to appoint a returning officer should the occasion necessitate this action.  Section 8 deals with the holding of the poll on the larger islands where polling places are provided.</P>
    <P>In previous elections, it has been found that, owing to weather conditions, the transport of ballot boxes from the island to the mainland has been delayed.  It has also been found impossible on certain occasions to hold the election on the island on the same day as that appointed for the polling on the mainland.  Returning officers have been doubtful as to their powers in this matter.  They could apply for the issue of a &ldquo;difficulty order&rdquo; under <Col N="53" /> pre-emergency electoral legislation, but it is considered desirable to give returning officers discretion and to enable them to arrange for the holding of an election a few days earlier than the appointed day for the mainland and, if necessary, to arrange for the opening of the poll at an hour different from 9 a.m. and to close it within a certain period clearly indicated in the Bill if weather conditions necessitate such action.  The returning officer is definitely given discretionary powers in this regard.</P>
    <P>The remainder of the Bill deals with repeals.  We are repealing emergency legislation and making it apply to all general elections and all by-elections in the future.  We are doing a certain amount of minor consolidation by repealing sections in the 1927 and 1935 Electoral Acts which refer to matters dealt with in this Bill, so that they will all relate to the Electoral Act, 1923, and this Bill will be a Bill amending the Electoral Act, 1923.  In that way, legislation by reference is being obviated.  I do not think that there is anything of a controversial character in the Bill and I trust it will have the unanimous support of the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Traynor)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill provides for the continuance of a limited number of the powers which had to be secured by Emergency Orders.  It incorporates in permanent legislation provisions so made covering the following matters:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(a)  Supplementary powers and duties of local authorities in connection with evacuation arrangements subject to the direction of the Minister for Defence given after consultation with the Minister for Local Government and Public Health; (b) An amendment to the Air Raid Precautions Act, 1939, necessary as a result of a typographical error in Section 34 of that Act; (c) The authority for full recoupment by the State of expenses incurred by local authorities on the provision of food and rest centre arrangements under A.R.P. schemes; (d) The necessary authority for the Minister for Finance to pay compensation to members of air raid precautions services injured while on duty in peace-time, for example, at bombing incidents.  They would be such as took place at the North Strand, Dublin and other centres during the emergency; (e) Powers to enable the Minister for Defence to <Col N="55" /> distribute reserve medical stores to hospitals where they can be maintained by use and replacement, if necessary; (f) Authority to enable grants to be paid to hospitals by the State and local authorities towards the cost of measures taken by the hospitals to protect their normal patients and staffs from the effects of air raids.</P>
    <P>These were some of the powers found necessary in the light of experience gleaned from the nature of air attacks as they developed.  They are interim measures only and designed, in the main, to enable us to retain such of the additional precautions taken under Emergency Powers Orders, as with the limited knowledge at our disposal now, seem necessary to continue.</P>
    <P>We are retaining reserves of certain essential equipment, such as fire pumps, medical and surgical supplies, rescue equipment, anti-gas respirators. This equipment is located in different parts of the country and is being maintained in good condition against the likelihood of its being required.  Any developments of air raid precautions in other countries on new lines necessitated by the altered conditions are being studied continuously by officers of the Department of Defence.</P>
    <P>No one will, I am sure, query the wisdom of retaining powers to enable air raid precautions to be organised, and while we cannot at this stage indicate the nature of the future organisation it would be undesirable to abandon any measures which may have value in the future.  The Air Raid Precautions Act, 1939, to which this Bill is an amendment, still stands but will, no doubt, need revision in the future as more information becomes available.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Counihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That the Seanad is of opinion that the recent agreement concluded with the British Government will have no beneficial effect on the production of fat cattle for export to Britain, and requests the Government to take further steps to obtain an economic price for our fat cattle, particularly during the winter and spring, and so encourage stallfeeding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This motion is not intended as an attack on the Minister or his officials and I do not intend to say anything <Col N="57" /> which would in any way affect the good relations which have always existed between the cattle trade, the Minister and the Department of Agriculture. My object is to show the unsatisfactory position of the trade and to try to induce the Minister to make further representations to obtain an economic price from the British Government for our fat cattle.</P>
    <P>During the years of the war the British Government kept the controlled price of our fat cattle at the minimum which they believed would keep the Irish farmer from going out of production. We tried time and again to get the Minister to do something to improve the position, but nothing was done.  If the Minister did try, we got no information about it.  The national executive, tired of making representations, issued a statement to the British Press in which we pointed out that we had thousands of fat cattle to sell if the British Government were prepared to pay an economic price.  As soon as that statement appeared in the Press, our High Commissioner in London was invited to discuss the matter with the British Minister of Food and there was an invitation sent to the Minister of the Irish Government to send a delegation to London to discuss prices. Some officials of the Department of Agriculture went, but the discussions did not result in any material benefit.</P>
    <P>We feel the Minister should have gone on that occasion and that two or three members of the national executive, who were responsible for getting the invitations sent to our Government, should have been invited also and should have been consulted for the purpose of advising the Department's officials.  That was not done.  I believe the Minister should have discussed the matter with his opposite number in the British Government.  If there is any truth in the statement that you should never send a boy on a man's errand it is doubly true that you should never send a civil servant on the Minister's errand.  I do not make any reflections on civil servants, but it is not the same thing for civil servants on both sides to discuss prices and agreements which they have no authority to make and which could only be made final if Ministers on both <Col N="58" /> sides discussed the matter.  That is the only complaint I have to make against the proceedings which have been adopted.</P>
    <P>The national executive are very much alarmed at the continual decline in our live-stock exports.  We cannot see any hope of an improvement under present conditions.  Previous to 1931 our average exports of cattle per year to Britain were over 800,000 head. About half that number was sent for immediate slaughter by British butchers; the other half was brought by British and Scottish farmers for continued feeding.  Our exports have declined to a little over 600,000.  That represents a decline of 200,000 in those years. During that time also we were exporting thousands of sheep and lambs, and millions of pounds' worth of pigs, bacon and butter.  At the present time we are producing scarcely sufficient pigs, bacon, butter, sheep or lambs to feed our own population.</P>
    <P>We believe that decline in production is due to trade restrictions and uneconomic prices, and that is proved by the increase in the exports of cattle from the Six Counties.  In 1938 the exports of fat cattle from the Six Counties were 57,000 head.  These exports increased in 1945 to 156,000 head.  Our exports of fat cattle declined from 139,000 in 1938 to 13,000 in 1945.</P>
    <P>The Six-County and British farmers complain that the prices for fat cattle do not pay the cost of production. There is an enormous difference between their prices and what the British Government propose to pay us. The best price that they will pay for home-bred British or North of Ireland cattle is 82/6 per live cwt. and in a good many cases there is 2/6 per cwt. for quality added to the 82/6, making 84/- as the top price for British or North of Ireland home-bred cattle. Where we export live cattle to the Six Counties or Great Britain and sell them on the live-weight basis within two months of being exported, the best price for the best cattle would be 52/-per live cwt.  That is a difference of £19 on a bullock of 12 cwt.  If anybody thinks we can continue on that basis, he is labouring under a great mistake. <Col N="59" /> Of course, we do not send any cattle to be sold on the live-weight basis.  We sent a small number in the last year, to be sold at the port of landing, consigned to the British Food Controller. We were getting 10¼d. per lb., until the increase of 1d., making it now 11¼d., but we have to pay all the expenses and take the risk of some of the carcases being condemned for bruises or diseases, in which case we get nothing for them, as they are not insured.</P>
    <P>We can sell the best cattle at home in the Dublin market or in any other place, for export to the Continent, at 10/- per live. cwt. more.  The top price for the Continent to-day in Dublin was 68/-, which would mean about 1/1½, whereas the best price when shipped to the British Minister of Food would be 11¼d.  Therefore, anybody would think that the trade agreement must be a silly thing, if the Irish farmer is going to export to Britain and pay all the expenses, at £5 or £6 a head less than he could get in the Dublin market for the same animal.  Of course, a good deal of the cattle we send there would not be bought for the Continent.  I admit that the extra 1d. a lb. for cattle we have to send to England is a certain advantage, but the whole increase should not have such a flourish of trumpets.  On the cattle exported last year it would mean about £20,000.</P>
    <P>The British Minister of Food is anxious to buy meat from any quarter he can get it.  The present ration to British citizens is 1/2 worth of meat per week.  The British Government has made long-term agreements with the Argentine, Denmark, Australia and Canada.  It is extraordinary that our Government cannot fix an agreement for our live stock, which is so important for the prosperity of this country. The agreements which other countries have made, in some cases, are 50 per cent. better, as in the case of the Argentine.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCrosbie" hpid="Mr. Crosbie Mr. Crosbie">

    <Speaker pid="JohnCounihan" hpid="Mr. Counihan Mr. Counihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Counihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Adding 45 and 12½ gives 52½ per cent., as a matter of fact, so I am right in saying at least 50 per cent. more than the prices given in 1939.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="60" /> The cattle trade do not want the Minister or the officials to go hat in hand to beg favours from the British Government.  We want the Minister to meet them on equal terms.  We are the third or fourth best customers of Great Britain.  We are on the sterling bloc and it will cost them no dollars to buy our stuff.  The Irish farmers do not want to send their food to the Continent if they can get anything like the same price here from the British Government. We want to deal with the people with whom we always dealt, and if there were a little bit of goodwill, if the Minister came off his high horse and went to interview the British Government, some arrangements could be made.</P>
    <P>I do not want to say anything which would aggravate the Minister or the Department, but I hope he will think over the statements I have made, which cannot be controverted.  The British Government cannot expect that we send cattle, pay all the expenses and run all the risks and then accept £6 per head less than we could get in the Dublin market for cattle to go to the Continent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to second Senator Counihan's motion.  No more important question has come before the Oireachtas for a long time.  If he were twice as vehement, I would not blame him.  In fact, it is rather unfortunate for the cattle trade that he is the calm, dignified figure he is. If he were more impetuous and more inclined to make the Minister angry, I believe he would be much more effective.  This is not a matter about which we can mince words.  There is very great dissatisfaction throughout the country about the prices being paid by Britain to Irish farmers for their live stock to-day and there is very good cause for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Counihan has given us the facts.  He was denouncing the Government&mdash;and rightly so, in my opinion&mdash; for the economic war and the consequences which flowed from it.  The position to-day is no more satisfactory than it was then, if you calculate that to-day the Six-County or the British farmer, when he takes his fat beast to <Col N="61" /> the market, for a 12 cwt. article can get £19 more than the Irish farmer would for the same animal.  There is something wrong in the whole position. It is sometimes said that we are not fighting half as vigorously as we should to get the best possible price from the British, that we are so concerned about the cost of living here that we are not fighting hard enough to raise the British payment to us.</P>
    <P>I want to add my comment to what Senator Counihan has said regarding the policy that has been pursued for a very considerable time in making trade agreements between this country and Britain for the sale of our agricultural products.  I do not know where the idea originated, but the Minister's policy in this respect is definitely unsatisfactory.  Members of the Government or members of the Department are sent to carry on negotiations, and we put them in the position that they are to sell the produce of Irish farmers, without consulting them or their representatives and without bringing the representatives of the cattle trade with them to have their advice and backing.  I do not know how they manage to get that mandate.  Even from the Minister's point of view, it would be very much better, when our representatives go to discuss the problems of marketing, that they should be accompanied by some representatives of the producers.  In fact, it would be much more sensible to send the representatives to do the bargaining. Although Senator Counihan is a soft-hearted man, the members of the cattle trade would not be bad bargainers at all.  Without consultation with the producers, we are arranging prices with the British Ministry of Food which are definitely unsatisfactory. Far be it from me to cast any reflection on the men chosen for this rather difficult operation.  We all know them and respect them for their ability, but when officials are making arrangements they are doing something very impersonal and not doing it in at all the same way as a man would when selling his very own stuff.</P>
    <P>I am convinced that much better prices could be secured if our policy were different.  We had better be frank and outspoken about this.  What <Col N="62" /> is to be our policy with regard to the export of beef cattle to Britain in the future?  What does Britain expect of us?  Sometimes I think they feel they must get our stock, no matter what price they pay for it.  There is no one more anxious to sell to Britain than I am.  I would sell to anyone if I got a decent price, but I have some pride left, and refuse to be kicked about by the Minister of Food in England or anyone else.  I refuse to accept the position that we must take much less for a commodity than our neighbours get for something equally good, but no better.  We know that beef is the most sought-after commodity now in every country, yet we find ourselves in a situation which does us no credit at all. We are prepared to accept the price which is forced on us to-day.  Britain was wealthy once.  She is wealthy no longer, although she is still regarded by many as being very powerful.  She finds herself to-day in the extraordinary position that little countries like Belgium and Holland can come into the Dublin market and give £6 or £7 more for a fat beast than she is prepared to pay.</P>
    <P>I do not live very far from the Border.  There is a very considerable trade in smuggling going on there. Day after day, wagons of live stock are coming up and passing through my county from the Midlands, to be driven across the Border.  You have a beast in my county worth £35 and, if you can get it across, it is worth £48. That is happening every day and ten or 20 wagons of stock are flowing in that direction.  A considerable illegitimate trade is being built up, to the detriment of the legitimate producers and traders.  I hope what the Minister has to say will not be a defence of the British Government's policy towards us.  Other people have made them pay their price.  I know we could argue from the angle that we are not in a situation to-day in which we can claim that we are getting goods against our sterling and that to build up an increase in our sterling assets may not be a very commendable policy at a time when it is suggested that we are being challenged to write down the value of those assets.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="63" /> This fact, however, has to be noted, as Senator Counihan pointed out: after very difficult negotiations with the Argentine, because President Perron was prepared to withhold the export of beef to the British market, the Argentinians got what they wanted. They got concessions with regard to the ownership of the railways in their country built by British capital and they got the highest price for beef which they had ever received.  Cattle were never as high in price in the Argentine as they are to-day.  Cattle in this country are not at all as valuable as they were in the days of the last war.  With the Danes, the British were in a similar position.  When trading commenced after the defeat of the Germans, the British, apparently, thought they could buy from the Danes at their own price.  Suddenly, they discovered that the Danes were not prepared to sell to them at their price and they had to advance their prices for butter and bacon considerably before they could get supplies.</P>
    <P>Relatively, the beef Britain is buying from us is the cheapest commodity in the world to-day.  There is nothing better than the beef we are producing and Britain is buying it at a price far under its value.  The same article in the hands of the British or the people of the Six Counties would be value for the sums which Senator Counihan has mentioned.  At this stage, I do not know what I should be prepared to advocate.  If, however, I were challenged and if I could not see my way clearer in relation to the position we shall occupy in the future in respect of the export of live stock to Britain, I should be prepared completely to reorientate my policy rather than accept a price far under the value of the commodity I have to sell and bearing no relation to the price paid to the British or the Six-County farmer for the same commodity.  The British and Six-County farmers were able to get a considerable increase in their prices consequent on the increase they had to pay to their agricultural labourers but nothing came to us as compensation. It seems to me that there is a general attitude of mind towards farming not only in Britain but in this country <Col N="64" /> which is revealed in the problem which Senator Counihan has introduced&mdash;a feeling that anything is good enough for Irish farmers and that, no matter what price is fixed, they are prepared to accept it and toil on.  Nothing could be farther from the truth.  In the days of the emergency, farmers put up with many difficulties, laboured under disadvantages and carried their burden as well as they could.  They were so busy with the toils and labours of the day that they had not much time to think about problems of price or to come together and lay plans to have their prices increased.  But they are beginning to stir.  They are becoming conscious now that they suffered, in the recent war, losses and disadvantages which they did not experience in the previous war.  They have not come out of this war at all as well off as they came out of the previous war.  They have built up no reserves such as they built up in the last war and that is due, in the main, to the fact that, throughout the seven years of the war, cattle prices were not at all adequate to meet the cost which the work we were engaged in entailed.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will have an appreciation of the fact that Senator Counihan spoke with restraint, that the attitude of the British in this matter of price will be very detrimental and that there is need for an examination of the whole position to try to discover what the policy of Britain will be in regard to the purchase of fat cattle from us in the future.  The sooner we face up to that the better.  I do not believe in mincing words about this problem.  We ought to know our own minds on it but we ought equally to discover what the British mind is.  If the British attitude of mind is not going to be satisfactory to us, then we had better put on our considering caps and decide whether there is not need for a change of policy.  There is no doubt that Irish farming cannot prosper under the conditions which British live-stock policy imposes on it to-day.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephJohnston" hpid="Professor Johnston Professor Johnston">
      <NameTxt>Professor Johnston</NameTxt>
      <P>There are many viewpoints from which I might approach consideration of this most important motion and many capacities in <Col N="65" /> which I might discuss it but I have to remember that, for some years, I was a member of a committee which was studying the problem of post-emergency agricultural policy.  In that capacity, we had before us many matters, including this very important matter.  I feel that, as an ex-member of that committee, I am, to some extent, on my defence in this matter, as well as the Minister, because one of the things we tried to do on that committee was to build up a case for establishing the principle of the same price for the same quality of product in the British market, whether the animal is of Irish or of British origin.  We did that in the most temperate manner possible. Perhaps, we were a bit too temperate. I should like, in the course of my remarks, to put on record some of the things we might have said but did not say and some of the data which came before us which we might have published but did not publish.</P>
      <P>Before coming to that, I want to emphasise the regrettable fact that, for the past 14 years, stall-feeding of winter beef cattle is stone dead in Éire and it is the British differential pricepolicy that has killed it.  In approaching that matter, I do not want to take an anti-British point of view.  I want to approach it from the point of view of the fundamental economic interest of Ireland and, at the same time, to make all possible allowance for the point of view of the British in their economic relations with us and, if possible, to put the matter on a basis on which we can have a square deal in our economic relations with our great neighbour.  I do not think that we have succeeded yet in putting it on that basis.  So long as that principle of the differential price, which penalises the export of fat cattle from Éire and which has killed the stall-feeding of cattle stone dead, continues, we cannot have that square deal in our economic relations with our great neighbour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It may seem a small matter that we get too low a price for cattle that are fed in the house in winter time and it might seem that the principal result of a higher price for winter-fed beef would be an increase in the cost of living in this country to people who <Col N="66" /> buy beef.  Superficially, that might appear to be the case but I want to make the point that the stall-feeding of cattle should be an integral part of our whole agricultural economy and that it is essential to a sound economic basis for the large-scale programme of cereal cultivation to which we have had to commit ourselves in connection with the war and to which we seem likely to be committed for some time to come.  It is, I think, generally accepted that it is possible to have a large-scale production of corn products in a western European country when that corn cultivation is based on a profitable live-stock economy and is associated with the winter feeding of cattle, thereby providing the natural manure without which you cannot procure high yields from the cultivation of grain crops in this climate and soil. Consequently, the fact that we have not been able to get a sufficient amount of animal manure to put our land through a proper rotation has, undoubtedly, contributed to a reduction of the yield per acre of our wheat and oat crops during the past few years. If you look at the statistics in these matters, you will find that, whereas a normal yield of about 20 cwts. per acre was quite common in the case of wheat, oats and barley some years ago, in the past few years the yield has dropped to about 17 cwts. per acre. One of the causes of this regrettable drop is scarcity of animal manure.  The principal cause of that is that stall-feeding is no longer an economic proposition for farmers.  If it had not been for this fact, if stall-feeding had been still possible, it is likely that the yield of wheat per acre would have been heavier, that the price per barrel which would adequately pay the farmer would have been less than the price we have at present to pay and that, consequently, the cost of living would have been lower for the general public.  I should like people to realise that, whether they have any direct interest in agriculture or not.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of the matter is that, owing to this discouragement of the adequate winter feeding of cattle, both big and small, we have had in recent years the phenomenon that; although the total cattle population appears to <Col N="67" /> be maintained about the same figure, nevertheless, the annual output of cattle for home consumption and export has steadily diminished in recent years. The reason for that seems to be that, because the cattle are inadequately fed in winter, they take longer to mature. The annual output is less than it used to be&mdash;less by a matter of about 100,000 animals in the year.  If you turn those 100,000 animals in the year into cash, even at the present relatively low prices, it amounts to a few million pounds in the year.  If you take into account the indirect repercussions on our economy which that higher output of cattle would have had, you might argue that the total reduction in the national income resulting from this discrimination against our cattle would be from £18,000,000 to £20,000,000&mdash;that we incurred a national loss on account of this disorganisation of our economy of the order of £10,000,000 to £20,000,000, at present prices.</P>
    <P>I would like to put on record certain facts and data which came before us in our capacity as a committee investigating these matters.  First of all, I would like to refer to what we actually published. This particular problem was referred to in paragraphs 47 and 48 of our Interim Report on the Cattle and Dairying Industry; again in paragraphs 62 to 67, and also in paragraph 255 of the Majority Report on Agricultural Policy.  In the course of our deliberations there was a good deal of bandying about of typewritten memoranda and so forth.  A good deal of consideration was given not only to what we would say but how we would say it.  Some of the comments that were considered on this problem of price differentiation were perhaps somewhat more pungently expressed than what finally appeared in the published report.  Let me quote one of them:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The policy of price differentiation encouraging the export of store cattle rather than finished fat cattle has been a principal cause of change in the character of our cattle exports and of a reduction in a formerly profitable trade.  It has also diminished <Col N="68" /> the quanity of farmyard manure, for now only about enough cattle are house fed in winter time to meet the requirements of the home market and sometimes even that is left in short supply.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now, about the change in the character of our exports, a return was made to us showing the total number of cattle classified as fat which were exported in the winter months&mdash;that is in the months of December to April&mdash;in the series of years from 1925-26 to 1943-44. For various reasons, which I considered inadequate, it was not included in our published report.  I would like to take this opportunity of making these figures public.  I think they are most important and that they do establish a <i>prima facie</i> case for the serious effect of this matter on the export of winter fed cattle.  If necessary, I am prepared to read this whole row of figures to the House.  Senators, in the meantime, can go to sleep, but if they like they can take it as read.  I can comment on the general characteristics of it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephJohnston" hpid="Professor Johnston Professor Johnston">
      <NameTxt>Professor Johnston</NameTxt>
      <P>I will merely tell the House the gist of it.  From 1925-26 to 1931-32 the number of fat cattle exported between December and April, inclusive, averaged between 100,000 and 130,000.  From 1931-32 until the outbreak of the recent war the number ranged round about 50,000 to 80,000. From 1939-40 the number was upset in one year, due to the outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease which held up cattle exports.  Consequently, they had to go out as best they could.  Many of them went out as technically fat cattle.  In 1941 there was the inflated figure of 47,000.  In most of the war years the number was very moderate indeed.  In 1942-43 it was only 7,500, and in 1943-44 only 610.  In other words, cattle classified as fat were badly hit after the introduction of the differential price policy in 1942-43.  The recent war situation has pretty well killed that whole trade, and killed it stone dead.</P>
      <P>Now, may I read this comment which, unfortunately, did not appear in our published report:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="69" />&ldquo;The principle of price discrimination has become in recent years a normal feature of British policy, and ours is not the only country which is affected by it.  Accordingly, a general analysis of its economic significance and implications will not be out of place.  There are two principal methods by which an importing country may raise the price of home-grown food for the benefit of her own farmers.  One is by placing a tariff on all competing imported products. In that case the consumer must pay a higher price with reference to the whole range of food products whether home-grown or imported. The native farmer benefits by being able to command a higher price in the market thus protected. Obviously, of course, by this method the addition to the consumer's expenditure, in the case of a country like the United Kingdom, far exceeds the financial advantage conveyed to the nation's farmers.  It is quite intelligible that public policy in the United Kingdom should avoid the use of this method.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The more usual method is for the State to pay from public funds an addition to the price which the nation's farmers are able to command in the ordinary course of commerce. In that case imported agricultural products continue to come in and are bought at the &lsquo;world price&rsquo;.  The consumer pays no more in respect of any portion of his consumption than he would pay in a free market.  The additional gain to the nation's farmers takes the form of a direct transfer from public funds. From the national point of view this is the most economical way of conferring a special advantage on the national agriculture.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I should say, before reading any more, that the principal feature of this British policy is the fact that producers of fat cattle receive a subsidy in Britain direct from the British taxpayer which goes into the pocket of the producer and is not taken out of the pocket of the consumer.  The British point of view is that they are quite prepared to subsidise their own producers, but they do not see any <Col N="70" /> particular reason why they should subsidise our producers of fat cattle for export to Britain.  Hitherto, they have done their very best to limit the subsidy in the case of forward stores and to deprive us altogether of the element of subsidy in the case of fat cattle which we export finished.  Our answer to that should be that it is a matter of indifference to us whether the British choose to pay for their beef as taxpayers or consumers or both, but that what does interest and affect us is the final price that goes into the pocket of the British producer.  The circumstances that have arisen in consequence of that British policy, and the operation of that differential price, have thrown a spanner into the works of our agricultural economy.  We protest against it and demand and require that they should agree to the principle of the same price for the same quality of animal whether produced in Ireland or in Britain.  May I read further:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Under war conditions the British Ministry of Food has a monopoly of the import demand for all imported food products.  Consequently, there is no such thing as a &lsquo;world price&rsquo; in the ordinary peace time significance of the term.  We do not know whether or how long the British Ministry of Food will continue to exercise its monopolistic functions in the post-war era.  Clearly, while it does continue to exercise them, and until other markets in other industrial countries are again available, it can exercise an economic influence on the whole economy not only of our country but of all food exporting countries&mdash;most of them members of the British Commonwealth of Nations.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;There is reason to believe that New Zealand has found, during the recent war years, that her export prices have tended to be relatively lower than her import prices, and her economy has been financially embarrassed in consequence.  This was recognised by the United Kingdom and a substantial additional payment was made to the New Zealand Government to compensate for this disparity.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In our case the export price of all <Col N="71" /> our agricultural exports is definitely much less than the price plus subsidy obtained by the producers of similar products in the United Kingdom. The export price obtainable for our agricultural products is a principal element in the determination of agricultural incomes here, including the incomes of agricultural labourers. Agricultural wages here have risen in recent years, but are less than the current level of wages in the United Kingdom by at least 20/- per week. Labour and capital move freely from our country to Great Britain&mdash;in which respect we differ from the other nations in the Commonwealth. Consequently, lower prices for our agricultural exports than are, in fact, commanded by producers of exactly similar products in the United Kingdom constitute a strong economic inducement to us to export agricultural labourers to Great Britain instead of agricultural products.  We have, in fact, done so to an extent that now embarrasses our agricultural effort.  This is a matter which concerns the United Kingdom as well as ourselves.  We can see the reasonableness from a British point of view of the price discrimination policy followed in recent years.  But its economic implications and repercussions have, perhaps, not been fully realised by those responsible for it.  We are strongly of opinion that equal prices for equal qualities of produce, sold in the United Kingdom, is the policy which would best facilitate agricultural production in and export from our country.  We recommend that a joint conference be held to see if the problem can be solved in a manner that will be compatible with the national interests of both countries.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now, another point which came out in the course of our investigation was that if we wanted at a later stage to go on to a policy of processing our own beef cattle and sending them out as dead beef rather than as live cattle, we just could not do it so long as the present price differentiation principle exists, because any factory established for the processing of beef, in the case of high-class <Col N="72" /> store cattle, would have to buy the store cattle at the relatively high price which store cattle for export demands, and, presumably, sell the finished beef on the basis of the relatively low price that the British Ministry of Food gives for cattle ready for slaughter.  That would mean either bankruptcy for the organisation or highly subsidising your factory here. Let me quote from some of these memoranda:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;For example, under present conditions forward stores sell in the British market at a higher price than the price appointed by the Ministry of Food for fat cattle exported for immediate slaughter.  It has been recommended to us that we should transform our live cattle export trade into an export trade in dead meat as soon as may be.  Under present conditions it would be financially impossible for an Irish dead meat industry to buy its raw material in competition with the relatively higher price obtainable for forward stores and sell its finished product in the British market at the equivalent of the price paid by the Ministry of Food for fat cattle exported for immediate slaughter.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That brings me to another point which, perhaps, may indicate some loophole of escape from this very difficult situation. The person that made that recommendation to us was Mr. Thomas Shaw, an Englishman, who is an expert in the dead meat trade.  Looking at it from the point of view of an expert, he has been a strong advocate that we should develop the dead meat trade. He recently wrote an article in <i>Studies</i> advocating that policy.  He has been at it now for quite a long time. We have been doing our best to restrain him because we felt that so long as the differential price system exists what he was advocating was not practical politics.  Here is a letter I had from him on the 12th October, 1944:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Dear Mr. Johnston,</P>
    <P>I am wondering if the time has not come when I ought to do something to bring the matters of the report I made some years ago into discussion. <Col N="73" /> On this side, as you will be aware, a good deal of consideration is being given to post-war agricultural problems.  I myself am actively engaged on the meat and live-stock side in this connection, and I am finding increasing agricultural and political support for the principle that efficiency in production must be allied to efficiency in processing and distribution.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;A year ago I published a report on the re-organisation of the meat industry in this country and I am not unhopeful that as a result of the discussions that have ensued from it there will evolve on this side a rationalised processing and distributive trade allied to and integrated with organised producers.  This carries a stage further the concept that I outlined in my report on an Irish meat industry and some day I hope to have a discussion with you on it.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In the meantime, it would seem to me that useful purpose would be served if the organisation of a homemeat industry in Éire, with its attendant centralised factory abattoir and the ancillary manufacturing trades arising therefrom, were brought to discussion by an intelligent public.  I, of course, have no idea what may be the intentions of the powers that be regarding agricultural policy, but Éire has so much to lose by the continuing export of live, fat stock, and so much to gain in the national economy by processing at home, that official policy may be influenced if this matter were now brought to the forefront.  If you agree that the time is now opportune, how can action best be taken?  Would, for instance, useful purpose be served if I contributed a reasoned article on this matter to some such publication as <i>Studies?</i>  I would do this either on my own or jointly with somebody whom you might care to suggest.  The main point is, that at some stage the policy suggested in my report will be opportune for discussion.  I think you know that my interest in this matter, in so far as Éire is concerned, arises from what I believe to be a well-founded <Col N="74" /> belief that only by the export of well-graded Éire produce through orderly and efficient marketing channels can there be any real hope of a secure agricultural industry. The continuing export of raw material is an impoverishing factor, and only by processing at home under rational and modernised methods can the best interests of Éire's economy be served.  My own background, as you know, has been that of agriculture and the marketing of its produce, and I am sufficiently immodest in this particular matter to believe that I can make some small contribution. However that may be, it constitutes my reason for this letter and I would be most grateful if you would consider the matters I have raised and, as soon as you are able, be good enough to give me your views.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now, as Senators may be aware, that gentleman, Mr. Thomas Shaw, recently printed an article on the Irish meat and live-stock industry in the current number of <i>Studies</i>, to which I direct the attention of Senators.  The Editor of <i>Studies</i> submitted it to former members of the agricultural committee, including myself, for comment beforehand, and I had to comment in a way which was both optimistic and pessimistic. I had to say this with reference to his article:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I have read, with mixed feelings, Mr. Shaw's able exposition of the need for replacing our export of beef cattle on the hoof by a properly organised and developed dead meat export trade.  If it could be accomplished, nothing could contribute more effectively to the growth of our agricultural prosperity and to the establishment of a sound industrialism closely integrated with our major agricultural activity.  Unfortunately, under the conditions which have existed since 1932 <i>and which still exist</i>, the thing is impossible. In that year Great Britain began a price policy which stimulates, in fact subsidises, the export of forward stores and discriminates heavily against the export of cattle ready for immediate slaughter.  The policy has had different forms at different times, but in substance its effect has <Col N="75" /> always been the same.  To take a typical illustration: if the price fixed by the British Ministry of Food for an imported animal ready for immediate slaughter is 60/- per cwt. live weight, the corresponding price for an animal of equal merit, reared and finished in Great Britain, is of the order of 74/-, while the price obtainable for a forward Irish store with two months' expectation of life in Great Britain would be 69/-.  During most months of the year the latter price governs the price payable by Irish butchers for beef or near-beef animals.  The crucial system is: if we had a dead meat factory processing the type of animal now exported on the hoof, would it get a price for the exported meat no higher than the equivalent of the 60/- price now payable for animals exported for immediate slaughter, or what price would it get?  On the answer to this question by Mr. Strachey depends the feasibility or otherwise of Mr. Shaw's very attractive proposition. It is quite certain that the dead meat factory&mdash;if operating under present conditions&mdash;would have to pay the 69/- price for its cattle.  To buy at 69/- and sell at 60/- would, from the outset, condemn the proposed venture to bankruptcy&mdash;or heavy subsidisation by the national Government.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now Mr. Shaw is a very persistent person and I hope sooner or later he will get away with his big idea.  If he does he will have established something in the long-term interest of Britain as well as ourselves and it would be very much in our agricultural and other interests.  He tells me in a more recent letter that he is quite hopeful that this British policy of encouraging the export of forward stores and discouraging the export of fat cattle is essentially temporary, and as soon as there is less straw in Britain to trample into manure&mdash;in other words, as soon as the area under cereal production is diminished to normal in Britain&mdash;they will be less keen on importing our store cattle to trample their straw into manure and they may be more disposed to discuss on a new <Col N="76" /> basis the whole question of the export of cattle live or dead to Britain.  I hope he is right&mdash;I do not know.</P>
    <P>He has, on his own suggestion, and assisted by Professor Smiddy, arranged to read a paper on the general problem of the marketing of Irish agricultural products, with special reference to the feasibility of the development of a dead meat trade, before the Dublin University Commerce Society in Trinity College, Dublin, on Tuesday, 3rd December, at 8 o'clock.  The Minister has very kindly agreed to speak to the paper and Deputy Hughes and one or two other prominent speakers will be present.  I hope to have tickets available for distribution and if any Senator is interested in the subject, I will be only too pleased if he will turn up to hear Mr. Shaw, who is out to achieve something of permanent advantage to both countries.  In our own interest we ought to give him every possible encouragement.</P>
    <P>I am glad this matter has been discussed in an atmosphere fairly free from recrimination.  It was unfortunate this differential price policy began about the same time as the economic war, but the British were careful to explain at the time that their subsidising of beef and their discrimination against the price of Irish cattle was no part of their economic reprisals. In a way that was satisfactory, but in another way it would have been more satisfactory if it had been part of the economic war, because it would have come to an end in 1938, whereas the British cattle policy has been, from our point of view, one of the most economically hostile things that they did to us at that time and it would have been highly desirable that that part of the economic war which still continues should have come to an end in 1938.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcGee" hpid="Mr. McGee Mr. McGee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGee</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to say a few words in case certain aspects have not been sufficiently emphasised, though I think they have been.  I notice in this evening's paper that they deplore the lack of organisation amongst the members of the cattle trade, especially in Dublin, because of what happened to-day.  Someone was kind enough a few days ago to publish <Col N="77" /> that a special boat was coming to Dublin.  The result was an exceptionally heavy market in Dublin this morning.  Then, glory be to God, the boat was not prepared to take cattle. I think our cattle traders and the Government are seriously at fault.  They got an opportunity of using a boat from a foreign country for the cattle market, but they made no arrangement for the cattle.  The cattle were here and they could have been bought at a decent price for that foreign country.  Some system of organisation to ship those cattle would have been much better than having us assemble here to discuss what we should do in the future.  The point is that we should have done something to-day. Had that boat been in a position to sail, the prices in the Dublin market would have been much better.</P>
      <P>We are up against a very clever country in England.  They are not fools.  They are not going to raise the standard of employment in rural Ireland. One of the objects is to get the workers from rural Ireland to become coal miners in England.  We cannot blame England.  It is their game to keep down the greatest source of employment in Ireland.  They are advertising for coal miners.  They want our young men from the country districts; they do not want them to be employed in the sheds in holy Ireland. Why would they want them so employed?  Our Irish workers may be paid at £1 a week less than in England. If these men are kept in Ireland, England will be so much the poorer.  They are looking for 10,000 or 20,000 miners to mine their coal. We have got this great source of employment and yet neither the home Government nor the cattle traders have made any arrangements to facilitate the excellent services which some continental Governments are prepared to provide.  It is a very serious matter that such a thing should take place 20 or 25 years after a native Government was established.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First of all, we were told a boat was to come and then the papers this evening report that the boat is not ready for the cattle.  The cattle trade is of benefit to Ireland from the point of <Col N="78" /> view of the standard of living it provides. Many people leave the country because there is no employment for them there, because my sheds and the sheds all over County Louth are empty. It is easy for some politicians to talk, but we must recognise the position that exists.  Why not have the cows to produce the calves?  When the calves are reared there will be sufficient milk to produce butter by the ton and to spare as we always had it. Why is butter scarce?  It is scarce because calf-rearing has ceased, because stall-feeding has ceased, and because the prejudicial hand of England is there against us all along the line.</P>
    <P>I think it is time that the Government and the traders should decide that a bounty of £5, £6 or £7 10s. Od. per head be paid on every Irish beast that is two months in an Irish stall. That is the solution of the problem and it should be made operative if only for the reason that it will give employment at home and, through that employment, we will be able to get sufficient butter not only to feed our people, but to export.  There is a close alliance between a strong Christian outlook and the cattle trade; the trade has a close association with the Great Knight of civilisation.  We are a Christian people in this country and we should keep as many cows as will provide milk and butter for the people who are in the country.  We have a dwindling population because we are tapping too seriously the source that gave employment for so many years.</P>
    <P>The question of manure arises. There should be no shortage.  In other days outside every small household the produce of cows could be found rotting, ready to be put into the land to grow potatoes.  Our Government have failed &mdash;it must be admitted that they have failed&mdash;to obtain an economic price for our cattle in England.  The prejudice is there against them.  England wants our boys and girls; they do not want them to look after the cattle here. What are we to do?  It would be a useful action on the Government's part&mdash;it is a matter that calls for sympathetic consideration&mdash;to give what was suggested eight, ten or 12 <Col N="79" /> years ago, a bounty on home-produced beef.  We should convert the ships we have and put them to useful employment bringing our cattle at the lowest possible rate to the continental markets.  That is a proposal that is well worthy of consideration.</P>
    <P>It is no use in attacking Governments. They follow the line of least resistance, and they do not often accomplish much good.  Constantly speaking about what should be done is leading us nowhere and all the time the bleeding, the poverty and the flight from the land is continuing.</P>

      <P>I do not know of any discussion in this House for a considerable time on the outcome of which depends more the whole economic stability of this State.  Senator Counihan must be congratulated on the very fine case he has made this evening for this all-important industry.  We have been told time and again that 60 per cent. of the people directly and indirectly get their living from the land.  In a remarkable speech, part of which I have often quoted, made by An Taoiseach to one of the largest conventions of farmers ever held in this country&mdash;in 1930, I think&mdash;he appreciated the value of a prosperous agricultural community.  He said: &ldquo;The evils you suffer from are not from God; they are not like the seasons, over which we have no control; they are readily adjusted by good government, which we propose to give you, if and when elected.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Agriculture is in a state of topsy-turvy. The dairying industry is the basis of our whole economy and I come from a dairying county.  Our county committee of agriculture, of which I am a member, requested its C.E.O. to get a carefully compiled statistical return of the number of dairy cows over a number of years in our county and to get a milk return from the 53 proprietary creameries which operate in the county&mdash;which were built by the energy, industry and money of the people, representing £500,000 to the farmers of the county, making it a prosperous and specialised industry. He submitted the returns for 1938 to <Col N="80" /> 1941 to us, showing that there were 11,000 less dairy cows in 1941 as compared with 1939.  Only 33 out of the 54 creameries responded to our appeal for statistics and they gave the relative figures taken in milk over the same period of years.  We discovered from that that there were 1,500,000 gallons less milk per year.  There was a tragedy, clearly and unmistakably, showing the little interest in and the future prospect for the young farmers.</P>
    <P>That is not the worst.  Last year, in a small area around my town, acting in the capacity of an auctioneer, I cleared, in a radius of seven miles, 1,800 acres of land of milch cows.  That was one auctioneer in a circumscribed area.  The weekly papers show that other auctioneers throughout the country are doing the same.  Is that not unmistakable evidence of a lack of interest in dairying?  What is going to happen to butter production, the production of young cattle and store cattle and the continuity of that industry?  The Minister may tell me that the dairy cows I sold were replaced by young stock or other store cattle.  They were not.  The farmers have lost interest, because of the uneconomic position and asked me to set the land for other purposes.  That is a lamentable picture, in one of the most important counties in Ireland, showing the economic slavery in dairying.</P>
    <P>About five or six years ago, the Registrar-General stated in his report to this Government that the condition of the rural community was becoming appalling.  There were 350 rural schools closed because of the lack of interest in the farmers' children in getting married and their incapacity to do so and because of their disgust in regard to the slavery, the hardship and the unremunerative return from agriculture to their parents.  I raised this matter recently at a committee meeting and asked for a return showing the number of farmers' sons to whom we gave scholarships in the Albert School and other agricultural schools over the last five years and showing the number of these young men who returned to the land, as that was the primary reason why we asked <Col N="81" /> the ratepayers to contribute to their education, giving them technical and scientific knowledge which they might use on their farms.  I am told that very few, if any, want to return to the land.  The Registrar-General told us there were 66,000 less rural children to be found on the registers of primary schools.</P>

      <P>I am trying to show that the whole interest and drive of the rural community is against the land, because of the unremunerative prices.  This is very serious, as the whole economic structure of our community is being ruined.  Fat cattle last August were going at £28 and £30 for 2½-year-old bullocks which only two months afterwards would be sold for £32 and £34.  As indicated by the excellent speech of Senator Counihan, agriculture is in a state of topsy-turvy, our farmers are despairing and there is the flight from the land.  They deny themselves even the ordinary necessaries of life, forgo complete fulfilment of existence, deny themselves the happy companionship of married life and doom the race to extinction. Every Senator and county councillor is being approached by John, Tom and Mary every day of the week.  I was with the Department of External Affairs to-day regarding boys who want to fly from the land, because there is no future there, no stability and no uniformity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support some Senators who gave figures regarding our output and export of cattle over the last 21 years.  I think Senator Counihan's figure for the 1920's was a bit too high. The average export of cattle from 1925 to 1931 was 730,000.  Of that, we must keep in mind that the number of fats was 290,000.  In the period 1932 to 1938, the average export went down to 650,000 and the number of fats went down to 170,000, while the number of stores and milch cows remained constant as from 1925 to 1931.  In the war years, 1939 to 1945, the average export was 535,000.  Again, the stores and the cows are practically constant, but the <Col N="82" /> number of fat cattle was down to an average of 80,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCounihan" hpid="Mr. Counihan Mr. Counihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Counihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister give the number for 1945?  I contend it is only 13,000, with 4,000 shipped to the Continent.  These are the Department's own figures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was trying to support the Senator's argument.  In the last few years, the average is down to 466,000 and the average of fats was 15,000.  There are three things we must keep in mind when giving these figures &mdash;that the consumption of meat at home has gone up, that more calves have been slaughtered in the last couple of years than at the other periods and that the number of cows has remained constant.  If the number of cows remains constant, we may take it that the number of cattle produced is about the same.  Therefore, we have to account for the reduction in exports in the last three years compared with 1925-31.  There was also an export of a certain amount of dressed meat and a big amount of canned meat.  The number of cattle accounted for in that way, as dressed beef and canned meat, as far as the Department can estimate it, would be about 97,000&mdash;practically 100,000.  That would bring the average of the war years to 632,000, as against 730,000 in 1925-31.  There are 100,000 cattle to be accounted for.  We can account for those, to some extent, by increased consumption at home, the remainder being slaughtered as calves. Other Senators have brought out the point that the big decline in the export of fat cattle commenced in the early 1930's.  The Cattle Industry Act was passed by the British Parliament in 1934.  Under that Act, a subsidy was paid in respect of cattle produced in Great Britain or brought in from this country and fed in Great Britain.  At that time, the amount paid for cattle brought in for further feeding was 5/- per live cwt., equal to about 9/4 per dead cwt. That was continued until some time after the commencement of the war. Its continuance had, undoubtedly, a big influence on the reduction in the number of fat cattle going over.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Minister of Food came into office, at the beginning of the war, <Col N="83" /> he was very anxious to encourage the import of good stores from this country but, strange to say, not cattle for slaughter.  He increased the subsidy payable to British farmers for cattle brought over for further feeding.  The differential of 5/- per live cwt. had increased by 1945 to 12/6 per cwt. and that figure now stands at about 15/-.</P>
    <P>Senator Johnston approached this matter from one angle.  I am approaching it from practically the same angle. If a farmer here has a good store which he could, by two months' further feeding, turn into a fat beast, the British farmer could do the same in two months.  But if the Irish farmer sells to the British farmer, the British farmer will get £7 10s. 0d. more for his 10-cwt. beast than the Irish farmer would have got if he had done the fattening.  The British farmer sees a profit in the matter and the Irish farmer knows what will happen if he keeps the beast, and so an exchange takes place.  The Irish farmer sells to the British farmer, who does the fattening.  The difference in price in the case of a 10-cwt. beast is, as I have said, £7 10s. 0d.  Senators would probably hold that the average beast going out from here would be more than 10 cwts., so that the average differential would be even more than £7 10s. 0d. per head.</P>
    <P>We have had some discussion with the Minister of Food with regard to egg and poultry production.  The argument is sometimes put up from the British side that we are in a position to produce these things more cheaply than the British farmer could.  In the case of cattle, I think that the cost of production is certainly as high on this side as it is on the other side, because the cost of grazing and the cost of feeding stuffs for the winter feeding of young cattle is as high, at least, as it is in Britain.  Nobody can make a very good case that the Irish farmer can produce cattle more cheaply than the English farmer can.  If, therefore, the British farmer requires the prices which he is at present getting for cattle, it would seem as if, in all fairness, the Irish farmer should get the same prices.  I do not want to give <Col N="84" /> any more figures.  The figures I have referred to, I have given, more or less, in support of those quoted by Senators. I think that the number of cattle being produced here year after year is, probably, not much lower, if anything, than it was in the late 1920's, because the number of cows remains constant. We have, perhaps, overlooked some of the items&mdash;canned beef, a certain amount of which is going out, a greater consumption of beef within the country and a variable figure in respect of calves being slaughtered.  The slaughter of calves depends, to a greater extent, on the price of year-lings&mdash;I think that the figures will show that.  These calves in the past year, probably, constituted a fairly substantial item in reconciling those figures.  Some of the calves slaughtered were sent out genuinely as veal&mdash;but only a very small proportion.  A small proportion of the calves are consumed in this country as veal, but we are not veal eaters and we do not use much of that kind of meat, so that a quantity of the veal must have been used for other purposes.  Some people will suggest that it was used for the feeding of greyhounds.  Others will suggest other uses.  In any event, it was not put to any very good use, and it would have been much better if the inducements to our cattle breeders here had been sufficient to get them to rear all the calves they had.</P>
    <P>Having verified the figures given by some Senators, I should like to deal with a few of the points raised.  I must, of course, in the first place, express my appreciation of what was referred to as Senator Counihan's restraint in this debate&mdash;in the sense that he did not attack me on any particular issue.  He had no reason to do so because he will find that I am not disagreeing with anything he said. Senator Counihan gave some account of the history of the negotiations which took place during the summer or since the summer.  Senator Counihan's organisation spoke of the number of cattle that could be sent from this country to Great Britain if matters were settled up satisfactorily with regard to price.  As a result of the propaganda at that time, the High Commissioner had a talk with the <Col N="85" /> Minister of Food.  That was followed by a meeting between the officials of my Department and the officials of the Ministry of Food.  The officials of my Department put the arguments to the officials of the Ministry of Food and they undertook to deal with two particular items, although they may have reviewed practically all our agricultural exports.  Those items were beef and eggs.  We heard nothing more for a long time.  I took the opportunity to see the Minister of Food when I was coming through London about the middle of September.  Senator Baxter complained that we had not brought cattle producers with us on the occasion of any of these negotiations. It is often extremely difficult to have representative producers of some of those items at the type of conference that is arranged.  If it is a conference of officials against officials, one side cannot very well object to the absence of producers, except they go to the extent of saying that they will not take part in the conference at all.  If it is a conference between Minister and Minister, then nobody else can butt in. Officials are present on those occasions only for reference in the case of figures or arguments that may arise.  At the conference that took place between the Minister of Food and myself, I used every argument that was supplied to me by Senator Counihan's executive and I used a few very good arguments &mdash;at least, I thought them very good&mdash; which they had not suggested to me at all.  But it was no use.  We did not get very far.  It was pointed out that the present price for dressed beef was not getting the beef across.  That argument did not bear any great fruit because it became fairly evident to me that they did not want the beef across, that they wanted the cattle.  My only alternative in that case was to take Senator's Baxter's advice and say: &ldquo;You will get no cattle&rdquo;.  I did not do that.  If I had done that and if I had come back and said so, I do not know whether or not I would have Senator Baxter behind me.</P>

He, evidently, believes that, from his point of view and the point of view of British economy, it would be better for them to get good stores from this country for further feeding.  Therefore, as long as the belief in the present policy lasts in Britain, I am afraid their bias will be that way.</P>

      <P>I do not think that anybody ever said that that was a good bargain.  I can assure the Senator that I told the Minister of Food that it was such a bad bargain that it could not be regarded as a bargain at all.  There was no agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of Food, being a kindly man personally, said: &ldquo;Well, we will give you the 1d. anyway.&rdquo;  That is how <Col N="87" /> we got the 1d.  There was no agreement. We got the penny for nothing.  It is all very fine to talk here about what other countries can do on the British market.  The Argentine was quoted. Would we take the price that the Argentine are getting for their beef? Well, I do not know.  At any rate, we have not been asked.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is so.  The Senator quoted Danish butter.  I can assure him that the Danes are very dissatisfied with the price that they are getting for their butter.  As a matter of fact, they have to pay a subsidy to their producers in order to encourage them to go on producing butter.  I would like to tell the Senator that that subsidy was put on just before I went to Denmark.  They are taking the subsidy off schnapps and beer.  That is how I know all about it.  The Six-County farmers were quoted.  They are definitely getting a better price, but the difference there is, as Senator Baxter knows, that in Britain they have got into the habit of calling us foreigners.  We cannot object.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, we cannot object <Col N="88" /> when they call us that.  I agree with Senator Johnston that the winter feeding of live stock is essential to our mixed system of farming, and it would be a great thing indeed if we could get a very much higher number of stall-fed cattle turned out.  For the last four or five years my Department has been up against this: that we cannot advise the farmer to stall-feed cattle because we know that the advice would bring him perhaps certain loss if he did stall-feed cattle for export.  The fact is that we have only stall feds for home consumption. They are all right because they get the price that pays.  If we had stall-fed cattle for export, the farmer who would buy store cattle in the beginning of the winter to stall-feed them would be at a loss.  Therefore, we cannot advocate that.  We have been, on the other hand, advising farmers to feed their store cattle in yards or otherwise and, in that way, make farmyard manure.  I am afraid it is the only thing that can be done while the present policy on the British side lasts. The Government here can hardly be accused, as Senator McGee accused it, of not doing everything possible to encourage trade with all countries.  As a matter of fact, I think that we incurred a great deal of ridicule 13, 14 or 15 years ago when we talked of the possibility of alternative markets.  We had to put up with that.  We still believe that we should try to develop whatever market is the best for our produce, but there are difficulties about ships coming in that cannot be got over.  We can only do the best we can and deal with these matters as they arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Madden raised the point&mdash; the same point has been raised on many occasions&mdash;that cows are being sold off.  Well, I do not know where they are going, except to farmers, because the export of cows is actually down in the last year compared with the average for five or six years previously.  Therefore, if any big number of cows has been auctioned off, they are being bought by other farmers, and if that is the case we cannot find much fault with it.  As regards Senator Madden's other point, that he auctioned off grass, meadow <Col N="89" /> and tillage, I take it that it is also going to other farmers.  If one farmer does not like to do it, another farmer will.  That does not get us very far. The most distressing point, if you like, that Senator Madden made was that farmers are not getting married.  I believe that practically every country in the world, even those countries that Senators may regard as being wealthy agricultural countries, have the same complaint&mdash;that farmers are not getting married.  There seems to be some sort of a pest&mdash;something at any rate&mdash; spreading amongst farmers in recent years.  In any case, it is a world-wide complaint.</P>
    <P>I do not think that I have anything else to say, except this to Senator Counihan, that I agree with the motion &mdash;that is, that &ldquo;the agreement concluded with the British Government will have no beneficial effect on the production of fat cattle for export&rdquo;. It will have no beneficial effect.  It was not an agreement, but that does not matter.  He then asks &ldquo;the Government to take further steps&rdquo;.  I have no objection to that.  If the Government can take further steps, no doubt it will.  I do not think there is any possibility of immediate steps, because it is not so very long ago since I met the Minister of Food.  On that occasion he gave what was the last word of the British Government, and I do not think there is the possibility of getting that policy changed.  If there is any possibility of getting a change in this policy of the British Government in regard to fat cattle, I think the Senator may take it for granted that the Government will do what it can.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCounihan" hpid="Mr. Counihan Mr. Counihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Counihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not much more to say.  I think the reply of the Minister has justified, to an extent at all events, his position.  I want again to impress on him that there should be more consultation with the national executive of the cattle traders when live stock, either stores or fats, come into the question of negotiations.  The Minister said that there was no question of taking representatives from the national executive to go to London with the officials of the Department.  I do not think it would be establishing <Col N="90" /> any precedent if some members of the cattle trade were invited to go to London.</P>

      <P>I do not remember a single occasion on which we were invited. I can go back to the days of Mr. T.W. Russell and of Mr. T.P. Gill when he was Secretary to the Department of Agriculture.  In those days I was invited on a couple of occasions to accompany the officials of the Department.  I remember that, on another occasion, Mr. John Leonard, the then chairman of the Cattle Trade Association and myself went to see the British Chief Secretary.  We had no appointment when we got to the House of Commons and there was no Nationalist member that we could get to arrange an interview.  We had to fall back on Captain Dixon of Belfast, the present Lord Glentoran.  He arranged that we could have half an hour with the then Chief Secretary for Ireland.  We got the interview and there were satisfactory results.  As Senator Baxter has said, I think we would be just as competent as anybody else to make a good deal with the British officials.  The Department may look on me as an old fossil and, possibly, the British Ministry officials might think that I would go in with a shillelagh under my coat and give them an exhibition of what is supposed to have taken place at Donnybrook Fair.  The young cattle traders of the present generation are just as competent as anybody else to carry out negotiations on behalf of the country, particularly in regard to a business in which they are interested.  With the leave of the House, I beg to withdraw the motion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>I was asked by a person who lives in the town of <Col N="91" /> Clonmel to take up this matter and to see if anything could be done about it. On the face of it, it seems rather a trivial thing, but I suggest that when it is examined it will be found to be rather important.  The fact that it is important can be seen by a resolution passed by the Tipperary County Committee of Agriculture at a meeting held about a week ago.  The resolution reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That we ask the Department of Industry and Commerce to provide the necessary materials for the repair of milk cans and other creamery appliances as these materials appear to be in short supply at present, thereby causing inconvenience to milk suppliers.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>If one were to read the discussion that took place at that meeting it would convince one that the farmers who are members of the committee considered that this is really a very important, if not a very serious matter.  When asked to take up this matter, I called to the offices of the Minister, and I was told that the responsible officer was the officer in charge of the export licence section.  I explained as best I could the position and the probable consequences unless something is done. Subsequently I received a letter from the Minister for Industry and Commerce. First, the letter refers to my representations regarding the difficulty experienced by a Clonmel sheet metal worker and then the letter goes on to say:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I am to say that representations were made very recently to the British authorities for the release of supplies of material of this nature for use in this country, but the British authorities have intimated that, in view of the acute shortage of tinplate, they are unable to authorise its use for any purpose other than the packing of foodstuffs and that export of the material is allowed only for the packing of foodstuffs intended for export to Great Britain.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The letter concludes by stating that:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;In the circumstances, the Minister feels that no useful purpose <Col N="92" /> would be served in making representations for the release of the material required by Mr. Whelan.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There is an old saying of which I was reminded by a friend of mine quite recently.  It relates to the recipe for making hare soup.  The first thing to do is to get the hare.  I suggest that the material&mdash;condensed milk, I take it &mdash;exported to England, and for which apparently there is a market there, cannot be exported unless the milk itself is available.  The case then is that for a number of years, owing to the acute shortage of the material required to keep all the vessels which are used to bring milk to the creameries, the position has been bad and it is getting more and more desperate every year and unless something is done about it the milk cannot be delivered to the creameries much longer.  If that were to happen, it can be seen at once that the export trade, to which reference is made in this letter, would have to cease.  My suggestion is that the High Commissioner in London should be asked to take up that side of the question and put it to the British authorities, that if they want the condensed milk and any other foodstuffs, for the purpose of packing which tin is used, then the comparatively small amount of material required to carry on the industry here should be made available.</P>

      <P>In order to substantiate the statement I have made, I would like to quote the names of the creameries concerned.  The managers <Col N="93" /> of these creameries signed a memorial in favour of the proposal to secure the importation of this material.  The creameries are as follows: Clonmel and Newcastle, Ballypatrick, Suirvale, Outrath, Coolmoyne, Knockmeal, Springmount, Millvale, Grangemockler, Knockavardagh, Boherlahan, Drangan and Mullinahone.  Those are the creameries.  We then have a number of institutions, as follows: Rockwell College, Cashel County Hospital, Clonmel District Hospital, Clonmel Fever Hospital and Mental Hospital, Sisters of Mercy, Carrick-on-Suir, Sisters of Mercy, Thurles, Sisters of Charity, Clonmel, Shoe Factory, Clonmel, O'Mara's Mineral Factory, Clonmel, Plunder and Pollak Tannery, Presentation Convent, Clonmel.  In addition to this list there are hundreds of individual farmers, shopkeepers and householders. I know a number of these creamery managers and they would not sign a memorial in favour of this matter unless they were satisfied the position was serious.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister to take up this matter on the lines I have mentioned, that is, to ask the High Commissioner in London to see the British authorities in London, the people responsible for the issue of export licences, and to point out the seriousness of a refusal&mdash; that it will certainly in the near future handicap creameries, not alone in the particular area I am speaking of but, I should say, in general.  Even to-day, when I was travelling from Tipperary, I met one or two farmer friends and they agreed this was a very serious matter, from their own personal experience. I think any farmer present who has experience of this matter realises its importance and that it is a subject that should receive immediate attention.  I appeal to the Minister to do something about it.  If he does, he will have done something to advance the interests of our agricultural export trade in one of its most important branches.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have already supplied particulars of the type of material required.  I have also got an estimate of the amount of the material and if the Minister wishes I shall give him this estimate.  The quantity may appear <Col N="94" /> small, but it will keep things going for the present.  Documents have been supplied to the Minister containing the signatures of the managers of the cooperative creameries.  Most of us are acquainted with the managers of creameries.  We know they hold responsible positions and that they will not, without careful consideration, sign any documents brought along to them. They will generally satisfy themselves that the subject-matter of the document is of importance before they will agree to append their signatures.  I would like the Minister to deal with this matter in his usual energetic way. I believe that if the particular aspect I have mentioned is put before the British authorities&mdash;that the shortage of this material will interfere with the export of food from this country&mdash;it will go a long way.  It is really a matter of psychology.  If you hit him in the tummy, you hit him in a very serious place indeed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>I had to-day in the Dáil a Parliamentary question on this subject of the scarcity of tinplate for the repair of dairy utensils and I do not think I can do better than read to the Seanad the reply I gave in the Dáil.  The reply was as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I am aware that tinplate and bottoms for the repair of dairy utensils have not been available for some time, and that the repair of creamery churns has in consequence been seriously affected.  I caused representations to be made recently to the British authorities for the release of tinplate for this and other purposes, but was informed that, owing to the severe shortage of this material, the use of tinplate is not allowed in that country for any purpose other than the packing of foodstuffs and that exports are allowed only for the purpose of packing foodstuffs intended for consumption in Great Britain.  There is, therefore, no hope that supplies for the repair of dairy utensils can be obtained from that source for the present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;My information is that tinplate is also particularly scarce in the <Col N="95" /> United States, but recently I had representations made to the United States authorities for permission to obtain supplies from that source and I await the outcome of those representations. Inquiries are also being made as to the possibility of procuring supplies from Continental countries.  If supplies are imported for general use here, the requirements of the creamery industry will be borne in mind.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think it is quite foolish to hope that representation through the High Commissioner or otherwise, or the presentation of memorials signed by creamery managers, will be successful in securing consent from the British authorities for the release of tinplate for export to this country for a purpose for which tinplate is not allowed to be used in Great Britain.  I think the prospects of obtaining tinplate at present from other countries are very slight, but the efforts that are being made to that end will be pursued.  I might mention that there are at present reasonable supplies of new milk churns available.</P>

      <P>May I ask a question out of the depths of my ignorance? I gather that the British Ministry will be willing to supply tinplate for the purpose of packing Clover Meat Products.  Now, the tinplate in that case is used once.  It is taken over to England, surrounding some tasty stew, or something like that.  The housewife consumes it and the tinplate goes upon the corporation dumps.  If, on the other hand, it is used for the purpose of repairing dairy utensils, it will be used day in and day out for the purpose of conserving essential foodstuffs which may be turned <Col N="96" /> into cream, condensed milk, cheese, or half a dozen other essential commodities.</P>
