    <Title>Continuation of Compensation Schemes Bill, 1946 (Certified Money Bill)&mdash;Second and Subsequent Stages.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Aiken) Frank Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Aiken)</NameTxt>
      <P>Senators will recollect that the Taoiseach undertook, in relation to the emergency powers legislation, that Orders or instruments made thereunder would, as far as practicable, be provided for in special legislation if the continuance of the powers conferred under these Orders or instruments was found to be necessary.  On the basis of that undertaking I propose to provide in this Bill for the continuance of the following compensation schemes which were found to be necessary during the emergency:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  The scheme providing for payments of compensation to civilians who were injured by bombs, etc.,</P>
      <P>(b)  The L.D.F. compensation scheme,</P>
      <P>(c)  The L.S.F. compensation scheme, and</P>
      <P>(d)  The compensation scheme for seamen.</P>
      <P>The A.R.P. compensation scheme is being dealt with in a separate measure amending the Air Raid Precautions Act, 1939.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the cases of civilians and seamen the provisions of the Bill will apply to claims in respect of injuries received prior to the 2nd September, 1946.  It is unlikely that any injury arising out of the circumstances in respect of which those schemes were necessary will arise after that date.  The final date so far as the L.D.F. are concerned <Col N="538" /> is 31st March, 1946, the date on which the force was disbanded, and in the case of the L.S.F. the governing date is the 30th September, 1945.</P>
    <P>The schemes, as Senators are aware, provide power to pay compensation in respect of injuries and to vary such payments according to the percentage degree of disability found by the Army Pensions Board to exist from time to time.  It is necessary that these powers should be retained after the expiry of the Emergency Powers Acts from which the powers originally derived, and this Bill is designed to meet that end.  The Bill also continues the power taken by the Emergency Powers (No. 269) Order, 1943, to exempt payments of compensation from the suspensory or abatement provisions applied by the Military Service Pensions Acts, 1924-1945.  That Order did not apply to seamen's compensation and while so far as my information goes we have not had a case of an injured seaman who was a recipient of a Military Service Pension I have thought it well to place the scheme on all fours with the others in regard to the application of the Military Service Pensions Acts.</P>
    <P>The total number of awards made under the civilians' scheme as on the 31st May last was 173, and the amounts disbursed to that date came to £17,240. Fifty-two claimants are still in receipt of weekly compensation.  Two hundred and thirty awards were made under the L.D.F. scheme, 32 of which are still continuing.  The total amount disbursed to date was £7,349.  In the case of the L.S.F. the number of awards was 46 and the number of cases in which payments are still being made is 13. Total payments to date amount to £2,900.  Two hundred and nineteen awards were made to or in respect of seamen who were injured or were killed by belligerent action, and of these 157 persons are still in receipt of compensation.  Payments in respect of loss of seamen's effects were made in 378 cases.  The total payment to date under the seamen's scheme amounted to £65,300.</P>
    <P>The sum total of compensation, etc., paid to date under the four schemes amounted to £92,789.  The amount of <Col N="539" /> the awards now current may be put at £17,860.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill, naturally, arises out of the conclusion of the Emergency Powers Act.  It is necessary, as the Minister said, in order to make continuing payments.  What struck one in connection with the figures the Minister gave us was that we were very lucky, considering the numbers in the L.S.F., the L.D.F. and other services, that the total paid in compensation was only £92,000, and that the amount of continuing compensation being paid is insignificant.  I think that that is a tribute to the care exercised by members of those forces in the performance of a duty done in an entirely voluntary manner, in their own time and at their own expense.  I think that the Bill is a sound measure.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 5, to add to Section 4 a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(2) Every regulation made under this section shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas as soon as conveniently may be after it is made and if a resolution annulling the regulation is passed by either House within the next 21 days on which that House has sat after the regulation is laid before it, the regulation shall be annulled accordingly, but without <Col N="540" /> prejudice to the validity of anything previously done thereunder.</P>
    <P>When this Bill was going through Committee, I was of opinion that Section 4 would deal only with minor matters of detail and that it was not necessary that the regulations should be tabled. In the course of discussion in Committee, the Minister made it clear that, under this section, he was proposing to introduce new public bodies Orders which would materially affect the relationship of the elected representatives and the managers.  I do not propose to exhaust the patience of the House by going into the question of the rights of managers or of elected representatives. All I suggest is that the form in which an estimate must be presented by a manager to a council vitally affects the relationship between the elected members of the council and the manager.  Therefore, I think that the Houses of the Oireachtas should get an opportunity of discussing the form of the estimate.  The only way in which they can get that opportunity is by having the Order tabled, when made.</P>
    <P>If the Minister raises the objection that this will not only deal with the main general public bodies Order but with minor matters that are not of great importance, I am prepared to accept any arrangement for tabling by virtue of which the main Order which will determine the form of estimate and which will, therefore, determine the relationship between the manager and the council should be placed before the Oireachtas for discussion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LouisODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister tell us if he intends to prescribe the same form of public bodies Order as has been prescribed up to the present?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanRuane" hpid="Mr. S.T. Ruane Mr. S.T. Ruane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S.T. Ruane</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support the argument put forward by Senator Sweetman in connection with the relationship between the manager, the elected representatives and the Department.  A circular published by the Stationery Office some time ago pointed out the powers that remained with local bodies at a time when the general impression was abroad in the <Col N="541" /> country that any use such bodies served had passed away as a result of various Acts passed with a view to centralising functions that were theretofore exercised by members of local authorities.  In that particular circular, not alone members of local bodies but the general public were assured that the day had not passed when members elected for three years could exercise their powers to the advantage of the electors.  One paragraph in that circular referred to the powers still remaining with members in the following terms: &ldquo;The elected members have the power of the purse.  They exercise this in much the same way as the Dáil exercises similar power.  The county manager cannot spend until the local authority have authorised him to do so. He is bound by their decisions in the provision made by them in the annual estimate and, save with their consent, he cannot exceed the total amount provided by them for any particular purpose. The council alone have the power to make the rate and borrow money. They must, of course, maintain the services they are bound by law to maintain but there is considerable discretion allowed as to the manner in which they may discharge this obligation.&rdquo;  I hold that, if public bodies have still the power set out in this circular, the accuracy of which I do not want to challenge, the amendment spoken to by Senator Sweetman is worthy of consideration by the Minister.  When it is alleged that a local body have not provided adequately for a particular service, they should be afforded an opportunity of putting publicly before the Minister, and before the people who elected them, their reasons for cutting down the estimate submitted by the manager.  If their reasons are not given attention and the body is dissolved because they cut the estimate below what the Minister considered adequate, it is very doubtful if the general public will maintain their faith in the use of local authorities. Making all due allowance for the intelligence at the disposal of the Minister, through the manager and his staff, I hold that the members of local authorities have also a source of <Col N="542" /> information that is worthy of consideration. For that reason, I trust that the Minister will agree to the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Minister will see his way to accept the amendment. I give him credit for desiring to restore the greatest possible confidence and trust in his Department on the part of local authorities.  Whatever we may say at times, I am sure he really is very anxious that local administration will be a success. Therefore, there is on him the greater share of the responsibility to create a position of trust and confidence.  If his Department is at all suspect, he must do his best to remove that suspicion.  He would be wise to ensure that, before any regulations made under this section have the force of law and are implemented, it would be open to any member of the Oireachtas to express disapproval of them.</P>
      <P>Looking at it from the Minister's point of view, what could be more satisfactory than that he should challenge the Oireachtas, by putting these regulations on the table, saying: &ldquo;There they are; those are the forms under which the local authorities will carry out their functions; if you find fault with them, come along and say so&rdquo;.  If there is no challenge and if the time has passed, the Minister will then be in the happy position of having had the unanimous sanction of the Oireachtas for the power which he will have.  From the point of view of the Department as well as from the point of view of the local authority, it would be eminently satisfactory that such a precaution as this should be attached to the section.  Unless there are some insuperable difficulties not obvious now and in view of the power which the Minister will have to make regulations, the obligation does seem to be on him to give those interested in such regulations an opportunity of saying yea or nay to them, so that they may not find themselves unable to do anything but live under whatever disadvantages the regulations may have for them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite clear from the statements which have been made in regard to these regulations that the underlying motive is to compel the Minister to share the administration of his Department with the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The Public Bodies Order has been mentioned&mdash;in fact I think it is the main reason&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact that the Minister has power to make the Public Bodies Order is the main reason why Senator Sweetman seeks to compel the Minister in advance to put down for the approval of the Oireachtas every Order or regulation which he proposes to make.  That means that Senator Sweetman is claiming a right to share with the Minister for Local Government the administration of that Department. I think it is contrary to all sound practice and has been condemned by those who have given special study to the matter.  It has been said, for instance, by an authority who is sometimes appealed to in matters of this kind, that &ldquo;it is admitted in all countries in which the representative system is practically understood that numerous representative bodies ought not to administer.&rdquo; This authority goes on to say: &ldquo;The maxim is grounded not only on the most essential principles of good government but on those of the successful conduct of business of any description.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I have to make numerous regulations from time to time touching on all sorts of matters; and, before those administrative regulations can become effective, it is proposed that I should table them and that they should be subject to annulment, if the wisdom of Senator Sweetman, for instance, so indicates. Where is the doctrine of Ministerial responsibility going to begin to operate and when, in those circumstances, are we going to determine whether it is the Dr. Jekyll&mdash;the Minister for Local Government&mdash;or that very less reputable person, the Mr. Hyde&mdash; Senator Sweetman&mdash;who is going to function from the Custom House?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is one of those ill-considered things, one of the bright notions which <Col N="544" /> strike people on occasion and which, without giving any proper thought or attention to the matter, they put down here, to solemnly fritter away the time, not only of this Assembly but of the Minister coming here to assist the Assembly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a considerable amount of public business to discharge. I have on occasions to be, not only in this House but in the other House and also have a very heavy burden of administrative responsibility to discharge. Here is a Senator, who is supposed to function in the calm recesses of this House, whose claim to be here and assist us in framing this legislation is based on the assumption that he will give a great deal of careful thought to the public problems that come before the House as legislative proposals. Here is a proposal which would bind the Minister, for instance, if he made a regulation prescribing that, in certain circumstances relating to a change of place-names, the Commissioner of Valuation, the Registrar-General, the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Minister for Justice shall be notified of the change; then, if this amendment were passed, I should be compelled solemnly to table that regulation, and, if Senator Sweetman happened to be in one of his more impish moods I should be compelled to come here, leaving whatever public business I might have in the Dáil, or whatever other engagements I might have in the Custom House, to defend myself against some fantasy that suddenly intruded itself upon Senator Sweetman.</P>

The matter was not mentioned in relation to Section 4 and the regulations&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Even so, he did not give notice on Section 4 that he proposed to deal with the matter in this sweeping way.  What is the excuse? His excuse is, apart from anything else, that he proposes by compelling the Minister to table these regulations, to seek to make some change in the Local Government Act and in another Act that is not before the House&mdash;to make some change in the County Management Act.  I think that is a very poor justification for putting down an amendment which would have the preposterous effect which I have <Col N="546" /> indicated to the House.  I make dozens of regulations every day.  I, for instance, make regulations or Orders specifying that the ordinary estimates meeting of a county council will be held on a prescribed date.  I make Orders closing roads.  I make regulations governing all sorts of matters of that sort and the joke about all that is that these things could not become effective if Senator Sweetman's amendment were accepted, unless they were tabled before the House.  I think it is time that some Senators began to realise what their proper place is in the legislative system of this country, that they are not entitled&mdash;and I should resist every such attempt on the part of the Seanad&mdash;to encroach on the administrative functions of my Ministry. I think that would be the attitude also of my colleagues and of the Government as a whole.  We had better realise that the provisions of the Constitution have been enacted to prevent the same sort of obstructive attitude as was taken up here prior to the dissolution of the old Seanad and it would be well if Senators endeavoured to act in conformity with that recognition.</P>

My desire is to be helpful to the Seanad when I come here.  I am prepared to consider&mdash;and the Order Paper to-day is proof of that&mdash;any reasonable proposal. Where reasonable proposals have been submitted to the Minister in charge of this Bill, he has considered them and where he can, he has accepted them but there are some things the Minister will not do.  It is mere futility, so long as the Minister enjoys the confidence of the other House, on the part of Senator Sweetman, Senator Baxter or Senator Sir John Keane, if he wishes to be included in that group, to endeavour to encroach by legislation on what the Minister regards as his proper functions because while he enjoys the confidence of the other House, he will ask the other House to reject these amendments and the amendments cannot be carried.</P>

      <P>We have listened to an extraordinary speech from the Minister.  It is very unfortunate that on the first amendment on this Report Stage, he dashes any hopes of co-operation between him and this House in an attempt to improve this measure. What right has the Minister to describe an amendment, a reasonable amendment, and an amendment which has a parallel, mind you, in many other Acts of the Oireachtas, as obstructive; to describe the attitude of the Senator proposing the amendment as impish and to draw a purely arbitrary line of his own creation between administrative and legislative functions.  Surely there is the very closest interlocking between administrative and legislative functions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To seek to meet an argument merely by saying that such-and-such an amendment or such-and-such a statement is an encroachment of administrative functions is evading the point.  The Minister started off by calling names. That bears out what I said on an earlier stage&mdash;that the Minister's attitude towards, local authorities and towards this House is that of a totalitarian dictatorship.  He is entitled to <Col N="548" /> call names but if he calls us names we are entitled to say what we think of him.</P>

      <P>It is most important that at the opening of what promises to be a long afternoon we should have this atmosphere of antagonism created by the Minister.  The Minister if he wanted to deal with a perfectly legitimate request could have come along and said: &ldquo;I cannot meet-it; Senator Sweetman knows that it would entail tabling a number of regulations.&rdquo; I do consider that certain amendments of the Public Bodies Order or certain Orders of an important character like Senator Sweetman has indicated, should be tabled and should be open to discussion.  The fantastic picture that he draws in face of 25 years of legislation, that Ministers are constantly summoned from their duties to come and answer motions in this House annulling regulations, has no foundation in fact.  It is a thing that rarely happens.  The Minister should be ashamed of himself in bringing a fantastic picture of that kind before us at the present stage of our history.  The Minister may get his Bill through by steam hammer methods but we are not going to be muzzled in this House.  We are going to say what we think, let him call us what names he will.</P>

      <P>As Senator Sweetman pointed out there was really only one Order with which he was concerned, and that was the Public Health Order.  But that is not in his amendment. His amendment says &ldquo;every regulation&rdquo;.

      <P>As far as the amendment in its present form goes Senator Sweetman cannot agree that it could be put to the House because it would not carry out either his intentions or the intentions of the House.  Certain of these Orders have to be made within a limited period of time and they could not be made within this time if they had to be laid before either House of the Oireachtas.  I think Senator Sweetman knows this amendment is not in order and I appeal to him to withdraw it.</P>

It would be absurd and I think the Minister could not carry on his work and this House could not carry on its duties, that is, of course, if it reads all these regulations, which I doubt very much.  As I said before, we have these amendments put down to various Acts and I think it is just an empty formula, putting them down.  We had it before that Senator O Buachalla reads all those Orders because there is good Irish in them and Senator Hayes reads them for that reason, too.</P>

      <P>On this amendment the <Col N="550" /> Minister has raised two questions, one relating to the merits of the amendment and the other relating to a different matter entirely, namely, to whether the House under its constitutional powers has the right to put down this sort of amendment.  May I address myself to this second point very briefly? Section 4 of this Bill gives the Minister power to make regulations.  We do not want to see them all but it is quite clear that a series of Orders made under the Bill is of great importance and it is something which this House and the other House, if it so chooses by vote, has a right to see. The Minister is entirely wrong from the point of view of the Constitution and from the point of view of common sense, when he endeavours to argue that not only is this amendment impracticable but unconstitutional.  There is no intention of dragging the Minister from his important administrative work into this House.  As a matter of fact, the Minister's statement is a reflection not only on the House but on the Minister and his colleagues.  We have at all times, since the reconstitution of this House, enjoyed pleasing experiences with Ministers, and as an opponent of Ministers I would like to put that on record.  We have no difficulty in getting Ministers to attend this House. We had this experience on all sides and experienced no difficulty in so arranging our business that the appropriate Minister could attend.  By and large, I think, Ministers, and possibly the Minister for Local Government, at times, enjoy their visits to this House. Neither Senator Sweetman nor Senator Baxter or anybody else in the House wants to put something into the Bill that will in some way or other drag the Ministers from their duty. That suggestion is quite foolish.</P>

The Minister should be the last to talk about the Constitution because almost uniformly since the Constitution has been enacted whenever a point about it was raised in the Supreme Court a verdict was given against the Government.  The Minister would be well advised not to spread himself on this point about the rights given by the Constitution to the House.  We want to get this Bill through and nothing, not even the weather or the regard we have for the Minister will push us.  If the Minister persists in making these very ignorant and constitutional points here so much the worse for the whole lot of us.  They are not going to threaten us.  He told us we should remember what happened the other House.  What happened it? A very foolish Prime Minister abolished it and having done so found he could not do without it and started all over again.  The Minister would be well advised if he cannot understand the Constitution to give up reading it.</P>

      <P>When proposing my amendment I started off, as Senator O'Dea said, very coolly without trying to be impertinent, impudent or anything else.  The Minister, of course, at once took up the usual line about &ldquo;less reputable&rdquo; and such adjectives that flow so naturally whenever he is in this House.  Perhaps I had better get down to the amendment.  The Minister stated that the regulations to be made under this section were not discussed in Committee.  As a matter of fact, there are 13 columns of discussion that took place in Committee, and, therefore, the only thing that one can say about the statement of the Minister is that it is untrue.  It is perfectly clear from what is reported in columns 61 and 62 that the Minister from his remarks was envisaging a change in the Public Bodies Order which would have the effect of granting the manager more liberty than exists at the present time as against the elected representatives.  Representations, he said, had been made to him to that effect, and he indicated, from the tone of his words, that he was considering those representations favourably.</P>
      <P>This is the Minister's Bill.  He has chosen to draft it in such a way that the important regulations, like the General Public Bodies Order, are to be made under exactly the same section as the unimportant regulations to which the Minister has referred.  If the Minister had drafted the Bill in a sensible way so that the General Public Bodies Order was made under a section different from that under which the very minor regulations to which he has referred, are to be made, then it would have been quite easy for me to have put down a tabling motion only to the important section and not to the unimportant section, but it is the Minister's Bill and the Minister has drafted the section in this way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only way in which the position in regard to the Public Bodies Order <Col N="553" /> can be met on the Minister's Bill is by this amendment, and the Minister can describe that as foolish or otherwise to his heart's content.  As I say, this happens to be the only way on this Bill in which there can be publicity given to the Order: that an important Order like the Public Bodies Order can be annulled, if necessary, and in which that important Order can be the subject of constructive discussion in regard to the position of the manager <i>vis-á-vis</i> the elected representatives.</P>
    <P>Of course, when listening to any threats from the Minister, I am fully aware of the position of the Parties in the Dáil.  I am also fully aware of what I consider to be my responsibilities, and the duty that I owe to the people who sent me here as well as the duty that I owe to my fellow-colleagues as elected representatives on the local authority.  I consider that I have a duty to them to see that they are given their fair and proper share in the administration of local government.  That cannot be done if there is going to be a too sweeping and too open a change in the Public Bodies Order.  I, for one, am not going to go on the records as giving that opportunity to the Minister.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>In page 7, Section 10, sub-section (6), to delete sub-paragraph (b), <Col N="555" /> lines 31 to 35, inclusive, and insert instead the following sub-paragraph:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(b) the amount of the expenses to be charged on the urban area or each urban area (as the case may be) shall be the amount which bears to the total amount of the expenses the same proportion as the productive valuation of such urban area bears to the productive valuation of the area of charge, such productive valuation to be ascertained at the end of each financial year by the local authorities concerned in the adjustment.</P>
    <P>The paragraph I propose to insert is similar to the paragraph in the Bill save that the word &ldquo;productive&rdquo; has been inserted before the word &ldquo;valuation&rdquo; in three instances. The county councils, in making their demand upon urban councils, take the gross valuation of the town and they calculate the amount due in proportion to the valuation of the rest of the county.  Then, they call on the urban councils to pay their proportionate share.  In almost every urban town, there are quite a number of vacant premises, such as old stores which were formerly used for industrial purposes and, occasionally, vacant houses and shops.  The old stores are things of the past and, from this point of view, are more important than the shops, which will be occupied some time.</P>
    <P>I suggest that it is unfair to ask ratepayers of the towns to pay their own rate and also the rate which would be produced by these vacant premises if they had been occupied.  The Minister understands my point.  This matter has been going on for a long time and it was brought before the Government by the Municipal Authorities Association and various urban authorities. I thought this would be the appropriate time to get direct attention for the matter from the Minister and, therefore, I tabled this amendment.  I hope the Minister will see his way to consider it very carefully.</P>

      <P>There is a good deal to be said for the argument of Senator Honan on this matter.  Apart from the fact that there are vacant buildings in the towns, there are houses erected under the Housing Acts and other Acts which are not chargeable for rates on the full valuation.  New buildings are now rated on a third of the valuation for the first five years.  That involves a very big loss to an urban authority when charged with their proportion of the rates by the county council.  That was why I put down an amendment to the first sub-section of Section 10, to make the rates on the county health district instead of on the whole county. The Minister did not agree to accept that amendment.  A good deal could be said for Senator Honan's amendment but I do not think that the word &ldquo;productive&rdquo; is the best word to use. A better word might be substituted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Patrick J. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am inclined to support the amendment moved by Senator Honan.  On the Committee Stage, I mentioned that this question of poor rate gives rise to a great deal of misunderstanding.  The view expressed by Senator Honan is held by virtually every member of the local authorities.  It would appear that there is a slight difference as between the system in operation for the county and for the urban districts.  When calculating the total amount for the county, the county officials have it in their power to allow for the various unoccupied houses and for buildings which are not rated at the maximum rate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of an urban district, when the demand is received from the county council it is a sort of theoretical demand based upon an an assumption that all the buildings in the urban council's area are producing the full rate.  I can see the little difficulty which I discussed with Senator Honan; but at the beginning, before the rate is actually levied, if there were some machinery for enabling the urban council to confer with the county council and let the urban council say that while the gross valuation is so much the net valuation is considerably less, then this grievance, which is a perennial one, would disappear. <Col N="557" /> If that could not be done in advance, perhaps it could be done at the end of the year and allowed to credit in the succeeding year.  The principle which Senator Honan advocates is a sound and reasonable one and I would strongly support something being done, if not exactly in the manner he suggests, then in some equivalent manner.</P>
    <P>This question of unoccupied houses is a bone of contention year after year.  The poor rate is intended, in a sense, to be a county-at-large charge. It is theoretically treated as such. The rateable valuation of the urban area is taken to be so much; the rateable valuation of the rest of the county is taken to be so much; and the county council apparently arrives at the sum which the urban council should pay merely by taking the gross valuation and without allowing for any other consideration.  It is treated as being a county-at-large charge and it is made not alone on the occupied houses but on the unoccupied ones. That is where the grievance arises.  In actual fact, it is not a county-at-large charge.  It is a sum arrived at in a rough-and-ready fashion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Reilly Mr. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>It is rough-and-ready in the sense that the assumption is made that all the houses are occupied and are producing the full rate. It is in that sense that I use the word &ldquo;rough&rdquo;.  It is an approximate sum. The county council does not care a straw how the urban council produces that sum.  They say: &ldquo;It is your duty to ascertain what rate will be necessary within the urban district to produce that sum&rdquo;.  In that way, there may be a higher poor rate within the urban district than outside it while theoretically the rate is a county-at-large charge. One has only to take up the local papers to see that this matter crops up every year and is a source of intense dissatisfaction to the urban council.  If it were cleared up it would be of advantage to all concerned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me that Senator O'Reilly has put his finger on the really critical factor in this matter. The assumption underlying Senator Honan's amendment is that the county rates are a direct charge on the rate-payers in the urban areas, whereas, as Senator O'Reilly has pointed out, they are a charge upon the urban authority, and it is not the concern of the county council as to how those revenues are going to be provided by the local authority.  The assumption is that the community as a whole is served by the services which the county council provides as county services and, accordingly, each must bear its share of the cost.  The method which has been adopted for determining the urban authority's share is not, as Senator O'Reilly said, a rough-and-ready one. It is a most precise method.  What is considered there is the valuation of the property, not only in the urban area but in the rural area of the county, and then the charges are apportioned in proportion to the valuation of the urban area as compared with the valuation of the property in the rural area.</P>
      <P>I submit that there is no fairer way, no more effective way; in fact, I might go further and say there is no other way in which these apportionments can be determined.  Property is not always vacant.  In the case of some towns there may be buildings for which no use has been found for a long time and they may remain unoccupied and even become derelict.  If they are derelict, the local authority has a remedy in its own hands, under the Derelict Sites Act.  By serving notice, they can demolish those properties, remove them from their valuation lists altogether and to that extent can secure some easement of the existing position.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LouisODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not positive about that.  There are certain provisions made in the Derelict Sites Act.  The building must be unoccupied and it must be a blot or an eyesore on the district, before it can be removed.  If it is in good condition, I do not think it can be destroyed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>A lot of the difficulty arises from the reluctance of the local authorities to avail of its provisions. If a local authority wants to dispose of that matter, it can pass a resolution giving the manager the necessary instructions and providing the necessary funds, and he has to carry out the law. If the buildings are not derelict but are unoccupied, there is provided under this Bill what may be a remedy in some cases.</P>
      <P>At any rate, it provides an instrument whereby local authorities can compel owners of such buildings to show cause why they should not be rated.  A section of the Bill gives the local authority power to collect the rates on them in the first instance and, having collected the rates, the local authority has to be satisfied that the person from whom they have been collected is entitled to a remission, so that we are gradually whittling away the situation which has given rise to the complaint or the sense of grievance which has occasioned Senator Honan's amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The stage may come admittedly when property is unoccupied, not by the deliberate action of the owner, not because it has become derelict or one might say ownerless, but because passing circumstances are such that there is no person prepared to go in and pay a reasonable rent for it. That is not a position which is peculiar only to urban authorities.  These are the sort of things that happen in the country and which have been happening for some years on a very large scale and which, perhaps, for one reason or another, may happen even on an increasing scale in the near future.  These buildings which become unoccupied in the country, which become often derelict and for which no suitable tenants can be found are all <Col N="560" /> included in the valuations of the county authorities and these unoccupied buildings are taken into consideration in determining the rural areas' share of this apportionment as against the share which shall be ascribed to the urban districts.  Not only that but, as Senator O'Dea pointed out, there are buildings which are occupied for rent in urban areas in respect to which a remission of rates is granted and buildings accordingly, of which the full valuation is not the effective or the productive valuation.  These remissions have been granted in most cases&mdash;I should say in general&mdash;because urban authorities themselves asked that they should be empowered to grant these remissions of rates in order to encourage people to build inside their functional areas.</P>
    <P>What the urban authorities have done, the rural authorities have done also.  If we were to accept this amendment in the form in which it is here, we should be passing on to the rural areas responsibility for making good the remission of rates which urban authorities have granted in respect to new buildings constructed within their functional areas.  We should be asking the country people to pay for the remissions granted to town dwellers and we should be asking the country people at the same time to carry the expense of the remissions which they themselves had granted.</P>
    <P>These are the arguments on principle against the amendment, but there is another argument which is equally valid.  That is, that it is quite impossible within the rating year to determine what buildings in fact carry an effective valuation; because, excluding the buildings which are kept wilfully vacant by the owner, there are other buildings which are temporarily vacant and which, while being vacant when the rates were made and applotted, become tenanted during the course of the year. It seems to me that quite an impossible situation would be created in respect of the apportionment of charges as between a rural area and an urban area if we were to depart from the present simple scheme which <Col N="561" /> takes into consideration only things that have been definitely fixed and prescribed and in regard to which, if any change is made during the year, that change does not become effective until the following year.  For these reasons, I would ask Senator Honan not to press the amendment.  I may say that this is a proposal which has received very full consideration over a great number of years.  It has been urged not only on myself but on my predecessors and on Ministers for Local Government in the last administration. It has been considered very sympathetically to see if any element of genuine grievance could be removed, but there is no practical way of dealing with this problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHonan" hpid="Mr. Honan Mr. Honan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>I may mention that the remarks of the Minister, that the proportion of unproductive premises in the country as compared with the town would be only one to five, have considerably allayed my fears.  The town would have five to the rural area's one. There are no unoccupied houses and no unoccupied lands, generally speaking, in the country.  The point he made as regards the remission of rates on new buildings is a good point, and if the county is bearing a proportionate part of that, nobady wants to change the system.  I, for one, do not.  The reference to knocking down and clearing away premises is not, in my opinion, a good point, because the demolition of premises, such as I have in mind, would cost more than to build new premises. They must be left as eyesores, I am afraid.  The one redeeming feature in connection with this section &mdash;perhaps there are more&mdash;is the fact that under the 1923 Act you could claim rates only on unoccupied premises up to a valuation of £50.  On valuations of £20 and over you had no power to demand rates.  Under this Bill, I believe that limit has been removed and I believe you can now claim rates from the landlord on all premises irrespective of the valuation.  In all the circumstances I do not feel inclined to press the amendment on this occasion, until we see how this Bill works out.  If it works well, we shall attack the problem again at a later stage.</P>

      <P>This amendment arises out of an extremely long discussion which we had on the Committee Stage of the Bill in regard to Section 30.  I think it is common to all groups in this House that one of the main sections in the Bill, the fundamental basic principle of the Bill, is Section 30.  The section provides that where it appears to the Minister that a local authority has struck a rate that is likely to be insufficient in the Minister's opinion to maintain at a reasonable standard the public services, or to pay any other authority any sums that that local authority is by statute bound to pay, the Minister may hold a local inquiry and require the local authority to revoke the existing rate and to strike a new rate or the Minister may himself strike that new rate. The general burden of the discussion on the last day in regard to this amendment from the Minister's point of view was that local authorities sometimes do not carry out their duties, that if they do fail to carry out their duties, it is necessary for the Minister to put in a commissioner and that it would be an impossible situation if that Minister were unable to collect the moneys that were necessary to enable him to carry out his duty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They would be necessary for him to carry on all the functions in place of the local authority concerned.  I am <Col N="563" /> not so foolish as not to realise that there are occasions on which it is necessary for the Central Government to take a firm stand against a local authority, necessary on occasions that a local authority should be abolished. But I do not say it is going to provide a useful function in local government if the Central Government, through the Minister, retains a local authority and at the same time detracts from that power of that authority.  Therefore I have, in this amendment, conceded to the Minister that where he has appointed a commissioner the Minister will have the power to strike for the commissioner a rate that will enable him to carry on in a proper manner the services and the functions of the local authority for the current year.  The Minister made it clear on the Committee Stage that very often before the inquiry is got through and a commissioner appointed and before the commissioner has taken up office, it is often too late to do anything because the rate has been struck and the commissioner has then to go to the bank and borrow money.  The Minister made the point that this was a very unsatisfactory position.  That was the whole trend of his argument on the Committee Stage and I am conceding all this argument to him on this amendment.  I am anxious to ensure that you either have a local authority that is functioning as a local authority or you do not have one at all and that you do not pretend to put on the local members of an elected council a responsibility which is not theirs.  If they will not agree to carry out their duties I take the view, personally, that there are other methods of making them carry out these duties than the Minister's.  But if they will not carry out their duties it seems to me nonsensical to say that you are going to leave them there as a local authority and at the same time superimpose on them the striking of a rate against which they had fought and which they will not implement with good will.  If they are to remain there with a sense of grievance there will not be that harmonious relationship between the local authority and the <Col N="564" /> Central Government that is so necessary and desirable.</P>
    <P>I think it is far better from the viewpoint of the local authority and the Central Government that the Minister should have this power because I believe that it will be used by the Minister far less frequently after the mandate suspending and removing a local authority and it is better it should be used as infrequently as possible.  I think I am correct in summing up the trend of the argument on the Committee Stage and I think I am correct in the phraseology of the amendment itself.  Time and time again we have seen amendments discussed in this House, discussed on principle, discussed without reference to their exact phraseology.  All of us know that no matter by whom a particular amendment is put up if the Minister is satisfied with the principle he prefers in 99 cases out of 100 that it should be drafted in the exact wording used by the parliamentary draftsman.  That is largely because the Bill is drafted by one man and it is better that the amendments should be drafted in the same style as the Bill itself.  I think that the form of drafting of this amendment concedes to the Minister power to strike a rate to enable a commissioner to function but it prevents the Minister and, I am quite frank about it, from striking a rate over the heads of the local authority as long as this local authority is in existence.  I feel that otherwise any chance of co-operation is completely gone.</P>

      <P>This amendment puzzles me very considerably.  I think Senator Sweetman forgets there is such a thing as sub-section (6).  After members have been removed the commissioner is empowered to strike a new rate or a supplementary rate.  After holding a local inquiry into the sufficiency of such a rate the Minister may require the rating authority there to revoke such a determination and determine a new rate in the £.  Senator Sweetman would insert there, &ldquo;after they are removed from office&rdquo;.  How could they determine a rate after they were removed from office?  It would be absurd.</P>

      <P>In page 16, Section 33, sub-section (1), line 27, to insert after the word &ldquo;Minister&rdquo; the words &ldquo;after consultation with the local authority concerned&rdquo; and after sub-section (2) to insert a new sub-section (3) as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(3)  The consultation by a local authority with the Minister under sub-section (1) of this section shall be a reserved function.</P>
      <P>We had a little discussion on this on the Committee Stage.  Under the Bill, as it stands, the Minister may, from time to time by Order, vary the existing division of a rating area.  I had an amendment down on the Committee Stage suggesting that instead of the Minister it should be the local authority.  On that occasion, the Minister very properly pointed out that by doing that the position might be that the power might be operated by the manager alone.  I, therefore, suggested to him then that it would be better if words were inserted to the effect that the Minister, after consultation with the local authority, would vary the districts and make the Order. This amendment of mine merely carries out that suggestion, with this addition: that the consultation should be with the elected council rather than with the manager.  I think there is a certain amount of difficulty in that. So far as I am concerned I put this amendment down for the purpose of getting further elucidation than we got on the last occasion as to the practice and procedure that is going to be adopted.  I referred then, I think, to the manner in which the areas of dispensary districts are sometimes varied.  A draft order is sent down and the local council is asked for its observations.  At the time that I put in this amendment I had not the Official Report before me.  Perhaps we can deal with it now on the basis of procedure rather than on the strict wording of the section.</P>

      <P>One does not quite know what the Minister wants to do in this House&mdash;whether he is really anxious to have any assistance by way of amendment to proposed legislation or not.  Whatever the Minister's view on the matter may be, the fact is that members of this House feel that they have a conscientious responsibility to discharge in relation to this or to any other proposed legislation which comes before them.  The Minister may be able to absolve himself from responsibility in his own peculiar way.  That is the approach that some of us think we should make to the problems that confront us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the amendment, I think there is everything to be said in favour of it.  The appointment of rate collectors is the one responsibility which still remains vested in the local authority.  Surely, if there is going to be a variation in the division of a rating area into other collection districts, no one is more competent to offer an opinion on that than the elected representatives of the people.  They know <Col N="568" /> all the districts, and how one district will impinge on another.  The geographical area and considerations of that sort ought to weigh when there is any question of the variation of districts, amalgamations or alterations. The Minister may have his own views on this, but I feel anyhow that the members of the local authority are really the people who ought to be consulted. The Minister's view may be that it is the manager rather than the local authority who should be consulted. If the manager is a sensible man and wants to avoid friction&mdash;if he wants to have harmonious relations with the people with whom he has to work day after day and month after month&mdash;he will consult the local people. It would be much better, however, that responsibility for this decision should be taken by the Minister after consultation with the local authority.  I think that a wise and sensible Minister for Local Government who wished that his administration would be as perfect as possible would have that form of consultation. Otherwise he is going to get&mdash;I do not know whether he wants to cultivate it or not&mdash;his answer many a time and in an unpleasant way.  That is not going to be good for local government or for the Minister's Department.</P>
    <P>I would remind the Minister, as one with experience of what the attitude of local people can be, that their attitude is not always determined by their political points of view.  There is a local pride.  There is a spirit of feeling competent on the part of elected representatives.  They resent the attitude that you can do anything you like with regard to the conduct of local affairs, and that there is no obligation to consult the local people simply because you have no confidence in them: that you do not value their opinions or their worth.  The Minister would be well advised to change his attitude of mind in that regard. I suggest that the amendment is a very sensible proposition.</P>

Senator Sweetman withdrew his amendment in Committee after saying: &ldquo;If the Minister indicates that he is prepared to take the same procedure&rdquo;&mdash;that is, procedure in connection with the districts&mdash;&ldquo;in this case, I would be quite satisfied.&rdquo;  This amendment proposes, as Senator Baxter indicated, to do what Senator Sweetman's amendment purported to do in Committee.

      <P>In Committee, amendments are put down and are frequently withdrawn either because the Senator concerned or the Minister&mdash;as happens in many cases&mdash;proposes to put down the same or a similar amendment for the Report Stage.  If the amendment is put, in Committee, and defeated the same amendment cannot be proposed on Report, but an amendment not quite the same can be proposed.  The procedure for withdrawing amendments moved in Committee has proved to be extremely useful in this House and in the other House.  It enables a Minister to come back to the House with a formula which suits him better and it enables the Senator to go half way to meet a <Col N="570" /> Minister, as Senator Sweetman proposes. I am not suggesting that the amendment should be accepted because it is a half-way house.  What was suggested originally was that the Minister should divide the area into collection districts.  Senator Sweetman proposed that the local authority should do that.  What is proposed now is that the Minister should do it after consultation with the local authority, which is not quite the same as the provision in the Bill nor is it the same as the amendment proposed in Committee.</P>

I dealt with that matter at considerable length on Second Reading and referred to the grave tendency of the central authority to ignore the wishes of the local authority.  A most reasonable demand is made in this case&mdash;that the wishes of the local authority should be sought.  The Minister protects himself behind difficulties of procedure in refusing to grant that very limited concession to co-operation and goodwill between the central authority and the local authority.  If the Minister said that this was a reasonable request, I am sure that the House would facilitate him and, if necessary, recommit the Bill.  To a reasonable demand, however, the reply is that the local authority will not be consulted.</P>

      <P>Prior to the introduction of this Bill, the function of dividing a rated area into separate districts was, in my opinion, with the county manager, who has acted &ldquo;with the consent of the Minister for Local Government&rdquo;. Article 65 (2) of the Public Bodies Order, 1942, provides:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="571" />&ldquo;A rating authority, with the consent of the Minister, can, in such manner as the Minister shall approve from time to time, divide the rated area into separate districts for the purpose of the collection of rates.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Section 16, sub-section (7) of the County Management Act, 1940, provides:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Every appointment by the council of a county of a rate collector for a rate collection district lawfully established in such county shall be made by such council directly by resolution but no such appointment shall have effect unless or until approved by the Minister.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Prior to the introduction of this Bill, the function of dividing a rated area into collection districts was the function of the county manager, with the consent of the Minister, and had to be carried out in such manner as the Minister should approve.  The elected members of a local authority had no function in the matter.  They were empowered by Section 16 (7) of the County Management Act, 1940, to appoint a rate collector for a rate collection district lawfully established.  It had to be established beforehand in accordance with law.  This amendment seeks to go further than the law has gone.  Hitherto, this was a managerial function.  Under this Bill, it is the function of the Minister.  If a county manager could divide an area into separate districts only in such manner as the Minister would approve, the position was little removed from that created by this Bill, which empowers the Minister to divide a rated area into separate districts.  At no time had the elected members of a local authority any function in the division of a rated area into collection districts.  In seeking by this amendment to require the Minister to enter into prior consultation with the elected members of a local authority, Senator Sweetman is breaking fresh ground and is asking the Minister to do what he never did before.  Apart from the practical difficulties of consultation with members of an elected body, I do not think that any useful purpose would be served by consultation.  I do not think that any <Col N="572" /> great local knowledge is required to divide a county into three or four collection districts.  The county manager could have done that already and I am sure that the Minister, before dividing a rated area into separate districts, will have before him the data necessary for the making of a wide decision. For that reason, I think the amendment does not add anything beneficial to the present position.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the fact that local bodies have not the power to fix collection districts in a rated area is not in itself a reason why they should not now be consulted by the Minister when he fixes those collection districts? Surely consultation is comprehensible and practicable?  The Minister could communicate with the local body and tell them he proposed to divide the collection district in this particular manner and if they made a proposal he could consider it.  This amendment by Senator Sweetman does not make it mandatory on the Minister to do what the local body wants.  It merely asks him to consult them.  I think consultation is very frequently used&mdash;Ministers consult one another and consult various bodies.  It was stated by Senator Sweetman that local bodies are consulted when a change is being made in dispensary districts, so this would seem to be quite feasible.  The local body would have local knowledge and a local point of view.  This is not an unreasonable amendment, as it does not take the final determination from the Minister, but asks him to send the local body an account of what he proposes to do and then consider whatever proposals they put before him.</P>

      <P>This amendment was framed with the intention of giving statutory effect to what I stated the last time and what I understood the Minister was prepared to accept. Senator Ryan's point of view appears to be that the manager should be all powerful in local government, whereas my point of view is the reverse.  Particularly in regard to local government the elected representatives know the people much better than the manager and are able to appreciate these <Col N="573" /> divisions more easily.  It is not merely a question of dividing a district into three or four districts.  Kildare is a small county, but there are 12 districts and I understand we are not in any way out of the ordinary in the size of the districts concerned.  The Minister's own Department sent down to the county council the other day a suggested revision of dispensary districts. The council considered that and there were certain small points on which we thought it was desirable to make changes, on account of our local knowledge. Consequently the county medical officer of health has been asked to consider those changes and submit a report, which we will submit to the Minister.  I understand that this is done under a public health provision somewhat similar to this amendment, and it is the same practice that I wish to see adopted here, so I do not see anything out of the ordinary in it.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 7:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 18, Section 39, to delete sub-section (1), and to substitute therefor the following sub-section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  Where the appropriate Minister is of opinion that in order to serve the national interest or to improve the qualifications of the holder of an office, the duties of that office need not be performed during a particular period by such holder in person, the appropriate Minister may by Order authorise the holder to perform the duties of the office by deputy during that period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment to Section 38 of the Bill is in regard to the &ldquo;special circumstances&rdquo;, about which there was some considerable discussion on the Committee Stage.  The Minister did <Col N="574" /> not define his opinion as to what were &ldquo;special circumstances&rdquo; and, there fore, I have striven to indicate in the terms of this amendment what I consider they should be.  I take it the Minister was correct when he stated on the Second Reading that there was ample power already in the Act of 1941 to deal with cases of illness or of temporary absence, as for holidays.  I think the differentiation is that, in those cases, the office is performed by a substitute, where the substitute is appointed by the local authority concerned&mdash;by the manager, in pursuance of his executive duties.  This is a technical difference, where it is a case in which duties are to be performed by a deputy.</P>
    <P>In this amendment, I have left it to the Minister in his discretion to determine, in his opinion, the holder of the office is going to do something that serves the national interest or to improve his qualifications for that office. On the last occasion, the actual qualification mentioned by someone here was the D.P.H. or something of that kind.  It is obviously desirable that a doctor would be entitled to take an additional post-graduate course of some kind and, if sanction were necessary under this section, such sanction should be given.  There was also the question raised by Senator Quirke that it was desirable that candidates for the Dáil should know that they would be entitled to get their duties performed by deputy under this section.  There can be no doubt that such a case will be covered by the amendment, as it refers to &ldquo;the national interest&rdquo; and service in the Oireachtas is clearly something which is in the national interest.  The same thing would apply to service in the Red Cross, in France or elsewhere, as the Red Cross was set up at the request of the Government. As the definition of special circumstances was not given, I thought it better to limit them in the form proposed by this amendment.</P>

      <P>There may be 101 other reasons why a deputy should be appointed and they are all cut out by this amendment.  You are confining it to two points of a very doubtful nature.  The question as to what is serving the national interest is a big problem and different Ministers may differ as to the meaning of the phrase. I would say that the amendment is entirely impracticable and I would oppose it for that reason.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir John Keane Sir John Keane">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that in considering this amendment we must have regard to the sub-section which it is proposed to delete and we also must have regard to the present practice. We know and the Minister knows&mdash;I do not want to be too specific&mdash;of certain present practices with regard to deputies which are highly dubious, which in the opinion of at least some of us, and in the opinion of many people in the country, are in no sense in the national interest, and which, in the opinion of many, constitute an abuse of the whole procedure.  It is in <Col N="576" /> that regard that this amendment seeks to define the occasions on which deputies should be permitted and to exclude cases where the appointment of deputies would be very much opposed to the national interest and an abuse of the whole procedure. Surely the Minister has ample powers under the terms of this amendment to exercise any reasonable discretion in the public interest.  Senator O'Dea, as far as I could hear him&mdash;I suppose I must be getting deaf because I have increasing difficulty in hearing some people&mdash;rather doubted whether to be a member of the Oireachtas would be to the national interest.  That is a joke of a certain kind but it is a rather cheap kind of joke, coming rather unworthily from a person of his responsibility. He is entitled to make cheap jokes but in a court of law, I am sure his colleague would hold with his vast experience, that the national interest would cover the deputy of any person who is elected a member of the Oireachtas.  I leave the two Senators to settle the matter between themselves. I feel that this amendment gives ample discretion to the Minister to approve of the carrying out of duties by deputies in reasonable cases.  It would exclude cases which are not reasonable and therefore I support it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that this amendment adds anything or changes very much the sub-section in Section 38 because in the amendment and in <Col N="577" /> the sub-section the Minister's opinion is paramount.  The amendment says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Where the appropriate Minister is of opinion that in order to serve the national interest or to improve the qualifications of the holder of an office, the duties of that office need not be performed during a particular period by such holder in person.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The sub-section provides:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Where the appropriate Minister is of opinion that on account of special circumstances, the duties of a particular office should not be performed during a particular period by the holder of the office in person.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>In each case the Minister has to make up his mind&mdash;in the first instance, under the amendment, whether it is to serve the national interest or to improve his qualifications that the duties of the office need not be performed in person by the holder and, in the second case, whether on account of special circumstances the duties need not be performed by him.  There may be circumstances other than the national interest or the improvement of the qualifications of the holder of the office which would require that the duties of the office should be performed by a deputy. I do not think that anything could be gained by the form of this amendment. Section 19, sub-section (1) (j) of the Local Government Act, 1941, says that the appropriate Minister is empowered to make an Order&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;providing in case of holders being ill, absent, or incapacitated for the performance by deputy of such of their duties as relate to the functions of a local authority.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>So the Minister has already power to make an Order providing that the holder of an office who is incapacitated or absent through illness may perform the duties of his office by deputy.  It is quite possible that the word &ldquo;absent&rdquo; in that section might give the Minister complete power.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think that any useful purpose will be served by dragging in the national interest into what I might call mere routine administration.  In fact, I think the Oireachtas ought not, so to speak, hold up service of the national <Col N="578" /> interest as a model to employees of local authorities.  Therefore I suggest that the whole idea of empowering the Minister to provide by Order that the duties of an officer may be performed by a deputy will be defeated by the amendment.  It may be, of course, the intention of Senator Sweetman to defeat the powers given to the Minister by sub-section (1) of Section 38.  I think it would be wrong to tie down the Minister even to an expression of opinion as to what the national interest and the improvement of qualifications means. There may be other circumstances and these circumstances may not occur once in a lifetime.  They may be unforeseen, in which case it will be only right and proper that the holder of the office should be empowered by the Minister to perform the duties of his office in this way.  Therefore, I think that the amendment would be more of a detriment to the officers of local authorities than to the Minister.  For these reasons I do not think that anything useful can be achieved by its acceptance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TheodoreMoore" hpid="Mr. Kingsmill Moore Mr. Kingsmill Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kingsmill Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I think we have lost sight of one rather important principle and that is that if a man is appointed to a certain job it is his business to do the job.  There may be exceptional circumstances in which he can be excused from doing it but these circumstances should be circumstances not arising out of his own private interest or his own private purse but out of interests which override his private interests.  In other words, I can conceive that he should be allowed to appoint a deputy if he is going to better his qualifications for the job for which he is appointed so that he may perform his duties more efficiently.  He may be excused for illness which has come upon him for no fault of his own.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But first of all let us take our stand on the point that a person appointed to an office should not be allowed to appoint a deputy for the purposes of his own gain or his own profit.  And this being so I suggest to the House that it should approach this section and this amendment from the point of view of considering how far it should delegate to the Minister the power to relieve a man from his primary responsibility of doing his job and to <Col N="579" /> delegate it in such wide words as to allow the Minister discretion in any circumstances.  There is a tendency in legislation for Houses of Parliament to put all responsibility upon Ministers. I do not think that is fair to a Minister and I do not think that it shows a proper sense of responsibility in a legislative assembly.  I think it is grossly wrong and unfair for a Minister to have delegated to him this power in words so unprecise and indefinite as &ldquo;special circumstances&rdquo;. It seems that the Minister could be deluged by requests from officeholders on the most trivial and the most untenable excuses.  And the Minister is not entitled to say: &ldquo;This does not come within the power which has been delegated to me&rdquo;.  In every case he is left with the task of defining &ldquo;special circumstances&rdquo;.  I do not think it is fair to the Minister.  Moreover, on looking at the way in which the section is drafted I see that the Minister has tied himself down in a much more limited way than the amendment proposes.  The section as drafted says: &ldquo;should not be performed during a particular period&rdquo;. That is not the same thing as saying: &ldquo;need not be performed&rdquo; or &ldquo;may not be performed&rdquo;.  It seems to me that the Minister if he wishes to exercise his power has to come to the conclusion that it would be wrong or improper that the duties of the office should be performed during the appropriate period by the person appointed. In this respect I think it is too limiting upon the Minister.</P>
    <P>I am strongly of opinion that the Minister should be able to give leave in proper circumstances but the manner in which the section is drafted imposes upon him the duty of deciding whether it is necessary and desirable that the duties of the office should not be performed.  Senator Sweetman, seeing this difficulty, drafted his amendment in a wider way and it gives the Minister greater latitude where, I think, he should have greater latitude and I support the amendment in that respect.  But I do not believe that the Minister should be at liberty to give a person leave of absence and leave to <Col N="580" /> appoint a deputy unless it can be justified on the grounds of some interest other than the private interests of the holder of the office.  Senator Sweetman has suggested the &ldquo;national interest&rdquo; and the &ldquo;improvement of the qualifications&rdquo; of the holder of the office as justifiable grounds.  Both of those are not personal interest or for personal profit.  But I would prefer &ldquo;public interest&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;national interest&rdquo;, as Sir John Keane mentions in a later amendment.  I think it is a wider and better term than &ldquo;national interest&rdquo;.  It is without sure confidence or happy expectation that my request will be accepted that I ask the Minister to consider whether in his own interests these words &ldquo;special circumstances&rdquo; should not be more specific and limited than in the section&mdash;that it should be for the public interest or for increasing the qualifications of the holder of the office or for some reason or object other than pecuniary advantage to the holder of the office or the pecuniary ease and the comfort of the holder of the office that he should be allowed to appoint a deputy.  I feel that if we adopt this position we will be on very sound ground from the point of view of the theory of legislation and the duty of legislative bodies.  I do not think it is right either to give a Minister or impose upon a Minister the duty of deciding, without any guide whatsoever, whether he will allow any Tom, Dick or Harry to desert the position at which he is employed on certain conditions if by so deserting and appointing someone else to do his job he could gain advantage for himself.  The Minister might like to frame an amendment embodying this principle saying &ldquo;circumstances other than those which are for the benefit of the person holding office.&rdquo; I suggest he should use some kind of a negative preface such as that.  I do ask the Minister to approach this amendment in a way which will indicate whether he can accept some of it rather than the casual back-hand of &ldquo;away with the amendment, I will not accept any of it.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I find myself having a great deal of sympathy with the <Col N="581" /> amendment, but I hope it will not be pressed.  As I see it, it really means a vote of confidence or otherwise in the Minister's interpretation of either of two phrases.  The amendment seeks to impose on him the necessity of interpreting the term &ldquo;national interest&rdquo; as distinct from &ldquo;special circumstances&rdquo;. I, for one, would be happy to leave it the Minister to decide the point of national interest within the generic term &ldquo;special circumstances&rdquo;. I do feel that the Minister ought to take a special note of this discussion in the way of allaying what is undoubtedly considerable public unrest about one man holding two jobs, one paid out of the taxes and one paid out of the rates.  I think there is a great deal to be said for the trade union axiom of &ldquo;one man, one job&rdquo;. Now, we are all agreed, I think, that it can be conceived that, in special circumstances, it might be desirable and may be desirable for a man to be given certain facilities so that he may be able to engage himself in political life; but there does come a time&mdash;in this the public generally agree with me and there has been considerable discussion with me outside and, obviously, with other Senators on it&mdash;when the point is reached that a person should be given the choice of deciding what his career is going to be.  There are notorious cases and I use that word &ldquo;notorious&rdquo; deliberately, where over a long period of years public men have been trying to do two jobs&mdash;rather I should say, they are holding two jobs and doing one.</P>

I would be quite <Col N="582" /> happy to leave it to his discretion&mdash;he would bear in mind his own sense of responsibility&mdash;to say how much longer he would allow that dual position to continue.

      <P>On the last occasion I made some reference to the questions raised in the section.  I had hoped that a method would be found by which the section would be so amended as to ensure that, before the Minister acted under the section and declared that some officer of a local authority could perform his duty by a deputy, there would be consultation; that provision would be made in the section for consultation with the local authority so that they might have an opportunity of saying whether they approved of this arrangement.  In my view, if there is to be any responsibility at all given to the members of a local authority they must be asked whether they approve of an arrangement which affects the lives of their people.  That is not being done.  I am afraid that the amendment does not meet the case.  In addition, the amendment contains a provision to which I could not subscribe.  It says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Where the appropriate Minister is of opinion that, in order to serve the national interest or to improve the qualifications of the holder of an office, the duties of that office need not be performed during a particular period by such holder in person.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Now, I am totally against the view that a person appointed to a public office should be told by the Minister to go away and get better qualifications and that the job will be held down for him until he gets those qualifications. I think that is entirely wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us take the case, for example, of an assistant county manager.  In some counties provision is made for the appointment of an assistant county manager.  Let us assume that the Minister says that the assistant appointed in a particular county has not got the qualifications or the training that would fit him to become a <Col N="583" /> manager eventually, and says to him, without consulting the county council, without consulting the county manager and without consulting anybody except merely the holder of the office: &ldquo;You go across to the United States of America and spend a couple of years there studying the manner in which local administration is carried on through the managerial system.&rdquo;  This gentleman walks off, the local county council all the time having to pay his substitute.  I think that is monstrous. I also draw attention to this fact that there is no guarantee whatever that the person appointed to hold the office of deputy will have any qualifications whatever for the post to which he is appointed.</P>

A person who has high qualifications when immediately on entering upon the duties of his office may fall behind after a year or two and a post-graduate course of some kind would be desirable and helpful and in the public interest in such cases.  That is the broad general principle involved here&mdash;to give an opportunity to improve qualifications.  There is, of course, a certain suggestion that some huge post is in the offing and a person occupying a lower administrative post might feel that, if he had an opportunity of taking a course in administrative work, he might become qualified for the post of county manager.  I do not think that the average public body will allow a person to vacate a post with an object such as that in future.  I see a weakness in the amendment proposed by Senator Sweetman.  It seems to be water-tight but I doubt if it would be water-tight. A coach-and-four can be driven through any Act of Parliament and, even if this amendment were accepted, I think that a coach-and-four would be driven through it in the near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I shall give the House a little experience of my youth and I hope it will not be taken as having any relation to current events.  I mention this to show how this provision could be evaded. I remember, as a child, an eminent County Court judge on the Meath Circuit who was always accompanied by his wife.  I wondered if he was so severe in his judgments that his wife accompanied him as a moderating influence.  I discovered later that the judge suffered from a certain illness and that it was necessary he should have some such assistance.  Suppose we consider that it is in the public interest that a deputy should be promoted to some high post which involves great responsibility and which means that his family life will be broken up unless he is accompanied by his family. The person concerned may be highly qualified for the post and public interest <Col N="586" /> might demand that some consideration should be given to the other members of his household.  In that way, this amendment proposed by Senator Sweetman could be evaded.  I think that we are all in agreement with Senator Summerfield, that something should be done about this question of long absence.  I have an amendment down on that but, if the local authority is brought into the matter and if their position is recognised, I think that the problem will be dealt with in the best possible way.  If the local authority is satisfied that prolonged absence, perhaps extending over years, is justified, I do not think that we can go much further.  There is always the constant check of public opinion and, if public opinion becomes vocal and says that the absence is too prolonged, something will have to be done about it.</P>
    <P>Perhaps, I might mention a case which has come within my own administrative experience.  A person was allowed to hold an administrative office, on a temporary basis, to my own knowledge, for 30 years.  When old age approaches, the question is asked in such cases: &ldquo;What are the pension rights of the person concerned?&rdquo; He finds that he is not qualified for a pension.  That is an inhuman condition of affairs.  It may be said that the person has taken the position with his eyes open, that he should have vacated it earlier and sought a position elsewhere.  That is quite true but these things do occur and very great injustice is inflicted where the absence is prolonged.  The least we might do would be to give the local authority an opportunity of expressing judgment on the matter.  If they, with their knowledge of local circumstances, are satisfied, there can be no serious objection by others.  I am not personally concerned in this matter, although I might appear to be. I could give reasons for my statement but I am sure the House will accept what I say.  The difference between the two amendments would be the difference between tweedledum and tweedledee.  I agree with the Senator who said that it is a mistake to specify too minutely or too precisely particular circumstances because, after a month's experience, we might find <Col N="587" /> that there was some other circumstance of which we had not thought. Therefore, a clause-like this should be of a general nature.  I think that there could not be a great deal of advantage in passing this amendment. I fully sympathise with Senator Sweetman's intention but I think that the amendment could be evaded.</P>

      <P>I agree with most of what Senator Summerfield said.  He was simply stating the bald truth when he said that there was considerable interest outside in the issues involved. I am in a certain amount of difficulty. I am in favour of the appointment of deputies and I should be sorry if any matter of the moment should result in the passing of legislation which was unworkable.  I completely disagree with Senator Duffy when he says that it is not desirable for an officer of a local authority to get better qualifications. If a manager were prepared to travel in Europe or America for six months and could afford it, I think it would be a tip-top thing to do.</P>

      <P>As I understand the Bill, it would not be at the expense of the ratepayers.  I do not agree with Senator Hearne that a sanitary inspector should not have a qualification.  I would make it easier for persons to improve their knowledge or experience, but there should be a limit to it and there should be a time limit.  It should be perfectly clear that the special circumstances do not include a person who hopes when he is away that he may land into another position.  I am stating the position plainly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was away for a few days and did not see these amendments until today. I have gone through them carefully and, frankly, I do not like any of them as worded.  However, if we do as Senator Summerfield suggests and defeat them all, that means putting into the Bill as law a section with which I am not satisfied and which I want reconsidered.  Unless this House passes one of these amendments, the <Col N="588" /> Bill will go back to the Dáil and be passed.  If one of them is passed, no matter how unsatisfactory it may be, it can go back to the Dáil and be amended and put right.  I think we can get a better phraseology than there is at present.  Obviously, the matter is to be done by the Minister in office, not by a particular Minister, so we are dealing with definite law and I hope it will be possible to pass one of these amendments, with a clear understanding that the matter can be considered and suitable wording introduced. We have a Local Government Bill before us.  There is a certain amount of uneasiness amongst people outside and if we simply reject all the amendments and leave this exactly as it stands, I think we will be held responsible for not having done as we ought to do.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hearne</NameTxt>
      <P>Reference has been made by several people to public uneasiness in connection with the appointment of deputies.  The people responsible for the appointment of deputies have time and again gone before the people who count as far as government is concerned&mdash;the electorate&mdash;and the electorate has reposed confidence in them time and again.  The man who appointed a deputy a good many years ago in a dispensary district has been returned by the electorate in that constituency at every general election since 1927.  The people in that dispensary district were fully aware of all the circumstances.  His political opponents made the public fully aware of all the circumstances surrounding the appointment of a deputy.  I am perfectly satisfied that the suggestion of public uneasiness is grossly exaggerated and the expression is used to try to stir up public feeling in matters of this kind, matters which can be and should be treated in a very calm way.</P>
      <P>We have a reference by another speaker, in dealing with this section, to a statement that the deputy need not necessarily have any qualification. I suggest that that is a complete travesty of the section.  I make Senator Douglas a present of his disagreement. When I was saying that qualifications for an executive sanitary officer were not necessary, what I had in mind was a sub-sanitary officer.</P>

      <P>If I were in the Minister's position, there would be very few occasions in which I would allow a deputy to be appointed.  I am dealing now with a particular amendment. I realise that there may be an occasion in which there may be special circumstances that cannot be enumerated now and which certainly would not be covered by the two points mentioned in the amendment&mdash; serving in the national interest or improving qualifications.  If there are other certain circumstances, the one person who can decide, and on whom the responsibility rests, should be left to decide what the special circumstances are.  This House is very free to raise that matter, if necessary.  A motion can be put down at any time and we have often had an acrimonious discussion as a result of a motion.</P>

      <P>I have the fullest sympathy with the point of view expressed by Senator Hearne, that it would be much better if public business of all kinds could be carried on without a deputy, whether it be a deputy for the collection or marking of ballot papers or a deputy for any sort of public function.  Then there would be some assurance that things would be done honestly and to the best of the ability of holders of the office and in the best interests of the people.  However, I think it is <Col N="591" /> quite impracticable to enforce a principle that there shall be no deputies for any position in any circumstances whatsoever.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I was indicating that I saw considerable difficulty in accepting, as a general principle, the proposition that no holder of a public office should be allowed, at any time in any circumstances, to function by deputy, or that no person, who is discharging a public duty, should be permitted to function by deputy at any time.  We have already, even here in this discussion, a number of cases cited where some Senators would be prepared to agree that it would be highly desirable, if not absolutely essential, that a holder of public office might function by deputy.  This amendment proposes to narrow the occasions upon which functions might be exercised in this way.  I think that the mover of the amendment has been very unfortunate in its terms.  I cannot imagine that Senator Sweetman has given this proposal that full consideration and careful thought which, on some occasions, have characterised his participation in the proceedings of this House.  If I may adapt a phrase which I have just heard, it represents one of the graver lapses of his genius because I cannot believe that the Senator seriously wishes to equate, as he does here, service of the national interest with improvements in one's personal qualifications. The national interest, of course, is a predominant consideration with everybody.  I am not prepared to say, however, that everybody who is sedulous in seeking his own self-advancement would go so far as to regard the improvement of his personal qualifications as being synonymous with the national interest.  But, according to the terms of the amendment, the Minister is to consider the one equal to the other, either of them entitling a person to secure the Minister's authority to function through deputy.  I think that that would ask the Minister to accept a position which in my view is, on first principles, indefensible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="592" /> Senator Kingsmill Moore has indicated that he, in a measure, would support this amendment but, before he indicated that support, he laid down the general principle that no person should be permitted to function by deputy for his own private interest. Yet, the Senator has suggested that he would accept that amendment.  Why does a person improve his professional qualifications?  It may be that he does seek to improve himself in this way solely because he is anxious to render better public service.  I, as a practical man, take leave to doubt that that is the general rule.  I think that most people seek to improve their professional qualifications with the idea, one time or another, of improving their personal positions.  There is nothing to my mind objectionable in that; it is a natural urge.  I have indicated already that I feel that it would be in the public interest to extend the right to function by a deputy to persons coming within that category.</P>
    <P>Turning again, however, to the question of the national interest, and adverting to the particular phraseology of this amendment, I think that it might put the Minister in a very invidious and awkward position. There are a number of Senators eminently outstanding in their services to the House, but, quite frankly and without any offence, may I say that because of the bias with which they approach public questions, so far as the national interest is concerned it might just as well be served if&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Supposing that we had a more rigorously conscientious Minister, shall we say, than the present Minister for Local Government, and that he had to interpret the provisions in this section, and that they were so narrowly drawn as this amendment proposes, and that we had a certain number of Senators or Deputies habitually in opposition, and that he <Col N="593" /> were to think that these men's political principles were odious, dangerous and subversive, it would be a very difficult task for such a Minister to have to declare that in his opinion the holder of a public office should be facilitated, that it would be in the national interest that he should be facilitated in the discharge of the duties of his political position.  I do not want Senator Sweetman to put me in this position.  I would much prefer that I should be allowed without any reference to national interest or this question of improving one's personal position in life, to decide the circumstances in which a holder of public office might function through a deputy. In this connection I must try and impress upon the Seanad the point of view which as the Minister immediately concerned, I expressed when this section was being discussed in Committee. I said then that I felt that in matters of this sort we shall have to rely, as is customary in matters of general administration, upon the desire of the responsible Minister to excercise his functions with strict regard to his responsibility to the Dáil but also with some regard to human considerations. I think that is how the people of this country would like to see the administration of this country carried on. Senator Sir John Keane feels that he can be omniscient and foresee all the circumstances that might arise in matters of this sort.  I can assure him that he cannot.  I have had before me people asking for special leave in very pathetic circumstances.  The case could be that of a public officer who is the sole support of a widowed mother.  The mother has been suddenly stricken down by ill-health and the officer might wish to have extended leave, not because she is ill herself, not because she is incapacitated, but because she is advised that her mother must be carefully looked after and she would like to be allowed to be relieved from the performance of her public duties in order that she might nurse her mother.  Other circumstances might arise where the breadwinner of a family who has a son or daughter in the public services dies, and the affairs of the family might require the son's <Col N="594" /> undivided attention for a prolonged period.</P>
      <P>I think these are special circumstances which the Minister might justly take into consideration and, as a result, enable the holder of public office who was in such a position to function through a deputy.  There are a number of other cases, some of them, perhaps, hypothetical, that I could cite as likely to come before me for my personal consideration where it is desirable that a person should be given authority to function through a deputy. These instances will, I am sure, induce the House to believe that if you are going to grant this discretion in one case, if you are going to give the Minister authority to act at all, in one or other of the cases that arise, it is wrong that such restrictive conditions should be imposed on him as are sought to be imposed here, because they would preclude him from considering others equally deserving.  One must rely, in the last resort, on the desire of the Minister to do his public duty with, at the same time, adequate consideration for the human circumstances of each particular case.  For that reason I am going to ask the House to reject Senator Sweetman's amendment, and also all those other amendments, such as amendment No. 20, which would, as I have said, seek unduly to restrict the Minister in his judgment of what are special circumstances. I am going to do that because I can see no other way in which the power given under this section can be made effective to deal with cases which at the moment we do not foresee and which perhaps might not be foreseeable, but which, if put up in concrete form, everyone would agree were cases which merited special consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps I ought at this stage refer to a matter which has been the subject of some comment, and which has been again raised in this debate: that is the statement that there is a great deal of public uneasiness by reason of the fact that the holder of a local appointment has enjoyed extended leave of absence over a prolonged period.  Now I think that if there is public uneasiness elsewhere than in the area of the particular <Col N="595" /> authority with which the officer concerned was associated, it arises from a misunderstanding of the circumstances under which a temporary office was held by a permanent local officer.  I think we have already found general agreement here in the Seanad that officers of local authorities if they are elected to either House of the Oireachtas ought to be facilitated in discharging their public duties. What is going to be the position of the holder of a public appointment who is not only elected to the Oireachtas but is also chosen by the head of the Government and accepted by Dáil Eireann for an even more important post.  Is he to relinquish his whole-time appointment when, in fact, he knows that his tenure of his post as Minister, or as Parliamentary Secretary, may be of very brief duration?  In the case which has been the subject of review recently the person concerned was a member of a Party which had not at first a majority in the House.  When the Fianna Fáil Government first took office in 1932 it was in a minority in Dáil Eireann.  It had a programme to execute which, in the circumstances of the time, seemed rather beyond its Parliamentary competence, because it was clear that the constitutional amendments which we then proposed to make, together with the policy which we had put before the people in regard to the financial agreement with England, were likely to involve us in acute political controversy here, and also, I may say, perhaps involve the people in such economic disabilities as might compel us to relinquish office before this programme was brought to fruition.</P>
    <P>That our anticipations in that regard had some foundation is shown by the fact that the Government elected in 1932 felt it necessary to appeal to the people in 1933.  Now, bearing in mind that you have there, I think, positive proof that the tenure of Parliamentary Office was precarious: bearing that fact in mind, would it be reasonable to expect a person called to the public service of the State to relinquish an office which represented a very great part of his normal income, an office <Col N="596" /> upon which he depended for the maintenance of himself and his family, and an office which, once he had relinquished it, he could not possibly regain, because once the vacancy had been created another person would be appointed to the post, when in consequence of his service in the Ministry he might find himself rejected not merely by the Dáil but rejected by the people of his constituency at the succeeding election?  Remember also that at that time there was no prospect of a pension or any other allowance for a person taking public office.</P>
    <P>The 1933 election came along.  The position was slightly different&mdash;was somewhat better, to put it that way, from the Parliamentary point of view &mdash;from what it had been in 1932.  For now the Fianna Fáil administration had an over-all majority in Dáil Eireann.  But it had not a majority in the Seanad, as it was then constituted. Not only that but we were involved in this constitutional and economic dispute with Great Britain, the outcome of which any prudent man could only regard as uncertain.  Let me remind the House&mdash;this is, perhaps, an opportune moment to do so&mdash;that not one of our constitutional changes was carried out without very strong opposition not only in this country but on the part of the Government of Great Britain.  There is no doubt whatever&mdash; we have on record statements by members of the British Government to prove it&mdash;that, if we had been prepared to compromise in regard to political issues, we could have had a very early and speedy settlement of the economic differences.</P>
    <P>The position then was that the dispute with Great Britain was involving our people in great hardship.  We all know how our farmers suffered during that period.  None of us could say positively how they were going to react.  Thank God-and we were grateful to them for it&mdash;they reacted as patriotic Irishmen.  But they were suffering all through that period and those who were members of the administration were obliged to keep in mind the fact that, if the pressure became so intense that our agricultural population, and indeed all our population, broke down under it, there <Col N="597" /> might be a change of administration in the morning.  So that the person occupying a temporary position in the Government, sitting there as tenant-at-will of the Oireachtas and of the Irish people, had very little more assurance as to what his future would be than he had in the year 1932.  That, of course, is a consideration which was bound to be in the mind of any man who had previously held a secure public appointment&mdash;a public appointment which, let me remind the Seanad, constituted his main source of livelihood.</P>

      <P>I did not want to interrupt the Minister because I was very pleased with the line he was taking, but may I point out that he is going into a very wide topic&mdash;a topic which is very far from this amendment?  I suggest that it would be inappropriate to discuss that matter.  A good deal of it is very controversial.  We are all agreed that the tenure of political office is extremely precarious. That applies not only to the time to which the Minister is referring but to any time.  I agree with the main thesis of the Minister but we are getting into a series of discussions which could not possibly be relevant to this amendment.</P>

      <P>I should like to meet the Senator and I shall try to do so. I want to go only a little further and say that the circumstances, as I have outlined them, in relation to the years 1932 and 1933 applied to the year 1937 and to the administration that took office in the year 1938&mdash;at least, after the early part of its period of office. When the war broke out in 1939, no person could readily retire from his position in the Ministry and go back to his appointment as an officer of a local authority.  I am perfectly certain that, if these facts were before the public&mdash;I am grateful to those Senators who have given me the opportunity and allowed me the latitude to make this statement&mdash;such public uneasiness as exists would be, in great part, allayed. I do not want to say in regard to that matter any more than I have already said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not very easy to lay down the rule of &ldquo;one man, one job,&rdquo; in relation <Col N="598" /> to public appointments.  A number of posts are generally regarded by the public as being a single post, when in fact, the holder of the major post carries a number of other appointments as well.  The case of a town clerk will occur as an example.  In some cases, he is chief sanitary officer, registration officer and a number of other things as well.  I could not make statutory provision to ensure that no man would hold more than one office under a public authority.  We have in this Bill proposals for amalgamation of offices, proposals for making one office out of three or four existing offices.  I cannot and will not accept any amendments which would tend to restrict the Minister in the exercise of his power under the section as drafted, except, perhaps, an amendment more or less in the form I shall outline which might meet the point made by Senator Douglas and Senator Kingsmill Moore.  I should be prepared to move at an opportune moment an amendment to the following effect: &ldquo;An Order under sub-section (1) of this section shall not remain in force for a longer period than six months but may be replaced by a further Order or Orders if the Minister is satisfied that the special circumstances continue to exist&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>To some extent, the Minister brought all this discussion about this amendment on himself.  If he had made in Committee the speech which he has just now made, excluding the end of it regarding the position of Ministers and jobs, there would have been no trouble at all in settling this matter.  It was because the Minister refused to tell us anything of what he had in mind about &ldquo;special circumstances&rdquo; that Senator Sweetman was obliged to put down this amendment. Before I go on to make a few remarks about the amendment, may I say that the Minister dealt with the position of <Col N="599" /> a Parliamentary Secretary who, for a prolonged period, was occupying a post by deputy.  Neither Senator Sweetman nor I, nor any of my particular friends in this House, introduced that matter and for our part we regret that it should have been introduced by anybody. It is bad from the Parliamentary point of view and unfair from the point of view of the individual.  On an amendment on the Report Stage of the Bill, by a side wind, a very grave matter of this kind should not be discussed where an individual's honour is concerned.  We certainly had no desire to discuss it.</P>
      <P>Political office, as I said when I asked the Minister not to take the matter any further, is notoriously precarious and I agree entirely with the Minister in so far as that is what he was trying to point out.  However, in so far as he was trying to prove that political office for his own particular Party is more precarious than for any other Party, I disagree with him entirely and events have proved that there were never any special circumstances applying to the Fianna Fáil Party which did not apply to their predecessors in office and which would not apply to their successors&mdash;nothing is more certain than that they will have successors&mdash; and the attempt of the Minister to indicate that, in some peculiar way, they occupied a special position is a matter of special pleading which we might very well have done without.  He had a case for the particular point he was making without bringing in that.</P>
      <P>On the question of this particular amendment, if the Minister in Committee had managed to shed his peculiar views about the responsibility of Ministers to the Dáil and to the Seanad and had done what his colleagues do&mdash;told us what he had in mind in the section&mdash;we would not have had this discussion at all.  For example, on this section in Committee, if he had told us what he told us this evening, or told us what he told Senator O'Donovan about the meaning of a whole-time officer, this whole discussion on Report would not have arisen at all.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, in reply to Senator O'Donovan the Minister said, on another section dealing with whole-time officers, their experience was so-and-so and they had endeavoured to do so-and-so in particular types of case. Whether he convinced Senator O'Donovan or myself or not, he did make an effort to show what the purpose was and what kind of case he was trying to deal with.  If he had been as accommodating on Section 38, we would have got over the Committee Stage much more rapidly.  He refused to deal with anybody's point and particularly with Senator Summerfield's point, in Committee.</P>
      <P>I agree that as a general principle Ministers ought to have general powers.  Unless I am greatly mistaken, when you do what Senator Sweetman is endeavouring to do in this amendment and what Senator Sir John Keane is trying to do in amendment No. 20, that is, when you prescribe the things the Minister is to do, I believe the legal position is that those are the only things he can do.  From an administrative point of view, that position has proved irksome, cumbersome and hampering. Nobody wants to hamper the Minister.  It would be much better for him to have general powers.  He gave some examples this evening, one of which was compassionate leave.  My experience of Ministers since 1922 is that they and their officials deal with that kind of thing in a very reasonable way.  But the Minister brought all kinds of considerations into it&mdash;for example, that he would have to consider a man's political principles as odious.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>And that I might take it myself, I think.  I do not consider anyone's political principles odious, so long as they are principles.  I would rather not see these hampering amendments put down or carried, as I realise that in general administration one can get the most peculiar cases.  I myself was <Col N="601" /> chairman of the Civil Service Commission for ten years and the most extraordinary things arose, which one would not imagine even in a novel.  One would wonder how people who were merely competitors for examinations would be the cause of such extraordinary tangles as arose occasionally. I would leave the general powers to the Minister.</P>
      <P>We might dispose of all these amendments together, as the Minister has conceded the point of limitation of time, and I take it there will be general agreement in allowing him to move his amendment at whatever point is considered most appropriate.  If he does that, it will remove much of the difficulty. I regret very much that this matter of the tribunal and the Parliamentary Secretary should have been introduced at all.  I also regret that the Minister should have thought fit to engage in an excursion from 1922 to 1938, by way of Britain.</P>

      <P>In my opinion there are a number of other matters that would arise on the operation of this section to which the gravest objection could be taken.  I shall deal with them very briefly.  There is the question of the Oireachtas taking no power whatever to control any conceivable Ministerial malpractice.  We know that there have been in all countries, not frequently, I grant you, instances of misfeasance on the part of Ministers.  I shall give one example of how our Parliament has protected itself against malpractices in high places.  Have we not got a provision that any lease of State lands must be laid on the Table of the House?  Is not that, obviously on the face of it, a precaution to prevent malpractice on the part of the Minister of State?  Parliament must in certain cases take precautions to protect the country against malpractices. Although I agree with the general proposition that you cannot place Ministers under suspicion in all kinds of small ways, there should be no objection to placing general restrictions on administrative powers in certain cases.

Both &ldquo;cannot&rdquo; and &ldquo;should not&rdquo; should not be interpreted as meaning that the application should come from headquarters to the local authority.

      <P>In page 18, Section 38, sub-section (1), line 37, after the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; to insert the words &ldquo;on an application submitted on behalf of the local authority concerned&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>On the face of it, the sub-section looks like short-circuiting the local authority. I have had practical experience of the working of an arrangement of this type. I know the usual procedure is that the local authority first considers the position and then submits a suggestion to the central authority and the Minister acts upon that.  The words: &ldquo;the appropriate Minister&rdquo; contemplate the fact that there may be Ministers of different Departments involved and it struck me that it would be an improvement if in the last three lines the words were inserted: &ldquo;The appropriate Minister may, on an application submitted on behalf of the local authority concerned, authorise the holder to perform the duties of the office by deputy during that period&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is actually what happens in some offices&mdash;he merely authorises.  If the Minister thinks that the words should go out, I have no objection, but it will not fit in with the practice of other Departments.  I would suggest then that a lot of the criticisms we have heard would be obviated if some such provision had been put in the original amendment.  What happens is that a deputy, an official of some local authority, may be elected to the Oireachtas.  Naturally, he must convey that fact to the authority by whom <Col N="606" /> he is appointed, and, in the normal manner, they will say whether they approve of it or not.  The next stage is to send the proposal to the central authority and the appropriate Minister will say in turn whether he approves of the action of the local authority.</P>
    <P>It would give the whole section a much more democratic appearance than it has at present, if the amendment were adopted.  As it stands, it appears that without consulting the local authority at all, the Minister might issue an Order and that in itself would create a lot of bad blood between the local authority and the officer concerned. They would resent an Order coming from above without their being consulted in any way.  I do not think, however, that it will create any trouble, because in most cases those applications for approval will come from the county manager.  I believe that is one of the services for which he is responsible and so that will not introduce any conflict which might arise if it were a reserved function of the local authority.</P>
    <P>There are other bodies, such as committees of agriculture, vocational education committees and so on, where there is no county manager, where the county manager does not come into the picture, and in those cases the local authority is the authority to make it. If it is put in that form, things could run much more smoothly.  That provision would apply in other cases where application was made.  I would appeal to the Minister to accept this amendment because I think that it will make for better understanding between the Departments concerned and the local authorities.</P>

      <P>While Senator O'Reilly was speaking, it occurred to me that this amendment in its existing wording would have one particular effect to which I am quite certain he did not advert&mdash;I did not advert to it until, suddenly, as he was speaking. Section 38 is not confined to the Minister for Local Government; it is &ldquo;the appropriate Minister&rdquo;.  The appropriate Minister could be the Minister for Education, and it would be open to question whether the local authority would be the manager of the national school who would stand in the <Col N="607" /><i>locus</i> of the local authority.  I am not a bit clear on that.  Senator O'Reilly's amendment is meant to advert solely to persons serving under urban councils, town commissioners, vocational education committees or agricultural committees, but in fact cannot Section 38 also refer to an ordinary primary teacher?</P>

      <P>If the Minister for Agriculture can be brought in under this Bill, why not the Minister for Education?  I feel we have got away from the spirit which was inherent in the discussion we had before tea and I am trying to carry it on in that spirit.  I said &ldquo;tea&rdquo;, Sir.  I am not quite clear how the section will operate.  Will it have a restrictive effect on the powers of the Minister for Local Government in, for instance, the case of vocational committees and agricultural committees, operating under the Vocational Education Act and various agricultural Acts?  I think that as it stands it is going to refer to the Minister of any Department. It is desirable that the House should be clear as to the position of an office-holder of any of these authorities in relation to the holding of his position by a deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want also to make it quite clear that in anything I said to-day, I was not adverting to the case mentioned by the Minister in regard to the performance of duties by a deputy, because I did not think it would be right to advert to anything that was pending.  I was adverting to another case mentioned by the Minister in <Col N="608" /> reply to a question in the Dáil yesterday. One of the reasons I was adverting to it was that a particular side issue is affected by the amendment proposed by Senator O'Reilly.  I am informed in that particular case the Minister had dealt with it, not merely without reference to the local authority concerned, but contrary to the wishes of the local authority concerned, and, therefore, for that reason, while I see great difficulty because of the words &ldquo;appropriate Minister&rdquo; in Senator O'Reilly's amendment I would like to see that there would be consultation or notice and that in some way the local authority would be brought in for this purpose mentioned in Section 38.</P>

Even if the man was elected to the Dáil, the Minister would be prevented from even considering the case on those grounds.</P>

      <P>I would like to suggest that the Minister might try to devise some other form of words to meet my views and the views expressed here.  Supposing a Minister, by Order, decided to give his authority it would put the local officer in a very difficult position.  He would immediately come into conflict with his own employer. That is the position that will have to be guarded against.  I think the Minister might devise some form of words that would recognise the position of the local authority with, perhaps, a right of appeal to the Minister in the event of an unreasonable attitude being taken up.  Take the case of a person being appointed to the Oireachtas.  The county manager might raise the objection in that case, having regard to the statements made by the Minister himself on that subject, statements which I consider to be very reasonable and sound.  I want to avoid a conflict between the officer and his employer and at the same time the Minister might find means of dealing with the case of a county manager or other officer who adopts an unreasonable attitude.  As it stands it would be resented very much by most local authorities.</P>

      <P>In page 18, Section 38, sub-section (1), to delete the words &ldquo;by Order&rdquo; in lines 37-38.</P>
      <P>I have already explained what I mean by this method of dealing with matters of the kind that is not common to all Departments of State.  I feel that the word &ldquo;authorises&rdquo; is quite sufficient. In the case of the Department of Local Government the authority must be in the form of an Order, but in the case of other Departments they issue letters authorising certain things to be done. I think that if the word &ldquo;authorises&rdquo; were left standing it would be quite sufficient to meet both cases.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 16:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 18, Section 38, to delete sub-sections (2) and (3) and substitute instead a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(2) Every deputy appointed under <Col N="611" /> this section shall be appointed by the appropriate Minister after consultation with the elected representatives, or the commissioner, as the case may be, of the local authority.</P>
    <P>The purposes of this amendment are not in any way secured by the amendments circulated by the Minister.  The object of this amendment is twofold. It is to get rid altogether of this right of the holder of an office to nominate a deputy and, secondly, to try to bring the local authority into consultation&mdash; into co-operation with the Minister in respect of the appointment.  This nomination seems to be a most extraordinary provision.</P>
    <P>I heard it justified on the grounds that if a dispensary officer has to appoint a deputy there may be no other house in which the deputy can live, and on this account the holder should be given the right to nominate. Surely, that is an extraordinary reason for sweeping away the safeguards that surround public appointments at present&mdash;the unanimity, advertisement and secrecy of the proceedings of the appointment board.  All these were to be swept away and the Minister put on the defensive, in this position.  If I am a dispensary officer and nominate my brother, my sister, my niece, my cousin, who is a fully qualified, graduated practitioner, there can be no reason whatever that the Minister can give as to why this person should not be allowed to act as deputy.  That is an extraordinary position regarding an appointment, in the public interest, which may conceivably last for 20 years.  Just look at it.  The Minister himself might have been at one time a county manager and have been elected to the Dáil, and his appointment might be thoroughly secure, and he might go on for 15 or 20 years in public life acting through a nominee to whom the Minister at the time could see no objection.  As long as the Minister cannot give a valid objection to the nominee, that nominee has, in all reality, not only a right to the office but the right to retain the office except for misconduct or gross inefficiency.  We know that there have been some very inefficient persons <Col N="612" /> maintained in office.  I could give some cases in private to the Minister if he wants them.</P>
    <P>There is, at any rate, the position that we have swept away the whole method of public appointment, and that we allow a holder who may have been in office for only six months to nominate a deputy.  That deputy may remain in office for 10 or 20 years.  He may possess only academic qualification. He may not have had any practical experience at all.  It must be accepted that this is an extraordinary position.  What is the reason for giving this right of nomination?  Why should not the Minister consult, as any sensible Minister would&mdash;there need not be any statutory provision about it&mdash;the holder of the office and say: &ldquo;What views have you about your deputy?&rdquo; He could make arrangements with regard to the occupation of the holder's residence if such was necessary.</P>
    <P>I do not take the view that it would be impossible, except in more than a few cases, for a deputy to find a suitable residence other than that occupied by the holder of the office in the district.  We all know that in many country districts there are private medical practitioners who are fully qualified and who would be quite ready to assume the duties of the office.  They are every bit as well qualified as any nominee that the holder might choose to name to the Minister.</P>
    <P>I think that this principle of nomination is unprecedented.  I do not know anywhere in legislation where that power is given.  It is altogether out of line with the excessive precautions that are sometimes taken to secure impartiality in public appointments.  Let me emphasise again that it would not matter if this appointment of a deputy were for a limited period.  We all know from experience that it may go on for ten, 15 or 20 years.  Let us look at this detached from all the trammels of red tape.  What would a business firm do in a case like this?  It is not unknown that business people have to give extended leave and have to replace employees who may be elected to public office.  They give the employees the extended leave and say to <Col N="613" /> them: &ldquo;We will arrange for your work to be done while you are away; you will retain your rights of seniority and the increments of your office, but of course you will not take any emoluments.&rdquo; That is the commonsense way of doing it.  It is inconceivable that we should have departed so far from that method.  Let me try to tell the House what, failing the assistance of Senator Ryan, I have been able to find out about the practice in England on this subject.  The Senator was very helpful to the House on the British method with regard to abolishing local authorities, as proposed in Section 30. He was also very helpful with regard to what British jurists have said in regard to the publication and non-publication of inspectors' reports.  My time was very limited, but I did happen to run up against a very old friend who has been chairman of a county council in Great Britain for very many years. He is a very well-known man.  I do not want to mention names, but I can say that he is one of the foremost chairmen of British county councils.</P>
    <P>I asked him, generally, about the position.  He said: &ldquo;We do not often have it, but when we do it is a personal matter and I, as chairman, would probably deal with it.  We had the position that one of our employees was elected a member of Parliament.  What I did was I simply asked the council to give him leave while he was away attending Parliament, and we arranged that he would retain his office and emoluments, but of course he took no salary while away.  In due course when he ceases to be a member of Parliament he will come back, without any loss of seniority, to his old position&rdquo;.  I put to him the hypothetical case that I put to the Minister.  I asked him if it would be possible for one of the council employees to get leave, an employee who, say, was the wife of a civil servant.  Would it be possible, I asked, for her to get leave to join her husband who was quartered in some distant station?  His answer was that he had never heard of such a thing.  He said: &ldquo;If an employee of ours wanted to do that she would have to resign, and if we wanted to do it the Minister would not allow it&rdquo;.  He added: &ldquo;Of course, we give compassionate <Col N="614" /> leave for short periods.  In such a case we make arrangements for the work to be done during the officer's absence&rdquo;.  All that seems so simple that it is inconceivable that we cannot do it.</P>
    <P>Why should a local authority be completely ignored in this matter?  As I understand it all this arrangement with regard to a deputy is going to be undisclosed.  It is going to be a matter of correspondence between the county manager and the Minister's office.  The elected representatives are going to know nothing about it.  I do not know exactly what right they have to make a county manager disclose what is going on.  Clearly, it would not be a reserved service.  Presumably, the holder of the office would approach the county manager and say that he wanted leave to appoint a deputy.  The local authority would be left entirely ignorant. The matter would go to the Minister. The correspondence that passed would be undisclosed and the Minister would take what action he saw fit.</P>
    <P>What is a local authority for?  Surely a local authority has some rights in this matter, and the members of it are qualified to give an opinion on it. Who would be in a better position than the members of a local authority to know who would be the most acceptable person to the people of a district? The holder might want somebody who did not know the district and who had little or no experience.  The local authority might say that they would much prefer &ldquo;Doctor A&rdquo; to the person nominated by the holder.  He might live in the district.  But the local authority is not to have that opportunity. It is not to be consulted. The members of the local authority may wake up some fine morning and find that their local dispensary doctor or, conceivably, the county manager has gone off to take up some other public duty and that some other person has been appointed in his place without their knowledge.  That is a most extraordinary situation.  The object of my amendment is to bring this matter down to a human, realistic, sensible plane.  With regard to the qualifications, I am prepared to trust the Minister that, without consulting the local <Col N="615" /> authority, he will not appoint any unqualified person.  I should far rather trust him to appoint a qualified person than put him in the position of having to defend his decision against the nominee of a holder.</P>

      <P>Senator Sir John Keane has not grasped the very significant fact that this section gives a sort of covering authority to provide for circumstances which have not been dealt with by other Acts.  The assumption underlying Senator Sir John Keane's speech was that no provision had been made elsewhere than in the regulations made by the Minister for Local Government, or which may be made under the section, for the appointment of a deputy.  That is not the case.  There are some statutes&mdash;the Coroners Act, for instance&mdash;which impose upon the holder the obligation to appoint a deputy.  Immediately after appointment, a coroner has to appoint a deputy.  I do not want to speak too positively on this matter, but neither the Minister for Local Government nor, I think, any other Minister&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Coroners Act, of 1892, states: &ldquo;Every coroner, whether a coroner of a county or a borough, shall appoint by writing under his hand a fit person approved by the chairman or mayor, as the case may be, of the council who appointed the coroner, not being an alderman or councillor of such council, to be a deputy and may revoke such appointment, but such revocation shall not take effect until the appointment of another deputy.&rdquo;  That is a clear case in a statute of the British legislature, which Senator Sir John Keane now strongly contemns, providing for the appointment of a deputy by the actual holder of an office.</P>
      <P>Under the County Management Act, it is provided that, if the county manager is on vacation, or is, through illness, absent from his county, he may appoint a deputy.  The relevant sub-section is as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Where a county manager is on vacation and also where a county <Col N="616" /> manager is so incapable as aforesaid and such incapacity is due to absence from his county, the power of appointing a deputy county manager may be exercised by such county manager, after consultation with the chairman of the county council.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Senators will notice that the chairman of the county council must be consulted in each case.  The authority of the Minister need not be sought.  In this section, the person who is to be consulted in regard to the appointment of a deputy is the Minister who gives authority and, under sub-section (3) of the section, the Minister is required to satisfy himself&mdash; we have heard a great deal about qualifications&mdash;that the deputy possesses the qualifications required for the holder of the office and the knowledge and ability to discharge its duties properly.  I think that the Minister is in a much better position to satisfy himself in regard to these matters than the chairman or members of the local authority would be.</P>
    <P>Not only do I believe that but the Oireachtas has believed it, because it has prescribed by law that the persons who shall not have any say in the appointment of office holders, so far as their qualifications are concerned, are the members of the local authority and, in regard to major offices, even the manager of the local authority.  Since, in many cases, the office to be filled by a deputy will require very definite qualifications on the part of such deputy, I think that the best person to determine whether a proposed deputy is a fit person to be appointed is, in the first instance, the person who is responsible for the discharge of the duties of the office.  That is the principle which has been adopted in relation to the appointment of a deputy by a coroner or by a county manager.  Bearing in mind that the appointment of officers to major posts is no longer a function of the local authority or any member of it, then, failing the Local Appointments Commission, no person is more appropriate than the Minister to act in giving sanction to the appointment of a deputy.  The Local Appointments Commission <Col N="617" /> mission would not be an appropriate instrument in this matter because every person knows that delay is inseparable from the proper functioning of the Local Appointments Commission.  Deputies may have to be appointed in circumstances in which time is a very important factor and in which the duties of the office would have to be discharged almost without interruption.</P>
    <P>I think that the worst possible way of appointing a deputy is that suggested in the amendment.  The moment the question of the appointment of a deputy arose, we should be back in the position in which we were prior to the establishment of the Local Appointments Commission.  We should have every sort of personal consideration obtruded and all those factors operating, to exclude which, the Oireachtas felt, justified the setting up of a special body of commissioners to fill these posts.  We should have the unfortunate office holder, put, perhaps, in this impossible position&mdash;that his request to be allowed to approach the Minister to appoint a deputy would not be conceded unless he agreed to appoint a person who was acceptable to the majority of the members of the local authority concerned. That might quite easily eventuate in the appointment of a totally unsuitable person as deputy.</P>
    <P>The Minister would then have to authorise the discharge of the functions of the office by a person who, in his view, was unsuited for the post. The only reasonable way of dealing with the matter is provided in sub-section (3), viz., that the Minister should have to satisfy himself that the person to be appointed as deputy should be capable, not merely by academic qualifications but by ability and knowledge, to fulfil the duties of the post.</P>

There are very strict rules and I do not think we need be anxious that anyone will be sanctioned, either as a substitute or a deputy, unless properly qualified.</P>

      <P>And in some cases they must have experience.  My idea is that the County Management Act gave, in Section 17, full control to the county manager over all officials.  Therefore, the application for leave would be made in the first instance to the county manager.  He would either grant it, subject to the consent of the Minister, or refuse it.  If he refused it, the official would have an appeal to the Minister, under Section 10 of the Act of 1941.  The question of the appointment of the deputy would come up at the same time as the request for leave. If the county manager, or possibly any member of the council, knows anything against the deputy nominated, the Minister will very likely be informed of that disqualification. Therefore, Senators need have no fear whatever that the person who will be appointed as a deputy will not be very well qualified for the post.</P>

There are some counties in which that is not done, and I would like to see it extended.  In any event, it is mandatory on the county manager to produce, at the succeeding meeting of the local authority, the orders made since the previous meeting and members are quite free to see them. Therefore, the point that was made that this can be done without the knowledge of the elected members of the local authority is not correct.</P>

      <P>I omitted to mention that, in the course of my researches to find out the practice in Great Britain, I found out that in many cases there is a deputy county surveyor, deputy medical officer, and so on.  I was a little surprised that the Minister could produce only two cases to justify his acceptance of this power of nomination.  He produced the case of a coroner.  Obviously, a coroner must have a deputy, as he has to act straight away.  If there is a death, one cannot wait until the Minister or somebody else nominates or appoints a deputy.  In the case of the county manager, I am not familiar with the details of local administration now, but I should imagine that there would be a standing deputy, obviously someone in the office.

      <P>I move amendment No. 17:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 18, Section 38, to insert a new sub-section (3) as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(3) No holder of an office shall retain any emoluments payable out of public or local funds during the period that his duties are performed by a deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment does not need very much elaboration.  I suppose I may be told that there are at present people who retain emoluments when they appoint deputies.  I do not refer to retention during leave of absence. Obviously, the deputy acts then, but the emoluments of the office are retained. I do not know the rules about sick leave, but in commercial businesses, if you have rules regarding sick leave, you may give an official leave for six months on full pay and, perhaps, a further period on half pay, after which you deal with cases at your discretion.  I am not objecting, naturally, to an official on leave, whose duties are being done by a deputy, keeping his salary, but I am objecting to cases such as we all know of, where a holder has appointed a deputy over a long period of years, where the holder, say, is elected to the Dáil or <Col N="621" /> Seanad and for five or six years, or perhaps for ten years, his work is being done through a deputy.  Then the term &ldquo;deputy&rdquo; loses all practical significance.  In those cases the person doing the job is, in fact, the holder of the office.  You may call him what you like, but if he is the person doing the work for two or three years, he is the holder of the office.</P>
    <P>I understand&mdash;and I think the Minister admitted it&mdash;that it is possible for a person who&mdash;not for temporary absence, for leave for study or such like, but for a prolonged absence&mdash;appoints a deputy to make any financial arrangement he likes with that deputy to share the emoluments.</P>
    <P>The Minister told us that if it were not that way, it would create confusion and that he would rather not have knowledge of what financial arrangements were made.  That is an extraordinary position.  The holder nominates a deputy.  It is all very fine to say that the Minister is going to be quite indifferent in regard to the nomination and that he is not going to be affected by it but, in practice, it is quite conceivable&mdash;we know it has come about&mdash;that holders can nominate relations&mdash;I am not saying they are not quite qualified&mdash;to discharge their duties.  Yet the Minister would rather not know what proportion of the emoluments is retained by the holder. I call a position of that kind&mdash;it is hard to get words to cover it but I give the nearest terms I can get to describe it&mdash;is perilously like simony in modern dress.</P>
    <P>The Minister implied that it was very difficult to deal with cases of doctors who had emoluments from different sources&mdash;a doctor who had his salary from a local authority and who had his fees from private practice.  What is the difficulty?  Fees from private practice can certainly be made a matter of arrangement.  They are not emoluments from public or local funds.  Let the holder and the deputy make what arrangement they like about private practice but why, in all reasonable fairness or, I would almost say, decency of public life, allow the holder to retain any proportion of the salary payable <Col N="622" /> for a position to which a deputy is appointed? After all, you can get a young person who would be very glad to work for almost nothing in order to get experience.  Does the Minister tolerate that?  He does tolerate it, because he says: &ldquo;I would rather not know what arrangements are made.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I want to approach the subject matter of this amendment slightly differently.

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, Sir&mdash;and his Party.  The Senator will know that the Act was passed in 1926 and that it has been in operation, not only up to 1932, but up to the present time.  My difficulty about this provision is that the system has moved away to a large degree in the appointment of deputy in certain circumstances.  An office under <Col N="623" /> a local authority becomes vacant.  The Appointments Commission, after advertisement and so forth, chooses a person whom it thinks the most qualified for the position.  He is chosen, presumably, on account of his knowledge, his experience, his learning, his degree of skill for the particular office concerned.</P>
      <P>According to that knowledge, learning, degree of skill and so forth, the local authority pays him out of the public purse.  The public pay for a particular type of service represented by those qualifications.  It may then become necessary for that officer to appoint a deputy within the meaning of this section.  It does appear to me wrong that the public who are paying for a particular type of experience, skill and learning, should get something that is less than that.  The position may be that a very junior person, a person just qualified, may be put in the office. While he may be qualified within the meaning of that term for the position, he is not qualified to give the full service that the permanent holder of the office would be qualified to give.  It does seem to me very wrong that if the service that is given is not of the type that was intended when the salary and other emoluments of the office were being fixed, the same salary and emoluments should be paid even though the service is not the same.  That does not appear to me fair either to the local authority or to the public in the area that has to be served.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are two ways in which that can be dealt with.  It can be dealt with either by the permanent holder of the office not paying the full emoluments to the Deputy or it can be dealt with by there being a provision that the deputy to be appointed must possess the full standard of skill and efficiency of the permanent holder.  Senator Sir John Keane has dealt with the first way but in my opinion the second way would be fairer.  The first only deals with one particular aspect&mdash;the monetary aspect.  The second way I have suggested deals with the aspect that should be the primary aspect, namely, the question of service to the people in the functional area of the <Col N="624" /> office holder concerned.  And it does appear to me that there is a very strong case that the public should not be asked to pay for services of a particular type, experience and skill, that in fact they are not getting.</P>

      <P>In connection with this amendment, perhaps I might be allowed to put a question to the Minister which seems to me of practical importance?  It is: Who is the local employer of the deputy appointed in the circumstances contemplated?  The question may be of importance in this way&mdash;the emoluments of the deputy and contributions under the Insurance Acts.  Who is to be obliged to insure him or who is liable if there is a failure to pay him or her?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>The first thing I would like to point out is the section itself does not provide that any arrangement about money would exist between the office holder and the deputy.  Now, we are introducing a sub-section which legally would have no effect if it were put into existence because if you make it illegal to do a thing which is generally done, you will find that it will be done underground and you cannot prevent it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LouisODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there anything wrong in an officer getting fees after he ceases to hold office?  Suppose a man is an engineer or an architect to a local authority.  He has a big scheme in hand.  It may be something of a very big nature, waterworks, sewerage, harbour development&mdash;anything of that kind, perhaps it might be a hospital. He prepares plans and specifications and he has the work in full train.  He has his clerk of works appointed and he has told his clerk of works every detail of that work that is to be carried out.  When he has done that he is suddenly stricken down by illness, perhaps by tuberculosis.  We are told that a man suffering from tuberculosis is supposed to have no financial or other worry, and it is urged that people in employment should be paid the amount of their ordinary wage while in sanatoria, and I suggest there must be provision to that effect and I hope <Col N="625" /> it will be paid.  The man I have referred to has a wife and family and has gone through all the trouble of preparing the plans and specifications.</P>
      <P>Is it to be suggested that the deputy who comes in, who knows less than the clerk of works, is to be paid the full amount of the fees which would have been paid to the architect, and that architect cannot get a penny for what he has done in connection with that work?  I think it is a most preposterous suggestion to make and it would be unjust and dishonest if somebody who had practically done nothing would get the fees and that this man would get only the cost of preparing the plans while his successor walked away with the rest of the fees in his pocket.  It would be extraordinary.</P>
      <P>I can see cases of other professional work where similar cases might arise. A section like this may make for injustice as I do not see any valid reason for putting it in.  Suppose on the other hand, there is something done which ought not to be done.  Suppose that the deputy of the engineer had the fees and it comes to the notice of the Minister that it is being done and ought not to be done.  Under a section which Senator O Buachalla has pointed out to me, the Minister has power to revoke the appointment and the new deputy will be appointed so that there is no question about it, the public are protected in that way.</P>
      <P>Most professions have their own strict rules and they provide generally for cases of this nature, by which a person who would work at a fee that is too small may be dealt with.  You may take it for granted that those professions will protect themselves and you may take it that there is no doubt whatever that the person employed by the local authority will not get the fees agreed to under the contract with the deputy, because, as I understand it, they can make their own arrangements with the deputy or let the officer make his arrangements.  I think that generally speaking the local authority pay the deputy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I should, perhaps, begin by setting out the objection I stressed on the last day to the suggestion that we should give effect to a <Col N="626" /> proposal such as this on the Report Stage of the Bill.  I said in regard to it and I think it applies to this amendment:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;On the question of emoluments I think it would be quite impossible to lay down a rule that all the emoluments would be payable to a deputy.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I suggest that the instance which Senator O'Dea has mentioned in this House gives substantial point to that statement without further emphasis by me.  Again I said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;We would simply get into a state of the utmost confusion and certainly one which would clog the administration unduly if we are to put in a general statement that all emoluments are to be reserved to the deputy.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I went on to say that one might be certain that where the deputy satisfied the requirements of the Minister as to ability and experience, so as to ensure that he was a proper person to fill the post, the terms he would make with regard to emoluments would be sufficiently exacting to leave the principal very little profit out of the office which is what the Senator appears to fear.  Then the Senator asked me would I acknowledge the financial arrangement between the holder of the office and his deputy, and I said no, that it was not so desirable we should do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir John Keane Sir John Keane">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what I had in mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>That is going a long way from saying: &ldquo;Something which I prefer not to know&rdquo;.  I think the point about which Senator Concannon has asked me may help me to explain why it is desirable that the Minister should have as little to do as possible with these financial arrangements.  If the Minister enters into a matter of that sort, the officer becomes much less free in his sanction for the deputy. The Minister becomes to some extent, perhaps, much less free to insist on his point of view regarding qualifications, and a great deal of consultation and negotiation, if you like to put it that way, may take place between the three parties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="627" /> On the other hand, if the office holder is left free to make his own arrangements with his deputy, the local authority has a duty in respect of the deputy for whom the office holder is responsible.  The local authority will, perhaps, find itself freer to express itself as to the manner in which the deputy functions in his office because its members will be able to place full responsibility on the original office holder for the conduct of his deputy, and I think they will find themselves much freer to make representations to the Minister in regard to the conduct of that deputy.</P>
    <P>Apart from that, this amendment, if accepted, would create a very extraordinary position.  Resident medical superintendents of mental hospitals, if going away on leave or because of incapacity or because for some other reason they are allowed to go away, get authority to appoint a deputy before they leave the hospital and they appoint a deputy.  The position would be that if we were to send a superintendent abroad or to consent to his going abroad at perhaps some personal expense to himself, to a congress or to do a course of post-graduate study, or going on leave of absence, he would be deprived of all emoluments accruing to the office even though a deputy was functioning for him in the ordinary way.  And if he goes away for a week or so, he might have in the circumstances to appoint a deputy, willy nilly with the same consequences. I think it would be an impossible position.  If we were to apply this position to a coroner who is bound by law to appoint a deputy, and I am not suggesting that this Act would apply to him, the coroner, if Sir John Keane had his way, would not draw one penny in emoluments from the office.  I will not delay the House very much longer on this because there is some desire that we should dispose of the business a little earlier.  As I said on the Committee Stage, it would be impossible for us to enforce this and if we try to enforce it we should find ourselves in a state of great confusion.</P>

      <P>One thing seems to have been overlooked in this Bill. <Col N="628" /> If Section 8 is sufficiently adverted to it will be clearly seen that there is really no cause for this amendment.  I just rise to make this point because I feel that if this amendment was accepted it would deprive in certain circumstances officers of their right to receive full pay for the first six months of certified illness and debar them of their right to half-pay for the second six months of illness.  It seems to me that Sir John Keane has not adverted to the section as it stands and especially to sub-sections (1) to (4), and has not adverted sufficiently to the difficulties that would arise for officers in the case of illness if this amendment were accepted.</P>

      <P>On a matter of information I would like to know if the Minister has contemplated the position of deputies who might be in deputy-service for a considerable period, and does he contemplate that this deputy shall be considered all the time as a temporary officer?</P>

      <P>In the case of continuous service for three or four years, is there no emolument coming to him for recognised service or has he no right to become an established officer or to be elected, under the system as we know it at present, to a post within the particular service or within the particular area?  It is rather important in the case of deputies acting for two, three, five or ten years because they would be, at the end of that period, out of touch with the medical services and have no status with these services so far as local government is concerned, and no right to any established status for promotion or exchange to an established post somewhere else. Such a deputy must begin all over again like a lad coming out of college, except possibly for his experience. It is a phase of the question that strikes me and one, I think, that needs a little elucidation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me that this question of emoluments is one of considerable difficulty.  I see difficulty in passing this amendment as it is drafted but I am considerably concerned <Col N="629" /> by the attitude taken up by the Minister.  I can quite easily see that when a deputy is appointed for six or 12 months the Minister would not be very much concerned with the financial arrangement.  Those of us in business know perfectly well that for a temporary period you pay a deputy at a considerably higher rate than if you were paying a permanent appointment and rightly so, because there may be a period when the person has no appointment at all.  That may not apply, absolutely, to doctors but we are not dealing with doctors only here; we are dealing with every kind of case. Supposing a deputy is sanctioned for six months and then, by another Order, sanctioned for another six months and if it goes on in that way for 18 months or two years, I do think the Minister should know what the financial arrangements are.  From a business point of view if a deputy is being put in for six months, it is reasonable to assume that he should not be allowed to continue if he is being paid a smaller fee than is justified.  I can quite see the Minister's not wanting to be concerned when he is the Minister responsible, but from the public interest point of view I do not see why he should not be concerned. From the business point of view if an employer wants a substitute he expects to be able to discuss the position with the person who is going to do his work and to know what he is going to pay him. It might be that the person doing the work would get a little more, but certainly the employer and the other employees would expect that the position would be discussed, and that the employer would know the position.  In the case before the House the position is similar.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>This is not the Committee stage and certainly I do not want to turn it into a Committee stage, but surely in relation to this matter the mere fact that a deputy will continue to serve for a long period, for two and three years, is proof that the financial arrangements are satisfactory to him.  And being satisfactory to him the suggestion here, I think, is that they are satisfactory to him because his <Col N="630" /> qualifications are not satisfactory to anyone else.</P>
      <P>I have pointed out that the section requires that the Minister shall be satisfied, and if the Minister's qualifications are exacting enough then, as I again pointed out on the last day, the office holder who appoints the deputy is not likely to derive any profit from the appointment of that Deputy because he will have to satisfy his appointee in regard to the financial arrangement and will have to satisfy the Minister in regard to his professional qualifications and abilities, so that between the two very little grist will come to his mill.</P>
      <P>On the point that was raised by Senator Ó Shiochfhradha, the deputy is the employee of the office holder and there is no way out of that situation so far as I can see.  He will get no official recognition for his services in any way except this: that, naturally, if he has served in a post of this kind for a number of years he will be better qualified to get an independent post himself.  That is going to be part of his reward for that, but of course his financial remuneration is going to be his principal reward for his services.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>To conclude, I am quite satisfied, although I know that I will get nothing out of it, with the arguments I have made in support of my amendment.  I may say I was surprised that a man of the ability of Senator O'Dea, with his great experience of local affairs, could only bring out the case of a continuing contract as a justification of obtaining emoluments.  It is really rather laughable to picture the case of an architect, appointed by a local authority which sets on foot some public work, who has to appoint a deputy before he is paid his fees.  The <Col N="631" /> Senator pictures that, under my amendment, the architect would not be allowed to claim fees arising out of his contract although he had done a considerable amount of work.  Let us take the case of a solicitor to a local authority.  He incurs very considerable costs, but before they are collected he retires, or has occasion to appoint a deputy.  Is it suggested that he would not be permitted to draw the emoluments that he had earned?  The case is not comparable at all with the one that I made in support of my amendment.  I am surprised that Senator O'Dea could not find something better on which to oppose this amendment.</P>
      <P>I admit that lay persons, like myself, are in considerable difficulty in drafting amendments which do nothing more than set out a principle.  The Minister, in approaching the amendments, is skilfully advised, and points out all the pitfalls and difficulties in them.  He shelters himself in that way and evades the principle in them.  I labour under great difficulties in this matter.  In some Parliaments they have skilled officials to whom the members of Parliament can go for advice when preparing amendments.</P>
      <P>I must admit, in passing, that I get every assistance in drafting amendments if I go to the Clerk of the Seanad, but he would not claim to be skilled in drafting amendments.  In some Parliaments, as I say, they have legal officers who will give very efficient assistance to members of Parliament in drafting amendments.  We have no such assistance here.  All that I ever aim at, when drafting an amendment, is to set out the principle involved.  If it is a good one then, obviously, it would have to be put in form and harnessed to the working machine by the Parliamentary draftsman.  The Minister shelters himself in the way I have stated.  He is a skilful Parliamentarian, and by pleading all sorts of difficulties avoids the principle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The principle here is that the holder is going to hold office for several years, and that he can make a private financial arrangement with regard to his <Col N="632" /> emoluments with his deputy.  The Minister will know nothing about it. It is said that it would only create confusion, and that it is undesirable that he should.  That is a most unsatisfactory state of affairs.  I blame myself to this extent that I ought to have been more active on the Committee Stage. If we had these arguments on the Committee Stage, I might have been able to introduce not a more successful amendment but, perhaps, one that would have been a little more embarrassing for the Report Stage.  I shall try to show more foresight in the future.  I say that the Minister sees the principle as plainly as any of us, but he has deliberately evaded it and sheltered himself behind the difficulties. I do not propose to say anything further, and with the leave of the House I shall withdraw the amendment.</P>
