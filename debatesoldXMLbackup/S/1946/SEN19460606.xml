      <P>I think that, in considering this Bill, we might cast our minds back to what happened during the Second Reading discussion on the Principal Act of 1939.  It may be within the recollection of some members of the House that I had grave concern as to whether, except within very narrow limits, this tourist development holiday provision should be financed by the State.  I had the gratification, on that occasion, of obtaining, which is unusual for me, agreement on that general principle from the Minister.  He said&mdash;I am quoting from the Seanad Debates, volume 22, column 1914&mdash;in concluding the debate:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;When I concluded my remarks in introducing this measure, Senator Sir John Keane jumped up&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I do not know what the significance of &ldquo;jumped up&rdquo; is&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;to defend private enterprise against another attack from the <Col N="1984" /> totalitarian Minister.  I have joined issue with Senator Sir John Keane on many occasions in the past, on the comparative values of private enterprise and State enterprise, but we need not fear about it to-day, because on this occasion I am on the Senator's side.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I am very gratified about that.  The Minister went on:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I am all in favour of private enterprise in this matter of the development of our country.  I think if we are going to develop our holiday facilities here and take the greatest advantage from the opportunities that we have, we must really largely depend on private enterprise.  The Senator and myself, therefore, will be on the same side for the moment, because I share his views in that regard largely&mdash;much to his astonishment, no doubt.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister then went on to refer to certain matters, such as swimming pools, public conveniences, the stocking of rivers and the general supervision of hotels which, in his view, were proper matters for State action.  That was the position seven years ago. Owing to the war, the Tourist Board has been able to do very little since. Now, we are told that the Tourist Board intend to set up a subsidiary board, financed by public money, to establish and manage three luxury hotels.  I think that I am right in so describing them.  They are to charge something in the region of £10 10s. a week.  That represents a very wide departure from the principles upon which the Minister and myself were in agreement seven years ago.  The House had a right to expect a statement from the Minister regarding this very drastic departure from his original intentions.  Personally, I am against State enterprise in the matter of hotel management.  But, if it is to be conceded, can one imagine anything more dangerous or more hazardous than to embark public money on luxury hotels?  Surely, it is a commonsense to realise that that is the most speculative class of hotel business.  If you were catering for tourists of more moderate means, the risks would be far fewer, because there is a far larger <Col N="1985" /> volume of custom of that class offering. It is very doubtful whether the country will continue to attract visitors&mdash;it will, I think, be largely visitors who will be concerned&mdash;who will be prepared to pay in the region of £10 10s. a week for hotel accommodation. The circumstances of the present time are no indication of future probabilities in that regard.</P>
    <P>I consider it highly speculative to invest money in hotels of this character.  I take it that the Minister must know what is going on.  Has the advice of any experienced hotel managers been taken on this proposition? It would strike me, and I think a number of Senators present, that if one were going to embark on business of this kind, one would go to somebody of experience for advice.  We have a number of experienced hotel people, people who have made a success of the better-class hotel business.  Has the Tourist Board said to those people: &ldquo;Would you be prepared to take over the management of a few of those hotels which the board has in view, the board providing the money&rdquo;?  That would be a business-like approach. You would then commence with somebody of proved experience to handle the proposition.  So far as I understand, this proposal came out of the blue.  I do not think that the board would claim experience of all the details and technicalities of hotel management.  Yet they are about to embark on this hazardous form of enterprise, with the future most uncertain and with present conditions no indication of what is likely to happen when the Continent is open to normal holiday visitors of the richer type.  It is to me incomprehensible that the Minister, holding the views he did in 1939, should now be prepared to sanction a speculation of this kind. Surely, if the State is to embark in this business, it would be much more prudent to proceed on the lines of the smaller trust hotels.  It would be possible to go to well-established trust houses elsewhere and ask if they would consider financing an Irish company, financed with Irish capital and under Irish management, which would have their experience at its disposal.  That <Col N="1986" /> would be a modest venture and it would stand the test of time, because it would cater for the customer of moderate means.  As Senator Hayes rightly said, hotel management is a very personal business.  It is essentially a question of connection.  You cannot establish a hotel to attract visitors as you would establish a factory to make commodities.  There are all sorts of social inhibitions in regard to hotels.  Some people will not go to one class of hotel and others will not go to another class.  Hotel business is built up by experience and by the managers having connections.  None of these conditions seems to apply in this case. This seems to be the wildest conceivable scheme for the investment of public moneys.  I hope the Minister will give us some convincing reasons as to why a venture of this kind is to be undertaken.  I think that the Minister should give us reasons, too, why he has executed a <i>volte face</i> in regard to the principles he laid down in the Principal Bill when it was passing through the Oireachtas.</P>

    <P>The value of the tourist industry has been stressed by all the Senators who have taken part in the debate so far. For myself, I am in complete agreement with the proposal to develop the industry.  It is one that must, if properly organised, bring in its train very great advantages to the country. I do not intend to go in detail into the advantages as I see them.  Other Senators have dealt with them in detail but it may be no harm just to remind ourselves what these advantages are. If the tourist industry is developed on the lines on which I believe the board intends to develop it, it must necessarily follow that there will be considerable expansion in trade, in commerce and in industry.  It must necessarily follow that there will be considerable expansion in the national income&mdash;something that is certainly highly desirable.  It must follow also that there will be a considerable amount of new employment of a very useful and a very valuable kind.  It must follow also that the nation will be given a series of new and very valuable public amenities.  One would like to take time to enter into a discussion of all these things but their importance is quite obvious as there was some discussion of them and there is no need to labour them.  It will give us&mdash;I think the Minister referred to this matter yesterday&mdash;an opportunity of getting foreign currency.  To an extent, I hope it will help to relieve our dependence on one particular market. That is an objective that I think we should be anxious to promote, something we should like to see achieved. We value the market we have but I, for my part, think that it is not in <Col N="1988" /> the best interests of the nation that all our eggs should be in the one basket. I would be particularly anxious to avail of any opportunity that would enable us to get directly a reasonable amount of foreign currency.  If the industry is developed, as I believe it is going to be developed, then valuable strides will be made in that direction.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made, and rightly so, to the great value of travel. Irishmen are often reminded that they should travel.  It has often been said that, &ldquo;He knows not Ireland who only Ireland knows.&rdquo;  That may be an exaggeration but certainly those who have travelled, those who have visited other nations and other peoples, have come home generally speaking very much more national in their views and in their outlook than many of those who never leave our shores at all. Travel has its advantages for all and I believe that, so far as foreigners are concerned, there will be a considerable advantage to them in coming to this. country.  For that reason, we should be glad to have them.  The country has a great deal to offer, not alone in its scenery, in its food and in other services but culturally.  There is a great deal to be gained by people who will come and see what this country has to offer, its culture, its historical ruins and mementoes, its life and so on. I was particularly glad that I was in for the Minister's speech.  The Bill itself is a very short one, but it was well worth being in time to hear the Minister's speech.  Those of us who are particularly interested in the Irish language are very grateful to him for the information that he gave us with regard to the intentions of the board to develop Gaeltacht areas, as far as that may be in their power.  The board are to be thanked for what they have done for the Garryvoe scheme.  I am particularly glad to learn that the board is undertaking to take over and to renovate Ardmore College.  When that college is reopened and worked, as I think it should be worked and as I believe it will be worked, it seems to me that another area will be soon won back to the Fior Gaeltacht area of the country.  Perhaps, however, the Minister would give us some indication, <Col N="1989" /> presently, whether, if people come forward in other Gaeltacht areas, formulate reasonable schemes, and are anxious to erect new buildings, establish new colleges or new centres for the promotion of the language and cultural activities generally, the board will be in a position to aid them.  More than once I have appealed to organisations like the Gaelic League and Muintir na Tíre to take over in every county at least one or two of the mansions that are now derelict and convert them into colleges to which, every year, boys might be taken for instruction during a short intensive course in agriculture, horticulture and kindred subjects.  During another period girls might be taken there for instruction in butter-making and poultry rearing and such other activities as might interest them.</P>

      <P>I am anxious to get information on this point.  It is the intention of the board, as indicated by the Minister, to provide facilities in certain areas for the promotion of the Irish language.  I am not sure&mdash;but I would be very glad if it could be done &mdash;whether buildings may be taken over in different parts of the country to which boys and girls would be taken on holiday and at the same time given these courses here mentioned.  It may interest the Senator to know that in various parts of the country schemes of a similar kind are already in operation. Children are taken, ostensibly on holiday&mdash;it is, in effect a holiday&mdash;but with the holiday is combined a certain amount of valuable education.  Whether the board is free to give aid to activities of that kind I do not know.  I am anxious to know because I do not like to be hitting my head on a stone wall. If financial and other help of that type is not available from that source then <Col N="1990" /> I will not trouble to go on looking for it and arguing about the matter.  I will seek it in some other direction. That is why I raise the matter here and I hope I am in order in doing so. With regard to the activities of the board, I think it is only fair it should be acknowledged that throughout the country there has been in recent years a considerable improvement in hotel standards.  I do not use hotels to a very great extent but in those that I have occasion to visit and stay in I have found that, compared with pre-war standards, there is now a decided improvement. One meets people who do a great deal of travelling and I think on all sides there is the ready admission that a great deal has been achieved.  I believe that what has been achieved has been due to the activities of An Bórd Cuartaíochta.  Of course more might be done.  These improvements might be more widespread but when one considers that this work was started only at the beginning of the war and when one considers the difficulties of the period since then the achievement is all the greater.  Now that the era of peace has come I believe that developments will be very much greater and the position very much more satisfactory within a short time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of points raised in the course of the debate caused me some surprise.  One was to learn that there exists, or seems to exist, a conflict between the board and the hotel keepers.  I wonder to what extent that conflict exists and to what extent there is a lack of co-operation between the board and the hotel keepers.  I wonder whether the whole thing is not exaggerated. Thinking over it, I can quite understand that some hotel keepers must have been annoyed when standards were fixed and they were literally compelled to conform to those standards.  I can quite understand people like that being disgruntled, but I wonder to what extent there is a widespread conflict between the board and the hotel keepers.  Certainly it does not give me any satisfaction to think that there should be any considerable disagreement between them and we ought to have the fullest information about it.  It seems <Col N="1991" /> that the board has been given the power and the right to authorise the use of the word &ldquo;hotel.&rdquo;  I can quite understand many people being dissatisfied over that.  It is, I think, only a number of people who are annoyed because they are forced to conform to the board's standards and it is, I expect, this limited number of people who are annoyed because they had to drop the word &ldquo;hotel&rdquo; when they failed to conform to these standards.</P>
    <P>I cannot help thinking that the question of the luxury hotels has been over-emphasised.  I wonder what people who talk about such hotels have in mind.  Yesterday evening I tried to visualise what a luxury hotel is or is likely to be.  I have been in different hotels in Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Galway.  They are excellently run hotels, well furnished, well kept, with excellent service, good carpets and linoleum on the floors and so on.  Are these luxury hotels?  In what respect will any other hotel differ from them? Perhaps somebody would indicate to me what exactly is meant by the term &ldquo;luxury hotel&rdquo;?  Is it a matter of the price?  In hotels the situation will be important and the cost of the service will be important.  The tariffs will have to be according to the advantages and services, but I cannot make out from the discussion so far whether it is the charge that indicates a hotel is a luxury hotel or not.  The term is not clear.</P>
    <P>I can quite understand, watching the activities of the board, that there will be two types of hotels.  There will be first-class hotels in cities like Galway, Cork, Limerick and Dublin and there will be hotels of the type of those about to be set up in Ballinahinch and down in Termonfeckin.  In what respect will these hotels be different from any other?  I hope they will give as good a service&mdash;and I expect they will&mdash;as other hotels; that they will be as clean and that their floors may be carpeted as in the case of the city hotels.  Attached to these hotels will be domains or extensive grounds.  I expect it is the intention <Col N="1992" /> of the board to retain as much land as they can at these hotels, woodlands and gardens, etc.  If that is what is meant by luxury hotels then, so far as I am concerned, I am all in favour of them.  I hope the board will see to it that whatever lands they get control of with these hotels they will maintain them at least in as good order as they got them.</P>
    <P>This question of luxury hotels reminds me of the discussion we had yesterday evening about the tyranny that might arise through the handing over of hotels like these to An Bórd Cuartaíochta.  I know a large hotel in County Galway and I suppose, by such standards as I have been able to fix in my mind arising out of the discussion, it would be described as a luxury hotel. For years I have been going in and out of that place, for a long time indeed before the place became a hotel because there are a number of things around it that are of great interest.  I have been there very often as I say and have taken friends there.  Since it became a hotel I have visited it very often, too.  However, when I arrived there a few weeks ago I found that the gate was closed.  When I went to open it a keeper came along to demand that I pay a tax or admission fee of 1/- not alone for myself, but 1/- also for each person in my party.  There was no refund of the fee and naturally I thought it very unfair.  I may mention that very fortunately the historic buildings near this hotel and estate still remain under the guardianship of the Board of Works. We will have no tax to pay in going in there.  I am not, however, going to find fault with the people who levied that charge at the gate.  They want to maintain their gardens and woodlands as they got them and they are a very important amenity which contribute very much to the value of that hotel.  If they feel that damage was being done by opening the place to all and sundry then they are entitled to take some steps to see that damage will be checked.  Whether to demand 1/- from each person going in is the right way or the best way or not I do not know, but I have to admit that they have a right to protect their property. <Col N="1993" /> This is a private hotel but I can quite understand that if it were under the management of An Bórd Cuartaíochta and that it were to levy a charge on people going in, before they would get any service whatever, there would be a great outcry in the country.  No protest against an action of that kind is considered necessary when it is done by a private company.</P>
    <P>Another point that caused me a certain amount of surprise was the discussion on the memorandum of An Bórd Cuartaíochta.  I have not seen the memorandum or articles of the company and was not ready to jot down the items when Senator Sweetman detailed them in the House yesterday. There was a considerable amount of objection to the board undertaking an activity such as hairdressing&mdash;that was adverted to a great deal.  I think the point is exaggerated.  One can visualise hotels in the city where in the interest of their patrons they provide a hairdressing apartment, and surely if a hotel is to be established in the country, say at Termonfeckin, or away at Ballinahinch in the heart of Connemara, or anywhere else for that matter, there is nothing wrong in the board seeking power to provide a service of that kind or any other kind that is necessary for the proper working of the business.  It may be said that the difference is that An Bórd Cuartaíochta is a semi-State institution and, therefore, should be very severely curtailed. I fail to follow that argument.  When a company is being founded the solicitor who is approached to draw up the articles of association and set down the objects of the company usually casts the net as wide as possible.  There are very good legal reasons for doing so&mdash; it avoids difficulties.  Because a company happens to have certain finances from the State, because the board itself is partly or <i>in toto</i> nominated by the State, should it be deprived of powers of that kind?  Should we put it in a different position from an ordinary company?  In other words, because it is a State company should it be handicapped? It does not seem to me that it would be reasonable to do so.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to the advisability of the board paying attention <Col N="1994" /> to the provision of hostels and accommodation generally for workers. That is something with which we all heartily agree.  There are few things which give me greater satisfaction than to think that at long last workers are entitled by law to a holiday with pay.  There is nothing would ever give me greater satisfaction than to see industry and trade unionism organised to such an extent that the workers' holiday would be not only a week but as long as it is possible to give them.  At the same time I do not think we need look forward to any very sudden expansion of the demand for accommodation on the part of workers in holiday resorts.  Those people who will take their children to resorts of that kind are taking them there already and have been taking them for some time.  The new people who will be coming into the ranks of holiday-makers will be very glad to avail of the holidays to visit their parents and their grand-parents, whether they be in town or country.  It will be some time before there is any great need for provision of the kind that was stressed here yesterday.  Even so, it is time we began to think about it.  I do not know whether those interested in trade unions are aware that a fair amount of attention has been paid already to the matter by the League of Nations. Before the war a considerable amount of material had been published and in countries like Belgium a good deal of attention had been paid to the problem and schemes had been developed and put into operation.  It is well worth our while taking up the matter now and those interested in trade unions and in the workers should acquaint themselves with what has been done and see to what extent it might be adapted or developed here.  It is very pleasant to find that we are now in a position to talk about the necessity for getting an examination made of the possibility of suitable provision for workers in seaside and other health resorts.</P>
    <P>Reference was made yesterday to the indifference of the Minister for Education to the training of workers for this industry.  I think that reference was uncalled for.  Anyone who is familiar <Col N="1995" /> with the organisation of the vocational education system, with the curricula of those schools, cannot fail to be impressed by the amount of attention paid to this particular aspect of training. Not alone here in the City of Dublin but in other parts of the country, boys and girls are trained to take up positions as chefs and waitresses and many of them have already gone into employment throughout the country.  I have the pleasant experience in the hotel which I most frequent, in Dublin, that I am able now to do my business through Irish with waiters who have come out of Dublin Technical Schools.  These young people are very happy, very pleased and very proud to be able to do their business in Irish.</P>
    <P>All over the country, it is an important part of the schemes of the vocational education committees to see that girls are trained to fit them for hotel service.  I need not refer to what has been done in Cathal Brugha Street, but those interested in this matter will find that the Minister for Education has certainly not been remiss in doing whatever his Department could do to provide much of the personnel for this industry.</P>
    <P>There is just one other matter in conclusion.  Reference was made to the title that is contemplated for the company which it is proposed should run the hotels.  A certain amount of play has been made of the title itself, &ldquo;Failte, Teoranta.&rdquo;  I think the comment in question is uncalled for.  There is nothing wrong in that title.</P>

      <P>I want to compliment the Minister on the policy of insisting that the names of these companies should be in Irish.  These names may seem strange to people who are not using the Irish language frequently. It would not occur to me that there is anything strange about it.  The title conjures up for me immediately a company &ldquo;Incorporated by Law.&rdquo;  The idea of &ldquo;Teoranta&rdquo; is that the company <Col N="1996" /> has a registered capital, that it is a limited liability company, no more and no less than that.</P>
      <P>One might regard &ldquo;Solus, Teoranta&rdquo; as silly also, or feel that &ldquo;Mianrai, Teoranta&rdquo; is silly, but not so silly when one comes to think of it.  You do not think that &ldquo;Stationery Supplies Ltd.,&rdquo; is silly or that &ldquo;Corrib Hosiery Limited,&rdquo; is silly.</P>

      <P>I could suggest &ldquo;Failteoiri, Teoranta&rdquo; and there would not be anything wrong about it, but I am not suggesting it.  I think &ldquo;Failteoiri, Teoranta&rdquo; is good but no better than &ldquo;Failte, Teoranta.&rdquo;  Irish is growing up, and there is no cause for dissatisfaction over this title at all.  That is all I have to say on the Bill, except this, that if the new Tourist Board achieve even half of what it appears to me it will achieve, it will have done a great deal for this country.</P>

      <P>Fortunately or unfortunately, I have not been listening to the whole of this debate because circumstances over which I had no control took me away for some hours last evening, and, therefore, I can only glean what I have heard from Senator Sir John Keane and Senator Ó Buachalla the line along which the discussion has proceeded.  It appears to me that the real difficulty in which Senator Sir John Keane finds himself deserted to some extent by the Minister, is that, apparently, he gathered from the Official Debates that they had a very warm flirtation in 1939 when they both agreed that private enterprise must develop the country.  I do not know whether the Senator was unjust to the Minister in suggesting, as he seemed to <Col N="1997" /> suggest, that private enterprise would be used to develop the country and that State enterprise would be used only to destroy it.</P>
      <P>I do not think the Minister agreed with that suggestion which appears to be running through what Senator Sir John Keane has said to-day. What I feel, however, is this: the speech we have just listened to, when Senator Ó Buachalla appeared to be replying for the Government, seems to me to cause us to ask ourselves some questions as to the purposes of this Bill and the objects which a tourist policy should pursue.</P>
      <P>Until I listened to the speech which has just been delivered, I understood that the policy was set out in the White Paper which was published in March with the title &ldquo;Tourist Development Programme.&rdquo;  I understood that the policy was that of the Government, as it was issued by the Government, and it appeared to me to be an outline of what was intended.  That does not seem to fit in with what we have listened to now.  I notice that in opening his speech, Senator Ó Buachalla laid particular stress on the material advantages. He stressed the material value of the tourist industry, and that made me reflect.</P>
      <P>I have here an actual complaint from the County of Galway as to the lack of information as to what is the purpose, and the ultimate end of the development of, shall I say, tourism, on the lines which seem to be devised. Some people are inclined, even in County Galway, to contrast spiritual values with material values, and two priests&mdash;one is now dead and the other is still a revered parish priest in County Galway&mdash;expressed to me grave doubts from the point of view of spiritual welfare and from the point of view of Gaelic Ireland, about an expansion of the tourist industry in such a way that people with plenty of money would be attracted to Ireland in large numbers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I put that view as a matter for serious consideration.  It is not referred to in the White Paper, and apparently is not a matter on which the Government has reflected at all.  I take it the Government must accept full responsibility <Col N="1998" /> for the policy in this White Paper, because I noticed that in evidence in the Circuit Court yesterday, an official of the Tourist Board swore on oath that what he was doing was being done on the instructions of the Department of Industry and Commerce, so that we are safe in assuming that the policy being pursued is the policy laid down by the Government, and is not policy devised on their own initiative by the board, and they have not got a free hand to devise policy.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I draw attention to the fact that while we do recognise that a tourist industry can be a medium of bringing currency, as the Senator mentioned a moment ago, to this country, it does not begin and end there because there are other values to be considered.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator forgets that there is anything else to be said about foreign balances.  On that point alone, I would suggest to him that it is not of the slightest use to us to bring thousands of visitors from Britain because that merely brings in sterling to this country, a currency of which we have far more than we can use, or are likely to use in the next 20 years.  I want to point out that I have the sworn testimony of the Assistant Secretary of the Irish Tourist Board that the visitors that are being attracted by the board are, in the main, British visitors.  Here is a statement of his which appeared in the <i>Evening Herald</i> last Friday. He said there was &ldquo;a tremendous demand for hotel accommodation in Ireland particularly from Great Britain.&rdquo;  I take it that that is the position: that the bulk of the visitors coming here are being attracted mainly from Britain.  Let us not kid ourselves that that is going to make this country one penny richer.  If we export butter, bacon and cattle we will get sterling for them just as well as we can get it if we bring in British visitors and feed them with butter, bacon and eggs.  We ought not to exaggerate that aspect of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The advantage to this country, <Col N="1999" /> economically, will depend on the amount of what I think, in another connection, the Minister called hard currencies that we can get from visitors.  In other words, the material advantage lies in getting visitors from America, Canada, Switzerland, and from other countries that do not use sterling, visitors who will pay us in their own currencies.  Actually, we have not been handling much of these foreign currencies during the period when thousands of people belonging to the armed forces of America and Canada were in this country.  They came here with sterling.  Only a very small number of them arrived here with dollars.  I am just wondering now when we listen to this discussion on the great value of tourism&mdash;I hate this word but we all know what it conveys&mdash;and when we hear so much praise of what is involved in it I am just wondering whether we have all forgotten that there was a lot of anxiety in this city for several months owing to the invasion of Dublin by a number of people who were visitors to our shores.  May I say that this is not confined to Ireland? It is not merely a narrow Irish view.  A lady who is a friend of mine, a very popular writer in English, one of the best paid women writers in London, wrote an article some time ago for an American magazine, the title of which will convey its meaning.  The title was &ldquo;Our girls do not like your boys&rdquo;.  The Americans were willing to publish it, but the British Government would not permit it to be published because it would interfere with the inflow of dollars into Britain.  Is that our policy?  That is the line that is recommended to us now by Senator Ó Buachalla.  I want this matter examined.  I suggest that the members of this House should seriously examine it, and see what is involved. I am suggesting seriously that there is much more involved than dollars.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make clear what follows from mine.  One of the things that I want to draw attention to is this, that in the White Paper it is indicated, at the top of page 4, what the purpose of this board is to be.  It states:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The 1939 Act provided for the establishment of a board styled the Irish Tourist Board, with wide powers to extend and develop accommodation and other amenities for holiday-makers from at home or abroad.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Now, already reference has been made to the hotels that have been established. Senator Sir John Keane talked of them on the basis of ten guineas a week.  But that is an understatement, because, in giving evidence yesterday before Judge Shannon, the assistant secretary of the Irish Tourist Board said: &ldquo;It was proposed to charge 12 guineas weekly in August, ten guineas in September and seven guineas for the rest of the year.&rdquo;  So that it could be 12 guineas a week in the posh hotels during the month of August, and that in a country where men are restricted to £2 a week as farm labourers.  Surely &ldquo;the amenities for holiday-makers from at home or abroad&rdquo; to be provided in the posh hotels established by the board, are not intended for our farm labourers on their £2 a week?  If the board were to establish holiday camps to provide accommodation for tradesmen, for clerks, for shops assistants and for farm labourers at from 30/- to 35/- a week, then I would say that we should hail that as a great achievement, as an indication of what I would regard as the correct development of the functions of the Tourist Board; but I cannot develop any interest whatever in the establishment of posh hotels for British millionaires to come over here at a cost of 12 guineas a week.  I have not the slightest interest in that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to say that I have talked to people in other centres in which this <Col N="2001" /> thing called tourism has been developed, that is the expensive end of it, and I have found that there is, almost invariably, hostility amongst local people against the influences introduced into particular localities by these wealthy sections.  That is as true of Gleneagles as it is of holiday centres in Switzerland or holiday centres in Great Britain.  If you want to find out what the Isle of Man thinks of the flocking of trippers there in the summer, talk to one of the ordinary natives who is a member of the local council, and ask him what he thinks of all this, and you will find that he is horrified at its influence on social life in the Isle of Man, and particularly in Douglas.  It is a rather strange thing that there was not the slightest evidence that Switzerland desired to bring U.N.O. to Geneva.  The local people in Geneva have a feeling that they would be better off, at least spiritually, if the League of Nations had never established itself there with its wealthy personnel.  I have the same view, generally speaking, of the invasion of this country by wealthy holiday-makers. I do urge on the Minister that, if paid holidays are to be extended, if it is to become the general rule for wage-earners to have a week's holidays or two weeks' holidays at a time, there is an obligation on the Government, either themselves or by leadership of some kind, to encourage a plan for the utilisation of those holidays. Take the farm labourer in County Dublin down to Waterford or the Connemara Gaeltacht, if you like. Make it possible for him and, perhaps, his family, to live there during his holidays. Take the people at Navan and Kells to the seaside around Drogheda or at Portmarnock.  That is the kind of thing we should encourage when we are considering the provision under this Bill of £650,000.</P>
    <P>There is one other aspect of the matter to which I think I should refer. A number of complaints have reached me regarding the conditions under which the clerical and executive staffs are employed, particularly in the &ldquo;posh&rdquo; hotels.  So far as Dublin and County Dublin are concerned, and I think other areas, there is protection <Col N="2002" /> for the kitchen staff and for waiters and waitresses&mdash;either trade union protection or protection provided by law&mdash; but that does not extend to the office staffs.  Last week, I received a number of letters of complaint.  I should like to draw the attention of the Minister to what is said in a few of them.  A lady writes regarding her experience in a Dublin City hotel.  If the Minister is interested, I shall tell him the name of the hotel.  This lady has experience of three other hotels.  She says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The aim of the Government is to provide good food and a hearty welcome for the weary travellers from the war-worn countries but they overlook the fact that, if present conditions continue, these visitors are in danger during the coming season of being greeted by veterans even more weary, who wield not the sword but the pen.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>She is a romantic young lady and she has been listening to romantic people in a city hotel.  Another lady employed as a receptionist in a County Dublin hotel&mdash;not 20 miles from the city&mdash; which charges ten guineas or 12 guineas, I think, a week, writes:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;When so much is done to decorate and improve hotels from the visitors' point of view it is lamentable that so little thought is given to the welfare of the clerical employees. Apparently, we have no legislation governing the working hours or the working conditions of the clerical and official staffs on whose efficiency the comfort and happiness of the visitors depend.  In most cases, the hotel office opens between 7 a.m. and 8 a.m.  It remains open until 11 p.m. and, except for a short break in the afternoon, the office staff are on duty the whole of this time.  The afternoon break is about four hours.  This is considered to be a liberal time off in a 16-hour day! The futility of broken duty, in any event, is only realised by those who suffer its inconvenience. I am told that the guests who have queried staff conditions in this hotel were told that the clerical staff have one free day in the week, plus additional salary for Sunday duty.  That is entirely <Col N="2003" /> untrue.  We girls work from 7-7.30 in the morning until 11 p.m. on the seven days of the week, except for the afternoon break I already mentioned. We get no extra pay for Sunday duty.  In fact, I am ashamed to mention the salary I am paid after ten years' experience.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>A gentleman who knows the City of Dublin quite well and who has no contact with hotel life in Dublin sent me a note two days ago from which I made this extract:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In the &mdash;&mdash; Hotel, Dublin, the clerical and official staffs start work at 7.30 a.m.  They are on duty until 4 p.m. when they get off for three hours.  During this break, they must have tea and supper.  They resume at 7 p.m. and remain on duty until 11.30. If there is a late dance, they must continue on duty until they have balanced their cash and books.  Very often this means that they are working until 3 a.m. but, all the same, they have got to resume again next morning at 7.30.  There is no extra pay for this and no time off is allowed.  Apparently, there is no law dealing with hours or half-holidays for these unfortunate girls.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is Dublin.  I have recent experience of two or three other important centres.  As this Bill was coming before the House this week, I made it my business to find out what I could in regard to the conditions of the office staffs in provincial towns.  I found them deplorable.  A half-holiday in some cases was provided for, but the girl could not take the half-holiday if her services were required in the office. In all cases, they had to commence work before 8 o'clock and in very few cases were they finished before 12 midnight. The wages were from 15/- to 25/-.  I saw an advertisement in one of the Dublin papers last week for a manageress for a first-class hotel at 25/- a week.  Under the Act, the Tourist Board sends its inspectors to the hotels. They examine them and decide whether the hotel is entitled to be so called or not.  Apparently, they inquire if the beds are clean and all right, if the sanitary accommodation is all right and <Col N="2004" /> what the food is like.  There the inspection stops.  It is no part of the inspector's business, evidently, to inquire whether the hotels are engaged in white slave traffic.  Some of them are.  What W.T. Stead said on one occasion about London drapery houses might be said about some of the hotels&mdash;they are the ante-chambers of hell.  When £650,000 is being provided for the Tourist Board, I suggest that there is a duty on us to see that the staffs employed in those hotels are not employed under degrading and dangerous conditions.  I do not suggest that anything can be done by this House in relation to this matter on the Bill before us.  It is a Money Bill and we cannot interfere with it but we can at least insist that the Government in providing this money will make it clear that they expect the Tourist Board to look after the health and the morals of hotel staffs as well as the physical cleanliness of the hotel bedrooms.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HelenaConcannon" hpid="Mrs. Concannon Mrs. Concannon">

      <P>This Bill invites the Oireachtas to authorise the Minister for Finance on the recommendation of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, to provide £1,250,000 for the advancement of tourist and holiday traffic.  It is quite right and proper then that we should give some indication of our views as to how this money should be spent.  It is fitting that this advice should be given in two ways&mdash;by way of criticism of past action or inaction and by way of suggestions for future policy.  With regard to the past, we must remember that the board started with at least two very grave disadvantages. The first in my opinion was fundamental&mdash;they had not a woman on the board.  It is one of those aspects of life in which woman's experience and gifts, since she began to put humanity on the road to civilisation&mdash; and it was woman who did it&mdash;could be very well utilised, in the particular functions which the Tourist Board was called upon to fulfil.  It is largely a matter of house-keeping, of developing amenities.  I think that we know quite well that there are several women who would have the proper outlook, experience and ability to help in that direction&mdash;I do not mean to say people <Col N="2005" /> who are qualified only from the hotel-keeper's point of view.  You need very much more than that.  You want people with a national outlook, people who have a good business experience.  They must have experience of the Ireland to which we want to invite people from outside and, much more, the Ireland in which we want to live ourselves. The Tourist Board can contribute to make this Ireland and if it does the money which is now being provided will be well spent.</P>
      <P>A great deal of criticism has been directed to the suggestion that the money is being devoted by the board to the provision of luxury hotels.  I am not a great lover of luxury hotels. They frighten the life out of me.  One look at the commissionaire at the door and I think I would rather spend half a week in Lough Derg than in one of them but, then, I am not everyone. There are people who like to stay in such places&mdash;people on their honeymoon and people who like to have a glance at this type of life for some short period&mdash;and we should provide for them.  I do not think there is anything wrong in the board devoting some of its funds to the provision of such hotels, especially when the hotels are associated with opportunities for sport, are near famous golf links or are situated in areas which provide fishing and shooting facilities.  If it is not overdone, a few such hotels are all right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the same time I believe with Senator Campbell and others that what we really must cater for mostly are our own people who cannot afford, and who do not want, luxury hotels.  We have increased the number of people who are now given holidays with pay but these people are not able to afford luxury hotels.  We find a number of such people coming to Galway, for instance. The sort of hotel they like is the simple hotel with very clearly defined attractions. They want good plain food, properly cooked, good beds, clean and comfortable; they want good fires even in summer time.  They want a welcome and they want efficient service.  In my opinion, the Tourist Board should help, in an advisory capacity, private enterprise to provide such hotels.  I think that now that the initial work <Col N="2006" /> has been got over&mdash;they have seen that a certain minimum of sanitary requirements is provided before a hotel can call itself a hotel and that other essentials are secured&mdash;they could act as advisers to hotel keepers and help them out of their difficulties.</P>
    <P>The difficulties of the small hotel keeper are largely a matter of catering. Certain things have been suggested to me in relation to the requirements of Galway hotels.  There might be for instance a sort of catering season and it might be possible to arrange for an extension of rations for hotels during the holiday season when there is a great demand on the hotels, and perhaps a diminution of rations during the rest of the year.  Then there is the question of fuel.  I think it would be a very good idea for the board, having consulted with the small hotel keepers, to press the Government to treat the hotel industry as an industry and to see that some of the machine-won turf is made available for the small hotels. I think that is really very necessary.</P>
    <P>The next difficulty with which the small hotel keeper has to contend&mdash;and it is the small hotels in which I am interested&mdash;is the question of provision of staff.  I am glad to see that both the Minister for Education and the Tourist Board have made a start in Courtown in the way of training young people for running these hotels.  This college type of training is not exactly satisfactory but once the Tourist Board have got the hotels running, there might be a system of apprenticeship at such hotels. I think it would be a very fruitful idea for the class of hotels most of us have in mind.</P>
    <P>The hotel industry offers great possibilities. I myself know Donegal very well and it has been famous, as long as I can remember, for its small, comfortably run hotels.  If I might indulge in some personal reminiscences, my own family ran such an hotel.  We never made much money out of it but we got a good living and we got a great kick out of it.  The management of this sort of homely hotel offers a very interesting career for a girl.  We made people welcome and we supplied them with good plainly cooked food. If women were trained in this work, it <Col N="2007" /> would be much better than training them for some of the professions.  For that reason, I welcome the Bill.  If the Tourist Development Board had a woman on it it could fulfil its functions in an ideal way.  I commend that idea to the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>During the course of the discussion on the Bill yesterday Senator Hayes twitted Senator Summerfield with not having read the Bill. I think Senator Summerfield's speech did convey that his remarks were related to the Act of 1939 rather than to the Bill before the House.  I feel sure, however, that Senator Hayes would not have risked twitting Senator Summerfield in that manner if he had not read the Bill himself and that, therefore, when he purported to tell Senator Summerfield what was in the Bill, he was consciously misleading him.  Senator Hayes said that the Bill is a Bill to give more money to the board.</P>
      <P>I say that is misrepresentation of what is in the Bill but it is misinterpretation which quite obviously has influenced a number of speeches made during this debate.  The Bill is not a Bill to give more money to the board. It is a Bill which authorises the Government to make repayable advances to the board to finance approved schemes of a profit-making character to a greater aggregate amount than was authorised by the Act of 1939.</P>
      <P>The fundamental difference between the provisions of the Bill, as I have described them, and the misinterpretation of the Bill for which Senator Hayes was responsible has I think been the explanation of the fact that this debate has in the main been irrelevant. I am not suggesting that in the form of criticism of the conduct of the debate but to suggest that it got going in the wrong direction in the beginning, largely due to Senator Hayes, and continued in the wrong direction to the end.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Neither did I, previously. In this Bill there is no provision for grants of any kind to anybody. Senator Madden who talked about the taxpayers' money being devoted to the purposes of the Irish Tourist Board was equally misinformed as to the provisions of this Bill or of the main Act which this Bill amends. His suggestion that the money should be spent on various public amenities which should properly be provided by local authorities indicated that he also misunderstood the circumstances under which this money will be advanced and the purposes for which it can be used.</P>
      <P>I endeavoured to make it clear to the House in introducing the Bill that no money can be given to the board under the 1939 Act until the board certifies that the scheme for which it requires the advance is one that will make a profit.  Clearly, that restriction on the scope of the board's work precludes them from considering many of the matters which were suggested here. The board is obliged to prepare schemes which will ultimately yield it a profit and enable it to pay to the Exchequer the money advanced to it from the Exchequer.  The bulk of the money which will be advanced under this Bill will go for resort development schemes.  Not one Senator in the whole course of the debate referred to resort development schemes.  More than 80 per cent. of the total amount mentioned here will be expended on such schemes and not a single Senator thought it worth his while to refer to that.  They attached much greater importance to a minor and temporary activity in which the board is now engaged in regard to hotels.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly, I am quite prepared to do it.  I gave these examples yesterday.  Perhaps the Senator was not here.  If he was here <Col N="2009" /> he must not have paid much attention to what I was saying.  I gave a list of schemes which the board is planning and for which advances will be made from the Exchequer.</P>
      <P>One of the primary purposes for which the board was set up is to develop our holiday resorts.  Our holiday resorts even though they may offer exceptional advantages of scenery or unrivalled beaches in so far as our seaside resorts are concerned or facilities for fishing, shooting or other holiday recreations, have never been properly developed.  There is perhaps a historic cause for that.  In the past holidays were the prerogative of the rich, and the rich in this country were mainly of alien extraction and preferred to spend their holidays outside the country.  The normal development of holiday resorts which took place in other countries did not take place here.  We must try to make good that deficiency in our national equipment by developing facilities at these resorts, to make them more accessible to our people and their use more enjoyable to our people.  That is the primary intention of the board and the main purpose for which the money will be provided.</P>
      <P>I gave here yesterday a list of the areas for which the board is preparing schemes.  It could prepare a much longer list of more elaborate schemes for holiday resorts if it was administering Government grants, but it is not administering Government grants. The board must confine itself to schemes which will make a profit for it.  If Senator Sir John Keane wants an example I will give it to him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The board is acquiring an estate and house at Portmarnock.  Portmarnock is a seaside resort adjacent to Dublin. For many years, however, it has been almost inaccessible to the people of Dublin, first because private individuals owned a large amount of the land there and closed the land to people who might otherwise have access to it; secondly because road and other facilities which would enable the people to reach the strand and enjoy the amenities of the seaside there were not available. The board is going to make them available.  It will develop that area by <Col N="2010" /> the construction of roads, parks, shelters, bandstands and all the other amenities or facilities people would require to enjoy a holiday resort.  Having done that, it will expect to increase the value of the land it bought and having increased the value of the land by these development works it will proceed to sell or lease the land to people who will erect cinemas, restauraunts, hotels or other buildings from which, through private enterprise, they might hope to make a profit.  That is the aim.  In every case where the board deals with a resort development scheme which has been duly certified then having completed the development work on which it is engaged it will endeavour to dispose of some of the property or lease that property in such manner as to recover the expenditure.</P>
    <P>It is quite obvious that none of the resort development activity of the board will be remunerative to the board or serve the purpose which the Government and the board have in mind unless its activities are ultimately to be supported by private enterprise and in expressing the view that the development of our holiday resorts must be mainly taken up by private enterprise that is the idea I had in mind.</P>
    <P>The board can provide parks, swimming pools, roads, walks and the other facilities which the public would like to have but the schemes themselves will be incomplete unless private enterprise follows in and undertakes the other more commercial type of development which will enable the board to recover its expenditure and give to the public the added facilities which they will seek.</P>
    <P>Most of the debate however referred to the question of the operation of hotels by the board.  I explained in the Dáil in introducing the Bill that the board came into the possession of certain properties which are being developed as hotels largely because of the abnormal circumstances which existed in the years since the board was established.  The board could not undertake this resort development work during the war.  It could not carry out precisely the plan which we had in mind in 1939 and consequently other activities engaged its attention. <Col N="2011" /> Certain properties in holiday resort areas became available.  They were mainly large houses situated on demesnes where there were exceptional scenic attractions or other unusual facilities.  It acquired these houses with the Government's consent, with a view to their development as hotels.  The board is not going to operate the hotels, nor will its relationship to those hotel properties be any different from what it will be to other hotel properties. It is true that, having expended money on the hotels and having undertaken to provide capital for their development, it must retain such control over those properties until they are disposed of as will enable the board to sell them to the best advantage. The board is going to sell them to the best advantage, for the highest price they can get for them.  In order to ensure that they would not have direct responsibility for the operation of these hotels, the board has set up a subsidiary company, established under the Companies Acts.  Senator Summerfield was misled by Senator Sweetman's recounting of some of the provisions in the memorandum of association of that company.  I think he assumed that Senator Sweetman was referring to the powers of the board. That company will be sold to the public.  Shares in the company will be offered to the public and when those shares are bought, as we expect they will be, it will be a privately-owned company entitled to carry on any commercial activity which may be carried on by such a private company.  It may sell shares to customers or run a private hackney service, or carry on any ordinary activity such as that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">

      <P>The company at present is a non-profit-making company and the board of directors consists of persons who have agreed to carry on the concern, at the request of the Tourist Development Board, without remuneration. The intention is that the company will be offered to the public. <Col N="2012" /> That may involve some change in its status, but clearly the provision to which the Senator refers is intended to give the company a special status for tax purposes which otherwise it would not have.  That company will be offered for sale as a going concern to the public or it will dispose of the individual properties, if that appears to be the most advantageous method of getting back the capital invested.</P>

      <P>By the shareholders.  I have no objection to the board establishing a subsidiary company for that purpose or for other purposes that I have in mind.  Amongst the other purposes, there is the very important purpose of organising holiday camps. Senator Duffy, who spoke with some vehemence on this Bill, apparently read with great care the account of certain proceedings in the courts yesterday.  He told us, however, he was not present during the initial stages of this debate and apparently he did not even attempt to read the newspaper account of that debate before participating in it.  If the Senator had done so, he would have found that I made a special reference to the board's intention to organise holiday camps for workers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Senator is not blaming me for that.  The board is particularly anxious to foster the establishment of holiday camps and holiday hostels in suitable resorts, for the advantage of working-class families who cannot afford to pay the higher charges which operate in ordinary hotels at seaside resorts.  It will endeavour to get such hostels or camps established by private enterprise and will encourage and assist private enterprise to do so, either by technical advice or by the loan of money, if that is required.  However, if private enterprise does not appear to be oncoming in that regard, I will certainly encourage the board to establish a subsidiary <Col N="2013" /> like Fáilte, Teoranta, for that purpose and certainly will be prepared to approve an advance to the board for that purpose, if the board put up schemes which appear to be attractive and in every way sound.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>What I was really concerned about was the very little consideration given to the matter in the White Paper, which appears to be public policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I stated in 1939 that the board would not acquire hotels except in odd cases.  The board has, in fact, acquired only one hotel, that at Lisdoonvarna.  What is the position there?  At Lisdoonvarna, there is a spa which may be&mdash;and many have contended that it is&mdash;as good a spa as exists in Europe.  The board have advanced a substantial sum of money to the trust which owns the spa, for its development, for the erection of baths, shelters and other facilities one would expect to find at a spa.  If the board advances money and otherwise concerns itself with the development of the spa, it is for the purpose of attracting people there&mdash;and there is no good in attracting people unless there is a suitable hotel for them to stay at.  Consequently, it was felt to be a necessary part of the plan to acquire, enlarge and improve the existing hotel. It was acquired voluntarily and there was no question of compulsion.  An offer was made to the hotel proprietors and it was sold to the board.  They are spending a substantial sum of money on improvement and enlargement, but that is all part of one scheme, the main purpose of which is to develop Lisdoonvarna as a holiday resort in connection with the spa. There were special circumstances in that case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The board would not ordinarily acquire existing hotels except as a necessary step in the completion of some wider scheme.  It acquired for £500 the derelict hotel at Killarney, but they were not acquiring the hotel there but the site on which the hotel stood.  The suggestion that the board, in developing new hotels, is going into competition with private enterprise has no foundation for it.  There are 900 <Col N="2014" /> registered hotels in the country.  The new company established by the board, &ldquo;Fáilte, Teoranta&rdquo;, will operate five. There are not enough hotels in the country.  The particular hotels which the board will operate are all located in special areas, where they will not be in competition with anybody.</P>
    <P>The term &ldquo;luxury hotel&rdquo; has been used in that connection, and it was unfortunate that it was ever used.  That term brings to mind a false picture and one is led to misunderstand the type of business in which the board is engaged when that term is used.  People react against the term; so violently did Senator Honan react that he actually pronounced his opinion that people did not want luxury at hotels.  I think we want luxury in all our hotels.  I do not know the precise significance of the term, but while I agree it is quite true that people look in the main for cleanliness, good food and comfort, they also want luxury, and as much luxury as they can reasonably expect to get having regard to the tariffs charged to them.  In fact, I should say that a very large number of those who go to hotels for holidays are people who are prepared to save money all the year round, denying themselves luxuries, for the purpose of living like a millionaire or a semi-millionaire for a week or a fortnight.  That is a holiday to them and it is a very enjoyable one.  I think those people would be very disappointed if, having saved their money and having paid their fees, they were given plain food and cleanliness, but no luxury.  Part of the attraction of a holiday to them is the fact that they can get during that limited period of the year a degree of luxury which otherwise they cannot hope to experience.</P>
    <P>Senators Hayes and Crosbie made adverse reference to the personnel of the board.  There was even a suggestion that they were unfitted to be members of the board and were chosen for their membership solely because of their political affiliations.  The Irish Tourist Board consists of five members The chairman and managing director of the board is Mr. J.P. O'Brien.  He was manager, before his appointment to the Irish Tourist <Col N="2015" /> Board, of the Tourist Association and he was, perhaps, the one person in this country engaged in a professional, whole-time capacity, on tourist matters. I think that if any other person had been chosen for the post of managing director of the Irish Tourist Board, it would have required some explanation. He was chosen because of his special experience and qualification in tourist matters.  I may say that his retention in that capacity will, of course, depend entirely on the manner in which the board is administered.  Up to the present, there has been no cause for complaint. Another member of the board is Mr. Thomas Condon, a former Senator. At the time of his appointment&mdash;&mdash;</P>

What his politics are I do not know, but I am satisfied that he is a competent member of the board. There is An Fear Mór who runs a very successful Irish College at Ring, County Waterford, and has unique experience in that respect.

      <P>I am told here that these members were selected solely because they were supporters of Fianna Fáil.  I can tell the Senators that there were good reasons for their appointments, no matter what party they supported.  I say the Irish Tourist Board could not be described except as a very suitable board having regard to the special qualifications of the members who constitute it.  Let me say this now: I know that Senator Hayes and his friends have never yet forgiven Fianna Fáil for putting them out of office in 1932.  Their minds seemed to have stopped functioning in that year. Even now, they still think that we are trespassers, that the State and the institutions of the State are their special property, and that Fianna Fáil should have no right to interfere with them.</P>
      <P>In that state of mind they have, therefore, developed an extraordinary point of view that anybody who supports the Government should not be employed in any capacity whatever&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Hayes also told us about Séamus Davin, former secretary of Fianna Fáil.  Let me say to the Senator that Mr. Davin applied for a vacancy on the Tourist Board staff which was advertised and got it on his merits, and no other ground.  He told us a rather peculiar story about the personnel difficulties of Fianna Fáil being solved by appointments to outside bodies.  That story is not true.  In fact, I could say that the story is <Col N="2017" /> obviously not true, in view of the discrepancies in it, without any further examination.  But, nevertheless, it struck a very familiar chord.</P>
      <P>The main facts of the story told by Senator Hayes seemed to fit very accurately the circumstances of the appointment of a director of broadcasting during the Cumann na nGaedheal régime.  We are told that Fianna Fáil solves its personnel difficulties by putting these people into public appointments, or semi-public appointments.  Cumann na nGaedheal had a difficulty which they tried to solve by making a person a member of the Dáil.  I stopped that by defeating their candidate, so he was made director of broadcasting.  The facts all correspond to the old story and Senator Hayes has merely changed the names.  But, no doubt, he was trying to enliven the proceedings of the Seanad by recalling something which was really applicable to Cumann na nGaedheal.</P>
      <P>I think it is about time that we stopped this business of suggesting that every supporter of the Government who gets employment in a public capacity gets it for political reasons. Senator Hayes got a job paid out of public funds.  He was not the only one.</P>

      <Col N="2019" /> To get back to some of the other important points raised in the debate, Senator Honan referred to the desire of the Ennis Development Association to have a new hotel erected there, and he asked that the Government should procure a new hotel.  I cannot even undertake that the Tourist Board will embark on the erection of a new hotel. But I am sure that the board will assist local enterprise by advice and financial assistance to provide the new hotel in Ennis at least to the same extent as they are assisting a similar group in Limerick.  The type of hotel business which Senator Honan regards as desirable in Ennis must be provided by private enterprise in the first instance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no question of competition at present and will not be for many years because we have not half enough hotels in the country.  May I say, in connection with the suggestion that there should be more of the small class of hotels and workers' hostels that we want all kinds of hotels, and that it will be the function of the board to stimulate and assist in the provision of all kinds of hotels, hotels that will cater for every class of person?</P>
      <P>Senator Foran referred to a case where a hotel proprietor was prosecuted for over-charging.  He was not so prosecuted by the Irish Tourist Board.  The Irish Tourist Board have, in fact, no power to prosecute for that offence.  Over-charging is an offence only under emergency powers legislation, and I presume it was the officers of the Department of Industry and Commerce who were responsible for the prosecution in the case to which the Senator referred.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There was some misunderstanding. On that matter, may I explain to the House the powers and procedure of the Tourist Board in relation to hotel charges?  They do not attempt to fix reasonable charges. They ask every hotel proprietor when registering his hotel with the board to state the charges he proposes to make. He can state any charges he likes, from 20 guineas a week to two guineas a week, but once he states his charges he must stick to them.  The board will insist on the hotel proprietor maintaining the charges which he determines, and these charges are published in the handbook issued by the board.  The purpose of that scheme is to enable any person seeking hotel accommodation in Ireland to be told by the Tourist Board the hotels that are available and the charges for accommodation at these hotels.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, so that an individual can select the type of hotel which he regards as being within his means.  Having selected that hotel, he can go to it knowing that he will not be charged more than the charge set out in the handbook issued by the Irish Tourist Board.  There was an objection, and a well-founded objection, to the practice of hotel keepers pushing up charges when a customer came in who looked wealthier or softer than the ordinary run of customer, or, again, during special seasons when the demands for hotel accommodation were abnormally heavy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest that the penalty for that is, that if there is any departure from the charges set out, the board can cancel the registration of the hotel, but that there is no prosecution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That is correct.  Now that Senator Duffy is on his feet, it reminds me of the fact that he referred to the wages and conditions of employment of hotel workers.  The board has <Col N="2021" /> no functions in regard to the regulation of the conditions of employment or wages of the hotel workers.  I do not know if Senator Duffy intended to suggest that they should have functions in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>My point is that it should be part of the inspection duty of the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There would be no good in merely giving the board powers in regard to inspection if they had no power to remedy anything which they might find to be wrong.  The wages and conditions of employment of hotel staffs are regulated by private negotiation between individual employees and their employers, or by agreements negotiated between trade unions and the employers.  Is the Senator prepared to leave it that way, or is he proposing to give to this board the power to regulate the conditions of employment and wages of hotel workers?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>No, that is not fair.  I suggest that the board has the duty to inspect and see that hotels are maintained in a state of cleanliness to enable them to be registered, and I wanted to ensure that the other conditions were as good as those in regard to cleanliness.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator can have it one way or the other, but I do not think he can have it both ways.  Either the conditions of employment and the rates of wages for hotel staffs will be left to be fixed by the trade unions, through ordinary trade union action, or that duty will be taken away from the trade unions and will be undertaken by the Irish Tourist Board.  You cannot have both doing it.  I am certain that Senator Duffy, when talking on that, was talking without his <Col N="2022" /> book and without consultation with his colleagues.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Some Senator suggested that the present trend in holiday traffic is transitory, and that the anxiety of people in other countries to come and enjoy holidays here will pass when normal conditions are restored throughout Europe.  I do not know that that is true.  There are abnormal conditions prevailing at the moment.  The number of people who may wish to come here <Col N="2023" /> for holidays is very much larger than the number we can accommodate.  It is entirely incorrect to say, as Senator Duffy tried to convey, that the Tourist Board is endeavouring to attract visitors from abroad this year.  It is not doing so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>As I explained yesterday, the board and the Tourist Association are limiting their activities in so far as visitors from abroad are concerned. They are impressing on such visitors that they should not come here unless they have their accommodation arranged in advance.  Otherwise, they have no certainty of getting accommodation. There is no effort being made to attract visitors from abroad until we are in a position to cater for them properly.  At present we have not enough hotel accommodation, nor have the efforts of the board to raise the standard of hotel accommodation yet borne sufficient fruit.  I think, however, there is big business here for the future.  We must not regard the volume of tourist traffic as stationary.  It is not stationary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The development of travel facilities, and the inauguration of the practice of giving holidays with pay to workers as well as many other changes not merely in this country but in almost all countries, is raising the total volume of holiday traffic everywhere. This traffic is going to become much bigger business in the future than ever it was in the past.  If we are to get a substantial share of that business, I am certain that we can get it only if we prepare the basis on which the business can be built up: that is, proper accommodation and proper facilities which people will remember and speak about when they go back. It is not primarily for the purpose of attracting visitors from abroad we are developing our holiday resorts. We are developing our holiday resorts for the benefit of our own people in the main.  It is not primarily to attract visitors from abroad we are raising the standard of hotel accommodation.  It should be raised in any event.  We can, through those methods and other <Col N="2024" /> activities of the Tourist Board, interest private enterprise in the immense possibilities of the holiday traffic business which has developed not merely amongst our own people but all over the world.  We can attract a substantial part of that business here and it is export business.  Senator Duffy said that there is no use in attracting English visitors at present because they will pay us only in sterling and we have plenty of sterling.  He might as well say that we should stop shipping cattle or shipping other produce to England, because precisely the same argument applies.  If we ship cattle or goods to Britain, we do so not because there is an immediate need to obtain sterling for our own purposes but to maintain a trade which will be necessary and advantageous to us in the future.  In the same way, if British visitors come to the country this year for holidays, we hope they will enjoy their holidays and that they will, as a result, become propagandists for holidays in Ireland amongst their friends and neighbours in their own country.  That will bring trade to us which we shall need and be glad to get in the future.</P>
    <P>I might say, however, that the activities of the Tourist Board and the potentialities of this trade are not confined to Great Britain.  American air and shipping companies have expressed to me their belief that there are very substantial possibilities in the future of tourist trade from the United States.  These companies are expending at the present time very large sums of money on popularising holidays in Ireland in the United States.  There are, I think, two or three film organisations here at the moment making films, to the order of those companies which they propose to use in connection with their business in selling travel facilities from the United States to this country.  I see no reason why that business should not be encouraged as soon as we are in a position to handle it.  We are not yet in a position to handle it and we, ourselves, are taking no active steps in that direction other than to promote and assist the development of the facilities here which will, ultimately, put <Col N="2025" /> us in a position to handle that business.</P>
    <P>Senator Ó Buachalla referred to the possibility of the board assisting in the establishment of Gaelic colleges.  Let me make it quite clear that this board is concerned with holiday facilities.  It is considering and, in the future, will be very glad to consider, proposals for the development of holiday facilities in Gaeltacht areas where people can combine holidays with the study of the Irish language.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamOBuachalla" hpid="Liam Ó Buachalla Liam Ó Buachalla">
      <NameTxt>Liam Ó Buachalla</NameTxt>
      <P>Including the erection of buildings?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Including the erection of buildings, but from the point of view of the Tourist Board, the primary emphasis will be on holidays. The buildings would have to be in areas suitable for holidays&mdash;say, a seaside resort or some other area where people could enjoy ordinary recreational facilities.  Ordinarily, the board would assist projects of that kind by giving advice or financial help to persons who themselves were prepared to undertake the management of the buildings or holiday camps or whatever form the enterprise might take.  The assistance would be in the form of engineering advice and general advice in the management of such enterprise.  The board would not, I think, be interested in proposals for the establishment of colleges where education in horticulture or agriculture would be given.  I think that the Department of Agriculture have projects for the establishment of such colleges.  The primary purpose of the Tourist Board is to develop holiday facilities and any project submitted to it would have to be definitely associated with the provision of holiday facilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I again emphasise that the purpose of this Bill is to enable the Government to give advances on an increased scale to the board for profit making schemes, mainly of a resort-developing character. All the money so advanced will, it is hoped, ultimately be repaid by the board from the profits earned by it on these schemes.  The reason the Bill is introduced at present is that the board has already prepared schemes which <Col N="2026" /> will, ultimately, involve expenditure to a greater amount than was authorised by the 1939 Act.  Many of these schemes cannot be proceeded with because of certain difficulties to which I have referred&mdash;scarcity of materials, the fact that property required in connection with them has not been voluntarily acquired, and may not be voluntarily acquired, involving the use of the board's compulsory powers, and the fact that local authorities are not in a position to give the co-operation required.  In all cases, the schemes that can be begun this year will not be begun until after the present holiday season, so that it is not yet possible to produce, by way of illustration of the board's methods, a scheme planned and carried through to completion.  No scheme has yet been completed and, for that reason, it is not as easy as it otherwise might be to illustrate the board's method of procedure.  A number of schemes in the list which I read out will be begun towards the end of the present holiday season and will be pushed ahead as rapidly as possible. Their completion may involve the co-operation of other people or the availability of supplies which are not yet in sight.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir John Keane Sir John Keane">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the several unsatisfactory features of the Minister's statement, I want to put myself in order in discussing this matter and, therefore, I move that the Seanad recommend the deletion of Section 2 of the Bill.  That is, I think, the correct procedure on a Money Bill.  This Bill has shown us that the Tourist Board is to be a gigantic real estate speculator.  To earn money on its expenditure, it has got to acquire land, because, unless it owns the land which it is going to develop, <Col N="2027" /> it cannot take advantage of the improved values resulting from its development.  I take it then that it is not an exaggeration of the financial position of the Tourist Board to say that it is a real estate speculator.  It has certain compulsory powers and, to that extent, it enjoys an advantage. The Minister passed over very lightly as if it were a matter of secondary importance the establishment by the State of these hotels in connection with this real estate development.  The Minister did not answer my question as to whether advice had been taken by the Tourist Board from experienced hotel managers as to the possibility of profit from ventures of this kind.  If experienced hotel managers believe that hotels can, under such conditions, be run at a profit, why did not the Tourist Board ask such people to come in, give them financial assistance on a business like basis, and get them to manage such hotels, because obviously they would be far more qualified and experienced in such matters than a board of the kind the Minister mentioned? What single member of the board has any knowledge whatever of the technique or indeed of the social inhibitions and the little subtleties of social snobbery, that surround the development of a hotel clientele?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister was quite satisfied to accept the certificate of a board with such qualifications that a venture of that kind was likely to be profitable, did he feel any obligation to satisfy himself that there was a likelihood of such a venture being profitable? It is an extraordinary proposition that our money should be handed over to a body of people totally unqualified in hotel management who have never sought the advice of competent hotel managers and who are prepared to certify that a proposition of this kind is likely to be profitable. In the absence of such advice, we can only bring our own experience to bear on the problem.  I am very unlike many other people and probably many other people are unlike me but I consider nothing more unpleasant than to go for a holiday to a place which has been developed by promenades and <Col N="2028" /> band stands attracting all the crowds associated with amenities of that kind, and be asked to go to a hotel and pay ten guineas a week or more.  I do not say there are not people who will not do it but I do say that it is a most speculative enterprise promoted by people with no experience and it is an improper use of public money.  In view of the further enlightenment we have heard from the Minister, I am totally opposed to the character of the development he has outlined.</P>
    <P>There is one direction in which the State might assist&mdash;do not take it that I am totally opposed to any form of State activity, because I am not&mdash;and that is on the question of staggered holidays.  If school holidays were staggered it would add very much to the economic possibilities of the whole holiday business.  The fact that all schools close about the same time and that the whole peak load of holidays occurs at the one time is economically unsound and it is not justified by the weather.  It is justified only by practice and tradition and anything the Government could do to arrange that holidays could extend all through June, July, August and September, would be of enormous advantage to the economics of the whole problem.  I do not for one moment think that it would make holidays less agreeable.  I do hope the Minister will give the matter his serious attention and do what he can through State agencies to secure staggered holidays.  He might do something in that way with the schools and with the co-operation of the trade unions endeavour to secure the application of the system to industry.  So far as holidays amongst the wage earning class are concerned, they seem to be confined to a very short period in certain industries.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to follow the Minister into a high rage about anything raised here yesterday.  I realise quite well that the board is getting repayable advances from the Minister and when I said public money was being used, I spoke, perhaps, rather loosely.  Technically the Minister is quite right but in fact I did not misrepresent the position and I certainly <Col N="2029" /> had no intention of misrepresenting it.  The board puts up schemes which, in the judgment of the board, are profit-making schemes.  The Minister, quite properly I am sure, with all the sources available to him, examines them.  If they should turn out not to be profit-making schemes, the State loses.  That is quite clear.  In fact, what does happen is that State money is advanced for the purpose of a speculative undertaking.  I am not using the word &ldquo;speculative&rdquo; in any wrong sense.  Therefore I represented the position quite clearly and I could not have misled Senator Summerfield because I spoke after him and not before him.  My capacity is not so extraordinary as that.  Neither did I say, Sir, that all the members of the board were elected because they were supporters of Fianna Fáil.</P>
      <P>I should like to avail of this occasion to correct one error made, I am sure quite unwittingly, by the Minister in his enthusiasm to vanquish certain political opponents.  I advocated on the Committee Stage of the Tourist Development Bill, 1939, that a person with a knowledge of the Irish language and with practical capacity as well&mdash;and the combination is rather rare&mdash;should be put on the Tourist Board so that it could be sure that when certain of what are sometimes called backward areas were being developed, the question of the Irish language would receive proper consideration. If it is any consolation to the Minister I will say that I think the selection made for that particular kind of post was an admirable one.  So much for that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to Lord Monteagle&mdash;I am speaking entirely from memory now&mdash;I think it is quite wrong to say that the Monteagles were leaders of Southern Unionism.  I have a recollection that long before the Howth gunrunning in 1914 schools were managed in Limerick by the Monteagles&mdash;I think the name was Spring-Rice.  At that particular period, long ago in the British days, there were men from Ring on the teaching staff and the pupils were taught, to some degree at least, through the medium of Irish.  That was done in these far-distant days <Col N="2030" /> through the patriotic efforts of the Monteagles.  I am speaking entirely from memory again, but I rather think there was a member of that family with Erskine Childers in the boat that brought the guns to Howth in 1914.  I may be mistaken.</P>

He said that we should be as accurate as he was, but he was merely plastering Southern Unionism on these benches.  He was wrong.  In this particular instance he was extravagantly wrong.  I just want to say that that is an example of the unscrupulous type of debate to which we are accustomed from the Minister. I said before that I have a great admiration for the Minister in many ways, but there is nothing he would not say.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to say a word on this section.  I do not propose now to refer to the question of staff. I have some documents to read but I would prefer to deal with them on the Fifth Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a couple of points which I would like to mention at this stage. One point is that I have discovered in three or four cases hotel services have deteriorated very materially in the last two or three years.  There is one hotel not 20 miles from Dublin which in my opinion was a first-class hotel 15 years ago but I found it only fifth class a year ago.  I had another experience of hotels in a midland town recently.  I arrived on a Saturday afternoon in an important midland town and I put up at the hotel where I had been calling <Col N="2031" /> for at least 20 years.  I was getting off a bus at eight o'clock to speak at a meeting which was timed to start at eight, and all I could do was to hand my bag to the porter and say that I would be in later.</P>
    <P>I got to the hotel at about ten o'clock, and bear in mind the fact that I had no meal from about 9.30 that morning, but at ten o'clock on that Saturday night I could not get any meal in the hotel.  I was told there was no room in the hotel either and I asked a couple of friends to get a room for me somewhere.  When I came back later to the hotel where I had booked and where at ten o'clock I was told there was no accommodation, I discovered there were at least three vacant rooms there.  I was disappointed and I intended to mention the matter to some member of the Tourist Board.  It seems to me that the whole work of the Tourist Board is being destroyed if an impression like that is created on visitors who do not happen to come here from America, Canada or England.  Surely it is very unsatisfactory that where somebody, like myself in that case, goes into a town that he cannot get a meal at ten o'clock at night in view of the fact that nowadays you cannot get a meal when travelling.  That is going to have a very bad impression on people, especially if you tell them there is no accommodation when there is plenty.</P>
    <P>Another matter which came to my notice recently is the extraordinary absence of cohesion between concerns which are more or less operated by the State.  If they had been hostile organisations, one could understand it.  In a case to which I will refer we have the Tourist Board on one side exercising certain control over hotels, and on the other side we have Córas Iompair Éireann making arrangements for their buses to call at hotels.  On Saturday last I discovered that Hayes's Hotel in Thurles has terminated a contract with Córas Iompair Éireann because of the thoughtless manner in which the transport company was handling traffic calling at Hayes's hotel.</P>
    <P>I made inquiries because it seemed to <Col N="2032" /> me that there was a great deterioration when the bus stop was transferred across the street.  I am not reflecting on the hotel where the bus was to stop as a result of this change but it bears no comparison in appearance or reputation with Hayes's hotel in Tipperary. I asked the people in Hayes's hotel why this happened and they said they had a contract with Córas Iompair Éireann that four buses would call there each day.  They found in fact that six, seven and sometimes eight buses called in the day without any intimation having been given them that additional passengers were coming.  They knew nothing about the additional buses but were expected to have a hot lunch ready whenever the buses arrived.  On top of that, the Department of Supplies refused to give them additional tea or sugar to deal with the extra traffic.  I hope the Minister will not reply by saying that I have gone off the rails to attack the Government in this matter.  I am merely drawing the Minister's attention in what I hope is a reasonably restrained manner to what I consider a serious blemish on our method of handling this traffic which we might call native tourism.  I do not know how the foreigners will fare but I have endeavoured to convey to the House how the natives are faring.  I think this lack of cohesion is a serious matter.  So far as Hayes's hotel is concerned there was a lack of cohesion between concerns that might be expected to work in unison in promoting the interests of travellers and guests in hotels.</P>
    <P>In the other cases, I do not want to mention names but I can give the Minister the names of three hotels in which in my opinion services have deteriorated.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcGee" hpid="Mr. McGee Mr. McGee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGee</NameTxt>
      <P>I must ask the indulgence of the House because due to an accident I was not able to speak on the Second Reading but I trust my remarks will be in order on the section to which Senator Sir John Keane referred. I noticed in the general debate we had yesterday that we were all apologies and all sympathy for a certain Minister who is dealing with acts of the past, acts for which I have absolutely no sympathy or consideration. <Col N="2033" /> I was silent because I was all sympathy for the Minister who was looking to the future and that is the present Minister.  Somebody said that he might be deemed to be stepping off the rails in attacking the Government. I have a close experience of the Tourist Board and I would almost step off the rails on my side of the House to approve of a great deal that the Tourist Board have done.  I do not see how we are to develop our remote coastal areas without the Tourist Board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it was some Englishman who said in the last Great War, &ldquo;We have made mistakes, we will make mistakes but we will root through successfully in the end.&rdquo;  I hope that the Tourist Board will root through successfully in the end and with the help of well-meaning citizens that can be done.  Within the last year I was responsible for auctioning a certain property. I was told to get all I could and I valued the property.  Some people valued it at £14,000, others at £16,000 and one went as high as £20,000.  When one gentleman came and offered £16,000 the lady concerned would not sell but eventually the Tourist Board offered £12,000, and she took it.  I venture to think that in a couple of years' time they will have a first-class hotel there, whether they dispose of the property or not.  They really have a gift in that property because it would cost them nothing. So enthusiastic are the local people for the success of this scheme that we have adopted a plan to provide water and sewerage facilities for the villages surrounding the property at a cost of £25,000. That £25,000 scheme has gone to another Department of State, and I am sorry that when they were blowing up the Custom House they did not succeed in abolishing the Local Government Department, for that scheme is with them for a year and it is in their pigeon-holes still.  That is evidence of goodwill on the part of the people I represent.  In developing these coastal areas, unless we have some board with authority and with money to act, the remote areas will be by-passed. That is a very big question.  Last night I heard two Senators speaking <Col N="2034" /> here, two colleagues, one praying that we would not have another Blackpool in this country, and when he left the House, his colleague stated that our people could not get a decent holiday since the Isle of Man boats ceased to sail.  That shows the difficulties the Tourist Board are up against.  They cannot bring a Blackpool to Ireland and cannot get people away to the Isle of Man.  I do not know which is the faster place, but when I was a young fellow they used to tell me I would have a far better time in the Isle of Man than even in Blackpool.</P>
    <P>Regarding the development of our remote areas, my county has a population of 60,000 and we are a growing population still.  We have had no new hotel development in the last 30 years that I know of, except the present development undertaken by the Tourist Board.  My colleague, Senator Sir John Keane, said there was not a man with hotel experience on the board. To my certain knowledge, doing business with them, they have selected a gentleman, one of whose ancestors was a most distinguished representative, anti-Fianna Fáil, in this House, and, so far as I know, they are pursuing their job reasonably well and I would rather not hear of their competition in other areas when you have an undeveloped area such as Louth, with only two hotels along the coast, the Greenore Hotel and this one.</P>
    <P>I am not satisfied that the Minister has asked for sufficient authority or sufficient money for the development of coastal areas.  Accordingly, I would like to stress the development of remote coastal areas.  With regard to transport, even yet the Department of Supplies is a bit too small-minded.  We ask for a bus to take the members of the county council round the district.</P>

      <P>No one interrupted Senator Duffy or Senator Sweetman and they are both on their feet much more often than I am, so I do not think it would be too much for them to extend indulgence to me for about five minutes more.  These remote coastal areas will not be developed by individuals. <Col N="2035" /> They have failed in the past. For example, in the case of fishing villages like Clogher Head and Annagasson, the men have probably gone to England for the war and it will take something brave and courageous to re-establish the big fishing industry where it ought to be.  That can only be done if a board like this is generous in those areas.  They will contribute their moieties in rates and expenses. The groundwork and foundation are there.  Beside these very buildings they purchased from Lady Montaigne, there is the hill of Clogher Head, which is the only height along the coast from Newcastle in County Down to Howth&mdash;and it is at least as good and attractive as Howth.  It has the huge town of Drogheda, with an 18,000 population, beside it.</P>

      <P>I suppose it is five miles, anyway.  I am not such a judge of distance as the Senator is.  In regard to the development of the Irish colleges, I remember that 25 years ago the late Eoin MacNeill established one with some success at Omeath, where we have an Irish-speaking area.  If I were silent about the beauties of that place, I think I would be misrepresenting my people. Obviously, you people who have every side to turn to for money&mdash;right, left, centre&mdash;must know that, when the border operates and half our people are cut off tragically at the end of a licensed premises, there is very little money, unless such money as black-marketeering might bring in.  Whilst that may be very substantial during the war and whilst the Belfast people may come there to spend their war gains on a Sunday, there is room for <Col N="2036" /> any development the board can bring, especially to that peninsula known formerly as Cooley, which had so many trials to endure on account of the black scab.</P>
      <P>It is not too much to ask for the generous eye of the Minister.  The beauties of Connemara are all very well, but I think it will be found that this place 60 miles from Dublin would afford a great field for development. We have a sufficient number of hotels in it, just as we have everywhere else in Ireland; and some of them, except those that are carefully looked after, are certainly not attractive. Many of us have business in this hotel and go there the night before a fair in winter time, and find the Tourist Board have done nothing.  You hear extensive ratepayers and taxpayers complaining of the state of some of them even in County Galway.  I am sure that, in time, that will be put right, but I would not like that we should oppose the Tourist Board too violently, because there is so much room and so many opportunities for them to invest money in them in wholly undeveloped places, and some of them within 60 miles of Dublin. There is not much necessity to develop Beauty's Home and the wilds of Connemara. There are other citizens entitled to partake of whatever moneys are being invested in this business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can speak only on behalf of the northern end of the eastern coast and on behalf of my county council. Any place the board seeks to develop, be it in the property they are pursuing or be it further north, they will find the local authorities, urban, rural and county, at their disposal in every way. We feel we are a neglected area in this development and, now that the board has started, we think the Minister might be more generous in expending even four gallons of petrol to take the county council members through its district in a bus on the 26th June.  That would be evidence of the goodwill to which we are entitled. If there were a little more friendly cohesion between the Departments, when a local authority sends up a scheme and has the sand and has Senator Sir John Keane and his <Col N="2037" /> directors ready to sell us the cement, we would be able to erect the waterworks in the vicinity which connects the town that is the basis of the cement factory and the area that the Tourist Board is starting to develop with this hotel in Newtown.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is anything else that would come within this section. I do not think I am supposed to deal with the staggering of holidays.  I have talked about the Irish language and I have dealt with Senator Foran's objection to Blackpool and Senator Campbell's admiration for the Isle of Man.  The Minister said yesterday evening that the help of the local authorities would be needed.  We are waiting and praying for some funds to be placed at our disposal for the development of what we believe will be a tourist place worth seeing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCrosbie" hpid="Mr. Crosbie Mr. Crosbie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crosbie</NameTxt>
      <P>On this section, I remarked in my speech yesterday that I regarded the sum of £1,250,000 as being an excellent investment of public funds.  Despite anything that has been said subsequently on either side of the House, or even by the Minister, in his very vehement summing up, I still maintain that it is a good investment and in some ways I think the amount of money could possibly be greater. My reference to the personnel of the board brought to me, at any rate, an unexpected vehement reply, if not an attack from the Minister.  I am personally acquainted with only one member of the board and he is, as far as I know, a gentleman of great competence and wide general experience. I have no wish to cast any aspersions or doubts on the competence or capabilities of those other members of the board with whom I am not acquainted. My criticism of the board, however, would be this, that for a number of years in this country we have had, as the Minister admits, 900 hotels, and he quite rightly points out that we have not got anything like a sufficiency of hotels.  Out of those 900 hotels I do not know how many are, shall we say, successful, but I do know that we have a great number of extremely competent and successful and efficient hoteliers, and I do regret that when this board was set up not one of these <Col N="2038" /> extremely competent and efficient people who had made such a tremendous success of their trade&mdash;one might almost call it a profession because it really amounts to an unofficial profession&mdash;was put on this board.  That was also the object of the questions I put to the Minister during his statement, and I would like the Minister, when he is replying, to take the opportunity of elaborating his statement to me that when this subsidiary company which is to start these hotels, is floated as a public company to the public, and the shares put on the market, the directors will be chosen by the shareholders.</P>
      <P>I would like him to tell the House, if possible, whether the Government will have a nominee on that board, and whether the chairman will be nominated by the Government, or by whom will he be selected, and I would urge on the Minister, when the time comes &mdash;he says it will be some time, but apparently it will come&mdash;to float this company as a public company, to take the opportunity of making good the omission he committed in the Tourist Board itself and see that there are on that board people who have made a success themselves of the hotel business.  That is my greatest criticism of the Tourist Board as it is now constituted.  I have no doubt that the members of the board are very competent in their own way, but there is not one member of the board who has earned his living by running a hotel, and I think that is a great pity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>With some things the Minister said in his reply on the Second Reading, I am in agreement, and it might be better to refer to that at first.  The purpose of this section is to enlarge the aggregate amount of the advances to be made by the Department of Finance to the Tourist Board for schemes certified by the board. Therefore, perhaps, technically, this money is not used for publicity but, perhaps, it would be as well to stress what was stated already, that there is no part of this money to be used for publicity, that no publicity abroad is being made at the present time by the Irish Tourist Association, that all the association is doing is to deal with the <Col N="2039" /> barest minimum of queries made to it and wherever it is asked by prospective visitors, it stresses in reply that people should not come to this country unless they have made appropriate booking arrangements in advance.</P>
      <P>I agree with the Minister that when people come here we should be prepared to receive them, and they should not be encouraged to come until such time as we are ready.  I am not clear, however, in respect of the grants that are to be made under this section, and I would like the Minister to explain it a little more, whether it is possible in this respect, or in any other manner, to ensure that some system of aiding tourist resorts by cheap holiday transport fares is possible.  Certainly, we hope that so far as the present summer is concerned, the reduction in the tax on petrol will mean also a reduction in bus and train fares.  That will assist the holiday season for our own people, but I do not know if there can be any schemes brought in like those in Switzerland and Italy where reductions varying from 20 to 80 per cent. in transport charges were made available for people, not necessarily foreigners, but for their own nationals, travelling together with their families.  Some sort of family travel arrangement is very desirable in the interests of holiday makers, and I would stress very strongly that if the Minister cannot bring it in under this section, he would give urgent directions in that regard to the interests concerned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>At the tea adjournment, I had dealt with a couple of points which arose out of the Minister's speech when replying on the Second Reading debate.  I want to deal with just a few more points.  The Minister was perfectly correct in saying that a great deal of the discussion on the motion for the Second Reading was in relation to the Tourist Board, whether by means of a company or otherwise, operating and carrying on hotels, particularly luxury hotels, and, in addition, being empowered to carry on the <Col N="2040" /> variety of businesses that are provided for in the Memorandum of Association. The Minister, with that debating skill to which we are all so accustomed, avoided in regard to the businesses the net point which is a simple and concise one.  The powers of the board are specifically set out in Section 16 of the Principal Act of 1939 as defined in Section 1 of this Bill.  The Minister knows as well as I know that, if there had been any attempt to incorporate in the Principal Act powers to enable the Tourist Board itself to carry on any of the businesses that are now mentioned in the Memorandum of Association of the new company, there would have been an outcry in the Oireachtas. My point about those businesses is clear and simple.  It is that the device of a company is a device that is dishonestly trying to get away from the limitations which are imposed in the Principal Act.  The board should not by any device attempt to get away from the statutory limitations which are imposed on its operations in the Principal Act, and it is because I am of that opinion that I object to these powers being included in the memorandum of the company.  Whether or not it is proper or wise to include them in the memorandum of any ordinary company is quite another matter.</P>
      <P>I am in entire agreement with the Minister that it is usual for persons floating private companies to cast the net&mdash;I think that was the phrase used by Senator O Buachalla&mdash;as wide as possible.  I agree so far as that applies to a private company, but this is not a private company.  The proposal here is merely a method of evading the regulations and restrictions imposed by Section 16 of the Principal Act, and I, therefore, object to any part of the funds which we are providing under Section 2 of this Bill being utilised for such a purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I saw the Cathaoirleach looking at me and I wished to relate my remarks specifically to Section 2 of the Bill which we are now discussing.  It is because the memorandum of the company is an attempt to enlarge, extend and widen the provisions in the original Act that I made reference to hairdressers, bakers, licensed traders, <Col N="2041" /> manufacturers of pleasure steamers and others yesterday.  If it were an original company, being opened for private operations, that would be normal, but this is merely an attempt to get away from the provisions contained in the Principal Act.  It is on that ground I object.</P>
    <P>I do not understand, despite the Minister's reply, how this company is to dispose of itself to the general public, having regard to the provisions included in its articles.  It does not appear to me that those articles were drawn with the view which has now been suggested in mind.  Senator O'Donovan said yesterday that, while we were talking of the board setting up luxury hotels, we had no evidence of that.  It was, perhaps, unfortunate for him that the statement appeared in yesterday evening's papers to which reference has already been made and that there was a heading to-day in the newspaper which I may describe as the Bible of my friends opposite: &ldquo;Club to cater for wealthy tourists.&rdquo; I suggest to the Minister that, while everybody going on holidays does, without question, want more luxury than he can get at home in his normal life, we do not want merely to cater for the super-luxury of the wealthy tourist. I suggest that it would have been better for the board to utilise the money which they are getting under this section to make some positive approach to the other methods of encouraging the trade&mdash;to utilise the money to do something in connection with holiday camps.  Not so long ago, the members of this House paid a very pleasant visit to certain of the midland counties.  As they were coming back that day, they saw Nissen huts, erected by the Turf Board at one place for certain purposes.  If that board were able to obtain those huts for that purpose, why were not the Tourist Board, if they wanted to operate holiday camps, equally able to obtain them and have them set up? The Nissen hut would be an easily-convertible structure and would provide suitable holiday camp facilities.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the reason of the omission is not, as the Minister said, <Col N="2042" /> that this is to be a minor phase of their work but because, as the chairman of the board said on 7th November, 1945, they are going in for luxury hotels, that that is what they regard as their main, positive, and immediate work.  While it may be said that their intentions are to the contrary, we can only judge those intentions by what we have seen so far. What we have seen does not bear out the Minister's statement of the board's intentions.</P>
    <P>The Minister made reference, in a somewhat heated little &ldquo;scene&rdquo;, to the members of the Tourist Board.  I think that the charge made by Senator Hayes was not against the members of the board but against certain employees&mdash;not all employees&mdash;of the board.  The Minister made particular reference to Lord Monteagle.  It has been pointed out to me that, in fairness to him, it should be stated that his wife was one of the teachers at the college to which Senator Hayes referred, and that he himself was one of the original people associated with Sir Horace Plunkett in the initiation of the co-operative movement here.  It is only fair that that should be put on the records of the House.</P>
    <P>In a few moments, we are to discuss a Bill dealing with local government. One of the Acts which constitute the local government code was very much decried at first but was subsequently accepted as a sound proposition&mdash;the selection of local government employees by independent methods.  The Minister for Local Government will, no doubt, state, when dealing with his Bill, that he believes that to be a sound method.  I should like the Minister for Industry and Commerce to make clear why a similar method of operation is not suitable in the case of a board such as the Irish Tourist Board.  It appears to me that what is fish for one should be fish for the other and that, when employees of one body are selected in that way, it should be desirable that employees of another body be selected in the same way.</P>
    <P>It would be better for the Minister to make clear the exact method by which the staff of the Irish Tourist Board are appointed.  The Minister, as <Col N="2043" /> reported in Column 6, Volume 99, No. 1 of the Dáil Debates, stated that he did not lay down any conditions in regard to the method of appointment of officers of the board.  The Minister has stated that political considerations did not enter into any such appointments. I want to make it clear that, if that is the case, the method of appointment is one that the public would like explained because if it is merely a coincidence that the Tourist Board is to a large degree-staffed by persons who are of one political complexion and who are, more than that, related to what I might call for the moment for want of a better word, a certain hierarchy in Fianna Fáil, it is only fair to them that the method should be made clear.  We should like to know whether, for example in the appointment of an assistant secretary to the board, public advertisements were issued inviting applications for the position and if certain conditions were fulfilled; and, further, whether in regard to the appointment of a solicitor for the board, who, I notice, made the application yesterday, the same type of opportunity to apply for the position was afforded to other solicitors who might be equally qualified to deal with the matters on which it is necessary for the board to obtain legal advice.  I want to try to deal with this matter in a calm way and I should like the Minister to supply the necessary information when he is replying.</P>
    <P>Nothing that has been said by anybody has in any way shaken my view that there is in this industry of providing for tourists and holiday-makers a great future, if the industry is developed in the right way.  Even after hearing the Minister, nothing has made it clear to me that his board is going to make an effort to get the co-operation of the hotel industry.  I am in entire agreement with the provision of hotels in an area such as that mentioned by Senator McGee in Louth where there is no hotel in competition.</P>
    <P>It is a very different story to compete with an existing institution.  The provision and operation by the board directly or indirectly through the company <Col N="2044" /> of a hotel such as Ballinahinch, which is just next to the Zetland and another hotel of which the Minister is well aware, and the provision by the board of an additional hotel in Killarney are bound, if there is not the same overflow as exists at present, to affect existing institutions.  I want further to know&mdash;and I would ask the Minister to be absolutely specific on this point&mdash;whether the board is at once going to make provision&mdash;and when I say &ldquo;at once&rdquo; I mean during the next month&mdash;by virtue of which existing hotel keepers who want to modernise, improve, and extend their premises can get long-term credit at reasonable rates.</P>

      <P>In view of the very explicit statements made by the Minister in opening the debate yesterday and in the debate we had to-day, I must confess that I am puzzled at the tone and the trend of the speeches made on this section.  Senator Sir John Keane started off by describing the board&mdash;I think I quote him correctly&mdash;as real estate speculators.  At least one of this evening's Dublin newspapers has given him the prominence of the front page.  Whether they have reported him correctly or not I cannot say, but what he is reported as having said would lead the ordinary public to assume that this House is now discussing whether we shall, in fact, finance a number of reckless spendthrifts. The Senator's description of this scheme for tourist expenditure is that it is a highly speculative one.  Of course it is to a degree, but I suggest, because it is of importance to the country, that if there is an element of gamble in this, in the light of the Minister's statement as to how the money is to be expended, the country will gladly face that gamble.  If all State expenditure is as well thought-out and as well planned as this, I do not think that we shall have anything to regret within the next year or two.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrederickSummerfield" hpid="Mr. Summerfield Mr. Summerfield">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Summerfield</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought the Minister himself had explained them. Evidently some people are harder to convince than others.  It is obvious to <Col N="2045" /> the ordinary people&mdash;and I do not claim to be anything more than an ordinary person&mdash;that much of what the Minister has already stated covers expenditure for schemes that could not be initiated or brought to fruition except by State expenditure.  I am glad to know that Portmarnock is to be developed and I hope that before long Dollymount will be developed.  I wonder how many people resident in Dublin have thought, as I have thought over a long period of years, that we cruelly neglected nature's gifts.  Instead of these places being so convenient to Dublin, they might have been hundreds of miles away for all the good they were to the majority of the people of Dublin, particularly Portmarnock.  If Portmarnock had been near an English industrial city it would have been developed long since.</P>
      <P>Development need not necessarily mean the bringing of Blackpool to our coastline.  Development can mean merely making available to the community the beauties of these places in a restrained and well thought-out fashion.  Therefore I am puzzled to know why there has been so much emphasis on luxury.  I am glad the Minister dealt with that question.  I think we are a long way from the time when we can describe any of our hotels as luxury hotels.  The best of them are only what one would describe as decently good hotels.  If there is to be a higher standard set, all right; let us start at the top if you like.  In the course of my speech on the previous stage of the Bill I myself stressed that in my opinion sane development will include amenities for the family, as the family is the basis of our population. I think we should lay greater emphasis on that.  We have had so many speeches and so much time of the House has been occupied by this debate, that I have no intention of making a detailed speech such as seems to be the fashion in this House, but I should like to set my view as a counterblast if you like to the view which has been expressed by Senator Sir John Keane which has already got very great publicity, that if this Bill involves speculation, it is not reckless speculation but something that is wise in the best interest of the people.</P>

      <P>I do not want to enter into this discussion very much.  I am a thorough advocate of State enterprise and I must say that in our efforts in that direction we have been reasonably successful.  In all those efforts of State enterprise, however, we found Senator Sir John Keane as hostile and as bitter as he is at this moment.  For the electrification of the Shannon there was no more bitter opponent than Senator Sir John Keane and so he has been through every State effort that has been made.  Unfortunately, however, I find myself somewhat in agreement with him on this occasion because I think we are likely to blot our copybook because of our success through State efforts.  It is for that reason that I enter into this discussion.</P>
      <P>I cannot visualise the State risking the fairly big sum of money involved in this Bill.  If these schemes are a success the intention is to hand them over to private enterprise.  In my opinion this development is not going to be such a success, or such a money-spinner that it will induce private enterprise to come in and take it over. Therefore, we will be left holding the baby, as it were.  Those are my feelings at any rate.  Having put our money into it and not achieving the success that we hoped for this will be left as the property of the State, whereas on the other hand, if by any chance it should turn out to be a money-spinner, we are going to hand it over to private enterprise which is to get the benefit of our effort, the benefit of our interest and of our money.</P>
      <P>I have read a good deal about this luxury business.  One place mentioned was Ballinahinch but the Ranji Singhi could not afford to keep that place going.  He spent a good deal of money on it and with all the money he spent and the development that took place it certainly was the last word in luxury. The salmon used to come up the river and ask to be caught, so that there you had inducement for the fisherman while the area was well stocked with game as well.  Nevertheless we do not notice a great number of people coming over to partake of the amenities to be obtained at Ballinahinch.</P>

    <P>Senator Sweetman referred to Portmarnock. <Col N="2047" /> I do not know if what he said is to be applied to the country.</P>

      <P>Oh yes, it was Senator Summerfield.  I knew it was a name beginning with an &ldquo;S&rdquo; anyway.  I want to know in what way are the people of this country going to benefit from the expenditure on the development of Portmarnock any more than they are benefiting from Portmarnock to-day.  I hope the Minister will tell us that.  According to the published statement yesterday evening there will be 19 bedrooms accommodating a maximum of 33 people.  These will be catered for in a hotel covering 200 acres.  The hotel will own 200 acres of Portmarnock and will shut out the people from the beautiful strand, so that people will have no more access to the strand at Portmarnock after all this expenditure than they have to-day.</P>
      <P>Senator O Buachalla mentioned Ashford. Time was when people could go into Ashford and enjoy its beauty and scenery but now they have to pay 1/- and at Portmarnock they may have to pay 1/- or more.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Foran</NameTxt>
      <P>No?  I think Senator Summerfield said that he hoped Dollymount would be developed, but I have heard people belonging to the Royal Dublin Golf Club saying that they hope there will not be development out there.  Generally speaking there is grave apprehension regarding the possible activity of this board.  There are amenities which offer considerable inducement to our own nationals and locals but if this board carries out what I learn is their intention, the nationals and locals will be put into competition with the black marketeers from other countries coming in here and paying 12 guineas a week for amenities which our own people can enjoy now at fairly reasonable prices.  The people realise <Col N="2048" /> that and they are very concerned about it.  I hope that the Minister, for the sake of our worthy achievement up to the present in State enterprise, will see to that matter and give a good deal of attention to making this effort as definite a success as many of the others were.</P>
      <P>I would like the Minister to explain why the staff engaged by the Tourist Board are not recruited through the Employment Commission.  The staff for many other enterprises are so recruited. If there is any particular reason for this I would like to know it. If the staff engaged by the Tourist Board were recruited through the Employment Commission it would kill, at the source, this allegation that the people being employed and recruited by the board are all members of a certain organisation, and that priority and preference are given to them.  Here is an opportunity of doing away with that allegation.  It is an allegation to which I do not subscribe but it is doing a considerable amount of harm, and if the Employment Commission were resorted to it would to a large extent kill the allegation that preference and priority are given to people with a certain political tinge.</P>

      <P>I had hoped that at some time or another we would be finished with the suggestions that are being thrown across the House from the other side and which arise every time the question of giving money for the formation of a board comes up in this House.  Senator Sweetman confined the matter to a certain basis.  He said that they were not referring to the members of the board though he said they were referring to some employees but not to all the employees.  No names were mentioned and no details were given but evidently there is the suggestion that somebody was appointed as an employee of that board who was Fianna Fáil and how dare members of the Fianna Fáil Government appoint a man who is Fianna Fáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, that matter has so often been repeated in the Dáil and Seanad that I really think Ministers and boards are afraid to appoint anybody who is Fianna Fáil to a position on a board. <Col N="2049" /> A man came to me recently and asked me to recommend him for a position. He said he was a Fianna Fáil supporter for many years and that he was secretary of a Fianna Fáil cumann.  I said: &ldquo;If you mention that fact you will never be appointed, no matter how good you are.&rdquo;  That is what I feel about it and that is what is felt down the country by the people who know.  It is not felt by the people who do not know.  People who do not know the difference read the debates in the Dáil and the Seanad and sometimes they come to us and ask us to use our influence to get them positions.  We do our best to assure them that if we tried to use any influence we would probably disqualify them from going for the appointment and that probably they would have no chance of the job at all if we put in a word on their behalf. There has been an attempt made to purify public life, in spite of the views of some people, yet these views are still instilled into them by speeches such as we have heard here to-day.  I wish it would end, for the sake of the purity of public life.  It does no good, it is not genuine, and the people who make those statements do not believe them.</P>

I am sorry that does exist and I was glad to hear the Minister take a strong attitude when he said that, in any appointment under him, politics does not come into the question.  I hope, at the same time, that the dice is not loaded against any man who belongs to his Party.</P>

      <Col N="2050" /> Senator Sweetman also referred to the memorandum of association of a company.  I am surprised that he did so, as he admits that he knows perfectly well that, when a company is being formed, the memorandum of association sets out the objects of the company and, in doing so, every industry or trade that could possibly be carried on by the company originally intended to be formed is set out.  He has seen it and so have I, as I have drafted them.  We give power to people to establish hotels, to run laundries, to become soap makers and so on, even to be tailors and haircutters and anything else they like.  That is done in order that their rights will not be confined in any way.  It is not done for the sake of giving them power to do that, as the one hundredth part of the powers given are never adopted and it was never intended they would be adopted, but for fear anything would ever occur in some far distant date that would make it necessary for the company to enter into a particular business.  That is put in, even if it is only to happen 200 years hence, in order to save the company the necessity of making application to the court to alter the memorandum of association. There is nothing in that point, which is just a debating point and I am sorry it is made.  I do not know why this debate has lasted so long and I hope I have not added much to its length.  I thought it would have been over a long time ago.</P>

      <P>Like Senator Summerfield, I was struck by Senator Sir John Keane's use of the words &ldquo;speculator in real estate&rdquo; in describing the Irish Tourist Board.  No doubt, the board will be dealing in real estate, nor would I altogether object to the use of the word &ldquo;speculation&rdquo; in that regard, unless the Senator desires to give it an unsavoury meaning.</P>

      <P>They will be speculating in real estate, but also no doubt they will endeavour to eliminate as far as possible the element of speculation <Col N="2051" /> in their transactions.  In so far as the real estate dealer may acquire property with a view to its subsequent development and resale at an enhanced value, there is a similarity to the method of operation of the Tourist Board in regard to their resort development schemes.</P>
      <P>There has been much discussion concerning the constitution of the Tourist Board and I do not think it gets rid of the issues which were raised in the Second Reading debate for Senator Sweetman to say that he did not refer to the board.  Associates of his on the same bench did refer to the board.  Senator Crosbie made a positive statement that the members of the board were appointed solely for their political opinions.  Senator Hayes's references may not have been as direct, but Senator Hayes is not always noteworthy for direct references, yet he got the idea across just as effectively.  I named the members of the board during the Second Reading debate, though I disliked having to do so.  Most of the members of such boards have business associations of other kinds and do not like to be drawn into political controversy.  I regret particularly if I made a reference to Lord Monteagle which might have caused him annoyance.  If I understood his political past, that will at least be an indication that his politics were not taken into account when he was made a member of the board.</P>
      <P>Senator Sir John Keane asked if the board have had expert advice in respect to their hotel operations. They have expert advice.  They have employed not merely technical people with considerable experience but from time to time they have employed consultants to advise them on particular aspects of their work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Crosbie asked why no hotel proprietor is on the Tourist Board. The answer to that question is quite definite: I think a hotel proprietor should not be on the Tourist Board.  I know that the Commission on Vocational Organisation made a similar criticism of the board, but I think it was based on a misunderstanding of <Col N="2052" /> the functions of the board.  It has responsibility for supervising hotels generally and may have the obligation of imposing penalties upon hotels which do not carry on their business in accordance with the board's standards. I should think that the majority of hotel proprietors would object to some competitor of theirs being on the board and exercising these powers in relation to them.  We could have had five hotel proprietors&mdash; or some other number&mdash;on the board, and that might have been a very useful thing for those five individuals; but I am sure that all the other hotel proprietors would feel they would prefer a board which did not include persons actively engaged in the hotel business.</P>
    <P>The company which is set up by the board to manage temporarily these hotel properties is in a different position. That board, I understand does contain amongst its members a person who has had very long experience and has very high reputation in the hotel management business.  It may interest Senator Mrs. Concannon to know that one member is also a lady.</P>

      <P>That is true, but I make reference to the lady, arising out of the suggestion that the board, in acquiring properties and arranging for the establishment of a hotel business at Ballinahinch, was acting contrary to the interests of local hotel proprietors. So far as I know, all the local hotel proprietors strongly favoured that development by the board.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>When Senator Sweetman asks by what particular process the board's interests in that company will be transferred from the board to ordinary private shareholders, I cannot answer his question precisely.  The intention is that this company, which will have a temporary existence, will complete works of construction and equipment and establish the hotels as going concerns which will, at that stage, be sold to the public.  It may be that individual properties will be disposed of separately.  It may be that a whole series of hotels will be offered as a single business as operated through this company.  The intention is that the public, if they wish to avail themselves of it, will be given the opportunity of taking an interest in it and acquiring it.</P>
      <P>It is hoped that the board will, in fact, cease to have any financial interest in the undertaking at that stage. Perhaps, it is necessary to state that this company is not the only one the board has promoted.  The board has also promoted a company to develop its Tramore properties.  It is a local company, but it was promoted by the board.  It consists of local business people and their function is to manage and direct the general development of the property which the board has reclaimed and developed, and in the case of every property that the board has got, development work will probably be completed by local initiative.  It may have to take steps to encourage, assist or promote a local business company as an alternative to doing the job itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He mentioned the question of holiday camps.  I would be delighted if private business people came to the board and offered to establish these camps with their own capital, and to run them under their own management. That may happen, but if it does not happen, I will not object to the <Col N="2054" /> board promoting the establishment of a company for that purpose, even though it may have to proceed, as in the case of the hotel company, through a holding company for a period until they have established the commercial possibilities of the business.  Whether it is done one way or the other the board will have the obligation to see that the development of workers' holiday camps will proceed.</P>
    <P>May I say at once, that I entirely disagree with Senator Sweetman that Nissen huts would make suitable equipment for holiday camps.  I think that Nissen huts would be most unsuitable, and if the board made a proposition to me to establish holiday camps on the basis of a collection of Nissen huts, I would object most strongly.  The picture in my mind of holiday camps for workers and their families consists of more than huts in which they can sleep. When I am talking of workers' holiday camps, I am thinking of properly constructed camps with swimming pools and restaurants, and proper sewerage arrangements and water supplies, and everything that tends to comfort and health, and those things must be planned and developed on a proper basis.</P>
    <P>These holiday camps were established over wide areas in Great Britain before the war.  They were established by a private company, but I think their establishment was encouraged by the Government with a view to having mobilisation centres for troops when a war developed.  The fact is that these camps were commercially most successful. Our population distribution and industrial conditions are different from those of Britain but, nevertheless, we have to secure the establishment of those camps here, and I believe that in favourable circumstances they can be as commercially successful here as they were in Britain.</P>
    <P>I know that Senator Foran may feel it is wrong that this State board, having established these businesses, should dispose of them to private interests.  The board has not as its primary object the establishment of hotels and camps.  It has to encourage their establishment and supervise their management.  It intervenes in these <Col N="2055" /> businesses only to encourage and stimulate private enterprise&mdash;only to get things going when private enterprise is holding back.  Its primary purpose is to encourage private enterprise.</P>
    <P>Senator Duffy complained that the standard of comfort and cleanliness in some hotels he experienced was not high.  That, I think, is probably true. The board will necessarily proceed to raise the standard of hotel accommodation step by step.  I mentioned here, already, the opinion held by the board, but it would not be reasonable to establish very high standards in 1945, and to insist on their realisation by hotel proprietors.  It will undoubtedly raise its requirements as time goes on, and as it becomes easier for hotel proprietors to acquire new equipment, to install new furniture and generally to get rid of the objectionable conditions which are sometimes found in hotels.</P>
    <P>Of course, in every hotel, cleanliness can be achieved straightway and one of the matters to which the board is giving particular attention is the standard of cleanliness which is achieved, and I think that if cleanliness is, in fact, achieved, deficiencies in equipment will be less important.</P>
    <P>I cannot possibly deal with Senator Duffy's points about Córas Iompair Éireann and Hayes' Hotel in Thurles. The last I heard about Hayes' Hotel in Thurles was when a member of the Seanad, not here this evening, was anxious to attend a race meeting in Thurles when the use of motor cars for attendance at race meetings was prohibited and a Presidential election happened to be in progress for which cars were allowed.  The member concerned plastered his car with slogans &ldquo;Up O'Kelly&rdquo; and attended the race meeting.</P>

      <P>There was one point referred to by Senator Duffy&mdash;he said the Department had refused to <Col N="2056" /> increase the allocation of tea and sugar to a hotel because it was getting increased business.  The fact is that no hotel has been getting an increased allocation of tea and sugar because it is doing an increased business.  It is probably true that every hotel and restaurant in the country has been doing increased business as a result of the rationing of those commodities. It would not be possible to increase supplies of rationed goods because of increased business.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That was a useful change for the people that operated somewhere else.  However, I am not in a position to talk about the circumstances, and, consequently, I cannot deal with that point.  Senator Sir John Keane referred to the problem of staggering holidays.  I do not wish to deal with that at any length except to say that I did interest myself in the matter at the request of the Tourist Board before the war.  I found very considerable difficulty in getting any measure of agreement amongst industrial managements and others concerned on a practicable plan.</P>
      <P>The school authorities have their difficulties and cannot very well alter the period during which the schools are open during the year, particularly as examinations have to be arranged. The conflicting views of industrial directors and of trade union officials who were consulted, as well as others, as to the most suitable time for holidays and as to the practicability of spreading holidays over a longer period, made it very difficult to work out a scheme which would be accepted. No doubt, we could enforce the staggering of holidays by legislation, but I think that would be a form of Government interference which no Government would be anxious to undertake because of the unpopularity which would be bound to follow from it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is true to say that everybody <Col N="2057" /> would like to get their holidays in the first week or the first fortnight of August, but the fact is that everybody cannot get them at that period without having such congestion at holiday resorts that holiday comforts would be impossible.  If we could devise a system for staggering holidays we could make enjoyable holidays more easily obtainable and we would be lengthening the holiday season which would help the providers of holiday facilities, thereby assisting considerably the problem of the efficient and economical management of these businesses here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the Minister consider the question of being able to encourage the staggering of holidays by better transport concessions in the non-rush periods?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I was about to deal with the Senator's point about transport facilities.  On the question of devising an arrangement for staggering holidays&mdash;it is a phrase I do not like but it conveys the right idea&mdash;I should mention that so far as I have been able to ascertain, efforts to that end made in Great Britain were no more successful there than they were here.  Senator Sweetman referred to the possibility of cheap transport to holiday resorts.  It is, of course, true that in normal times the railway companies did provide cheap holiday transport.  Not merely were week-end excursions a normal feature of railway operation, but we had holiday trains during the week and special holiday season tickets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These were, I think, a regular practice. We cannot have these facilities now because the curtailment of transport makes it impossible to run excursion trains or to give special excursion facilities or to attract travellers to the public transport services by any reduction of fares.  This year, fortunately, we will have much more ample transport facilities by rail and road than we had in any year for the last four or five years, but it will still be, I think, a year or perhaps two years before we will reach the stage at which excursion trains or other exceptional <Col N="2058" /> transport facilities can be provided at cheap rates.  I should think, however, that it would not be necessary for the Tourist Board to do anything about that.  The transport operators will be willing to do it in their own interest.  I want to say, in answer to the specific point that was raised, that the Tourist Board has not any power under legislation to use the money advanced to it for the purpose of subsidising rail rates or for the giving of grants towards a reduction of fares for that purpose.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>We may hope, I suppose, for some reduction in fares this season in view of the reduction in the price of petrol?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There will be a reduction in general fares and a considerable expansion of facilities.  Senator Sweetman is perturbed about the scope of the functions taken in the memorandum of association of Fáilte, Teoranta.  Senator O'Dea, I think, gave a correct explanation of why that is the normal commercial practice.  I want to point out that, in so far as that company is operating properties which will ultimately be disposed of by means of sale, it is desirable that there should not be handicaps or restrictions imposed which might depreciate their value, in the course of time. I could not attempt to say how soon or how late it may be that that company will be operating without any public financial support.  It will then be entitled to engage in any business which any other citizen can freely engage in.  I think it would be undesirable that we should place it in the position that it would at that stage, if it wanted to extend its activities, have to seek an amendment of its memorandum of association.  The memorandum, I understand, makes reference to distilling, brewing and other activities.  I would point out that no one can engage in the business of brewing and distilling without going through certain legal formalities and getting certain licences.  That situation will apply, of course, in the case of this company as in the case of anybody else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2059" /> With regard to the staff of the Tourist Board, the procedure, I understand, followed by the board in appointing staff is to advertise vacancies in the Press, to invite applications for these vacancies and to have a committee of the board interview the applicants, placing them in order of merit.  Senator Sweetman asked about the assistant secretary and the solicitor. I can give no information as to these appointments.  I do not know the names of the persons who were appointed or anything about them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LouisODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that the board has any solicitor.  So far as I know, they engage different solicitors through the country whenever they require them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The obligation on the board is to get the best staff it can. It will, of course, be aware of the necessity of avoiding any suspicion that, in choosing its staff, it was influenced by improper motives.  I do not think it is desirable that we should place upon these organisations the obligation of recruiting staffs through the Local Appointments Commission. Under some of the Acts establishing boards of this kind the boards are empowered to use the Local Appointments Commission when they require staff, but, as a general rule, it is not practicable to undertake and carry on a commercial enterprise with the condition that staff can only be recruited through the Local Appointments Commission. I do not know if Senators appreciate precisely how long it takes for the Local Appointments Commission to function.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LouisODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is always months and sometimes years.  Clearly, no board engaged in commercial work could be required to face that prolonged delay before securing the staff which its activities need.  I realise that it is inevitable that any organisation functioning under this Government will be open to the accusation of giving preference to supporters of this Government. When this Government disappears, and when another Government <Col N="2060" /> takes its place, the same allegations will be made, possibly by myself, in relation to that Government.</P>
      <P>The fact is that no body of people in charge of enterprises of this kind will allow themselves to be saddled with dud staff merely for political reasons, if they know that their individual credit, as well as the success of the whole enterprise, will very largely depend not so much on the board as on the efficiency of the staff acting under the board.  I have never found, in the case of any of those boards, reason to believe that any consideration was applied in the appointment of staff other than that of getting the best people.  My personal practice has been to refuse to allow my name to be used even for reference purposes by people applying for positions under these boards.  Needless to remark, I get a very large number of letters asking me to assist them or their sons or daughters in getting appointments from one or other of those organisations because these people believe, from speeches made in the Dáil and Seanad, that it is all a matter of influence. Invariably, they are informed that I have no function whatever regarding the appointment of staff in these organisations and that their applications should be addressed to the secretary or manager, as the case may be. That causes political difficulty for me, because those people, I am sure, do not always believe that the answer is true and think that I am just putting them off.  In due course, it will come to be understood that it is personal merit which will be the deciding factor.  I have never given any board with which I am concerned any instruction or suggestion that they are not free to appoint members of Fianna Fáil, as they are free to appoint people of any other political persuasion, if they are the best people.  I have no doubt that the supporters of Fianna Fáil are the best people.</P>

The board had such a scheme, but when they went to discuss their project with the Dublin Corporation&mdash;it was quite clear that the co-operation of Dublin Corporation would be required&mdash;the Dublin Corporation authorities intimated that they would rather do the whole job themselves.

      <P>There are two golf clubs at Dollymount.  Whether or not the plans of Dublin Corporation will involve any interference with the golf courses, I cannot say.  Senator Sir John Keane asked where the well-considered plans to which reference had been made were.  I could produce here details of the work which the board proposes to do&mdash;the areas they propose to acquire and the different proposals for development of those areas&mdash;but that would, I think, be undesirable, because the board is quite free to change its plans at any time if it can get better plans and, in the second place, what the Seanad really requires is a general indication of the manner in which the board will proceed.  That I tried to give.  Senator Foran asked about Portmarnock.  There, the board acquired an estate with a house on it. The area of the estate is to be developed. Roads will be built through it which will give access to the public from the main road to the strand, parks will be laid out, shelters and bandstands will be erected and the area will be levelled and improved so that there will be normal holiday-resort facilities there.  A house being on the estate, they are going to use it as a hotel but the whole of the estate area will be developed in accordance with the board's general scheme and will be available to members of the public who wish to use it.  The development plan for that area&mdash;the construction of those roads, promenades and so forth&mdash;requires the co-operation of the Dublin County Council.  I understand that the commissioner acting for the county council has agreed to undertake certain expenditure in the provision of a water supply and other public services which are necessary.  All the work will begin at the same time&mdash;the country council work and the work of the Tourist Development Board.  What has happened at Portmarnock is not, as Senators seem to assume, that the board has acquired an estate which shuts off the sea from the main road and is using that estate purely as an amenity to the hotel.  The board acquired the estate with a view to <Col N="2063" /> developing it as an estate and, incidentally, got a house which they propose to use as a hotel.  One of the main purposes of the acquisition of the estate was to give access to the very excellent beach there.</P>

      <P>So far as I may have been responsible for prolonging this debate, I make no apology.  We are placing at the disposal of the board a large sum of money.  We shall probably never again have an opportunity of looking at this proposition from a business standpoint. There will be no annual vote, so far as I understand, on which the work of the board can be discussed.  We can only obtain enlightenment and bring criticism to bear on the operations of the board if somebody chooses to raise the matter when the accounts of the board are laid on the table of the House.  That is a roundabout and not satisfactory way for Houses of Parliament to keep in touch with institutions which have the spending of large sums of money.  I thought that it would not be long before my old colleague, Senator Foran, would remind me of my record in respect of the Electricity Supply Corporation.  I make him a present of the admission that I was wrong on that occasion.  But the fact that I was wrong on one occasion is probably a very good reason why I should not be wrong on all occasions. I am perfectly prepared to submit my record in the matter of criticism of State enterprises to a tribunal constituted, if you like, of both wings of the Labour Party, before which I should be glad to appear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like the Minister to enlighten us on two or three points. He referred to a very successful organisation in Great Britain which has developed holiday camps.  Those of us who keep in touch with the financial papers are aware that that organisation made a very successful flotation lately.  No sense of isolated nationality should prevent the Tourist Board from going to that body and saying, &ldquo;You have experience of holiday camps; would you consider coming over to our country, forming <Col N="2064" /> an Irish company and sending over men with the technical experience necessary for the establishment of such camps?&rdquo; That was done in the case of cement and sugar beet.</P>
    <P>The board might say: &ldquo;We have funds at our disposal to help you financially.  You have ample funds but there are certain limitations imposed by the Control of Manufactures Act which would make it necessary that a certain percentage of your directors must be of Irish nationality and that a certain percentage of the capital must be owned by Irish nationals.&rdquo;  Is there any objection to a policy of that kind being adopted because I believe that it would help the establishment of holiday camps if we approach the matter in that way? We would have the very best experience at our disposal.  If these people agreed to examine the proposition and then said: &ldquo;Commercially we do not think there is anything in it,&rdquo; that would be all to the good.  You would have got expert opinion on the possibility of an enterprise of that kind.</P>
    <P>The same remarks apply to trust houses.  There is a body which has experience of the smaller class of hotel. There again I feel that if a body like that were approached they would consider the question of forming an Irish company with the usual percentage of national capital and national directors. That would be far the best way of developing propositions of the character which the Tourist Board has to consider.  May I again say that I am not concerned&mdash;I have not been in touch with any Party&mdash;with this squabble over the political affiliations of the board or its officers, though I do know that it serves the Minister as a very useful red herring to enable him to avoid discussing the more businesslike aspects of the problem.  I do say definitely that the board is not constituted in a manner which would enable it to handle commercial propositions with the best chance of success. What commercial experience have any members of the board got?  I agree that they are men of the world and that they are fully qualified to deal with such matters as propaganda, advertising and publicity.  They know <Col N="2065" /> the political facets of Irish political life and they know local conditions, but they have no experience of dealing with commercial propositions, and it is entirely on commercial ventures that this money is to be spent.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister does not take exception to my describing them as speculative measures.  Surely men of commercial experience are necessary for that purpose.  Have any of the members of the board such experience? In a smaller way perhaps they have technical experience of hotel management. The men I have in mind would have experience of hotel management, as much general knowledge as directors would have, though they would not necessarily have risen from the ranks of the hotel and catering business. That is why I say that this board is not constituted to handle and develop commercial propositions.  I know that there are men of genius who have had no commercial experience but who have made quite a success of ventures of this kind.  I know there are such men in this city but I think these are the exceptions rather than the rule and I do say that is the danger facing us when we come to the expenditure of large sums of money by a body with really no experience and no qualifications to develop business propositions.</P>
    <P>There is one further point which I should like to put to the Minister if he thinks fit to reply to it.  Has he got a statutory obligation as Minister to examine these schemes independently of the board or is he prepared to accept the reports of the board, and the belief and the opinion of the board, that they are going to be a commercial success?  Of course, nobody in ventures of this kind can say conclusively whether they are going to be successful. Take the Portmarnock Hotel, for instance.  The Minister has told us that he believes that it will be possible in a short time to sell the Portmarnock Hotel to private enterprise but the Minister has never said &ldquo;only if it is a paying proposition.&rdquo;  I think Senator Foran pointed out that it was a very unsuitable building and that it was never built for a hotel.  That means that it can be sold to private enterprise only if it is commercially successful, <Col N="2066" /> otherwise it has got to be kept by the board and run at a loss.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>As to the two points raised by the Senator, I have an obligation to examine schemes submitted to me by the board, but I want to make it quite clear that I have declined to accept responsibility for an examination of the technical aspects. If the board produces a scheme which involves some engineering works and if they say that an engineer was employed by them and that he has certified that the scheme is feasible, then the board's engineers must be trusted to look after the technical part of their proposals.  It is the board's responsibility to see that these duties are carried out.  I have the responsibility to examine schemes from a general aspect before approving of them.  There have been some schemes submitted by the board which have not been approved or have not yet been approved or which have been sent back for re-examination regarding certain aspects.  An obligation is on the Minister to examine these schemes before approving of advances to the board, in other words the making of advances to the board is not an automatic business after the board has made application.</P>
      <P>The Senator is wrong in his assumption that the Control of Manufactures Act applies to the operation of hotels or holiday camps.  It does not.  There is in fact no statutory limitation on the ownership of hotels or holiday camps.  If a foreign company wanted to establish and operate hotels here now, it could do so.  It does not have to apply for a licence or seek any approval from a Government Department. The same remarks apply to holiday camps.  If the company, to which the Senator referred, wanted to establish hotels and holiday camps here they could come in and do so.  If the board have to face the responsibility of getting holiday camps established through their own initiative or through a company promoted by them for the purpose, then no doubt they will seek the best advice they can get anywhere in the world to ensure that they will be on the right lines.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>On the motion that the Bill be returned to the Dáil I would like to refer to something that was raised at an earlier stage in the debate. The House will remember that I drew attention to the conditions under which a section of the hotel staff were employed, and I made it perfectly clear I was speaking only of the commercial and executive staff.  The Minister I think misunderstood the point I was making or at least did not apprehend its narrow character.  He addressed himself&mdash;but perhaps like Senator Sir John Keane it was a red herring&mdash;to the problem of organising hotel staffs as a whole so that trade union organisation might regulate the conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as I understand, the waiters, waitresses and kitchen staff in all the hotels in Dublin and in the vicinity of Dublin are organised in trade unions and as far as I know there are no complaints regarding their conditions <Col N="2068" /> of employment.  I think they actually are employed under negotiated agreements which cover a long period of time.  I am concerned, however, with employees who are almost exclusively clerical, employed as clerks in the hotel office and as receptionists and typists. The number of such persons in a hotel is usually quite small and I have pointed out that their wages run from 15/- to 25/- a week.  In the last few hours, however, I have learned that wages in some of the provincial hotels are in fact as low as 5/- and 7/6 a week, so that the case I was making is not confined merely to Dublin or the vicinity of Dublin but is generally applicable to the whole hotel industry throughout the country.</P>
    <P>The Minister tells us, first and foremost, that it is not the function of the board to examine the conditions under which staffs are employed.  To that I have replied that there is a duty somewhere, and if the Minister resents the suggestion that it is the duty of the Government I must join issue with him. If he asks me whether I am willing that the Government should intervene rather than leave it to the trade unions, I answer &ldquo;yes.&rdquo;  There is no equivocation about that.  It has been the practice of this Government, of their predecessors and of the British Government since 1909 to intervene on behalf of unorganised workers to secure that there are certain minimum conditions of employment.  The Minister himself operates 15 trade boards which are established for the protection of persons, mainly people who are unorganised and unable to protect themselves. Actually the conception of the trade board was that that organisation was set up by the State only when there was no effective machinery available to regulate wages and conditions of employment.  It is not merely wages.  I do not desire to bore the House with quotations from complaints that have reached me.</P>
    <P>I restricted myself to those references that concern wages and hours of young girls but I want now to draw your attention to the conditions under which the staff lives in a leading County Dublin hotel which charges its guests 12 guineas a week.  This complaint <Col N="2069" /> was given me by a person who has access to the hotel and who knows it intimately.  He said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I think it is right that you should know how the clerical staff are treated in some of our posh hotels.  I know the ins and outs of &mdash; hotel. I am in a position to give you details about it, which probably the public do not suspect.  For instance, the hours are long, the food is poor and meagre.  The pay is 15/- a week for young girls but paid monthly for trained experienced office clerks. Three of these girls sleep in one small bedroom at the end of an underground passage.  Part of this passage is used as a potato store.  At the other end is the furnace-room with a temperature like a turkish bath. Here certain members of the staff dine.  It is known officially as the staff hall.  It is monstrous that people should be expected to use a room like this while the furnace is kept on.  The Tourist Board inspectors visit this hotel to see that the accommodation, the beds, the linen, etc., provided for the guests are up to the mark, but God help the staff&mdash; nobody bothers about them.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is a description of the conditions under which young people are employed in an hotel than can afford to get 12 guineas a week from its guests.</P>
    <P>I refuse to accept the view that the Government have no obligation in this matter.  I refuse to accept the view that the Tourist Board inspectors should confine themselves to an examination merely of that portion of the hotel occupied by the guests, without considering the conditions under which the staff is employed, because in the long run the success and popularity of our hotels will depend on the manner in which the guests are received by the staff.  It is monstrous to think that people working under these conditions could be cheerful, pleasant or agreeable in dealing with guests realising what the guest is getting and what they are getting themselves.</P>
    <P>If the Minister wants to draw this red herring across my path as to whether I am in favour of the State intervening, of the Tourist Board intervening, <Col N="2070" /> to protect the interests of these commercial employees&mdash;typists, receptionists and clerks&mdash;of the hotels, I say I am in favour of their doing it. I say, too, that if the trade unions have a function in that matter they have neglected to perform their duties. I do not know if the trade unions would agree that they are under any obligation to the clerical staffs.  They may not, and it may be true that the clerical staffs do not join trade unions, but let us bear in mind the fact that the clerical staff are not in the same position as the kitchen staff, the waiters or waitresses.</P>
    <P>The clerical staff usually consists of two or three girls as against 20, 30 or 40 people employed throughout the whole hotel establishment.  By the very nature of their employment these girls in the office are more or less in conflict with the rest of the staff and I think it is probable they feel that they may not belong to the same tribunal as the other members of the staff.  There is not much point in their joining any other union because their strength does not allow of their own organisation&mdash;two or three of them in isolation&mdash;and by the fact that they were combined with the hotel staff as a whole they have no chance whatever while being combined that way to secure better conditions for themselves.  Therefore I suggest it should be part of the Minister's duty in implementing the provisions of this Bill, to ensure that the conditions of employment of the clerical and executive staff, people who are unable to defend themselves, will become part of the function of the Tourist Board.  I hope the licence required by a hotel will be refused where the board is not satisfied that proper conditions are observed in respect of the hotel staffs.</P>

For very deliberate reasons, I referred to people by titles rather than by names, and since the name was mentioned&mdash;as I say, I accept that the Minister did not mention it intentionally&mdash;it is only right that there should be a disclaimer on the records of the House.</P>

      <P>On the question raised by Senator Duffy, while I would not go so far as he goes in regard to any responsibility of the Tourist Board for the wages or even for the hours of the staff, I do feel that there is a certain responsibility with regard to accommodation.  I do not think it is right to label a hotel and admit it in a high-class category without some adequate regard to the conditions under which the staff live.  The whole character of the hotel should enable an adequate staff to be provided for, and a good, high-class hotel should not be so labelled unless adequate accommodation is provided for all its staff.  I agree with Senator Duffy to the extent that there should be some responsibility on the board's inspectors to satisfy themselves that the staff accommodation is adequate to the class of hotel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>My objections to Senator Duffy's observations concerning the conditions of employment or remuneration of clerical staff in a hotel are due entirely to the fact that they were brought in here irrelevantly. Senator Duffy knows as well as I do, and as well as every other Senator knows, that the Tourist Board has no powers which could be used to remedy the grievances of which he complains. Nevertheless, he endeavoured to leave the House under the impression that these grievances were due to some dereliction of duty by the Tourist Board or by the Government.  Provided he understands clearly, as other Senators understand, that whatever conditions exist in regard to the employment <Col N="2072" /> of or the accommodation given to clerical staffs, it is not the fault of the Tourist Board and that the Tourist Board have no powers in law which give them a right to interfere, then we can deal with that matter.  If he tells me that the trade union concerned is unable to organise the people affected, and that the trade is one which, because of its nature, cannot be organised, then the law does provide machinery by which action can be taken, by which the State can be given powers to regulate rates of remuneration at least, that is, by the use of the Trade Boards Acts.</P>
      <P>If there is any difficulty about applying the Trade Boards Acts, by reason of the fact that the persons concerned are only a class of persons employed in the trade and not all the persons employed in the trade, then proposals for legislation which, amongst other things, would alter that law, will be introduced soon and be before the Seanad within a month or so, and the Senator can make any reference he likes then.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill has a double purpose: it will amend and to some extent consolidate the law.  Some of the legislation which it is proposed to repeal has been on the Statute Book for more than a century.  For instance, the series of Acts relating to the construction of bridges, beginning with the Bridge Act of 1813, contain a code which is now antiquated, but under which hitherto we have had to operate.  Part IV of the present Bill is drafted to replace all these Bridge Acts which, as will be seen from the Schedule, will be wholly repealed.  Similarly, in regard to the rating provisions contained in Part II, these will bring about a much needed simplification of the law of rating in urban areas.  A new municipal rate will take the place of the various rates levied in boroughs and urban districts and separate poor rates, town rates, sanitary rates, improvement rates and other rates in towns provided for under local Acts will disappear.  This, of course, involves the repeal of the law relating to the town rates.  The county councils levy one rate, the poor rate. As only a fraction of this rate is now devoted to public assistance or the relief of the poor its name is a misnomer and it is proposed that it shall be known henceforth as the county rate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill is divided into five parts. The first part is preliminary and general and is confined to definitions and the usual sections relating to bringing the Act into operation, the making of regulations, the adaptation of existing enactments and the repeals.  It follows the usual lines adopted in earlier local government Bills and calls for no special comment.  Part II relates <Col N="2074" /> principally to financial matters and largely to the proposed change in the rating system in urban areas to which I have referred.  Before dealing with particular sections, it will, I think, be convenient to refer briefly to the existing position in regard to rates.  In the four county boroughs and the borough of Dún Laoghaire, a rate, called the municipal rate, is levied.  The only other rate levied in these areas is called the contract water rate, which is a form of charge for special water supplies.  In other boroughs and urban districts, at least two rates are levied, poor rate and borough or town rate.</P>
    <P>During the 19th century it was not unusual for towns to promote local Acts and many of these local Acts provided for special rates each with its own peculiar incidence.  Now, it is sometimes a matter of difficulty in urban areas which have their own Acts to be sure what exactly is the law.  For instance, in some urban areas land bears all the rates in full, in others it bears some rates in full, and others only in part.  The poor rate I should explain, perhaps, in urban areas is the rate levied in order to meet the demand of the county council.  The term town rate, which is in general use in urban districts, means all the rates which are raised by urban district councils to supply the funds they require for their own activities.</P>
    <P>It includes the rate under the Towns Improvement Act, 1854, and may include rates for other expenses and rates raised under local Acts.  In the municipal boroughs excluding county boroughs and Dún Laoghaire, there is a borough rate.  Public Health expenses &mdash;expenses under the Public Health Acts&mdash;are raised under Section 226 of the Public Health Act, 1878, which contains a number of provisos relating to the nature of the rate to be used and its special incidence.  These provisos have given rise to a diversity of practice.  For example in the Borough of Drogheda the sanitary rate is a flat rate on all hereditaments whereas in most urban districts land and railways are rated one-quarter of the valuation.</P>
    <P>In Galway, and Senators O Buachalla and O'Dea may be interested in this, it is doubtful by what rate or with <Col N="2075" /> what incidence the sanitary expenses of the corporation should be raised. The position in several of the towns is similar to that which existed in the county boroughs before the introduction of a single municipal rate by the various City Management Acts.  Those Acts altered the position by substituting one municipal rate with one definite incidence for the various rates with different incidence.  In consolidating the rates, a difficulty arose by reason of the fact that hereditaments of certain classes had been exempted from some of the older rates and it would therefore have been unjust to require the occupiers to pay the whole of the new municipal rate.  The difficulty was met by ascertaining the average amount in the pound paid by hereditaments of each exempted class in the county boroughs or in Dún Laoghaire, as the case may be, over a number of years immediately before the passing of the appropriate City Management Act and the proportion which that amount bore to the average rate in the pound paid in the same period by an ordinary hereditament.</P>
    <P>This proportion was expressed as a fraction, and hereditaments of the exempted class were rated to the municipal rate only on a fraction of their full valuation.  For instance to take again the example of land if it were found as in the case of Dublin that agricultural land was assessed at a sum that was approximately equal to about half the rate on the full valuation then the fraction for agricultural land was one-half.  The present Bill in Part II proposes to do for the urban districts what has already been done for the county boroughs and Dún Laoghaire, that is to consolidate existing rates in each area into one rate.  The provisions of the City Management Acts have been adopted to this purpose.</P>
    <P>These provisions have been found in the county boroughs to work satisfactorily and without confusion.  The effect will be that there will in future be only one rating law for all rates. That law, I should say, will be the existing law relating to poor rate.  Let me say that the law of poor rate is not perhaps in every respect ideal, but <Col N="2076" /> it is more certain and easier to ascertain than any other rating law in force. No doubt in time, when the question of valuation for rating has been disposed of, a comprehensive rating Bill will be undertaken.  Such legislation will be rendered easier by the present Bill which will eliminate the divergencies, to which I have already referred, created by local Acts.</P>
    <P>There is, however, one matter in which the introduction of the municipal rate into the urban districts and other boroughs is more difficult than in the county boroughs.  Each county borough was dealt with by its own separate Act, so that in ascertaining the valuation fractions it was only necessary to consider the incidence of the rates in the particular borough in which the Act applied.</P>
    <P>This Bill, on the other hand, is a much more comprehensive measure. It deals with a great number of areas in which, as I have already explained, the incidence of the rates is not uniform.  The burden of rates on the particular hereditament could not, therefore, be kept on substantially the same basis in every area except by the inclusion of the Act of valuation fractions for each area as was done by the City Management Acts.  We have rejected the idea of fractions being fixed for each area by Order of the Minister but have adopted the alternative method of having the same fraction for all boroughs and a slightly lower fraction for all urban districts that are not boroughs for each type of rateable property that under general law gets partial exemption at present.</P>
    <P>Under the existing law, there are altogether four different types of property which will be rated on a fraction of their valuations when the new municipal rate is being assessed. They are agricultural land, canals, land used as railway and half rents. As I have already explained, the first three enjoy in most towns exemption from the town rate to the extent of three-quarters of the valuation.  The fourth class of property, half rents, is half the annual rent derived by the owner or other person interested in any rateable property which is exempted from poor rate by reason of <Col N="2077" /> being used for public or charitable purposes, or for the purposes of science, literature and fine arts.</P>
    <P>Owners of these half rents are rated to poor rate but not to town rate. Under the Bill, one half of the half rent will be rated to the full municipal rate.</P>
    <P>In Part II it is proposed to alter the method by which commissioners of a town that is not an urban district will obtain expenses and assimilate it to that by which a subsidiary body of the county council obtains funds.  At present the town commissioners raise their own rate.  They have separate rate books and rate collectors.  Their rate is limited to 2/6, but that limit, I should explain, may be exceeded if the excess is caused by housing expenses and the expenses of school meals.</P>
    <P>There are at present 23 places constituted as towns under the Towns Improvement Act, 1854, but in the case of five of these towns elected commissioners are no longer functioning, their business having been transferred to the respective county councils.  The total aggregate sum raised in rates in these towns is small in relation to the total rates levied.  What is proposed in the Bill is that the county council should levy on the town the money required to meet the expenses of the commissioners.  As the county council will be at some expense in making the levy by reason of poundage payable to the collector and the irrecoverable rates they are also to be allowed to charge certain additional expenses.</P>
    <P>The position in relation to these small towns is that they are generally unable to employ whole-time officers or to maintain the same standard of service as the larger authorities.  We hope that, by relieving them of the business of levying and collecting rates, they will be freer to attend to the business entrusted to them, and that they will be, from the point of view of the ratepayers, a significant economy in administration.</P>
    <P>Part II of the Bill contains two sections, Sections 14 and 23, which are almost identical and which relate to rates on vacant premises.  Section 14 <Col N="2078" /> relates to premises in a county but not in an urban area.  Section 23 relates to premises in an urban area, and both sections, as I think I have already indicated, relate to premises that are unoccupied at the time of the making of the rate.  They empower the rating authority to rate the owner who will be able to get a refund in due course if he can show that the premises are unoccupied for the purpose of alterations, or repairs, or because a tenant could not be got at a reasonable rent. In general terms, the sections are the same as corresponding sections in the City Management Acts, except in one particular.  In the cities of Dublin, Cork and Limerick and the Borough of Dún Laoghaire the amount of the refund is limited to one-twenty-fourth of the rate for each month the premises are vacant.  That means that not more than six months rates can be refunded in any one year.  Under Section 14 of this Bill the whole rates can be refunded if that course is justified under the section.</P>
    <P>I think I should also, in order to avoid here the confusion which arose in the Dáil, mention that under the Increase of Rent and Mortgage Interest (Restriction) Act, 1923, the owner of an unoccupied dwelling house to which that Act applied became liable for the payment of rates.  In the year 1926, however, an amending Act provided that the owner should not be liable during any period not exceeding six months when the house was unoccupied for the purpose of the execution of additions, alterations or repairs, or by reason of the fact that the owner could not obtain a suitable tenant at a reasonable rent.  These provisions, as the House will recollect, were not reenacted in the Rent Restrictions Act of 1946, and have now lapsed. Sections 14 and 23 of this Bill, however, will do more than merely replace these lapsed provisions of the 1926 Act, because the proposed new section will apply not only to uncontrolled premises but also to controlled premises.  That is to say, they will apply to all premises which happen to be vacant at the time of the making of the rate.  That will not only replace the existing law but will <Col N="2079" /> simplify it at the same time.  The net effect of the sections will be this, that if an owner holds a house vacant in order to sell it or to keep out competitors, or for some other ulterior motive, he will have to pay the rates. If, on the other hand, the house is vacant because he wants to alter it or repair it, or make an addition to it, or because he cannot get a suitable tenant at a reasonable rent, then, though he will be called upon to pay the rates in the first instance, he can secure a refund as soon as he has shown that he is entitled to a refund in accordance with the section.  Let me stress this point, that the onus is imposed in the first place on the owner of unoccupied premises to pay the rates, and that the onus is put upon him in the second place of justifying his claim for a refund.</P>
    <P>Section 30 relating to insufficiency of rates has given rise to considerable discussion, and as some of the criticisms directed against the section obviously arose from a misunderstanding of its real effects, I should like to make clear what the section proposes to do.  Under the section, if a rating authority determine a rate in the pound which appears to the Minister to be insufficient to meet the expenses which a local authority must legally and properly incur, the Minister, after holding a local inquiry into this question of the sufficiency or insufficiency of the rate, may require the local authority to determine a new rate or, if it is more convenient, a supplementary rate.  If the local authority does not comply, or if the new rate or supplementary rate is still insufficient, the Minister may remove the members of that local authority from office.</P>
    <P>Now let me point out that this power of removal is one which the Minister has had since 1923 in any case in which the members of a local authority fail to discharge their duties duly and effectually.  Failure to make a sufficient rate to defray the legitimate and normal expenses, obligatory expenses in many cases, to be incurred by the local authority is failure to discharge a statutory duty; failure to discharge one of the primary duties of a local authority <Col N="2080" /> which is to provide money to ensure that the local services will be carried on satisfactorily and efficiently.</P>
    <P>We are not proposing to coerce any local authority to do everything that a prudent body would do but we are requiring them to do the minimum that they ought to do, failure to do which would either involve the local authority in debt or jeopardise the services for which they are responsible.  If this section were not in the Bill, we should be faced with a position which would, I think, be most inequitable and unsatisfactory. We have already had experience of it.  We have had cases in which, by reason of failure to make the rates, the local authority has been dissolved and the commissioner appointed to administer its affairs on behalf of the ratepayers was faced with the position that he had not power to raise the necessary moneys in the normal and regular way by means of the rates but had to raise them by borrowing from a bank, which, of course, involved the local ratepayers in additional expense</P>
    <P>Under the section, as it stands in this Bill, when a rate is found insufficient, the Minister will not proceed to hold an inquiry for the purpose of ascertaining whether or not the local authority has been negligent in the discharge of its duty but will hold an inquiry upon a narrow issue&mdash;that is to say, to ascertain whether the rate, as determined by the local authority, is sufficient or insufficient to enable it to discharge its responsibilities to its ratepayers effectively, efficiently and economically.  At that local inquiry, the local authority will be represented. If they have any justification for failing to make a sufficient rate, for failing to meet the demands of their officers, if they urge that these officers themselves have not been functioning efficiently, that they are not satisfied with the services provided by their servants in return for the revenues made available&mdash;these issues can all be threshed out at that local inquiry and the Minister will then be in a position to say whether or not the rate, as determined by the local authority, would be sufficient if the local authority's services were economically and efficiently administered.  If the case of the local <Col N="2081" /> authority be established, it will not be the local authority whose conduct will be reproved but it will be the conduct of the servants of the local authority.</P>
    <P>If, on the other hand, it is found that the local authority's services are being administered efficiently, that there is no fault to be found with its servants in the discharge of their duty, and that the local authority has been recalcitrant in its refusal to provide them with the finances to enable them to maintain those services properly, then the Minister can turn round to the local authority and say: &ldquo;You must give your officers a sufficient revenue to enable them to do their duty not only to you but to the community whom you represent.&rdquo;  If, having been given that chance, the local authority fails to comply with it, then the Minister can dissolve that local authority and put in a commissioner to administer its affairs.  Instead of having to go to the bank to raise the necessary moneys, the commissioner will be able to raise those moneys in the normal way through the rates.</P>
    <P>Let me put to the House an aspect of this matter which was not sufficiently stressed in the preceding debates on this section.  Apart from his general duty to see that the local authorities carry out the functions assigned to them, the Minister for Local Government and Public Health is concerned in another respect when a local authority will not provide by rates the revenue they require from that source.  If they refuse to provide the necessary finances out of the rates, then, if the local public services are to be carried out, borrowing will be inevitable.  But the lenders&mdash;the treasurers of the local authorities&mdash; cannot give overdrafts or temporary loans without the sanction of the Minister.  The Minister's sanction is accepted, I think, by the lenders as evidence that the loan is being raised in anticipation of some revenue which will enable the borrower&mdash;in this case the local authority&mdash;to extinguish the debt.  If, in fact, there is no revenue in sight&mdash;it cannot be in sight if the local authority refuses to raise it&mdash; then the Minister's sanction to <Col N="2082" /> borrowing becomes meaningless.  In fact, he cannot give his sanction, in my view, and the local services must come to a standstill.</P>
    <P>The business of local authorities is a subsidiary business.  It is a delegated business&mdash;delegated by the central authority, under statute, with a view to carrying on the local services.  Not one of those local authorities functions in its own right. They function under the Acts of the Oireachtas.  They function as subordinate, administrative bodies in the State and their duty, and their sole reason for existence, is that they carry on those services which the State and the community consider necessary for the common welfare of the people.</P>
    <P>If they fail, as I have said, to carry on those services and to pay their way from year to year, then the Minister for Local Government, charged with responsibility to the Dáil to ensure that local administration be carried on economically and efficiently, would fail in his duty if he allowed the local authorities to involve themselves so deeply in debt, in order to defray the cost of the local services, that they threw on future years and on other ratepayers an undue burden of taxation. That is the justification for Section 30.</P>
    <P>Section 31 of this Bill relates only to the present year.  This is the last year in which town commissioners will levy rates.  In future years, the rate will be levied, as I have explained, by the county council, on the demand of the town commissioners.  It is important that that fact should not be overlooked. The county council will levy no more on the town than is necessary to meet the demand of the town commissioners and the cost of collection of the rates.  At present, six members, out of a total of nine members, of a town commission have to sign the rate book for the town rate.  This is a requirement of a section in an Act of 1847 which will be repealed by the present Bill.  It is proposed, under Section 31, that non-compliance with that section will not invalidate the rate this year.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2083" /> Section 32 of the Bill has been inserted to meet a position which arises in a few counties this year.  As members will be aware, an increased allocation from the Road Fund was announced after the rate had been determined in some counties.  Certain of the councils in these counties altered the rate which, under the existing law, they had not power to do.  This section will give them the necessary legal authority in the matter for this year only.</P>
    <P>Section 33 relates to the division of districts for the purposes of rate collection.  The division of a rated area into collection districts is at present a matter for the manager.  It is a subject on which differences of opinion have arisen between some councils and managers and it is proposed in Section 33 that the Minister shall be responsible for any variations in these areas that need to be made.</P>
    <P>The final section in Part II&mdash;Section 34&mdash;is designed to place the occupiers of small dwellings owned by State authorities in the same position, as regards rates, as occupiers of dwellings that are not small dwellings. That is to say, that in the case of occupiers of houses which are owned by State authorities, the occupiers will be rated and not the owner.</P>
    <P>Part III of the Bill relates to officers and employees of local authorities and is intended to be supplementary to Part II of the Local Government Act, 1941, which is the principal code dealing with the staffs of local authorities. Section 36 is a more elaborate provision for amalgamating offices than that contained in Section 32 of the Act of 1941.  Section 32 of the Act of 1941 applied only to offices designated major offices.  The new section applies to all offices.  Section 37 is intended to meet the case of women officers whose conditions of appointment required them to retire on marriage and who have not, in fact, retired.  I should like to emphasise that it will not apply to officers to whom such a condition did not apply on appointment.  The performance of the duties of a particular office by a deputy during absence or illness of the holder of an office is already provided for by the Act of <Col N="2084" /> 1941, but in some instances it is doubtful whether the certificate of a deputy or substitute would be valid where the officer cannot act in person.  Section 38 is intended to regularise this position.</P>
    <P>Some misapprehension appears to have arisen regarding Section 39 which gives the Minister power to make regulations requiring an officer to devote the whole of his time to his official duties.  There again I should like to emphasise that there is no intention whatever of converting existing part-time officers into whole-time officers against their will.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the section is to enable the question of whole-time or part-time service to be settled in the same manner as other conditions of service.  The term &ldquo;whole-time&rdquo; which has been used in Superannuation Acts since 1865 has of course a strictly legal meaning.  It does not imply that an officer must devote all his waking hours to official duties.  In practice, it means that an officer cannot engage in other occupations during the time he is required for his official duties.  That is the spirit in which the section will be administered.</P>
    <P>Under Section 41 it is proposed to continue as part of the ordinary law certain powers at present vested in the Minister in relation to the pay of weekly wage earners and other employees of local authorities. Section 41 requires that any increase above the level of August, 1942, shall be sanctioned by the Minister.  It does not prevent increases&mdash;increases have in fact been granted&mdash;but ensures that they shall be examined in the light of all the circumstances affecting them.</P>
    <P>Part IV of the Bill, as I indicated in the opening of this statement, is intended to replace existing provisions in relation to the construction and reconstruction of bridges in which more than one road authority is directly interested.  It provides, as I have said, an entirely new procedure which is more direct and expeditious and presumably will be less expensive than that laid down by the code which has been in existence since the year 1813, with modifications, the latest of which was made in 1867.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2085" /> Under the new procedure where a bridge has to be built between the functional areas of two or more road authorities, the work will be undertaken by one of the road authorities and the cost will be contributed by all the road authorities concerned in proportions to be determined either by agreement among the road authorities or after the holding of a local inquiry.</P>
    <P>Any road authority, under this Part of the Bill, being of opinion that the construction or reconstruction of a bridge is expedient for the purpose of improving road communication between places within their functional area or between places within and places outside that area or for the purpose of improving road communications through that area, may make application to the Minister for a bridge Order.  This, I should like to emphasise, will be a reserved function of the local authority.  That is to say, it will be a function which will be reserved to the elected body and cannot be discharged by the manager.  The application for this bridge Order may make proposals for the defraying of the expenses of the work and of the maintenance of the bridge by two or more road authorities.</P>
    <P>The Order when made will determine which road authority will carry out the work and the proportions in which the expenses of the work and of future maintenance will be met by the road authorities concerned.  As I have said, it is possible that the road authorities may agree among themselves as to the terms in which a bridge Order is to be made.  Failing agreement, one of the road authorities may be called upon to make a preliminary report including any necessary surveys after which a local inquiry must be held before a bridge Order is made.</P>
    <P>Under the Harbours Act, 1946, provision is made by which the Minister for Industry and Commerce may authorise harbour authorities to carry out works.  The purpose of this provision is to obviate the need for private Bills on each occasion on which it is desired that a harbour authority should carry out a work.  Under Section 55 of the present measure Part IV will be applied to any harbour authority which is being authorised to construct or <Col N="2086" /> maintain a bridge.  Certain other provisions of that Part of the Bill will apply to railway companies and other persons other than road authorities who were required by or under any Act to construct or maintain the bridge in respect of which a bridge Order is sought.</P>
    <P>Part V of the Bill contains a number of miscellaneous provisions which could not be appropriately placed in any other part of the Bill.  They refer to a number of vexed questions which arose from time to time, matters about which there is some uncertainty in relation to the present law and matters in respect of which some amendment of the present law is required.  Sections 61 and 62, for instance, deal with the procedure to be followed when there is an equality of votes at meetings of the county councils or of committees of a local authority.  Under Section 61, the chairman of a council will not have a first vote or casting vote if he is not a member of the council.  Somebody may say: &ldquo;When can a chairman of a council not be a member of the council?&rdquo; It might happen that at the first meeting of the council held after a triennial election the outgoing chairman would not be a member of the new council; he, nevertheless, continues in office until the new chairman is elected, that is until his successor is appointed.  While it is true that a chairman who was not an elected member of the council and who chose to preside at the first meeting of the council after a triennial election would not have a vote or a casting vote, the casting vote of the chairman who is a member of the council is preserved except where it is provided that the decision is to be taken by lot and that is the significance of the reference to Section 43 in the Act of 1941.</P>
    <P>Section 63, is designed to make a local inquiry with its attendant delay and expense unnecessary where there is a wilful refusal or neglect on the part of the local authority to comply with an expressed statutory requirement. This section merely restores the position as it existed in the period from 1925 to 1942.  Under Section 64 of the Bill, when members of a local authority are removed from office the <Col N="2087" /> members nominated by them to subsidiary bodies will cease to hold office whether they were members of the parent body or not.  Under Section 65, the quorum for town commissioners is to be reduced from its present figure of five to three.</P>
    <P>The purpose of Section 66 is to straighten out a rather involved position in regard to the audit of accounts of certain public bodies.  The effect of a few statutes has been to give two Ministers similar powers to regulate the accounts and audits of certain bodies.  In practice this has not caused any difficulty because there has been no conflict of opinion as to which officer should audit the accounts, but it is necessary to clear up the law, to clear up the position from the legal aspect and to give to one Minister only the responsibility of ensuring that the accounts of local authorities are properly audited.  Under sub-section (6) of Section 66, the county manager who is an officer of the county council is made, for audit purposes, an officer of every elective body for which he is manager.</P>
    <P>Section 67, it will be seen, deals with traffic signs on roads and amends Section 36 of the Local Government Act, 1925.  Under the new section the Minister may make regulations as to traffic signs and these signs will now include mechanical devices such as traffic lights.  The position in this regard, perhaps, might require some explanation for the Seanad.  Under the section, a county or county borough council or an urban district council will provide traffic signs for any road in their charge at the request of the Commissioner of the Garda Siochana. The Commissioner will specify the number, nature and position of the signs and the bodies themselves may provide the signs with the consent of the Commissioner.  The position up to this was that the Commissioner could make bye-laws for the safety and control of traffic under the Road Traffic Act, 1933, but that Act did not make adequate provision for the erection of signs showing that a bye-law was in force in relation to a particular place. With the enactment of this new <Col N="2088" /> section the erection of a traffic sign will be an indication that a road regulation within the meaning of the section is in existence.  The Minister can, under the proposed new enactment, prescribe by regulation the nature of the sign, but he no longer prescribes the place where the sign is to be put up.  That becomes the function of the Commissioner of the Garda Siochana who is responsible for the general safety of the public in regard to road user.</P>
    <P>Section 68 will enable road authorities to require any person, who by or under any Act is charged with the duty of maintaining a bridge or its approaches, to carry out specified works of maintenance.  In default, the road authority may carry out the works and recover the cost from the person who fails to carry out his statutory obligation in this matter. Provision is made under the section for appeal to the Minister.  Section 69 of this Bill will supplement Section 161 of the Harbours Act, 1946, which authorises harbour authorities, with the consent of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, to make and carry out agreements with other persons to undertake work jointly and pay a proportion of the cost.  Section 69 gives similar powers to road authorities, with the consent of the Minister for Local Government and Public Health, to undertake works jointly with harbour authorities.</P>
    <P>Sections 70 to 72 are unimportant sections.  They relate to the question of election expenses, insurance and the duties of rate collectors in regard to furnishing information which is required for the preparation of the rate books, and are intended merely to clarify the law.  They will scarcely affect the existing practice in these matters.</P>
    <P>Sanitary authorities can at present in areas in which Part VI of the Public Health Acts Amendment Act, 1907, is in force provide or contribute to the expenses of a band of music in a park or pleasure ground.  The new provision in Section 73 differs from the existing law in allowing county councils the same powers as urban authorities and in not confining the performances to <Col N="2089" /> parks or recreation grounds.  It will therefore enable local authorities to arrange for band performances in public in the winter time if they so wish.</P>
    <P>Sections 74, 75 and 76 deal with the changing of names of towns, townlands and streets.  Senators may be aware, from certain recent discussions, that the existing law is in many respects unsatisfactory.  There is power to alter certain place names but no power to alter others.  Some authorities have, in fact, passed resolutions purporting to alter names and these resolutions, having no legal sanction, had not the effect intended.  This has created some confusion in many cases, as both the old name and new name are in use.  In fact, I have been told of places where the local authorities adhere to the old name, while strangers and people outside the area use the new name.  Sections 74 to 76 provide a clear procedure which will ensure that alteration shall be made only after full deliberation and after the wishes of the people in the area have been properly ascertained.  Provision is also made for consultation with authorities who have specially studied the subject of place names.  In regard to street names the general law at present is that the consent of two-thirds of the ratepayers and valuation of the street is necessary before the name can be changed.  It is proposed that henceforth this change can be made with the consent of four-sevenths of the ratepayers only.  It will not be necessary to consider the valuations.</P>
    <P>The law as contained in the Trustee Investment Act, 1889, limits to an unreasonable degree, having regard to existing conditions, the field of investment open to local authorities, by giving them less freedom than is allowed to trustees generally.  Section 77 will remove this discrimination.</P>
    <P>The purpose of Section 78 is to ensure that receipts of the nature of capital moneys will not be treated as revenue by local authorities but will be invested for the permanent benefit of the inhabitants of the area to which they accrue.</P>
    <P>Section 79 enlarges the power of <Col N="2090" /> local authorities to acquire land. Local authorities have been given power under many statutes to acquire land which is necessary for the purpose of carrying out statutory duties which they are about to discharge.  It is now proposed that they may acquire land by agreement&mdash;I would emphasise that it is by agreement&mdash; which they may require at some future time although the purpose for which they will use the land has not been determined.  It is hoped that the power thus given in Section 79 will facilitate those authorities who are anxious to take advantage of and adopt the planning Acts.</P>
    <P>The method of the disposal of land is regulated in Section 80.  At present borough councils can dispose of corporate property in the manner provided by the Municipal Corporations Acts.  I would like to emphasise that not all land held by local authorities is corporate property.  Section 80 deals with the disposal of land which is not corporate property, land which the manager at present may dispose of as he thinks best and without consulting the members of the local authority. The new section will ensure that, before a manager disposes of such property, the members of the local authority shall be notified and given an opportunity to veto the proposal if they think the property should not be disposed of or should be disposed of on different terms to those proposed.</P>
    <P>Section 81 will authorise road authorities to dispose of land severed by road operations to enable the land to be used economically and to prevent it from becoming derelict.  Small parcels of land become severed when existing roads are re-aligned or when new roads are constructed.  In connection with the re-alignment of existing roads, lands forming the sites of roads or of parts of roads which are no longer required for the use of the public tend to become derelict and wasted.  The Local Government Act, 1925, provides for the abandonment of roads, but abandonment of a road under that section does not affect the right of way of the public over the surface of the road, Furthermore, it often happens that there are entrances <Col N="2091" /> to private property on the portion of the road that would be abandoned. Section 81 will authorise the road authority to acquire such lands if not already in their possession.</P>
    <P>The road authority will be authorised to sell or transfer gratuitously such land or part thereof to any person who is the owner of the land which adjoins it, and is situate on the same side of the road for the purpose of providing that person with alternative means of access to the road or for the purpose of enabling the land to be used economically or for the purpose of preventing the land becoming derelict.  The road authority may make the sale or transfer subject to such conditions (including conditions requiring the land to be fenced with other lands and to be permitted to be occupied with other lands) as the road authority thinks fit. Provision is included in the section for extinguishing public rights of way with the consent of the Minister, and for extinguishing by agreement rights of entry to adjoining property through the land.</P>
    <P>Doubt has arisen as to the powers of urban district councils to borrow for the purpose of the construction of roads and bridges.  Section 82 will clarify the position.</P>
    <P>Section 83 excludes loans borrowed by county councils as public assistance authorities from the borrowing limit of one-tenth of the valuation which was imposed in 1898 when they had no public assistance functions.  County councils as public assistance authorities will be subject to the limit of one-fourth of the valuation fixed by Section 57 of the Public Assistance Act, 1939.</P>
    <P>Section 84 is a re-enactment in modern form of the existing law in regard to the issue of stock by local authorities.  The only difference is in the addition of the words &ldquo;on such terms&rdquo; to sub-section (1) and the requirement in sub-section (3) that the Minister for Finance will be consulted.</P>
    <P>Sections 85 to 88 relate to local inquiries that are ordered by the Minister.  Some of the Department's general inspectors have in recent years been assigned the duty of acting <Col N="2092" /> for local bodies when the members of such bodies have been removed and also have been acting temporarily as managers when vacancies occur.  They are not always available to hold inquiries. Furthermore, for certain inquiries it is desirable to have persons with special training and experience. It is proposed to give the Minister power to appoint temporarily specially qualified persons to hold inquiries if occasion requires.</P>
    <P>Occasions have arisen on which it would have been very desirable for the manager of a local authority to have separate legal representation at inquiries. This has been particularly the case where his own decisions or conduct are involved or impugned.  If he is separately represented by order of the Minister under this section his costs may be paid subject to any limit the Minister may impose.  A similar position may arise in regard to other officers and private persons.  If the Minister considers that the evidence before the inquiry is in the public interest and that a contribution should be made towards the costs and expenses incurred, he may certify the amount of the contribution and direct its payment.</P>
    <P>The remaining sections of the Bill are largely concerned with slight revisions or amendments of the wording of earlier statutes.  Only two of these call for any comment.</P>
    <P>It is proposed in the first that in future the clerks of old age pension committees shall be appointed by these committees without reference to the Local Appointments Commissioners.</P>
    <P>Members of the House with knowledge of the amount of remuneration paid to these clerks will appreciate that it is unnecessary to apply the machinery of the Local Appointments Commissioners to their appointment. We propose, in future, to dispense with that cumbersome and expensive procedure.</P>
    <P>Section 93 of the Bill, whilst retaining the prohibition against the surveyor trimming or cutting a tree in the period April to end of September unless he is satisfied that failure to do so will involve serious risk of accident, will permit a hedge that is prejudicial <Col N="2093" /> to the proper maintenance of the road to be cut by the surveyor in that period.</P>
    <P>Amongst the enactments repealed which are set out in the First Schedule will be found parts of several Public Libraries Acts.  The purpose of these repeals is to abolish the rating limits for libraries.</P>
    <P>Part I of the Second Schedule relates to boroughs other than county boroughs and Part II to other urban districts.  In these boroughs, as I have already explained, arable land and market gardens, etc., will be assessed on three-quarters of the valuation and in other urban districts on three-fifths of the valuation.  In the case of land in urban districts in respect of which relief is at present paid out of the agricultural grant there will be a transition period in which the assessment will begin at 6/20ths of the valuation and rise by 1/20th each year to 3/5ths as provided in Section 21.  The agricultural grant will be paid into the municipal fund as provided in Section 26 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>This, Sir, covers practically all the provisions of the Bill.  The House will see that they all tend in one direction, as I said earlier, to consolidate the law and to clarify it and to make it a more efficient instrument to ensure that the standards of our local administration will be high and correct.</P>

      <P>I quite appreciate the facility which Senator Sweetman's proposal offers to me, but I think I am in order in clarifying the position and making it quite clear that there is no infringement of the constitutional position that my first obligation as Minister is to Dáil Éireann.  Like all other members of the Government, I am responsible to Dáil Éireann in the first instance, and if my presence is required in Dáil Éireann I cannot like Boyle Roche's bird be in the Seanad as well.  I appreciate Senator Sweetman's helpfulness and I can assure the Seanad that there will not be any difficulty about considering this Bill within the statutory time.</P>
