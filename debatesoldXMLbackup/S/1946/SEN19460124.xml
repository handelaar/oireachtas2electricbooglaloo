    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To delete the second paragraph and to substitute instead the following words:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;That the Seanad suggests to the Dáil that in accordance with established practice, when Joint Committees have been set up, the number of <Col N="91" /> members of the Committee representing the Dáil and the Seanad respectively be equal&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The motion moved formally by Senator Quirke is a motion for the setting up of a Joint Committee of both Houses to consider the method of election of a certain number of Senators.  The present proceedings arise out of a motion in the Dáil dealing with that particular matter, that is to say, dealing with the method of election of the elected Senators and with certain court proceedings and other matters which arose about it.  The resolution moved in the Dáil sets in motion proceedings for a Joint Committee which will have 15 members of the Dáil and seven members of the Seanad and will have the Ceann Comhairle as chairman. It seems to me that proposal is one which departs from all precedent, which is unsound in itself and which, in the particular connection, that is to say, dealing specifically with the constitution of this House, is particularly objectionable and I think upon reflection it may be that the Taoiseach would not proceed with it.</P>
    <P>In the first place, in order to get it out of the way, may I say, although it is not concerned with my amendment, that the prescription in the motion that a particular member of the other House, namely, the Ceann Comhairle, should be Chairman of the Joint Committee, is also without precedent.  The practice always was, since 1922, that if the Ceann Comhairle were nominated by the Dáil to be a member of a Joint Committee he was always selected as Chairman of the Joint Committee.  I have been on a number of occasions in that capacity Chairman of a Joint Committee and I have, of course, no objection to that procedure.  I think it is a sound one and I think there can be no doubt that, if the Chairman of the other House were nominated a member of the Committee, when the Joint Committee met, exercising their right to elect a Chairman of the Joint Committee, they would certainly elect the Chairman of the Dáil, but I do think that it is hardly proper that when a Joint Committee is being set up the Dáil should prescribe <Col N="92" /> that its Chairman should be Chairman of the Joint Committee.</P>
    <P>There are a great many objections to a Joint Committee which would have 15 members of the Dáil and only seven members of this House and may I be allowed to say, Sir, in the first place, that my objection in this particular instance is not based upon any kind of politics.  As far back as 1929, I took exception, as Chairman of the Dáil, to a proposal in the Dáil that there should be a greater number of members from the Dáil than from the other House on a Joint Committee. That ruling was given without notice, that is, I had no notice that the matter was being raised, and subsequently a ruling was given, after consideration, and when the matter arises now and I have given the matter further consideration, it seems to me, Sir, that the reasons which dictate, since 1922, that an equal number of members of both Houses should serve on a Joint Committee, are absolutely sound.  Just as my stand on this particular matter has nothing to do with politics, neither has it anything to do with the kind of powers the Seanad has.  Ever since 1922 this House has been smaller in number and inferior in powers to the Dáil, but, even so, I think when you come to appoint a Joint Committee you should certainly have equal numbers.</P>
    <P>What, after all, is a Joint Committee of both Houses?  It is a Committee of the Dáil which joins with a Committee of the Seanad on agreed terms of reference.  They then proceed to elect their own chairman and they do their business.  The Seanad is entitled entirely to control its own affairs and, although there has been a convention by which when a motion for a Joint Committee comes before either House, the number is suggested and an equal number in both Houses, the fact is that either House can put as many members as it pleases on a Joint Committee, although, as I say, as a matter of practice and a matter of convenience they have always been equal.</P>
    <P>A Joint Committee is a body which meets to deliberate and consult and its deliberations and its consultations and <Col N="93" /> its capacity for agreement should always, of course, be much greater than its tendency to vote and to divide. Its proceedings are not final&mdash;another point which should be remembered&mdash; that is to say, when a Joint Committee reports to each House, each House can then take its own decision upon any recommendations the Joint Committee makes.  All the Joint Committee can do is, not to come to decisions, of course, but merely to make recommendations. When these recommendations have been made, each House is free to take its own line upon the recommendations and, in the Dáil, for example, neither the House nor the Government nor the Government Party nor any other Party is bound by the recommendations of the Joint Committee.</P>
    <P>The motion does hit at all the precedents we have had so far and I should like to put this to you, Sir, to the House and to the Taoiseach, that the more often a joint committee divides, the more division lists it presents to both Houses in its report, the less useful it has been.  The whole defence for this motion in the other House was that you need to have 15 members of the Dáil in order to give representation to all the different Parties in the Dáil.  I think a little consideration will show that that is not sound.  There is no necessity to represent all the Parties in the Dáil because the constitution of a Second House is a national matter of considerable importance and it is not a Party matter at all.  There is not, I presume, a Party line upon what kind the Second House should be and there is no necessity to represent all the Parties in the other House or, if I may break a convention and say even all the Parties in this House in a joint committee because when the joint committee reports, as I have said, then there will be something to go on and anyone who has any ideas can express them.  But there certainly is no necessity to have representation of all the Parties.  What you really want in a joint committee is people who have given some thought to the subject, people who have some experience of the matter, or who have done some reading on the matter, who <Col N="94" /> are prepared to put up a scheme or schemes.  I think it can be said with truth of this House that we have at least as much knowledge and perhaps more experience of what is necessary for a Second House than the Dáil has, so that in that way we should get, I think, equal representation.</P>
    <P>I think the Taoiseach in moving the motion in the Dáil said that he was making the number 15 because he wanted to give representation to everybody. Although I am accepting the Taoiseach's view that the Dáil motion is based on a carefully calculated Party view, it seems to me we need to get away from that view in constituting a committee to go into how the Seanad is to be elected, because there should not necessarily be in the Second House Party rivalry and the question of what kind of Second House you are to have is one which, I think, members of the other House and members of this House could sit down and consider free from any Party ties or Party obligations. Having said that, and having made an appeal that we should follow precedents heretofore established, that we should deal with the Seanad in regard to this business as an equal of the Dáil, I should say that I do not for a moment consider that the Seanad should have equal powers with the Dáil over legislation.  I am not arguing for that at all, but I am arguing that, if you set up a Second House and give it any powers, then you must treat it in matters of this kind on an equal footing with the Dáil.</P>
    <P>Now, with regard to what kind a Second House should be, a matter which this Joint Committee will have to consider, it has to be remembered that the Joint Committee when it meets will have very restricted terms of reference.  It will not be able to deal with the powers of the Second House.  Indeed, I should like at the outset to say that I have very little interest in that matter.  I think the most important thing for a Second House of Parliament is not the powers it possesses, but the capacity its members show to deal with matters coming before it, the weight and influence it can have in public affairs, its own special knowledge and the experience <Col N="95" /> which it brings to bear on legislation. These are, I think, much more important than the powers which may be conferred upon it in the Constitution of the State.  Similarly, it seems to me that there need not necessarily be clashes between the two Houses.  Quite clearly, under the Constitution, and I presume under any Constitution we are likely to have, whenever there is a clash between the Dáil and the Seanad, the Dáil is bound to win.  But I think that at the present moment we are in the position that a clash between the Dáil and the Seanad is avoided by endeavouring to make the Seanad as nearly as possible a replica of the Dáil.  I think that is an extremely bad scheme.  The Houses should not be the same.</P>
    <P>At the present moment we have a scheme whereby the Dáil itself is the electorate.  The members of the Dáil elect, and they are themselves elected on a Party basis and on a regional basis, as they come from different areas in the country.  They are joined as an electorate with the county councils, who are themselves, of course, regional, as they also come from different areas.  The present Party in power, the Fianna Fáil Party, has always maintained the view that in the county councils politics should be of importance.  So that, taking the Dáil and the county councils, you have an entirely Party electorate.  The object presumably is to ensure that the Party which has a majority in the Dáil and in the county councils will also have an undisputed majority in this House. Now, that seems to me to sin against a fundamental characteristic of a Second House, which is, that it should be different from the First House.</P>
    <P>In spite of the handicaps under which this House labours, in spite of the fact that it would appear, if one reads the Constitution and the Act which governs the election of members here, and looks at the nominees of the Taoiseach here that an endeavour is made to make this House as nearly as possible a replica of the Dáil, it has in fact, under very severe handicaps, I think, developed into being something <Col N="96" /> rather different from the Dáil. Ministers, when they come here to argue Bills, have found that this House is a different kind of House from the Dáil, sometimes more satisfactory, from the point of view of discussions, than the other House&mdash;and that is essential.  Inevitably, the Minister in the Dáil is influenced by the fact that, when all comes to all, he can ring the bell and call a division, and he is bound to win.  I am not charging the particular Ministers now in office with having that point of view, but it is a point of view which Ministers everywhere, in the nature of things, have.</P>
    <P>Now a Minister should not have that feeling in this House.  The very fact that this House has limited powers and is going to keep on having limited powers, I presume, should absolve this House from having a Party complexion and Ministers coming here&mdash;I am not speaking now particularly of the present Ministers, but Ministers generally&mdash;should not encounter the same kind of opposition here.  They should meet a different atmosphere in this House from the one which they meet in the other House.  For example, I belong to a Party and I oppose the Government, but I have always refused in this House to put down amendments that were moved and defeated in the Dáil.  I have always objected, as a matter of fact, even when other people moved them, to supporting here amendments put down simply because they were moved in the Dáil and rejected by a Minister. I think we should do our own business in our own way and that a Minister should encounter here a different kind of opposition, a different atmosphere, and a different kind of speech from those which he meets in the other House.  He should meet, if it were possible, more specialised knowledge, more discussion of principles, less advertence to what the electorate thinks.  I hope somebody will not tell me that I am undemocratic.  But there can be no doubt&mdash;I have ample experience of it&mdash;that debates in a House elected on a popular franchise are bound to be influenced by the thought of what the man who reads the local newspaper will think of the <Col N="97" /> Deputy's speech when published in that newspaper.</P>
    <P>Now, as I said, this House is different from the Dáil, although every precaution has been taken to make it a replica.  I think that on the question of how the Seanad should be elected we should provide at least as much brains and experience as the other House and, therefore, we ought to have the same number of members.  If people will throw their minds back, there have been several occasions here when Ministers, who proved adamant in the Dáil&mdash;notably the late Minister for Finance&mdash;and refused to accept any amendments in the Dáil, were induced&mdash;and when I use the word &ldquo;induced&rdquo;, I mean precisely that&mdash;to accept certain amendments here. Senators will recollect and the Taoiseach will recollect that when bombs fell here we had provision made for damage to property by bombs during the war.  Certain proposals were made in the Dáil by the Minister in that respect and they were hotly opposed in the Dáil, but no change was made.  In this House, when the matter was tackled in a different way and tackled from different sides of the House, the Minister made substantial alterations.  Similarly, on the question of personal injuries through bombing or enemy action of any kind during the war, we had a very substantial change made in this House, simply because a different type of debate took place here and the Minister was tackled in a different way.</P>
    <P>At any rate, I do not wish to delay the House by giving a disquisition on what I think of the constitution of a Seanad; but I do think that, a Seanad having been constituted, it should be treated as the equal of the Dáil for the purpose of Joint Committees.  A Joint Committee should be looked upon as a deliberative and consultative body and not as a body which must be constituted on a Party basis, on which everybody must have representation, so that you can read in the division lists how everybody voted.  I think that is a fundamental mistake with regard to this Committee.  I am sorry that the precedents already <Col N="98" /> established with regard to Joint Committees have not been followed in this case.  Possibly, they were not adverted to at all.  I have no ambition to be on this Joint Committee, and I am quite prepared to accept the decision of the selection committee, if it is decided to have seven members of the House selected from the point of view of their experience and for what they can contribute to a committee and to knowledge about a Second House, rather than on account of their Party affiliations.  I think the same thing could be found in the other House.  As far as we are concerned here, I am sure the Taoiseach himself must have remarked that, in spite of the fact that we began, perhaps, in a certain atmosphere of suspicion, we have succeeded in creating an atmosphere here where, for the conduct of our own business, we are able to make concessions, we are able to accommodate one another and accommodate Ministers when they come here and we are able to do all that without abandoning our opinions and in the best of good humour.</P>
    <P>There is a lot to be said for establishing another House and making it substantially different from the Dáil. I would like to appeal to the Taoiseach to yield to the precedents already established in that respect and to let this matter be considered by the Committee in an absolutely non-Party atmosphere.  It is a very restricted matter, as one cannot consider in this Joint Committee the question of nominations by the Taoiseach, or whether the Head of the Government should nominate 11, or less than 11 or more than 11; one cannot consider the remuneration of Senators or the powers of the Seanad.  The terms of reference are very limited.</P>
    <P>When the Joint Committee has considered the whole matter on that non-Party basis, it can be very freely debated in the Dáil and in the Seanad.  It can be debated in both Houses on non-Party lines, without having to scrutinise the division lists of the Joint Committee to see who was in favour of scheme A and who was against scheme B.  If that were done, <Col N="99" /> if the matter got consideration by a Joint Committee of both Houses in equal numbers and were then considered in the same non-Party spirit and atmosphere by both Houses, we would arrive at a solution of a problem which we all agree very urgently cries out for solution.  In that way, without having regard to politics, and without regard to quarrels between the two Houses&mdash;in fact, there have not been any such quarrels for a number of years&mdash;we could adhere to the original precedent and have a Joint Committee to consider this question of electing Senators, consisting of an equal number from each House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To add at the end of the motion the following words:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That, notwithstanding established procedure of committees, the joint committee be empowered to present minority reports if necessary&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I take it that the intention is to debate the motion and the two amendments together.  Therefore, before dealing with my own amendment, I would like to deal with the subject and to show how it fits in with the amendment I propose.  I agree almost entirely with what has been said by Senator Hayes. Whatever may be said for or against the present method of election, one thing we can say is that the members of this House have no responsibility for it.  There was no Second Chamber at the time, so this Seanad had no say in the matter.  There may be a few of the present members here who may have been in the Dáil at the time, but at any rate we can approach this problem with a reasonably open mind, plus a fair amount of experience&mdash;and experience of a somewhat different character from that which could possibly be obtained by members of the Dáil acting as part of the electorate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I feel that the only possibility of obtaining proposals which will meet with sufficient general support to justify the Government in changing the existing legislation can come only from a <Col N="100" /> committee of a reasonable size, in which there is no attempt to exercise Party whips and in which Party interests are largely forgotten.  After all, it would be an extremely clever Party man, no matter how experienced, who could devise a new system of election and say with any certainty exactly how it would work, from the point of view of the Party, in five, six or ten years' time.  Perhaps he could visualise how it would work now, but that would be of little value.  I feel that it will be an extremely difficult task to devise amendments in the present law, keeping, as one must do, within the terms of reference of the committee and strictly within the Constitution&mdash;since one cannot recommend any amendment, however small, in the Constitution itself.  It would be extremely difficult to devise something which would be fully satisfactory. Nevertheless, I believe the Seanad should agree to set up a committee and should agree to the principle of the motion, but I think it should not agree to uneven numbers.</P>
    <P>I do not want to repeat in any great detail what Senator Hayes has said, as that would mean taking up time.  It can be taken that I am in substantial agreement with him.  I would like particularly to emphasise my very strong conviction that one of the difficulties in the present Seanad which has a very considerable bearing on the question of election, is the fact that, whereas 90 per cent. of our debates are not on Party lines, the divisions almost entirely and almost always are. I feel that it should be accepted by all Parties that a Second Chamber with limited powers of delay of only three months' maximum&mdash;less time than frequently it takes for a Bill to be examined in the Dáil&mdash;should not have any Party Whips and that every member elected to it should stand on his own feet and justify to those who supported him and to the public outside his action on a particular matter. Senators should not be put in the position that they have to obtain advice or instructions from a Whip of a Party or a group.  I do not mean that there should not be groups of people, naturally formed and naturally <Col N="101" /> working together&mdash;such grouping adds to strength&mdash;but when you come to divisions the Party system operates very definitely against the value of this House and very definitely against the respect in which the House is held.</P>
    <P>We in the Seanad debate amendments rarely with any heat, frequently with very little reference to Party issues that may be involved, and we debate them with the Minister.  If the Minister does not like them or says he cannot accept them, there is a division. Then the Whips are called and the amendment is defeated.  Now, I do not think that is our function.  Our function is to send suggestions to the other House to be considered there. Where, on a particular matter, we disagree with the Minister, that should be made known to the other House and to the Government as a whole, since there is collective responsibility.  Then they will have an opportunity to decide the point.  I would not quarrel if, when an amendment came back, there were Party Whips&mdash;though, in view of the fact that there is only a three months' delay period, even that should not be necessary.  On several occasions, when I have been speaking to Ministers, I found they did not even know that amendments had been proposed here and rejected, as they were Ministers who were not directly concerned with the particular Bill.  For that reason, I think this matter of amendments is one which should be dealt with on non-Party lines.</P>
    <P>I think that has a very definite bearing on the subject-matter of the Committee, because I believe that if it could be accepted that the object of an election for this House is to get men and women who have had a fair measure of experience, who are respected because, whatever their views may be, they are honest views, who have knowledge and are able to express themselves, who can stand on their feet and who, by the very fact that they have accepted a position in the Seanad, should be, to my mind, relieved from attendance at, or close connection with, Party meetings on matters relating to the business before Parliament&mdash;I am not attempting to <Col N="102" /> interfere with their free actions as citizens outside&mdash;if that could be accepted as what you want, then it would be very much easier for a Committee to get itself down to the best way of electing that kind of person. If, on the other hand, each Party is concerned simply with getting, first of all, as many members of the Party as they can into the Seanad, and only, as a secondary consideration, getting the best ones they can, then you will have a different method of election.</P>
    <P>I suggest to all the Parties, particularly the three oldest and largest&mdash; Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and the Labour Party&mdash;that they could go a very long way towards meeting this problem by agreeing on openly and beyond any question, and not only agreeing on, but putting into practice, a procedure by which every member of the House would not only be not subject to Party Whips, but would not be able to obtain the assistance of Party Whips on the various matters before the House.</P>
    <P>It is, to my mind, quite clear that the only object of this Committee is to discuss and, if possible, make proposals. The Bill provided for the election which was envisaged in the Constitution, and which had to pass into law before the Constitution could have effect, was a Government measure. Any amendment of it will, of necessity, be a Government measure.  Therefore, the Government is not really very much concerned&mdash;at least, I assume it is not&mdash;with what the Fine Gael members, the Fianna Fáil members or the Labour Party members in the Committee think about it.  They are concerned with whether or not they can get out of this Committee proposals which will meet with a good measure of consent and which they may think worth while bringing in as an amendment to existing legislation.</P>
    <P>For that reason, I feel rather strongly that it would be a pity if there could not be a minority report. Being a Joint Committee of the House, what will happen is that in all probability there will be some type of a report drafted and an amendment will be put down and it will be rejected, if there is a division.  Another <Col N="103" /> amendment will be put down and it will be, perhaps, passed and you will get by that method a kind of amended draft in the way in which you get a Bill drafted, nobody being responsible for all of it, all voting on different lines and different amendments, and there is a very grave danger that out of it you will get a hotch-potch.</P>
    <P>I think it was suggested in the Dáil that the Government would have been wiser if they appointed a commission, with persons outside the Oireachtas.  I do not agree with that.  I think it would be better, in the first instance at any rate, that we should try amongst ourselves to see if we could not find a solution of this problem.  I think that when we meet the method of report should be not unlike that of a commission.  It would be far more valuable to the Government to have, for the sake of argument, a definite suggestion, complete in itself, proposed by a certain number of members of the Committee and, if it may not so occur, if necessary another suggestion, complete in itself, proposed by other members of the Committee.  I believe that out of that we will get a clearer report, something which will be very much easier for them to make a decision on.</P>
    <P>The procedure which is set out in the Standing Orders was really devised for the purpose of considering Bills.  This is not a Bill.  The Committee will not have any report before it, to commence with.  I am not going to press this if it does not meet with a measure of support, but I feel that you will get a better result if it is possible to have that and, if the members of the Committee so desire, one or two or even three reports which would be reports complete in themselves.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCounihan" hpid="Mr. Counihan Mr. Counihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Counihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have very little to say in support of the amendments that have been so clearly put forward by Senator Hayes and Senator Douglas.  I have heard it said pretty often by members of the Government Party in this House that the Taoiseach at least is not anxious to have the Seanad run on Party lines.  I believe that statement.  I believe he wants a <Col N="104" /> non-Party Seanad.  In view of that, it is surprising that when it was proposed to set up this Committee he made the statement in the Dáil that he wanted representation for the different Parties in the House and that is the reason he gave 15 representatives to the Dáil and only seven to the Seanad.</P>
      <P>Senator Hayes has pointed out very clearly that the members of this House have had more experience of Seanad elections than the members of the Dáil. There are some Senators here still&mdash; their numbers are getting small&mdash;who were elected in 1922 and who successfully contested practically all forms of election to the Seanad since that time. That gives them a wide range of experience as to the proper method of electing a Seanad and I think that point alone should be given serious consideration when setting up a Committee to consider some better scheme of election.</P>
      <P>The case for them has been so very clearly put I do not think there is very much more to be said in favour of the amendments.  The Taoiseach stated that he wants to give representation to all.  As a member of the Selection Board, I cannot see how we can give representation to the different elements in this House if we have only seven representatives.  I think the number should be increased to 15.  We are more interested than any members of the Dáil in having a Seanad properly selected.  We are anxious to have a Seanad that will be a credit to the country and that will be useful in doing the work of the nation.  We want a Seanad that will put down all kinds of corruption, and I think the Taoiseach would be well advised to accept the amendments suggested by Senator Hayes and Senator Douglas. I appeal to him, as one of the founders of this House, to accept these amendments so that we may have a satisfactory Committee to consider some better scheme for elections to the Seanad.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps it might help if I were to intervene at this stage.  When this matter originated in the Dáil, Opposition members had criticisms to make of the method by <Col N="105" /> which the Seanad is elected.  They pointed out that abuses of various kinds could arise and that practices had arisen which tended to lead to abuses.  I do not think that in the whole of that debate there was any reference to the question of representation of the Seanad at all on the Committee, so that I am afraid I shall have to bear the blame of being responsible for the troubles that have arisen, because it was I myself who introduced the question of representation of the Seanad or who suggested that certain members of the Seanad should form part of the Committee set up to examine this question.  I am afraid we could argue for a long time on the principles on which a Committee of this sort should be set up.  Arguing the matter with others, I was met with the counter-argument, for example, that, after all, this was a fundamental Constitutional question, that, in the first instance, it should be considered by the House, whose members were directly and immediately elected by the people, and that the Seanad should not come into it at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The argument was also put up that as the criticism was against practices which had grown up&mdash;there have been suggestions, for example, that perhaps some members should not be in the Seanad at all&mdash;it would be desirable not to have the Seanad represented. That was one view.  The next view was one which Senator Hayes put forward, that if we have a Joint Committee or a Committee consisting of members of both Houses, each House should have an equal number on that Committee.  I know those who are anxious for the prestige of the Seanad might strongly hold for that.  It was, I think, provided in your Standing Orders at one particular period and also in the Standing Orders of the Dáil that that was the manner in which a Joint Committee should be constituted.  That provision has dropped out and it is no longer provided in the Standing Orders of either Houses that Joint Committees should be constituted in that way.  If it could be said to have been an established practice&mdash;I have not gone into the matter in detail to <Col N="106" /> find if there were any exceptions to it&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>There were no exceptions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Possibly there were not.  If there was no particular Committee in question, I would be inclined not to base the Committee in that way, if it is a Joint Committee.  In fact when the matter was mentioned, I considered the advisability of leaving out the word &ldquo;joint&rdquo; and putting in instead &ldquo;a Committee of members of the Dáil and the Seanad&rdquo;.  I did not think that it was, in fact, going to be joint, in a certain sense, and I considered that the matter was hardly worth settling in that particular way. I can see that some Senators might desire that the word &ldquo;joint&rdquo; should be left out and then you could constitute a Committee consisting of members of the Dáil and the Seanad.</P>
      <P>Another basis on which one might try to set up a Committee of this kind would be to say: &ldquo;Very well, we shall have man for man in the Dáil and the Seanad.&rdquo; There are 138 members in the Dáil and there are only 60 in the Seanad.  On that basis the Seanad would be getting full representation under this proposal because the membership of the Seanad is slightly less than one-half the membership of the Dáil.  There was, I think, some little bit of confusion in suggesting that the Committee was to be selected somewhat on the lines of proportional representation.  I have not checked up to see how it is that you usually select Committees.  I suppose you have a Committee of Selection&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think I suggested that our committee should be selected on the principles of proportional representation.  We select a committee here for any purpose by going to the Selection Committee who are representative of all Parties in the House and they nominate the members. They do not necessarily have to nominate the people they think best for the particular purpose.  That is identical with the Dáil scheme that was originally operated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not suggest <Col N="107" /> that it was Senator Hayes caused the confusion but one of the speakers who followed him seemed to be confused in his mind as to what Senator Hayes had been speaking about.  Senator Hayes was talking about the Dáil.  The number seven was selected as being roughly in proportion to the strength of the Seanad as compared with the strength of the Dáil.  Senator Hayes suggests that we should not have a committee constituted in the Dáil on Party lines.  Well, if I were proposing such a motion in the Dáil, and I were going to leave any Parties off the committee or any Parties unrepresented, I think I would hear about it.  It would be suggested that the views of certain groups or Parties, and of the people they represented, were not being taken into account.  The practice has, at any rate, grown up in the Dáil that when committees are being formed there is representation of the different Parties on the committees and I think, on the whole, wisely so because you get an opportunity, when the report comes along, of hearing an expression of the different views, if you have a fair number on the committee.  If any strong views are taken by a particular section you will have these views represented. There is a number of Parties in the Dáil and you want to have each of these represented.  Then there are the Independents, each of whom might be regarded as a Party in himself. Nevertheless, they like to have some unattached view and to select some person to represent them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>He would no longer be unattached.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>They cannot select them otherwise.  You come back therefore to the point where you have to deal with some of the fallacies underlying these attacks on Parties.  When you come to examine it you will find that democracy cannot work without Parties, that people who have a particular point of view in common, group themselves together&mdash;people who can work together in order to get a particular point of view accepted.  I think the natural number to take for this committee is 15.  I was disposed <Col N="108" /> at the start to have equal numbers but I was already in difficulty with the number 15.  Even if you add seven more to that number, you have a very big committee and if you double it you will have 30 members.  I do not think that you can get a group of that kind together who will be able to give you a report with any chance of its being accepted.  I could probably name half a dozen individuals to whom I could say privately: &ldquo;Will you put your heads together and give us the best scheme you can?&rdquo; That would be one way of doing it and I often thought it would be the best way&mdash;to get half a dozen people who know something about the subject.  If you had any difficulty in finding a solution, you could say to these half dozen persons: &ldquo;Look here I am in difficulties about this problem.  I have given a certain amount of thought to it.  I have got no satisfactory solution.  Will you go and see what you can do?&rdquo; Well, that would be very helpful to myself but it would not be of much use publicly.  It would be of very little use, I think, and it would not help me either in trying to get it through the Dáil unless the solution happened to be intrinsically a very good one.  I admit that if I had a really good solution it would be able to carry itself.  But that is not the position I anticipate will arise here.  A great deal of attention has been given to this particular problem.  We have already had some commissions and committees upon it. When the Bill was going through, we had a committee of the House considering it, and we did not get very far, so much so that we had to withdraw it from the committee and proceed straight through the House with it.  My own belief is that, even when this Committee is considering it and putting up a solution, it will be one which could very readily be found fault with. You will find difficulties in it.  I do not think it would be likely, if I were to select a half dozen individuals and put them to work, that they would be able to give me anything which of itself could get acceptance either in the Oireachtas or with the public outside.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are two things that I see <Col N="109" /> against it as it is at present.  First of all, even as it is, it is very big.  That is the first point.  Secondly, it has the objection that it seems to give fewer members to the Seanad than to the Dáil, and I will admit that I should like, for the prestige of the House, to have equal numbers.  But there is this in it&mdash;assuming it was not going to be accepted in any way as a precedent&mdash; that it does say: &ldquo;Individually, taking a Senator with a member of the Dáil, you are given equal representation&rdquo;; that is, there is no question of saying that in this particular matter we are likely to find more brains in one House than in the other.  We are taking them on a proportional basis. I must say that I do not see any solution except this, and I would urge the Seanad to accept it.  I do not want to do anything that would seem to lower the prestige of the House.  I think that in most cases where a Joint Committee is in question&mdash;I would be inclined to say, but it might not be true&mdash;we would find we could have equal numbers.  I must say that the number 31 is too large for a practical Committee.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The question is what to do next.  You cannot manage in the Dáil with less than 15, as it is constituted at present.  You cannot hand-pick. You cannot ask the Committee of Selection to hand-pick.  The Committee of Selection is constituted in proportion to the strength of the various Parties, and if, for instance, the Party that is supporting the Government wished, it could have as many as it chose on the Committee.  Consequently, we are here in a real, practical difficulty.  It is not a question of principle at all; it is a real, practical difficulty.  I do not see any solution of it but the present one, and it is on that basis I put it forward.  It will be argued that I could hand-pick.  I could, but I am not going to be given permission to do that, and it would vitiate any results that would be got at the end.  It would be said: &ldquo;This is the finding of a hand-picked Committee.&rdquo; I should not like people to think, as was suggested by one of the speakers, <Col N="110" /> that it does not matter what sort of report the Committee gives us.  I think it does.  I think if there is a carefully thought out solution, even though it may not be perfect, the fact that, in circumstances like the present, it is recommended to the Dáil would put a serious obligation on the Government to accept it, unless there is something in it that they can definitely improve upon, or unless there is some fatal flaw in it which would render it patently unsuitable.  I do think, therefore, that in setting up a Committee like this the report which we get will be of importance.</P>
      <P>The next point brings me to the other amendment.  I have given some consideration to that.  I have been a member of some Parliamentary Committees, and it seems to me that within the existing rules you can get a complete scheme put forward.  If a member of this Committee finds, in talking to the others, in general discussion, that there is a certain solution which appears to him to be a good one, what is to prevent him from putting up this scheme as a whole?  I think it could be put up as a whole, as a definite motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to interrupt, but I should like to make the point clear.  It could be put up, but it would not appear to the public in the report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Oh, I think so.  Committees, so far as I know, could even have a verbatim report, but the usual thing, if my recollection is right, is to give the motions, divisions, and so on, in the report.  Consequently, if there is any complete scheme that any member of the Committee has, he can put up that scheme as a whole.  He can put it before the Committee as a whole, get it discussed as a whole, as a motion, and get it accepted or rejected by the Committee.  If it is rejected, there will be a vote on it.  The number of people who will support it will be given the very same public indication as would be given by a minority report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it would be given in the proceedings but not in the <Col N="111" /> report.  I am not trying to make any point, but I think the public probably would not see that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In any published documents that I remember, submitted to the Dáil after a Committee of that particular kind, you would find: &ldquo;Proposed by such and such&rdquo;, and the result then would be given, such and such members voting one way and such and such members voting the other way.  I am not against the idea.  I think the idea is a good one; that it is better to have a complete scheme and not a series of motions, the coherence of which and the co-ordination of which one with another might not appear to the public.  But I do think, if there is a group working as a Committee, they could, without changing the existing practice at all, put forward a complete scheme, have it discussed as a whole, and then it would be voted on as a whole, so that the public would know that this thing was put forward and that such and such members of the Committee supported it, which is really the same, it appears to me, as a minority report, and it would be introducing something new to bring in the idea of a minority report as such.</P>
      <P>Taking the two together I am in a real difficulty.  It is not a question of any desire on my part to do anything which would lower the prestige of this House in any way, but I am in the practical difficulty that the only way I could get equality would be to increase an already too-large Committee by adding seven more members to it and making it 31, and I think that our efforts should be somehow to reduce it.  Senator Hayes seemed to indicate that he would like to reduce it, but my trouble is how am I going to do it.  Could I go and ask the Selection Committee in the Dáil to do something which they are not accustomed to doing?  Their usual method is to work in this particular way, and I could not hand-pick them myself because if I do I am prejudicing the value of any report that may issue from this Committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps this is not <Col N="112" /> strictly in order, but, as we are dealing with an abnormal case in which the Taoiseach points out we do not want to follow precedents too closely, would it be quite impracticable for the two Selection Committees to meet somewhat informally on a committee of, say, 18, nine of each?  That means that with the two meeting together there would be no difficulty in seeing that all the various interests&mdash;after all, they are the same in both Houses &mdash;were represented.  It would be a better sized Committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think I could agree to that, because it would be starting something new and final, and, when all is said and done, the vote in the Dáil will have to be taken into account, and I am afraid that in that particular way it would be open to the objections which I am putting before you, the objections to hand-picking.</P>
      <P>If I wanted, personally, to get advice, I think I could select seven or 11 people, or some number about that &mdash;I would not like to go beyond, say, 11 at the utmost&mdash;who would give me, privately, advice, and I believe I could get advice and suggestions from them as to a solution which would be as good as I could get from any Committee that could be formed.  The fact, however, is that I believe that will not bring conviction to other people.  They will say: &ldquo;Of course, he will have the selection of them himself, and we know the sort of people he will select&mdash; people who will give him the kind of report he wants&mdash;but look at all the other people that he has not selected.&rdquo; Then they will come along and give me not the seven or the 11 that I would choose but many times that number&mdash; perhaps 77 other people who would be chosen by somebody else.  So we have the practical difficulty here, and I think that, taking all the circumstances into account, this is almost as good a solution as we can get at the moment, and it is on that basis that I put it forward in the Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before I sit down, I should like to say that the Dáil did not take upon itself to dictate to the Seanad.  This is merely a proposition coming from the <Col N="113" /> Dáil to the Seanad, saying, in effect, that the Dáil thinks it is expedient that this thing should be done and that it is looking for the concurrence of the Seanad.  There is no attempt, however, on the part of the Dáil, to dictate to the Seanad as to what it should do.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I put this suggestion to the Taoiseach?  He has very considerable influence in the other House with, at least, 70 members&mdash;70 members odd, I take it.  Is it not possible that a committee of selection could agree on nine members?  My recollection of the members of the Dáil Committee of Selection is that they have always been amenable, and I think it would be better to have it suggested that nine members of the Dáil should be put forward instead of 15; and if the nine members of the Dáil were elected, the Seanad would have advertence to that.  I think that the Taoiseach underestimates his own influence with the Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Oh, I hope I do not underestimate or overestimate my influence there, and I hope that I have a fair appreciation of whatever strength or weakness it has.  Now, first of all, we have got to give representation to the four or five Party groups, to start with, and naturally you will then be brought up against the question whether, if this report is going to have real influence, it would be one to which the majority of the members of the Dáil might object.  I mean that you have to try to get people to give the assent of their commonsense, so to speak, to questions of this kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not representation rather than proportional representation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but the Senator knows perfectly well that these propositions will be voted upon or that, even if not voted upon, there will be certain views expressed.  Again, a great deal of this argument is based&mdash; and I am sure Senator Hayes does not mistake this, because I am satisfied that he has given sufficient thought to this question to know that Parties are formed on the basis of things which the members of these Parties fundamentally <Col N="114" /> agree and to which other Parties fundamentally disagree, and when such questions come up, these Parties, naturally, will want to have their representation taken account of. There is growing up a sort of view that Parties are something to be ashamed of in a community.  There is, undoubtedly, an attempt to make it appear that there is something wrong about political Parties or about having political Parties in the State and people having Party affiliations and Party views.  I am not one of those people who believe that and I never have been.  I believe that it is quite natural for a group of people in a community to put forward certain views which they hold in common, and that when questions that affect these fundamental matters arise it is only right and natural that the interests affected by them should have representations effective in accordance with the votes of the people.  Not merely do I believe that that is right and natural, but I am absolutely convinced that democracy could not work without it. If each one of us in this community were to act without any idea or view as to what other people might consider in the matter we would get nowhere. You have to have Parties, and one of the things that would be important in our community, I think, would be to have proper respect for Parties, as long as Parties do not abuse the powers which they naturally will have as Parties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, I did not approach this as a Party question, except from the point of view that ultimately it will be voted upon.  This Committee will take part in the discussion of various propositions, and when matters arise which they regard as fundamental it is only right that the community as a whole, in so far as it can be proportionally represented, should be proportionally represented, but I did not approach it from a narrower point of view than that, and I think I am justified in saying that any attempt to say that this should not be approached from the Party point of view is wrong because, so long as you have a democracy, you will have parties, and the various Party views, in so far as <Col N="115" /> they affect fundamental questions, will be expressed and will insist on being expressed.  I think that you might as well face that at the beginning as at the end.  I think, Sir, that I shall say no more about that.</P>

Muna n-éiríonn le Seanadóirí a gcuid moltaí a chur i bhfeidhm ní hionann sin agus a rá gur daoine gan chiall gan phrionsabal na daoine a chuireas 'na gcoinne.

    <Speaker pid="MichaelRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a motion which concerns this House most intimately, because it relates solely to the method of election to this House.  Under the Constitution this House consists of 60 members of whom 11 are nominated by the Taoiseach and 49 are elected.  Of the 49 elected members three are elected by the National University of Ireland, three by Dublin University, and 43 from panels of candidates constituted in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution.  This motion deals, therefore, with the mode of election to this House of 43 members, these 43 members being selected from the panels.  The resolution to my mind could be criticised, at least, its form. In the first place, I think that the use of the word &ldquo;joint&rdquo; is unfortunate.  If the word &ldquo;joint&rdquo; were omitted nothing would be lost.  The resolution sets forth:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That it is expedient that a Joint Committee of the Dáil and Seanad be set up to consider and make recommendations on the method of regulating elections of those elected members of Seanad Eireann ...&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is certainly expedient to consider and to make recommendations on the method of regulating elections of the 43 elected members but it is by no means expedient that a Joint Committee of the Dáil and Seanad should be set up to consider and make recommendations in connection with that election.  However, there is a problem there.  Apparently, it appears that <Col N="119" /> some change must be made in the mode of election of the 43 members.  The Constitution sets forth that the Houses of the Legislature, with the Uachtarán, are called the Oireachtas.  Dáil Eireann is totally distinct and separate from the Seanad in the Constitution. Strictly speaking, it is difficult to say why Dáil Eireann should be concerned with the mode of election of the 43 panel members who are, according to the Constitution, to be elected from panels of persons having knowledge and practical experience of certain defined interests which are set forth in the Constitution:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;i.  National Language and Culture, Literature, Art, Education and such professional interests as may be defined by law for the purpose of this panel;</P>
    <P>ii.  Agriculture and allied interests, and Fisheries;</P>
    <P>iii.  Labour, whether organised or unorganised;</P>
    <P>iv.  Industry and Commerce, including banking, finance, accountancy, engineering and architecture.</P>
    <P>v.  Public Administration and social services, including voluntary social activities.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Constitution is not complete, because Article 18, sub-article 10, paragraph 1 states:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Subject to the foregoing provisions of this Article elections of the elected members of Seanad Eireann shall be regulated by law.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>So it is merely for the purpose of enacting legislation to implement the express provision of the Constitution that this Committee has to be set up, in order, perhaps, that a more suitable form of legal enactment might be ultimately obtained.  Therefore, as this law must be enacted by both Houses, by the Dáil as well as by the Seanad, it must be sponsored by the Government and, of course, the Government must, in the end, take responsibility for the initiation of legislation to implement the Constitution.  This Joint Committee is to be set up nominally to advise both Houses, but really to advise the Government, so that <Col N="120" /> nothing appears in the Constitution which would give the recommending Committee a Party complexion.  Of course, it would be quite open to the Government to say that some outside body might be quite satisfactory for the purpose of giving advice on this matter, but apparently the Government have considered that a Joint Committee of the two Houses should be the body to make recommendations.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach has stated that in order to give political Parties proper representation in the Dáil the minimum number for the Dáil is 15, and by putting one man in the Dáil against one man in the Seanad, the number on the Committee to represent the Seanad is seven.  Of course, this is not in our common acceptance of the term &ldquo;a Joint Committee&rdquo; at all.  It is a committee, no doubt.  At the present time, when we speak of a joint tenancy or a joint agreement it is a question of share and share alike.  A tenancy in common in law is where people have different shares.  This idea of a joint committee, consisting of equal numbers, is not quite new, as more than 150 years ago in England, whenever there was a joint committee between the House of Lords and the House of Commons, the number of members from the House of Commons on the committee was double the number of members representing the House of Lords.  But that has been abolished since 1864.  Now, it is commonly recognised in Great Britain and here that a joint committee should consist of an equal number of representatives of the interests concerned.  If this Joint Committee is not to be regarded as a precedent in respect of Joint Committees of the Oireachtas, no harm will be done.  While I have no rooted objection to the use of the word &ldquo;joint&rdquo; in this case, I do not think that it is apt.  While supporting the resolution, I should like to make the reservation that this is not to be taken as a precedent for Joint Committees which may have to be set up hereafter to consider legislation.  In legislation, each House controls its own business, so to speak.  The members of the Dáil pass a Bill through its various stages and then it comes on here.  If it should <Col N="121" /> be advisable at any time that a Joint Committee of both Houses be set up, then both Houses should be represented on that Committee on what I might call an equal basis.  The purpose which the Government and the Taoiseach have in mind would be just as well achieved by calling this body a Committee simpliciter instead of describing it as a Joint Committee of both Houses.  Therefore, I think that the amendment by Senator Hayes is unnecessary.  I think that the Taoiseach did say that this was not to form a precedent.</P>

If I were dealing with the matter in the first instance now, I should describe this body as a Committee of both Houses, leaving out the word &ldquo;joint&rdquo;.  I think I indicated that there was a certain amount of doubt in the matter at the beginning. As this was to be a Committee of both Houses, I thought that the use of the word &ldquo;joint&rdquo; would not carry any connotation regarding numbers.  However, we have lost a great deal of time in setting up the Committee&mdash;&mdash;</P>

No matter what the Taoiseach, Senator Ryan and I may say, if you pass this motion it will be a precedent and will suggest that the only way you can appoint a Joint Committee will be by having the representation in numerical ratio to the Dáil and Seanad.

      <P>While reserving rights as regards Joint Committees of both Houses, I cannot see any objection to the appointment of this Committee to make the necessary recommendations. As regards the amendment by Senator Douglas, that the Joint Committee should be empowered to present minority reports, if necessary, I think that that would largely confuse the issue.  It would be confusing if every members of the Joint Committee were to present a report of his own.  The reports might make very interesting reading but they would be of little use as authoritative guidance.  In the end, it is quite possible that, notwithstanding our talk here to-day and the talk in the other House, the Government might be compelled to adopt its own solution owing to divisions of opinion in the reports of the Committee.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Patrick J. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach mentioned a couple of times that there were four or five Parties in the Dáil and that each should have representation.  I assumed that there were five Parties and, adopting the suggestion of the Taoiseach, that each should have representation, I got certain figures which I shall cite. Assuming that the largest Party should have five representatives, then Fine Gael would have two, Clann na Talmhan one, Labour two&mdash;since there are two divisions of Labour&mdash;and Independents one.  That gives a total of 11.  If you allow a representation of 11 to this House and take an exactly similar division of Parties, you will get a Committee of 22, which is the maximum proposed in the motion before the House.  I suggest that that would be a reasonable solution of the difficulty. You would have the maximum number of representatives and all Parties would be fairly represented.  There might be one objection&mdash;the Government Party would have a total of only ten out of the 22.  That, however, would not be a serious difficulty since the representation would be mixed owing to the inclusion of representatives of all Parties and it would be most unlikely that all would combine to vote against <Col N="123" /> the Government Party.  In addition, the chairman of the Committee would have a balancing effect and would probably keep things right from the Government's standpoint.</P>

      <P>I should like to offer two suggestions.  I should like to see this a Joint Committee in the sense of the term used by Senator Ryan.  It is not as if we were meeting to recommend some abstract or remote conclusion. We are really meeting to take steps to decide what will be the fate of our House.  We are meeting to make recommendations which will, presumably, be acted upon in part, if not in their entirety, thus deciding the composition of this Chamber.  Since we seem to be the focus of world attention with regard to a great many things, it is quite likely that our struggles with this problem will provide very interesting material for other countries who are facing the same problem of the composition of a Second Chamber.  The first suggestion I offer is that we should go straight ahead and have a Joint Committee of 30.  I have nothing like the experience the Taoiseach has regarding large committees but I have been on a sufficient number of such committees to view them with horror.  I suggest that that Committee of 30 might appoint a subcommittee which would report to the Joint Committee.  The other suggestion has merely occurred to me now and I have not thought it fully out.  Would it be possible to have joint action by the selection Committees of the two Houses?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am personally indebted to the Taoiseach for his defence of the Party system.  It is the inevitable consequence of groups of men thinking alike.  The thoughts and actions of <Col N="124" /> such men are crystallised in the Party system.  Anybody who wants to defend the Party system has merely to look back on the history of Europe for the past six years.  There, he will see what the Party system has saved nations from and what its absence cost other nations.  Like the Taoiseach, I notice a certain amount of diffidence in this House in referring to the Party system, as if it were something not quite respectable.  I think it is inevitable among people who are at liberty to form and to express opinions, but the point I am wondering if I can make is: Suppose you want to represent the various Parties and your two Joint Selection Committees meet, what is to prevent them getting their 15 members from both Houses lumped together?  Why need you chop up the two Houses separately?  Can the two Selection Committees not meet and say: &ldquo;We want a Committee of so many members and it does not matter from which House they come&rdquo;?  I think it might be possible to work it out on those lines.</P>
    <P>I should like to express my gratitude for the lucid and most cogent way in which the Taoiseach showed us how he reached the conclusion step by step.  It is a case of the irresistible force and the immovable obstacle.  I am not endeavouring to put up any immovable obstacle, but I would like to put forward these points.  In view of what the Committee has to decide on&mdash;the fate of the Upper or the other Chamber&mdash;and in view of the extraordinary difficulties in which we find ourselves regarding the number of the Committee, my two suggestions may possibly be deemed worthy of consideration by some subsequent speaker.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TheodoreMoore" hpid="Mr. Kingsmill Moore Mr. Kingsmill Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kingsmill Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>Listening to this debate, without having any formal views at all when I came into the Chamber, I have been wondering whether, in our effort to achieve reality, we have not become a little unreal, and whether, in attempting to say that we are sound, practical men with our feet on the ground, realising the existence of Parties, realising the <Col N="125" /> necessities of Parties and realising the compelling force of Parties, we have not really tended to overlook the kind of solution which may be found by the Committee, or, perhaps I should say, the efforts towards a solution which are likely to be the result of their labours.  I for one certainly do not anticipate that this Committee will be able to bring forward a satisfactory solution of the problem which it is asked to face.  I do not suppose that the solution it brings forward will be one which cannot be criticised and soundly criticised by members of nearly any political Party and nearly any abstract political school.  The most that I hope for is that the scheme or schemes which this Committee, after its labours and deliberations, presents to the country will be better than the present scheme.  As I said on another occasion, I think experience has shown that it could hardly be worse.</P>
      <P>But you are setting up a Committee to give you ideas of something better than you have and if you get ideas of something which will be better than you have, I think you should be thankful. It would be an advantage if several ideas, not necessarily completely antagonistic&mdash;they may be complementary or supplementary &mdash; with the arguments for them can be put in the same paper, presented to the Oireachtas and to the Government, and if it is then left to the Government so far as they can to select either one scheme <i>in toto</i>, or to combine elements of each.  Whatever scheme they select, there will be something wrong with it. Whatever scheme any body devises, subsequent experience and the logic of subsequent events will show that it is not only not perfect but full of objections; but if we are really practical, what we are looking for in this is an improvement on the present system and not an ideal one.  That is why it seems to me an unreal thing to approach this from the point of view that, by carefully balancing political representation, we will get the best ideas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is all very well to say that political Parties are united in their attitude to certain subjects.  I doubt very much whether the members of any political <Col N="126" /> Party are united at the present moment in their ideas as to how best you can elect what I may call the vocational part of the Seanad.  The problem will be one of abstract politics, and, although you can find a difference between an approach to abstract problems when considering extreme left or extreme right, I think the divisions of the Committee to be elected will, and should, naturally cut across the present largely accidental political grouping.  That is the only reason why I do not accede at once to the plea of the Taoiseach that we must regard political Parties as being natural and proper, and that we must have a representation and a somewhat proportional representation of them on the Committee to be set up.  I suggest that you, first of all, want to ensure that it is a Committee of people who know something about this matter from the point of view of abstract politics; and, secondly, a Committee on which are represented some people who know now the abstract works when translated into the concrete.</P>
    <P>The scheme on which this House is elected at present is, in the abstract, beautiful.  The practical politician would probably have foreseen that, when translated into the concrete, it would have a number of disadvantages. There are, or there used to be, certain South American Republics whose constitutions, viewed from every abstract point of view, were models of all that a constitution should be, and it was not, perhaps, a coincidence that these States were accustomed to date their chronology from their last revolution.  I anticipate that if you can get a certain number of people who have an abstract approach, and if they can be checked by people who will say: &ldquo;That is all very well, but what is likely to happen is this,&rdquo; you will get one idea or two ideas which the Government will be able to take hold of and to utilise as the basis of a new system.</P>
    <P>The responsibility is the Government's in this case.  The responsibility of the Government is to be advised and to make their choice, and, having made that choice, having made it not on political grounds, then, if they like, let the matter be debated in the Houses in a way in which inevitably a <Col N="127" /> certain amount of political considerations will come into play.  I am very anxious that this Committee&mdash;and I tender to all who may sit upon it my anticipatory condolences because they will have an almost impossible task&mdash; will be so constituted that it will have, first of all, representation not on proportional political lines but rather on the lines of containing people who have certain knowledge of abstract politics, certain knowledge of the course of history and certain practical knowledge of how things work in this country.  Those are the three types of people that you want, and not three types of existing political Parties.  I hope, secondly, that its procedure will be so formulated that it will be possible for different groups to present different reports, not merely in the form of schemes which have been put forward in the Committee and voted upon, but schemes which are presented to the Government, together with the arguments of those who put them forward. I hope, thirdly, that the Government in formulating their own plans will not be afraid to adopt something out of each type of proposal.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that the method of putting forward schemes by motions and then voting upon them would be an adequate safeguard to ensure the ventilation of the good ideas which may be contained in each scheme, but, speaking subject to correction, I think that in practice the report which is presented to the House, and certainly the report which would be reproduced in the newspapers, would not contain the motions and the voting on the schemes.  They could be discovered if you looked at the proceedings in full, but in practice they would be as effectively buried as the evidence given before a commission which occupies the blue books in England.  They are of enormous thickness and are never looked at except by an occasional student of the subject.  Everyone merely looks at the conclusions in the report.  I do not think that should be so.  I think there should be an opportunity for people to produce a minority report, or minority reports, and I think that at the very beginning we should not <Col N="128" /> accept the point of view that those must necessarily be the reports of political Parties.  What we want them to be is reports of people from various political Parties who, on certain issues of current politics, might vote against each other, but who might yet approach the abstract question of the best way of constituting the Seanad in a way which is dictated by their own experience and training, and cuts clean across Party lines.  I can quite conceive that, on a Committee of that nature, Senator Magennis and I might find ourselves producing a minority report of two, because it is more than probable that in the abstract certain questions might be approached by us from the same point of view.  That might not happen if it was a question or a matter of immediate political heat.</P>
    <P>If we want this Committee to operate with the greatest advantage, I think we are stultifying ourselves at the very beginning by trying to elect it upon political lines.  We should do everything to emphasise the fact that its report should be non-political, that it is to get a good Seanad and not a Seanad that is going to favour A, B or C.  It is a confession of failure to suggest that it is going to be in proportion to the strength of political Parties.  It might even be a weakness in argument to suggest that the numbers for Dáil and Seanad should be exactly the same, and that is where I agree that it should not be called a Joint Committee. But if there is an argument in that, inasmuch as that the Seanad can bring to bear on the problem the practical experience of those who have been elected, and that the Dáil can bring to bear on it the practical experience of those who voted for it, I have no doubt whatever that in both Houses there are people who would be able to shed a great deal of light on what practically happens at an election. For that reason, if for no other reason, I think there is a very good reason why the Seanad should have equal representation, and as it is the Seanad whose reputation is at stake, it is still more important that its representation should not be liable to be swamped on the Committee, and I do not use that word in any sort of a <Col N="129" /> deprecatory way.  Let us get away from the whole idea that this Committee is going to be a battle ground, that it is going to be a Committee which, in fear and trembling, approaches an insoluble problem in the hope that it is going to help the Government with ideas for something better than you have got.  Solutions only grow.  They are not made in the minds of men or committees.  They grow out of the essence of political action and the essence of political man. Let us be content with that, but do not let us approach this from the point of view that it is to be settled in any schematic or planned way.  Let us take the practical attitude of having equal numbers of Dáil and Seanad, with everyone expressing his opinion, and everyone producing a report and giving it to the public for what it is worth.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Summerfield</NameTxt>
      <P>At this stage of the debate it is not my intention to take up much of the time of the House. I have been wondering, during the course of the various speeches that have been made, what kind of a Seanad was being envisaged.  There has been a reference to this political Party and that.  I think that the general problem should be more concerned not with the size of the Committee but with the fact that it is to be created at all.  The public want this Committee and its composition is far more important than its size.  My own position in this House is, I think, unique.  I, personally, was nominated at every election to the Seanad that has been held since the State was created.  On more than one occasion I got several nominations, but on most occasions I got zero votes, but the first and only by-election that I was nominated for saw me heading the poll.  There may be a lesson in that. I speak subject to correction when I say that my position in this present House must be unique in that I am the only Senator who was selected at a by-election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another important thing is that this Committee, when it is set up, must not fail in the job that it is given to do. The Seanad is part and parcel of the machinery of State.  We are carefully cultivating, and I am delighted to see <Col N="130" /> it, all the trappings of State from Arus an Uachtarain down the scale. We will only get respect for the trappings of State to the degree that we ourselves develop that respect.  No one can say that the system which obtains for the election of members to this House encourages the public to have that respect which they should have for the Upper House of the Oireachtas of the country.</P>
    <P>In listening to all the discussion that has taken place as to whether this Party or that Party is to be represented on the Committee, I have been wondering what the position of people elected like myself is to be.  The general public outside, the vocational bodies which are considered to be of sufficient importance in the life of the community to be nominating bodies, as they have been in my own case, have felt over a period of years that the scheme of election is a mockery and a sham and should go.  Therefore, I feel very strongly that, in the selection of the Committee, Party considerations should not be paramount, that a strong effort should be made to get the best possible brains that the country has got, men who can unselfishly evolve a scheme that will recommend itself to both Houses of the Oireachtas and, in the ultimate, to the nation and thereby secure the election of a Seanad that will be looked up to and respected by everybody, and not form the subject of music-hall jokes as it has hitherto.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>It appears to me that the discussion is wandering over a very wide field and that in the end we are not going to be very much further on than when we started.  As I understand, the question is whether or not this House is willing to agree with what the Dáil has submitted for our agreement.  Objection is taken to the proposal made by the Dáil on two grounds.  So far as objection is taken to it regarding the respective number of members of each House to be on the Committee, it appears to me that the proposal to make the Committee 31 does not differ materially from the proposal that it should be 23.  In either case the number is far too big.  A Committee <Col N="131" /> of 23 members will not be a practical body to deal with this problem. In the first place there will be a bad and irregular attendance of members.  Each group and Party will endeavour to secure representation for itself on the Committee without any regard whatever to the contribution which the representatives will make to the solution of the problem confronting them.  If we could get a Committee of 11&mdash;nine would do me&mdash;but not more than 11, with the Ceann Comhairle as Chairman and five members from each House, it would be a far better attempt to secure a working body than the present proposal.  I do not know whether that can be done or not.  I do not know whether or not we can induce the Dáil to agree that there should be a Committee of not more than 11 members.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach raised the difficulty as to how the body is to be constituted and at the same time give representation to all the groups and Parties in both Houses.  No matter what you do you cannot give representation to all the groups and Parties in this House. I am trying to estimate, looking over the House, how many possible groups there are in the Seanad.  There are at least ten.  There may be 60 for all I know.  There is no use in attempting to get a representative body on the pretence that you are giving representation to all groups.  You are not.  I suggest that if we cannot get the Committee of Selection to select five competent people in this House and the corresponding body in the Dáil to select five competent people from the Dáil then we ought to allow each House, on the basis of a proportional representation vote, to select five people to represent them hoping all the time that the House would select impartially the five most competent persons they could nominate to the Committee.</P>

    <P>When I hear Senator Summerfield talking about getting the best brains in the country I begin to wonder are we living on the earth at all.  Do not we know that that is the last thing we will get?  We are not going to get <Col N="132" /> the 23 best people and we do not want them.  If we did, we would not ask the Committee of Selection to select them on a political Party basis.  What we are proposing to do is to count heads.</P>

      <P>It does not matter.  If they can put their hand up when it comes to a vote, that is all that matters and that is the way the Committee of Selection will see it.  I would urge strongly that the Taoiseach should reflect on what has been said here and reflect on the kind of problem that he is asking the House to face and see whether he cannot go back to the Dáil and tell them that he is convinced that this Committee is too big, that it should be a smaller Committee, and ask them if they will agree to a scheme by which a smaller Committee can be selected impartially aiming, as far as possible, at getting the most competent people to act on the Committee.</P>

      <P>Up to now nobody has suggested that this matter be referred to the U.N.O.  Unfortunately, we are not affiliated to that organisation because I am sure it would present enormous difficulties to them as it appears to present to the people here. To me there is no difficulty whatever about the matter.  With Senator Hayes' amendment I am in entire agreement.  With the motion I am in entire agreement except as regards the proportion of representation.  I recognise the need, the great need, for reform in connection with the election of this House.  On former occasions I tried to call attention to the various abuses that occur during the elections for the Seanad.  The result is that this Seanad does not occupy the place in the public mind that the Seanad should occupy.  It will not occupy that place until we put ourselves beyond reproach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With very little change, we could make the present system of election to the Seanad a perfect system.  We will not get a perfect House because we have not perfect people in the country. <Col N="133" /> I suggest that if we abolish the postal voting we have solved the whole problem.  In order to prove that I will have to descend to the level that was descended to in the Dáil.  For instance, in the last election one of the Parties to the Seanad election decided to call in all the panel papers of their adherents and, having called them in, appointed a committee of three to mark these papers in a certain way. One of the three failed to turn up. Two people took on the marking.  One of them was a candidate and he switched a vote, which ensured his own election.  The other switched a vote which ensured the election of a particular friend of his.  I have heard that story time and again, repeatedly.  It may or may not be true but this is true: A committee was appointed to investigate the marking of the papers. That is a long time ago.  That committee has not reported its findings up to now.  Whether that is true or not, so long as it is possible for that to occur, this House cannot stand high in the estimation of the people of the country.  That is the root of all the trouble.  The panel system is a good one; the arrangements are good; but the postal voting damns the whole proposal and will continue to do so. There is no doubt whatever about that.</P>
    <P>There is no difficulty to my mind in getting over the trouble of postal voting.  The total number of electors to this House is in the neighbourhood of 300.  One hundred and thirty-five of these are Dáil members.  There is no earthly reason why the Returning Officer would not bring the ballot papers to the electors or why the electors would not come to the ballot box, the same as any other electors in the country, and cast their votes and preserve the secret ballot, because this House is not elected on a secret ballot so long as you have postal voting.</P>
    <P>I suggest that that would go a long way to have this House elected on a basis that would bring credit to it and to the Oireachtas in general.  To my mind, it does not present any difficulty. As I said, I am thoroughly in favour of Senator Hayes' proposal, but I am altogether opposed to the amendment <Col N="134" /> proposed by Senator Douglas.  We know that one man on the Committee from any House who wants to advertise himself will be sure to put in a minority report.  If we have 30 on the Committee, we can safely say that we will have eight or nine minority reports.  I believe that the Taoiseach and the Dáil and the Oireachtas in general would be well advised to accept the amendment proposed by Senator Hayes and let us have a unanimous agreement on the motion; otherwise I seriously suggest to the House that they should stand by Senator Hayes' amendment and send back to the Dáil our opinion on the matter as represented by a vote of this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know that Senators fully realise the problem there will be for me, for instance, if I have to go back and try to urge the Dáil to change the number.  In the course of the debate here it was suggested that counting heads without counting what is in them is not a very good way of arriving at a decision. That hits at majority rule.  Everybody knows that a case can be made against majority rule.  But it is a practical rule.  It is accepted and it works. The same thing is true of the Dáil about giving proportional representation to members of Parties.  You get your work done.  Otherwise, on each occasion, you will have a discussion as long as the discussion we have had here on this particular matter.  You are anxious for your prestige as a House and that is the only basis&mdash; perhaps also a reduction of the number &mdash;on which objection to my proposal is taken when all is said and done&mdash; that it would lower the prestige of this House compared with the Dáil unless you had the same number as the Dáil. The Parties in the other House will also be anxious for their prestige and will ask themselves or ask other members of the House to consider whether they are to be rated man for man as of less intelligence and less value than their neighbours.  Therefore this question could raise interminable discussions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the values of having a rule like this adopted in the Dáil is that, <Col N="135" /> when a Committee is proposed, each particular group is left to select its own particular representatives and the Committee is able to get on with its business and do its work.  Otherwise you will have interminable discussions as to what are the proportions for the different people, unless you settle it by some sort of secret vote or, again, by proportional representation.  I had to bear these practical things in mind when I put down the number of 15 in the Dáil, and I knew I was not going to have a long discussion as to whether the proper representation was given to each Party.  Everybody recognised it. It meant that each particular Party, even the small Parties, were given reasonable representation in proportion to their strength.</P>
    <P>When I come here you are anxious about it, naturally, and I admit that, if I were doing it again, I would probably knock out the word &ldquo;joint&rdquo;. I do not think it necessarily has the connotation of equality.  Nevertheless, a case could be made, and, therefore, I would wish to get rid of it.  But, even to do that now, would mean going back to the Dáil again and, after all, the main thing is to put this Committee at work.</P>
    <P>The other solution is that possibly you could give equality by giving the Seanad 15 members.  There is objection to that&mdash;apart from the objection that it would make the number on the Committee still greater&mdash;that it would be an undue proportion of the members of the House, which is a sound objection, particularly when it is the present constitution of the House that has been the cause of the setting up of this Committee.  If it could be suggested outside that the members we are putting on this Committee would have any interest in preserving the existing mode of election, objections would be raised to it.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I do think that, when all is said and done, the solution that is proposed by putting in this number is as good as you can get.  I know there are objections, but you cannot get perfection in a lot of things and you must do the best you can.  The thing was to get the Committee at work and to <Col N="136" /> get a Committee which will have a fair chance of being put rapidly at work and a Committee composed in a manner in which it cannot be said that from the start the dice were being loaded in one way or another, except in so far as they were loaded by the people voting at the last election not doing the work in a fair way.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding the objection raised to this, I ask the Seanad not to send this back to the Dáil.  We will have, first of all, this question as to whether in a case like the present one there should be equal representation; I am talking of the particular case that is under discussion.  As a matter of fact, rather than do that, I would be inclined to say: &ldquo;All right; as the Dáil does represent the nation in miniature, being elected by proportional representation, we will get the Dáil as representing the people and the democracy of the country, to consider this matter from their point of view and leave the Seanad out of it altogether&rdquo;.  That was a way of doing it.</P>
    <P>It was not explicitly approached in that way in the Dáil, but in the whole of the discussion from which this motion arose there was no suggestion, so far as I remember, of a Joint Committee or a Committee on which the Seanad was to be represented at all. There was a complaint from the other House that the method of election to this House has grievous objections to it; that it worked out badly in practice; and that the Dáil should set about setting up a Committee to try to get a better mode of election.  My own feeling is, if we cannot get agreement between the Dáil and this House, we should do that rather than face in the other House again all this question in which, just as happened here, discussions arise which are not to the credit either of this House or of the institutions generally.  These things in connection with recent elections are almost certain to crop up, even though they may not be strictly in order or may not be so regarded by some people, and the Chair may be willing to give wide scope to people who are speaking on a resolution of this sort.  I have tried <Col N="137" /> to do my best and I admit that it is not as satisfactory as I would like it to be.  From listening to the discussion here, I cannot see any more satisfactory way of doing it, unless I approach it from the point that the Dáil would set up a Committee for which it would have sole responsibility. The Committee would have no authority whatever and its only purpose would be to examine the question and make suggestions.  That is not what is proposed now.  The report of this Joint Committee should have a considerable amount of authority behind it and the Government would certainly have to justify its failure to implement the Committee's suggestions. If I were to do it another way, which occurred to me, by getting together a number of people more or less experts on this subject and asking them to submit proposals, it would be possible then for the Government, if it saw something it could put forward and take responsibility for, to bring forward its proposals in the ordinary way.  However, we have started in this particular way and I suggest that the important thing is to go ahead with the work.  Even though Senators may not agree with me otherwise, I think they will agree that I have tried and that my approach has been to try to get a practical solution to a fairly difficult question.</P>

      <P>Then may I add a word of explanation, since there have been two speeches from the Taoiseach? I approach this matter from the point of view of the House.  I agree that there have been abuses which need to be investigated.  I do not see anything in the point about the word &ldquo;joint&rdquo;. If you join some members of the Dáil with some members of the Seanad, whether you call it a &ldquo;Joint Committee&rdquo; or a &ldquo;Committee&rdquo;, it seems to my simple untutored mind to make no difference whatever.  I think the Taoiseach's idea of a Committee of the Dáil to consider this whole question <Col N="138" /> would not be a bad one and I would have no objection to it.  The Dáil has an absolute right to do that, if it likes.</P>
      <P>However, when you are setting up a Joint Committee for the first time&mdash;I think this is the first time&mdash;you are certainly making a precedent here, a precedent which is a wrong one.  Particularly in the case now at issue, where you are considering the constitution of a Seanad, it is a mistake.  As I said before, by way of interruption or explanation, I think the Taoiseach under-estimates his own influence with the Dáil and the influence of other people with the Dáil.  I do not think the Dáil would stand up on its hind legs and say it wants 15 members and will have nothing else, no matter who says so.  I believe that nine members of the Dáil would give just as much representation to Fianna Fáil as 15, and the only difference would be that there would be only one Labour Party representative instead of two.  My amendment does not mean that we want 15 members of the Seanad.  As the Taoiseach very properly said, that would be a fantastic idea; and I am against it.  If there were two fives, as Senator Duffy suggested, it might be small, but if the representation were nine from each we would get a much better Committee and a much better discussion.  However, what is being done here, whether it be called a Joint Committee or not, is to make the precedent that every Joint Committee of the two Houses will have at least 15 members of the Dáil and only seven of the Seanad.  Further, if there are more Parties in the Dáil&mdash;as there might very easily be at some future date&mdash; then there will probably be still more Deputies on such Committees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am interested only in the constitutional aspect, which I think is important, in the way in which this House should look on itself.  If we are ousted from the position, with regard to Joint Committees, of being a free and equal number with the Dáil, we have lost very considerably.  It would be preferable for the Dáil to set up a Committee of its own, rather than come to us and say it wants 15 members, while we are to get only seven, and that it insists beforehand that the <Col N="139" /> Chairman of the Dáil be the Chairman of the Joint Committee.  That is a bad scheme and it will effect really nothing.  Perhaps the truth is that there is some fear as to what this Committee will decide and there is a desire to make absolutely certain that there will be a particular Party majority on it.  That is an entirely misguided attitude, <Col N="140" /> as the Party element should not enter into it at all.  I am in agreement with the Taoiseach that we must have Parties, but I cannot see that we must have consideration from the Party angle of the constitution of a Second House.  That is what has ruined this House and that is what will ruin this Committee.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That Seanad Eireann requests the Government to furnish, in the form of a White Paper or otherwise as may be convenient, particulars of the several statutory or other enactments now in force which authorise, on terms analogous to the provisions of Section 281 of the Mental Treatment Act, 1945, a Minister of State by Order to adapt, amend or modify Acts of the Oireachtas or any statutory or other enactments; the number of Orders made under each of them and particulars of the several statutory or other enactments so adapted, amended or modified by virtue of each such Order, and the extent of such adaptations, amendments or modifications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>After the discussion to which we have listened to-day, it is hardly necessary to remind the House that its functions in relation to the making of legislation are somewhat limited.  As everybody is aware, any Bill that comes before this House can become law within a period of three months in the form in which it reaches the House, whether we like it or not.  It is understandable, therefore, that members may have some reluctance to devote the time and attention to legislation which must be devoted to it in the Dáil.  I do not want it to be inferred, however, that because of these circumstances the members of this House are less attentive to the legislation which comes before the House than are the members <Col N="141" /> of the Dáil.  On the contrary, I think a substantial number of members of this House pay great attention to the business which properly comes before us and devote a very great deal of their time to the study of the legislation which reaches them and they endeavour to amend it and improve it.</P>
    <P>There is one function which, it seems to me, the House should perform and it is a function that the House alone can perform in the circumstances of the case&mdash;that is, to give attention to, and watch closely, what is done outside Parliament under the authority of the legislation passed through both Houses.  Everybody is familiar with the practice which has grown up of giving Ministers wide powers to make regulations by Order which, when made, have the effect of an Act of the Oireachtas.  In many cases the regulations which are made under these Acts cover a very wide field.  In bulk they are probably five times as great as the Act which gives rise to them.</P>
    <P>This motion is not concerned with the making of regulations in the ordinary way; it is concerned with a very narrow field, but one of great significance in the realm of regulation-making by Ministers.  The proposal in the motion is that a White Paper be submitted setting out particulars of the several statutory or other enactments now in force which were made under the authority of Acts of the Oireachtas or earlier legislation, authorising the Minister to modify Acts of Parliament. So far as I have been able to discover &mdash;although I do not at all assert that I have made a very careful study of the problem&mdash;the origin of this procedure may be found in the Local Government Act of 1898.  Section 104 of that Act authorised the Lord Lieutenant of the day by an Order in Council to declare that certain stated provisions of British and Scottish Acts of Parliament would have effect in Ireland. There are two things to which I want to draw attention in that regard.  In the first place, there was no power to apply any Act except an Act mentioned in the Statute as being capable of being applied to Ireland. In the second place, the Order which applied these enactments was not an <Col N="142" /> Order made by a Minister or by a Government Department; it was an Order in Council.  We have no machinery equivalent to an Order in Council.  The Order is now made by a Department or a Minister.</P>
    <P>I want to emphasise that the procedure followed in 1898 was the making of an Order in Council applying certain named and specific enactments&mdash;not a roving commission modifying and applying anything one wished&mdash;but under that clause, Section 104 of the Local Government Act of 1898, we got the Application of Enactments Order which as far as I remember runs into 50 foolscap pages of print.  What has happened since then?  Take the Local Government Act of 1925.  Section 86 of the Act says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Minister may by Order.... make such adaptations of any existing enactments (including any Local Act) relating to any matter dealt with or affected by this Act as appear to him necessary or expedient for carrying this Act into effect.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is a very wide departure from the principle contained in the Act of 1898 and, so far as I know, nobody outside official circles can have any knowledge of what was done under Section 86 of that Local Government Act.  I suppose the legal members of this House will be familiar with what is done and will be able to tell us where these Orders, if there are such Orders, may be found.</P>
    <P>I have in my mind the position of an ordinary member of a county council, an urban council or of any local body, whether a corporation or not, who is face to face in his representative capacity with the effect of regulations about which he can have no knowledge. You can imagine a member of the county council in Kerry, Donegal or Galway coming into a meeting, to discuss a matter which appears on the agenda, having a view of his own as to how it might be dealt with and he is confronted with the manager or the clerk who tells him, &ldquo;You cannot do that; it is prohibited by an Order made by the Minister under Section 86 of the Local Government Act of 1925&rdquo;. Whether the clerk is right or not&mdash;he is not always right in these matters&mdash; the member of the council is powerless <Col N="143" /> because he has never seen the Order.  He is not in a position to say whether or not the Order prohibits him doing what he wants to do.</P>
    <P>We go further and we get the Public Assistance Act of 1939.  You will observe that in this case the authority given to the Minister goes still further.  Section 89 of the Public Assistance Act says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Minister may by Order make such adaptations and modifications of any enactment in force at the commencement of this Act and relating to any matter or thing dealt with or affected by this Act as appear to him to be necessary or expedient for carrying this Act into effect or for enabling this Act to have full force and effect.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>You see a number of new words inserted in that section which did not appear in Section 86 of the Local Government Act of 1925.  I imagine these words were inserted because they have some meaning.  I cannot imagine a draftsman importing new words and phrases into a section unless it is done for a purpose.  I assume that the purpose it was intended to have was that Section 89 of the Public Assistance Act should have a much wider application than Section 86 of the Local Government Act.  Section 281 of the Mental Treatment Act is almost identical with Section 89 of the Public Assistance Act and we shall have, in the course of the next few weeks, other Bills in which there is a continuation of this principle of conferring on a Minister power to modify, to adapt or to do pretty well what he likes with any Act of Parliament so far as he considers it necessary that an alteration should be made in the existing statute to enable him to do what he is asked to do under a particular Act.  Where the layman who happens to be a member of this House or of a local authority is to be acquainted with the activities of Ministers under these provisions I do not know.</P>
    <P>I am aware from personal knowledge that officials of public bodies do not even know where they can lay their hands on some of these Orders.  I <Col N="144" /> remember on one occasion being concerned with interviewing an important official of a county council.  Some questions had been asked to test his knowledge of local administration.  He was looking for promotion and casually I asked him the question whether he was familiar with the Application of Enactments Order.  He said he had never seen it.  I said: &ldquo;Surely there is a copy of the Application of Enactments Order in the office of the county council.&rdquo; He replied: &ldquo;There is; the secretary has a copy locked up in the safe and it is very hard to get at it.  I have never seen it.&rdquo; This man was a highly placed official.  I said: &ldquo;Would not the secretary of the county council let you take it out and read it?&rdquo; He replied: &ldquo;He would not; he would not give a copy of it to anybody living.&rdquo; That is the experience of a person who had a responsible position in the office of a county council.  How can the county councillor who comes up from a remote part of the country to attend a meeting of the county council become familiar with the provisions of those Orders when a highly placed official whose job it is to administer them cannot lay his hands on a copy?</P>
    <P>What I am asking in this case is that a White Paper be submitted, setting out briefly the names of the Acts which have been modified or adapted, and showing the effect of the Orders made for the purpose of modifying or adapting them.  I think it is a reasonable request, and I think it is the kind of thing in which this House particularly should be interested.  As I have said, if they cannot have the same effect that the Dáil has on shaping the character of legislation, at least they have the function of seeing what is being done outside the Oireachtas under the authority of statutes.  That is a function which cannot be fulfilled by the Dáil because of the nature of its work, and because of the kind of tasks which come before it.  For instance, we know that in the Dáil a considerable amount of time is devoted to consideration of the Estimates for Public Services.  We are saved all that. Therefore, I submit that it is incumbent upon us to pay attention to what <Col N="145" /> is being done, as in this case, under the authority of statutes, and to see that the public knows what is being done and how it is being done.</P>

      <P>The question raised by Senator Duffy is a very important one. The motion, in my submission, is rather inadequate.  The motion merely requires the Government to furnish in the form of a White Paper particulars of the several enactments now in force which empower a Minister of State to legislate, that is, to legislate in a certain way, namely, by Order to adapt, amend or modify Acts of the Oireachtas or other statutory enactments in force.  Those enactments can be easily enumerated.  They can be found by reading through the Acts of the Oireachtas and the British Acts in force.  The second part of the motion, which requires particulars of the Orders, or the manner in which those enactments have been adapted, amended or modified, is more difficult perhaps, but more illuminating, because there the things will be given.  This power which is vested in Ministers of State by Acts of the Oireachtas is not a new one.  In England that form of section in an Act is known as the King Henry VIII section, because in the time of King Henry VIII Parliament passed a law enabling the King to legislate by Proclamation, and this is the analogy, that the Parliament by law empowers a Minister to legislate by Order.  This sweeping section in an Act of Parliament, handing over to the Minister very large powers of legislation, has well been described as the King Henry VIII section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the year 1929 there was set up in England a committee on Ministers' powers.  The chairman of that committee was the Earl of Donoughmore, and it was a very representative committee.  The ordinary power of a Minister is an executive power, but this committee had to deal with the extraordinary powers of a Minister, namely, the legislative power, which is outside his ordinary function, and the judicial power, which the Constitution provides should be separated from the executive power.  The report of that <Col N="146" /> committee was published in the year 1932.  It is in our Library here, and it well repays perusal.  I think the command number is 4060, 1932.  That committee dealt with what I may call the extraordinary powers of Ministers.  It dealt with the legislative power on the one hand, and it dealt with the judicial powers or quasi-judicial powers on the other hand.  Under the judicial powers or quasi-judicial powers, it dealt with the holding of inquiries by Ministers acting as judges and administrators at the same time.  The motion before us to-night, of course, does not deal with the judicial or quasi-judicial powers of Ministers, but it does refer to what I may call the legislative powers of Ministers. From the time of Montesquieu, through the American Constitution down to the 1922 Constitution here, there has been an effort made to segregate the three powers of government, namely, the legislative, the executive, and the judicial power, to keep them in watertight compartments and to restrict the intrusion of a person occupying an executive position either into the judicial or legislative sphere, and likewise to restrict the Legislature from acting in an executive or in a judicial capacity.</P>
    <P>Under our present Constitution, there has been a weakening of that segregation, and the tendency at the present time is to blot out that well-known historical distinction of the separation of the powers or segregation of the functions of the Legislature, the Executive and the judiciary.  If it has come to stay&mdash;and it is a very hard thing in present conditions for the Legislature to legislate on every topic upon which legislation is required&mdash;it becomes necessary to have a certain amount of delegation of the powers of legislation to persons who occupy the position of specialists, to make subsidiary legislation.  We have had a considerable amount of legislation by Order since this State was set up.  We had a great number of Statutory Orders made in the early twenties, which are very difficult to obtain to-day.  Senator Duffy mentioned a moment ago that the solitary copy of the Application of Enactments Order in the county council office was locked up in the secretary's <Col N="147" /> safe.  I can quite understand that, because I think that, now, that Order can only be obtained either in Vanston's <i>Local Government</i> (Vol. 1.) for which you will pay one or two guineas, or perhaps even three guineas, or else, perhaps, there is one copy in each county council office in the country, and, presumably, there may be some copies in the Department of Local Government and Public Health.  Now, these Orders were made in 1899 and, probably, are now out of print, and while everybody is supposed to know the law&mdash;ignorance of the law is no excuse&mdash;everybody cannot find the law. An effort was made here recently to bring together the Statutory Orders from 1922 to 1938, and a copy of this has been published by the Government Publications Sales Office.</P>

      <P>Before the adjournment for tea, I stated that everybody was presumed to know the law, and that ignorance of the law was no excuse, but in order to know the law it should be possible to find out where the law is.  A great portion of our law, under the heading of statutory law, comprises not only the statutes of the Oireachtas, but Statutory Rules, Orders and regulations made under powers vested in the rule-making authority by the Oireachtas.  A few days ago I received from the Government Publications Sale Office the bound volume of the 1944 Statutes of the Oireachtas.  If any person thought that was all the statutes made law in 1944 he is making a great mistake.  We all know that there were hundred of Statutory Orders made in the year 1944, a great number of them, no doubt, under the Emergency Powers Act.  All these Statutory Rules and Orders affect the rights and impose liabilities on the citizens of the State, and I respectfully submit that it is essential that these Statutory Rules and Orders should be as accessible to the public as the Statutes of the Oireachtas are.  A layman may enter the Government Publications Sale Office and buy a copy of any particular set back to 1922 or 1923, but he <Col N="148" /> may find some difficulty in getting some particular Statutory Rule or Order.  It often happens that a Statutory Order is made which does not affect the citizen, perhaps for some years afterwards, and when that occasion arises it becomes applicable. Since this State was set up in 1922, a number of Statutory Rules and Orders has been made.  In my opinion in the early years from 1922 to 1925, the importance of these Statutory Rules and Orders was considerably underrated, and great numbers of them are locked up in Government offices.  Some of them were never printed or published and, therefore, the public had not the opportunity of knowing what statute law has been enacted.</P>
      <P>Within the last few years the Government appreciated the chaos that existed, as far as Statutory Rules and Orders are concerned, and made an effort to collect these Statutory Rules and Orders from the year 1922 to the year 1938 inclusive.  These Statutory Orders were gathered together, and were bound in 14 or 15 volumes, not under the particular years, but under the particular subject or the particular Ministry concerned. An index was made of that collection and is on sale at the Government Publications Sale Office for 10/6.  But at the present moment, these collected Statutory Rules and Orders cannot be purchased by the ordinary citizen in the bound form.  A certain number of these collected volumes was sent by the Government to a number of libraries, for example, King's Inns Library, the Law Library of the Four Courts, the Solicitors' Library, the National Library and others, but outside these libraries the Statutory Orders in collected form are not available.  We all know that, for a considerable number of years, these Statutory Orders have been published year by year in England, and if a person wishes to find out the contents of any particular Statutory Order made in any particular year, all he has to do is to refer to the bound volume of Statutory Orders for that particular year, and he can find what he is looking for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest to the Government that an <Col N="149" /> effort should now be made, even though it is belated, to collect the Statutory Rules and Orders made since the year 1922, and to publish these Statutory Rules and Orders in bound volumes for each year, not mixed up together as at the moment, but for each year from 1922 up to date.  We would then have what I may call a body of law available to the ordinary citizen.  This will be supplementary to the statutes enacted since 1922.  It is better to do that late than never.  The number of years which have elapsed since 1922 is comparatively small, and unless the work is undertaken, our statutory law will remain in a rather chaotic and unsatisfactory state.  The statutes of the Oireachtas are on the table of the Clerk of the Seanad, but they are only a portion of our statutory law and we are deceiving ourselves if we think that they represent the whole of the statutory law.  If those Statutory Rules and Orders were available year after year to a layman, such as Senator Duffy, it would not be necessary to bring forward this motion. I do not think that the motion is very practical.  It raises a very important point, but it is rather unusual to ask the Government to publish a White Paper showing how powers vested by the Oireachtas in Ministers to adapt, amend or modify statutes of the Oireachtas have been used in practice. If we had the Statutory Rules and Orders available, Senator Duffy could look at each Order or Rule passed from 1922 to 1938 and ascertain the position for himself.  It is merely imposing unnecessary work on officials to ask for this White Paper.  The energy which would be devoted to this task could be more profitably employed by the officials in collecting the Statutory Rules and Orders, year by year, since 1922, putting them together, having them bound and selling them through the Government Publications Office. That is one aspect of the motion.</P>
    <P>The motion has another aspect.  That is the aspect referable to the Application of Enactments Order under the Local Government Act, 1898.  We are at a great disadvantage in so far as Orders made under Acts of the British Parliament before 1922 are concerned. <Col N="150" /> Those Orders were published by the Stationery Office in London.  They continued to be in operation here under the law which we carried over when the State was set up.  It is as essential that they should be available now as it was when they were first made.  I suggest that those Orders which are applicable to this country and are still in force should be collected and reprinted. It is almost impossible to get a copy of an Order made 30 or 40 years ago.  If I were to write to London for one of those Orders, I should, probably, be told that it was out of print.  When we cut the painter, the British Stationery Office lost interest in us and were no longer concerned to preserve those Orders for us. It devolves on us to make sure that those Orders which continue in force are available to citizens in printed form.  Senator Duffy has raised an important point but I do not think that he should press the motion.  By raising the question which he has raised, he has achieved something.  I am sure that the Government will recognise the position and that they will place our statutory law on a satisfactory basis as soon as possible for our own benefit and the benefit of those who will come after us.</P>

      <P>I have addressed the House so often on subjects akin to this subject that members are familiar with my views and I do not intend to press them on them at any length to-night.  I support Senator Duffy's motion in the form in which it was drafted.  I must take mild exception to a certain fear expressed by Senator Ryan.  He suggested that a great deal of work would be involved in giving effect to this motion. I doubt that that is so.  Every Department has at its fingertips the Orders which it has itself made, altering a statute or modifying it in any way or giving effect to provisions in a statute.  It is the very blood of the Departments' veins and they know how it circulates.  If we can get out a volume such as the <i>Statistical Abstract,</i> with all the labour that that involves, this work could be done by the Departments concerned within a week without very much trouble so far as the <Col N="151" /> compilation is concerned.  Only this morning I heard that, on inquiry being made at the offices of a very big local body with regard to two or three Orders, made for them, it was discovered that that body had no copy of the Orders and did not know where they could be got.  What we want is, in the first place, a key to the maze and, in the second place, reproduction of the contents of the maze.  I agree with Senator Ryan in that but it is unfair to suggest that Senator Duffy's motion&mdash;which is only a necessary preliminary&mdash;would involve anything like the extent of work which the Senator suggested.</P>

      <P>May I suggest that, if the terms of the motion are agreed to, no publication be made until we shall have passed the new Local Government Bill and the Public Health Bill, because they will, probably, do away with many of the Orders which have been made?  That will appreciably lessen the work.  A number of those Orders has been repealed.  The Procedure-in-Council Order, for instance, which took up a large portion of Vanston, has been repealed.  A great part of the Application of Enactments Order has also been repealed and there will, probably, be more repeals under the new Acts.</P>

      <P>I cannot take the view that Senator Kingsmill Moore takes, that this would be an easy task. My information is that it would be a task of considerable magnitude.  The question I am considering is whether the time that would be occupied in making this return would be justified. I take quite a different view of the suggestion by Senator Ryan, because work done in the direction indicated by him would, undoubtedly, be of permanent value.  The trouble in connection with returns of this sort is that, if they are not complete, they are worse than useless; they are dangerous. Therefore, it is necessary to make sure that the whole ground is covered.  That cannot be done without the expenditure of a great deal of time.  For many years I have been urging the adoption of procedure by <Col N="152" /> which we would, by degrees, consolidate our laws.  Certain steps are being taken to that end and I hope that, before long, we shall have definitely started upon the work.</P>
      <P>The task involved by giving effect to this motion would be one of considerable magnitude.  It would mean going through not only all the statutes passed here since 1922 but the British statutes which were taken over.  I do not think it is right to say that the Departments have these Orders available to themselves in that particular form. Senator Kingsmill Moore's statement might be applicable to Orders which were actually in use.  But we are asked for a return in respect of all those in force, which would, I take it, cover those which are capable of being used.  I admit the justice of the argument that work of this sort is necessary and that it is not right we should have our laws hidden away so as to make access to them difficult.  There may be difficulties which I do not perceive at the moment but, subject to those difficulties, I would urge very strongly on the Government that the work Senator Ryan suggested should be undertaken. That is to say, that we should have in accessible form, year by year, the Statutory Orders made since 1922.  I am speaking as a layman.  I have not examined the matter in detail. There may be difficulties in doing as I suggest, but these difficulties should, if possible, be overcome.  It is but right, too, that Statutory Orders applicable here from the pre-1922 period should be pursued and made available.  That I am content to recommend should be done, but this type of return would require a great deal of research and would not be of much value.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As for the future, on the broad question of the giving of powers to Ministers and to the Government to make Orders of this kind, it will be for the Dáil and Seanad to see that such powers are given in a restricted form, if that can be done.  In particular cases, there may be special difficulties and it may be necessary to insert an omnibus clause but a time-restriction could be inserted.  If powers were given, for example, to enable an Act to be put <Col N="153" /> into operation, it might be provided that the initial part would be done in a certain time and then any difficulties likely to crop up would show themselves. You could also have a safeguard in the provision that Orders be laid before the Dáil and Seanad and be open to discussion.  These matters involve some difficulty and we have to see how far we can go in the desired direction.  With regard to those general powers of adaptation, such powers are generally given to a Minister bringing in a large measure, having a bearing on a number of previous statutes.  He cannot see precisely in advance how difficulties in connection with those statutes will impinge on the Act in question.  Those general powers are necessary in those cases but it is objectionable always to have an omnibus clause.  However, one oftentimes goes to a great deal of trouble to particularise and then finds that he is beaten and cannot sufficiently foresee things likely to arise so as to make provision for them.  You find then that, to do a practical piece of work, room will have to be found for an omnibus clause.  I do not think that those powers have been abused in any case. A great many of the powers are spent; they have exhausted themselves and the necessity for using them has passed long since.  It is very questionable that a court would hold that an Order was justified in accordance with the terms of the omnibus clause after the passage of so many years.  I do not think that we would be dealing with an immediate and practical problem in furnishing this return.  I admit that there is need for proceeding on the lines indicated by Senator Ryan.  If the Senator who brought forward this motion would be satisfied, I would undertake&mdash;I can only do my best and there may be difficulties in the way which I do not now see&mdash;to press for the carrying out of the suggestion made by Senator Ryan and to try to get those Orders brought together in volumes year after year. If they are already in existence, from say, 1922 to 1938, it would not be a very hard task to segregate them and to arrange them according to years, and, as I take it, a large number have not <Col N="154" /> been published, there will not be any loss, so to speak, in discarding a number of volumes which have cost public money to produce.  There is, therefore, a practical task which we could face there.  I do not know, if we go on with the process of consolidation, how far it would mean the incorporation into the statute law as it is of Orders as well as statutes of the Oireachtas.  It possibly would mean that, but in any case the doing of what is suggested here in preparing these Orders would be valuable for those considering the question of consolidation and, therefore, the money spent&mdash;and the time of officials and the disorganisation of other work mean money&mdash;would be spent for a purpose with a definite and permanent value.  I again urge the Senator not to proceed with his motion in its present form, but to accept the suggestion made.  We do not need a motion from the Seanad in relation to it because I can promise that it will be done, if it can be done.  It will be done unless there is something which I cannot see at the moment in the way.</P>

      <P>Senator Duffy is to be congratulated most sincerely on putting this motion down in that it has drawn a statement from the Taoiseach which I think should be especially marked in the records of the House and for the opening portion of which a special red ink should be used, because, in the very limited time I have been in this House, we, on these benches, on practically every measure have requested the Minister in charge to agree that the regulations to be made by him and his Department under it should be limited, first, as to time, and, secondly, as to degree.  We have on practically every occasion also urged the Minister in charge to agree that the regulations to be made by him and his Department under these measures should be tabled before each House of the Oireachtas, and both of these suggestions have been seriously fought against by the Ministers concerned. Only in the case of the Children's Allowances Act was it accepted and then it was accepted grudgingly and not in a full and complete manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been the practice of Government <Col N="155" /> Departments in the framing of regulations in recent years consistently to omit any provision for the tabling of these regulations.  It has been the practice to add, perhaps necessarily, a special section providing that the Minister concerned will have power to amend the Act if, in its initial operation, it should be found that there was some detail which required amendment. We did not object to that, but we always tried to have it limited, and for that reason and because we have to-day got the whole-hearted imprimatur of the Taoiseach on the efforts we have made to limit the power of Government Departments, I rise to congratulate Senator Duffy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel that the motion has very largely served its purpose. It deals with two propositions: the question of Orders made heretofore and the question of the introduction into future Bills of this provision authorising a Minister to make regulations. In the Local Government Bill, 1945, which should come before us in the near future, there is a provision which says that the Minister may by Order make such adaptations in any statutory or other enactments in force at the beginning of the Act and relating to any matter affected by the Act as are in his opinion necessary to enable the enactment to have effect in conformity with it.  That, again, is totally different language from that to which I drew attention already.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is, however, one saving feature about it, and I make so bold as to hope that the motion we are now discussing has had an effect on the Minister's mind, because he is making provision in the new Bill that any Orders made under it will be tabled, so that, so far as the future is concerned, any Orders made under the Local Government Bill <Col N="156" /> when it becomes an Act will be printed and laid on the Tables of both Houses and we shall have an opportunity of seeing what he is doing.  We tried to get that done on the Mental Treatment Bill, but failed.  What the Taoiseach has just suggested was impressed here on members of the Government, that is to say, that the power to make these adaptations and modifications should not extend beyond a certain limited time.  We suggested that there should be no power to interfere with existing legislation by Ministerial Order unless it were exercised within, say, 12 months of the passing of the measure. We failed to get that done, and I respectfully suggest that there are many instances in which Local Government officials, much less members of local councils, have no knowledge of the law they are applying.</P>
    <P>I want to make it clear that I was not dealing with Emergency Powers Orders.  These have a temporary life, and when the Emergency Powers Act, 1939, expires, all these regulations fall with it.  They have no validity except by virtue of the 1939 Act.  I was not referring, as Senator Ryan seems to think, to the whole body of regulations. I was referring only to an Order made by a Minister for the purpose of adapting or modifying an Act of the Oireachtas or a British statute.  Take the Local Government Act of 1945. Surely it is not too much to say that the Department of Local Government have in their offices copies of any Orders made under Section 86 of that Act?  It is almost unbelievable that that Department would not have in their offices now copies of every Order made under the authority of Section 86 of that Act.  If they have these Orders, it would not take them more than ten minutes to assemble them for publication. I take it that if there are Orders made under the Mental Treatment Act, 1945, these are available in the Department and it should not take very long to collect them and to have them printed.</P>
    <P>While I agree with the Taoiseach that if you set out to reproduce a complete list of these Orders, showing the modifications in other statutes effected by them, you may mislead, and, in <Col N="157" /> fact, will mislead the public if it is not a complete and accurate list.  But that could be done by instalments. There is nothing to prevent the Department of Local Government issuing a White Paper showing the portions of the Application of Enactments Order now in force.  There is nothing to prevent it producing a White Paper showing what Orders have been made under the Act of 1925 or the Act of 1940.  Let us bear in mind that the bulk of these provisions, authorising the Minister by Order to modify and adapt an existing statute, are almost entirely Local Government Acts.  They apply very rarely in any other case, though I notice that they have been brought into the new Harbours Bill in a most extraordinary manner.  That, however, is a matter that we can discuss when the Harbours Bill comes before the House.</P>
    <P>I do not want to press this motion, but I do hope that some action will be taken, arising out of what the Taoiseach has said, to impress on Government Departments the fact that the public at large are severely handicapped in protecting their interests and in defending their rights if they are denied access, as they have been, to Orders and Regulations, affecting many phases of their activities, made by Government Departments and not published.  I think it is known to the members of the legal profession who are members of this House that cases have come into court in which it was discovered that there was no copy of the Order, under which the prosecution was brought, available.  In fact, I seem to recollect a case that was taken to court where there was no copy of the Order at all available, either written or printed.  I am satisfied, however, that nothing more would be achieved by having a division on the motion than what has already been achieved, and, with the permission of the House, I am prepared to withdraw it.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 7:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (2), page 6, to delete paragraph (c).</P>
      <P>The object of this amendment is to bring back, within the scope of the Bill, flats which, after the 7th day of May, 1941, have been created from the <i>bona fide</i> reconstruction of houses. There is a later amendment of mine which seeks to suggest to the Seanad the way in which the rent for those flats may be fixed.  I am bringing this matter before the Seanad in the form of two amendments, more with the desire to submit it to Senators for their consideration than in any effort to press any view of my own.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The object of this Bill is not to prevent people making a reasonable economic profit or of getting reasonable rents, but rather to prevent extortionate rents in cases where there is an element of monopoly value arising through no effort or foresight of the landlord, but through circumstances outside his control.  At this stage I think it is necessary to make a slight digression from the immediate amendment before the House, because it was quite clear yesterday that several members of the House were not aware of the origin of these Acts or of economic conditions which gave them birth, or, indeed, of the political justification for their existence.  They were not aimed at fair rents.  They were aimed at preventing extortionate rents.  From time to time a state of affairs arises when one class of men, or one man, is in such a position that he can hold, or that the class can hold, the public up to ransom.  It has always been the policy of the law to prevent a person taking an unconscionable advantage of such a position.  May I give a very simple example which will explain the difference between a monopoly charge and a reasonable increased charge? Suppose a man is drowning near a pier and that there is another man on the pier who has a life belt which is his private property and that there is no other life belt there.  Leaving <Col N="159" /> humanity out of it for the moment, if these two men were free to bargain, the drowning man would be prepared to offer every penny that he had in the world to get the life belt, irrespective of the price, to the one man who had a monopoly of the only commodity which could save his life.  That is the kind of thing that the law sets its face against.  But suppose he is given the life belt, there is no reason in the world why, if the life belt is destroyed in saving him, the fair market price of the life belt should not be paid.  Or take the case of a man in a yacht which is drifting on a lee shore.  There is only one tug there.  Again, if that position is left to ordinary bargaining, because the position is such that the person wants the tug and that there is only one person who can save the man in the yacht, the latter will pay hundreds of thousands of pounds, in fact everything that he has, for the tug. The law will not allow that, but if he does get the tug he has to pay a salvage charge.  He has to pay for the risk and for any increase in the price of coal or cordage.  In other words, he has to pay a fair charge.</P>
    <P>Up to the year 1914, the ordinary law of supply and demand in regard to both houses and flats worked pretty well.  If landlords were charging too much, that is to say, charging what would be an unfair return upon their outlay, having regard to the risks and wasting nature of their capital, then people would build houses or flats and the landlords would be forced to bring down their rents.  Similarly, if tenants were not willing to give enough, the ordinary law of economics would apply, and people would not build houses.  But in 1914 you suddenly had a situation created by the Great War in which the ordinary laws could not apply.  There could be no building because there were no materials.  Neither had you the men because they were all engaged in the war.  By reason of that you got an artificial scarcity of houses in which the landlords for the time being were possessed of an article which had a quasi-monopoly value. They were in a position to hold the public, who must be housed, up to <Col N="160" /> ransom, and to demand sums which were quite out of proportion to their expenditure.  The law stepped in and said: &ldquo;We are not going to allow people to be victimised in that way; we will take the 1914 rent; we will allow additions to it because we realise there has been a rise in the cost of everything; we will protect the people in the possession of their own houses because if they could be turned out according to the ordinary law of contract and the landlord could make a new bargain, then a mere limitation on the rent would be ineffectual, and we will pass an Act which will give the landlord what we think is a fair return but will prevent him from profiteering by reason of the monopoly.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is the origin of these Acts, and to suggest, as was suggested in the Seanad yesterday, that their object was to transfer portion of property from the landlord to the tenant is an entirely erroneous conclusion.  In the earlier Acts flats and newly-built houses were excluded.  Flats which were built between 1919 and 1940 are now brought under the operation of the Bill which is at present before the House and houses up to a valuation of £60 are brought into the Bill which is before the House.  Looking casually through <i>Thom's Directory</i> at the houses with a valuation of £40-£60 in a certain street, I found that they were occupied by some of the best-known and richest medical specialists in Ireland, people earning £4,000 and £5,000 a year, probably, at the very least, consultant surgeons to the great hospitals. These are the houses that you are protecting and these are the men you are protecting from having one penny put on to their rent.  In many cases the landlords are poorer.  But you are leaving out of the protection the unfortunate person, the civil servant or the clerk, who has to have a flat near his work, who has to come to the Government office or to the ordinary office, who will be content with perhaps two rooms or three rooms provided they have amenities in the form of a kitchen and a water closet. It is open to a person, a rich person earning thousands of pounds, in a <Col N="161" /> house for which he may be paying £80, to turn that into five flats and to recover for those five flats a sum of £600, or £700, or perhaps £800, and that is being done all over the city. Sums of well over £100 are being asked for what are practically two-roomed flats, according to such information as is at my disposal.  If you were to take the Bill as drafted at present, you are protecting the prosperous and sometimes very prosperous businessman and professional man and you are leaving a poor class of flat dweller to the mercy of such landlords&mdash;I do not know that there are many, but I think there are a few&mdash;as are willing to take every penny they can get.</P>
    <P>That is one side of the picture.  I told you I was not producing this amendment as an advocate and now I am going to give you the other side because all I am anxious to do is to put it clearly before the House.  The reason why the Bill was drafted like this is quite obvious.  It is in the interests of the country as a whole to have more flats made and to have them made quickly.  Dublin is full of large houses, three, four and more storeys, and with large gardens, which were built for conditions in life when servants were plentiful and wages were low and when the life of a relatively crowded servants' hall, where the food was good, had an attraction for a considerable number of people.  That has passed for ever and undoubtedly, in the interests of the community as a whole, it is desirable that many of these big houses in Dublin, which cannot be run except with a staff of servants, should be turned into four or five flats.  It is desirable to give an inducement to people to do that because it will be a step towards solving the housing problem, and I think it is desirable that people who take that step should be given a good and a generous return upon their money.  That is why, although I ask that flats which have been constructed after 1940 should be within the scope of the Bill, at a later stage I am suggesting a method of fixing rents for them which should prove an inducement to people to continue with the work of creating such flats.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="162" /> I do not know that I am in order in referring to a later amendment but I think that the view of the House as to whether this amendment should be accepted or not might perhaps be influenced by the later one.  I do not want to transgress the rules in any way.  I wish just to indicate what the later amendment is.  From 1919 to 1940 houses from £40 to £60 and all flats were uncontrolled.  The houses and flats are now being brought under control, but by 1940 the amount of building that had been done on the outskirts of Dublin and the amount of flats which had been built had for the time being created a situation in which demand and supply were reasonably equal and in which the rent for flats, though I would consider it on the whole very much higher than the rent of equivalent houses, was not of an extortionate nature.  The ordinary economic forces had begun to have play.  So that, if you take as your standard the rent paid for a flat in 1940 you are taking as your standard a rent which, while a little bit on the high side, is on the whole probably not unfair to either landlord or tenant.  Therefore I seek by a later amendment, having brought flats back into the picture, to make the basis of the rent which is to be charged for them the rent which they could have been expected to fetch on short term letting if they had been erected before 1940.  That is to say, I ask the court to fix the same standard which is suggested in an earlier part of the Bill for houses for these flats but I recognise that if you fix as the rent of the flat the sum which it ought to have fetched for rent if it had been built before 1940 that the landlord may say, &ldquo;Yes.  As far as accommodation goes, that is reasonable but I have done my reconstruction at a period after 1940 and since 1940 the cost of materials has gone up and the cost of work has gone up and therefore my expenditure is greater than it would have been if I had created the flat before 1940 and the 1940 rent would not be adequate.&rdquo; Therefore I seek to provide that in addition to the basic figure of what would have been the 1940 rent if the flat had then been constructed the court may add a further sum to the rent in order to recoup the landlord for <Col N="163" /> any extra expenditure that may have been involved in building at a time when building was in fact more expensive.</P>
    <P>Those are the matters that I should like the House to consider merely as having been put before it by me, not as if I was advocating them, but I will, I think, say this, that it was not until a good deal of thought had been given and a good deal of consultation had taken place with other people that I put down the amendments in the form in which they now are, and that they will at least form a basis for discussion because I do believe very strongly that the greatest extortion at the present moment is occurring in the case of flats.  Flats are fetching about three times as much as a house of relevant accommodation or rather I would say this: you can get a house with three times the accommodation of a flat for the price you would have to pay for a flat.  But, of course, that does not suit everybody.  That is a medium-sized house and there are people who must have flats.  On all hands I hear complaints as to, I will say, the very high charges for flats and I think they should be brought under control.  But you must be careful not to control them in such a way as to prevent any inducement to landlords to go on helping to solve the housing question by building more flats.</P>

      <P>I am very much impressed by what Senator Kingsmill Moore has said on this matter.  I am sure he has a lot of knowledge of it.  I speak as one who has very little, if any knowledge, about this question of flats and I am not terribly interested in the matter. But, from the general standpoint of interference with private property, I feel something might be said about it. I certainly have no sympathy with the owner of a house who would seek to gain the exorbitant rents mentioned by Senator Kingsmill Moore.  I suggest, however, that it might be possible to deal with this question from another standpoint.  We have the <Col N="164" /> example of the excess profits duty, and it often struck me that that would be something to go upon in dealing with this question.  If it could be shown that a person was making these extraordinary, fabulous profits, why not apply a plan such as that and scoop off 75 or 100 per cent. of the profit which could be regarded as normal or reasonable allowing for the emergency conditions of the time?  That would leave the question of private ownership untouched and would also help to keep down those extravagant rents, because if a person charging these rents knows that he will probably lose rather than gain, he will possibly reconsider the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there is a case for bringing these flats under control. The reason why flats built after the 7th May, 1941, were not brought under control is the same as for houses built after that date, because we realised that there were extra costs and all the rest of it.  The same thing would apply to houses as applies to flats, if there was evidence that extortionate rents were being demanded for houses. I made it quite clear in the Dáil on the conclusion of the Second Reading debate when the question was definitely put to me that, if I had evidence of that, I would have no hesitation in asking the Government to control such houses.  I had no evidence about houses, but I think there is extortion in the matter of flats.  For that reason I think they will have to be brought under control.  Whether the method suggested here is the proper one or not is another matter.  I think that what we should try to do is to arrive at some fair figure giving a return on the outlay of the person in converting these large houses into flats.  I would say the same thing about those persons as about those building houses that they were conferring a benefit on the public by making accommodation available.  But you cannot allow people to be charged any price the person who owns this scarce commodity wishes to charge.  As there is evidence of this, I propose between this and the Report Stage to consider this whole matter and bring in an amendment dealing with it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kingsmill Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of what the Minister has said, may I explain an element which, if he is considering the matter, he will have to take into consideration?  The reason why the argument about houses does not apply to flats is that a house costs a lot to build.  A self-contained flat, according to the definition, is merely a flat which need not be boarded off or physically separated, but a flat which has facilities for cooking and a lavatory and bath.  I am aware of cases where separate self-contained flats have been made for an expenditure of about £20, whereas a house would cost something in the nature of £2,000 possibly.  But if you merely give a person the interest on what he spent, you are not going to encourage the person who has spent, say, £200 in creating, shall we say, four flats in a house.  If you merely give him 8 per cent. or £16, you are only recouping him for his expenditure; you are not recouping him for his brains or initiative or his planning or his difficulty in collecting.  That is why I suggest that you should take as a basis the kind of rent which economic conditions had stabilised in 1940 for similar flats, and that you add to that any extra expense which would have been incurred in addition to what would have been incurred at 1940 prices.  I doubt very much whether it will be sufficient merely to give the person what may be the very small cost of reconversion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>Yesterday I made a suggestion in relation to a similar set of circumstances, which I think was reasonable, and is reasonable in this case; that, having regard to the increased expenditure which is incurred where houses have been reconstructed during the last three years, it might be left to the court to decide what was a fair rent.  Senator Kingsmill Moore makes a suggestion in relation to a basic figure.  If that is satisfactory, I have no objection.  If it is not satisfactory, I still want to have control, even though we say to the court: &ldquo;Do the best you can; fix a fair rent, whatever you think is reasonable.&rdquo; I suggest to the Minister that this question of reconstructing flats in recent years has become one of the dangerous <Col N="166" /> rackets.  There has been an inflow of people into this country, particularly into Dublin and the neighbourhood of Dublin, with large sums of money which they are unable to spend elsewhere, because it was derived from a black market.  They hold all this money in currency of large denominations. They are buying houses here and converting them into flats and charging exorbitant rents, because they are still pursuing black market tactics.</P>
      <P>I will give an instance of one case in the County of Dublin.  The rent of the house in question in 1941 or 1942 was £100 per year, inclusive of taxes. There are a number of houses on the road in which this house is situated let to-day at £100 a year.  A certain gentleman came to this State about 1943 or 1944 and bought this particular house that I have in mind.  He has spent £500 in converting it into four flats.  The rents charged for these flats are: top flat, £75; first-floor flat, £80; hall-door flat, £90, and the basement flat £40 a year.  There is more expense, but it represents an income of £285 a year in respect of a house which was rented at £100 in 1941.  Actually, assuming we give him the 8 per cent. on the £500 which he expended in reconstructing the house, it would entitle him to £40 on top of the £100, giving him £140 a year.  But he has £185, so that he is making £145 more out of this transaction than the Minister has stipulated in the Bill.  I suggest to the Minister that this is being done on quite a large scale and is putting up the price of flats and houses, as if a flat becomes too dear you will take a house instead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is happening in Dublin is that a large number of people have been coming into this State during the last couple of years from Great Britain and Northern Ireland and are prepared to pay any price for flats and houses.  I know of five or six families where, the husband being away in the British Forces, the wife and children have come here, apparently with large incomes under their control and prepared to pay any price&mdash;and are paying any price&mdash;for flats and houses. They are being let at double the rents <Col N="167" /> they were fetching three or four years ago.  A few weeks ago, the newspapers directed attention to the fact that an American citizen advertised for a house in Limerick and offered £350 a year rent.  The newspapers' comment was that the normal rent of that house, according to the description given, would be £150; but the American family wanted a place in Limerick and were prepared to pay £350.  We know what is going to happen: people are going to leave a house of that kind and seek a house elsewhere, so as to rent their own house at the £350 to the American family.  I suggest that this is going to become a very serious social evil and that the Minister has an opportunity now to deal with the matter. If he misses this opportunity, it will not be so easy later on, as it will be tackled piecemeal.  The sensible thing to do is to handle the whole problem now and dispose of it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I entirely agree that, in so far as flats converted in Dublin are concerned, particularly those converted in recent years, there is unquestionably a racket.  However, the actual method of fixing the control is what I am interested in and I would impress on the Minister before he makes up his mind as to the best method to be adopted, that there are certain other considerations in addition to the mere cost of conversion.  In the first place, as apart from the monetary cost of conversion itself, there will unquestionably be a very much higher bill for repairs to four flats in a house than to the one house let to a single tenant. The amount to be paid every year for repairs will be considerably higher for four tenants than for one, even though they use the same total accommodation from the ground up. Secondly, there will be a much higher proportion of bad debts.  I have considerable sympathy with a lot of what Senator Duffy has said, but there is another side to the picture which he has not told.  It is true, as I can state from personal experience with clients of mine, that an enormous proportion of the income of Dublin house-owners has to be set aside to meet bad debts. That is particularly prevalent in the <Col N="168" /> case of flats.  It is quite common property that people go into a flat and get out again after three months, having paid perhaps the first week's rent only.  They were in Marlborough Road this week and they are gone to Clyde Road next week.  They stay only three months and the house-owner has no remedy at all.  It is useless trying to follow the defaulting tenant.  The only thing to do is to put the tenant out, and that involves additional costs.  Therefore the proportion of bad debts in fixing the total rent for a house so converted must be taken into account.</P>
      <P>As Senator Kingsmill Moore very correctly said, there is also a very much higher cost of collection with flats than there is in respect of houses. Finally, there is the additional cost of insurance.  These are matters which must be mentioned on the other side of the scale.  Quite frankly, I am glad that the Minister intends to bring these under control in some shape or form.  When he is doing so, I would ask him to bear that aspect of the situation clearly in his mind and also to remember the point which Senator Kingsmill Moore referred to so vehemently, namely, that it is essential that some of those larger houses should be converted, and that every inducement should be given to convert them into decent, proper self-contained flats, rather than that they should develop into the type of slum we have in the large houses on the north side of Dublin.</P>

      <P>It is very satisfactory to hear the Minister give an undertaking to reconsider this matter of the abuses of the conversion of houses into flats, before the Report Stage; but I do hope he will resist any approach on the lines indicated by Senator Duffy.  Senator Duffy would like to take a purely accounting view of it, taking the cost and thereupon fixing a sum which, as a commercial transaction, might give a reasonable return on outlay.  That would mean approaching the matter without any regard to enterprise.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir John Keane Sir John Keane">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>I still hold that, once the matter came before the court, a whole mass of evidence as to the costs and outlay would form the basis of the rent.  I hope the Minister will resist any approach on those lines. I feel that the correct approach is that, as long as there is no abuse and as long as the rent is reasonable and not extortionate&mdash;that should be the test &mdash;the fact that there is a fair profit on the outlay in a given case should not be brought into account.  Otherwise there will be almost a mathematical approach to the problem, which is not the right approach.  There is considerable expense involved, as Senator Sweetman indicated, and there is considerable risk.  As time goes on the property will not maintain its value and it is only fair that a person who takes risks should get a profit proportionate to the risks taken.  I feel there is great danger in this question of bringing all urban rents under the purview of the courts, in a method analogous to that we know of for years past in regard to the Land Commission.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHearne" hpid="Mr. Hearne Mr. Hearne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hearne</NameTxt>
      <P>Then I am in entire agreement, because of the fact&mdash; and this is something of which I have first-hand knowledge&mdash;that the materials used in the construction of flats are not so scarce as the materials necessary to build houses.  In other words, a person who had a sufficient amount of money could, in the last two years, fairly easily obtain the materials necessary to construct flats and let these flats, as has been suggested, at very high rents subsequent to 8th February, 1944, whereas if these people wanted to build houses to accommodate the same number of people they could not possibly do so, because the materials were scarce.  I think that at the present time and for some time to come there will be a restriction.  I cannot build a house without a licence from the Department of Industry and Commerce.  I can construct flats because the amount in question, £500, enables me to do very little in the way of building a house but it does a good deal in enabling me to reconstruct a house into flats.</P>
      <P>There is a case for dissimilar treatment of flats and houses.  I think, too, there will be great difficulty in assessing a return to a person who is willing to convert a house into flats on the money outlay alone.  I think it will be extremely difficult for us here, or for any Minister or Department, to set out rules that will be just to an incoming tenant and to the landlord who is taking very great risks.  I am informed, on reliable authority, that the dodging of rents by people is a very big impost on the landlords.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think, taking everything into consideration, the best method might be to leave it to the courts to decide what would be a fair rent.  Taking all the circumstances into account, and <Col N="171" /> making due allowance for the enterprise of a person willing to convert a house into flats, I think the best thing would be to leave it to the court to decide what would be a fair rent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kingsmill Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one difficulty and, as we are talking on this matter with a view to being of assistance to the Minister, I will mention it. The original proposition I had of taking the standard of existing flats, automatically takes into consideration all the elements which apply to flats in general&mdash;the difficulty of collection, the failure of tenants to pay, and other matters of that sort.  You are taking as a basis an economic flat rent fixed by the market conditions in 1940.  That rent must have taken into consideration all the economic elements.  That is why I suggested starting with that as a basis.</P>
      <P>The difficulty about giving it to the courts without any indication as to what may be a basis is that the courts will be liable to vary very widely. Neither landlord nor tenant will have the faintest idea of what the court will do.  You may get a lot of disappointments unless you give some pointers which will enable both sides to go to expert valuers and say: &ldquo;Within what limits will the court be likely to fix this rent?&rdquo; That is why I think it would be a mistake, unless you give some initial basis to the court to work from, just as you did under the 1914 Act.  It would not be fair to the court; the court is not an expert valuer and is not a house agent.</P>
      <P>As, in 1916, the court could find what might have been expected for a house in 1914, so, too, it should be in a position to find what could be expected for a flat in 1940.  That will act as a basis.  The Minister may add on any other elements which he thinks right, but that starts off with a basis which has been fixed by the inter-play of supply and demand and, although you may modify it, it is probably the best figure you can take as your &ldquo;X&rdquo; to start with.</P>

It will have to be tackled if we are to change the question of control and, frankly, I do not envy the Minister and his Department when they are tackling it.  The question will inevitably mean that, if the scheme is to work at all, we must have in this Act a definition to ensure that the flat will be a really self-contained one and not merely a bogus thing.</P>

      <P>In sub-section (2) to delete paragraph (d), lines 21 to 24, inclusive.</P>
      <P>I realise at the outset that I am confronted with great difficulties in relation to this amendment.  The section commences by saying that &ldquo;Subject to subsection (2) of this section this Act applies to every premises.&rdquo; Now, sub-section (2) contains a number of exceptions. These exceptions represent the type of houses and premises to which the Act will not apply.  One of these, as set out in subsection (2), is described as a dwelling provided by a local authority under the Labourers Acts or under the Housing of the Working Classes Acts and of which a local authority is for the time being the landlord.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as I can understand the argument, it amounts to this, that the local authority lets a house to a <Col N="173" /> tenant at a rent which is less than the economic rent.  That may be true, and it is, in fact, true in a number of cases; but it is not necessarily true in all cases.  However, I am making no case in relation to control of rents so far as local authority houses are concerned, but there are other provisions in the Act than those relating to rent control. There is a provision here with regard to security.  A person cannot be ejected from a house controlled by this measure, unless under conditions specified.  Then there is a provision in the Bill which relates to right of succession. These are important considerations. They are as important to the occupier of a council house as to the occupier of a house which is privately owned.  It may be argued that the council will act fairly, and that there is no risk that tenants of council houses will be harshly dealt with.  I want to refute that statement.</P>
    <P>There are cases well known to members of this House in which persons occupying council houses have been harshly treated, cases in which they have been dispossessed of their houses because of a change in political affiliations.  There was a case brought to my notice in the City of Dublin in which a person of taste, and I suppose with some time to spare, repainted his front door.  It was a corporation house and the door was painted black.  The tenant thought it an undesirable kind of colour and that he could improve on it.  He painted the door a mahogany colour and grained it.  That person was served with a notice to quit because he improved the appearance of the house.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>If this happens to a tenant in Dublin, I am just wondering what might happen in places we shall leave unnamed.  I suggest that that is not an isolated case.  I am informed that there have been four cases in Cabra within the last few weeks in which tenants, because they did something which they believed was improving their houses, were served with notice to quit.  They at least believed that they were improving their houses. One case came to my notice of a tenant who decided to improve the amenities of his house by widening a gate in order to bring in turf.  He was served with notice to quit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir John Keane Sir John Keane">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite rightly.  You cannot allow that sort of thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Sir John Keane says that you cannot allow that sort of thing.  All I am asking is that these houses be brought under the control given by this Bill so that, at any rate, the courts will have an opportunity of inquiring into the matter and of seeing that no injustice is done.  I do not want to argue whether or not a tenant should be allowed to repaint his door but I do say if he does that, and if he thinks it improves his house, he should be afforded the protection that this Bill gives, the protection of going into court and of showing that he has done a good job rather than a disreputable job, and that he should not be dispossessed on that account.  For that reason I am submitting this amendment <Col N="175" /> and I hope the Minister will seriously consider it.</P>
      <P>We all recognise that there is probably a substantial distinction between the attitude of a public authority towards its tenants and that of a private householder, but we have reached the stage now where the public authority is in the last analysis one person.  It is no longer a public board that decides whether a tenant is desirable or undesirable; it is a manager, a city manager or a county manager, and I submit, with all respect, that if we are going to extend protection to the tenants of privately-owned houses, then we ought to give the same protection to tenants who are subject to the idiosyncracies of an individual manager.  We must bear in mind that there are areas in this country in which a very large proportion of the houses to which this Bill would normally apply are owned by the local authority. Take counties like County Dublin or County Kildare.  One house in every four in County Kildare is owned by the local authority.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>

      <P>That is merely a family row.  When it is a question of dealing with the letting of houses or of evicting <Col N="176" /> people, the manager does not consult the county council and the county council knows that very well.  I submit that I have made a reasonable suggestion in this amendment and that it is one which the Minister cannot lightly brush aside.  I would urge him very strongly, if he has any hesitation in the matter, to reflect closely on what is likely to happen, having regard to the large number of houses involved, before he decides to reject the amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir John Keane Sir John Keane">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>I would ask the Minister not to accept this amendment. Any urban housing scheme, which is a really decent job, must be based on æsthetic uniformity.  It is unthinkable that every tenant, without the leave of the Manager or the local authority, should be allowed to introduce any colour scheme he likes.  That would simply lead to chaos.  We must have æsthetic decency.  Not only does Senator Duffy indicate that these tenants should be allowed to paint any colours they like on their doors, but he also desires that they should be permitted to widen their gates and to treat the property as if it were their own private property.  I do not suppose that the city manager would object to something small being done after permission had been obtained but here it is a matter of the wanton treatment of public property.  I hope that the Minister will insist on the observance of discipline in matters of this kind.</P>

Not alone that, but while there is an objection sometimes to accepting people with families as tenants in private houses, people who have families get a preference as tenants for these houses. There is no case in the wide world that I can see for bringing them under control&mdash;none whatever.</P>

I made it perfectly clear that there was no suggestion that the tenants of those houses should go into court to get a reduction in their rents.  I did say that there are other things involved. I made it clear that there was a question of security involved, and I made it clear that there was the question of the succession of a man's wife and children involved.  Those things are not protected or provided for now.  A very large number of houses and a very large number of families are involved.  There is no use in the Minister getting away on the idea that we are dealing with subsidised houses.  That is not the issue. The issue is whether the occupier of a council house is entitled to the same security as against the council&mdash;or more likely the manager&mdash;as an occupier has against a private landlord.  Again, there is another issue, whether the wife and the family of the occupier of a council house will be entitled to the same rights at law as if she were the wife or they the family of the occupier of a privately-owned house.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;must be a notice of not less than three months.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This is rather a technical and a difficult matter, and the House does not want to have law expounded or preached to it at this time of night.

If on the other hand, there is a desire for discussion, I will have to give the reasons for it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment was brought in in the Dáil as a result of representations that were made.  Both in the Dáil and afterwards I got a concrete case of where a house was supposed <Col N="179" /> to be let for 12 months, but where the tenant was subject to a notice of one week.  In view of that, I brought in the amendment.  I was quite satisfied that that would prevent bogus letting.  That is really what it amounted to.  I thought that covered the thing all right, and I do not know whether the difference between what is in the Bill now and Senator Kingsmill Moore's amendment is worth while.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TheodoreMoore" hpid="Mr. Kingsmill Moore Mr. Kingsmill Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kingsmill Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a terrific difference, because what is in the Bill now means 18 months' notice. Perhaps I had better explain this at length.  When the 1923 Act was being passed, certain classes of business premises were exempted from its operation because they had protection under other Acts or other provisions elsewhere. Premises which were in a fair or market were usually protected by the private Acts dealing with the fair or market, and yearly tenancies were protected by the Town Tenants Act, so those two classes of premises, if they were business premises, were taken out of the ambit of the 1923 Act.  When this Act was originally drafted by the Minister, those same two provisions found their place&mdash;I speak from memory but I think I am correct&mdash; premises in a fair or market were taken out, and yearly premises were taken out.  It was pointed out when the Bill was passing through the Dáil, that there was at least one agreement in existence under which a yearly tenancy was created which could be terminated on a week's notice.  Those were the terms in an actual agreement which was presented to the Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Such an agreement I have never seen, and I doubt if Senator Ryan has ever seen a yearly tenancy terminable on a week's notice.  In any case, one such agreement was presented to the Dáil, and the case was made: &ldquo;It would be grossly unfair to turn out, on a week's notice, a man who has a yearly tenancy.  Therefore put in what is the usual statutory provision for a notice to quit on a yearly tenancy.&rdquo; On those grounds it was agreed.  But the Dáil, and I think the Minister, overlooked something.  If you have a yearly tenancy created by over-holding <Col N="180" /> or by a verbal agreement, with no expressed provision as to how it is to be determined, the old law of land which is also to be found in the notice to quit Act says that in the absence of any other agreement a yearly tenancy is to be determined by six months' notice expiring on a gale day which is the anniversary of the day on which the yearly tenancy commenced. Now supposing the yearly tenancy commenced on 1st July, if you make up your mind to determine it sometime in the previous December, and give six months' notice to terminate on 1st July, you can determine it by that six months' notice.  But supposing you wait until January before deciding that you want to determine it, you could not then determine it until 1st July of the year following that, that is to say, roughly speaking, 18 months. The Dáil said: &ldquo;It is ridiculous to have it terminated, as in this agreement which has been flung in our faces, with only a week's notice.  Put in the ordinary notice for determining a yearly tenancy.&rdquo; Now here is the difference.  The ordinary notice for a yearly tenancy is not six months' notice expiring with the current year. That is only what the law implies, where nothing is said by the parties. I think that my friend, Senator Ryan, will confirm me when I say that in connection with all yearly tenancies which are of sufficient importance to be reduced to writing&mdash;and that applies, I think, to nearly all of them which are business tenancies&mdash;the common provisions are either that three months' notice be given at any time by either side, or sometimes that six months' notice be given at any time by either side, or sometimes three months' or six months' notice to expire on May gale day.  You will find all these, but, outside of an absolutely freak agreement, you will not find what was provided in the agreement produced in the Dáil.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, I have accepted the criticism which was made in the Dáil, that the original drafting of the Minister would take out of the Bill a yearly tenancy capable of being determined at a week's notice, and have substituted words, the effect of which is a yearly tenancy which is subject to <Col N="181" /> being determined by not less than three months' notice.  The three months' notice is usual in such cases, and it seems to me to be a reasonable amendment.  The amendment that was put in by the Dáil would be completely unworkable because it does not conform to any business tenancies, but merely to the little tenancies which are made verbally, and the effect of that amendment would be to completely wreck the Act.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to meet the Senator.  I was not thinking of 18 months; I had six months in mind; but supposing we make it three months' notice or to be determined at any time after.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TheodoreMoore" hpid="Mr. Kingsmill Moore Mr. Kingsmill Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kingsmill Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>What you are dealing with here is an exclusion altogether from the Act.  If you exclude a yearly tenancy in a business from the Act, but have a provision that no yearly tenancy in a business premises shall be determined within less than six months, that would be quite reasonable, but the difference here is that you may have two houses side by side, let as business premises. One of them is let on a yearly tenancy determinable by six months' notice by either side, and the other determinable by a three months' notice by either side.  Now one of these premises is outside the Act for all purposes, and the other is inside it.  This was drafted to take yearly business premises tenancies out of the Act.  Once you define the type of business premises by any length of time, the funny thing is that you are taking the same types of businesses out of the Act and putting others in, and it would be a much more satisfactory way of dealing with it if you took yearly tenancies out of the Act, as you had done originally, but made a provision that no yearly tenancy should be terminated in a business premises by less then six months. That would meet the whole question.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hearne</NameTxt>
      <P>As a layman, perhaps I might be permitted to say that I think that a yearly tenancy should be terminated by six months' notice, the six months' notice to expire at any time.  If three months were inserted, <Col N="182" /> as Senator Kingsmill Moore seems to suggest, in view of the difficulty at the moment in getting premises at all, three months would be an extremely short time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kingsmill Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with my friend, Senator Hearne, but again we are at cross purposes.  I would agree that a provision should be made in the Act that a tenancy in business premises should not be terminable within six months, but if you put it in this section, which is an exclusion section, you are allowing some premises in, and leaving others out.  I suggest leaving it as it was originally, take business premises out of the Act, and put in a section that no business premises within the valuation limits of the Act shall be capable of having the contractual tenancy determined within less than six months.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to know why there was a variation in the exclusion of premises held under a tenancy from year to year and the exclusion provisions under the 1923 Act and the Emergency Powers (No. 313) Order, 1944.  In Section 17 of the 1923 Act it is provided that the Act should not apply to any business premises held under a tenancy from year to year, or for a term of years. The Emergency Powers (No. 313) Order, contains the same provision. In Article 3, sub-article (1), paragraph <Col N="183" /> (d) it is provided that business premises let from year to year or for a term of years should be excluded from the operation.  Now in this Bill it is provided that the Act, if it is passed, shall not apply to business premises let for a number of years. That is quite clear, and follows the Act of 1923 and the Emergency Powers (No. 313) Order, but then the Bill goes on to exclude certain types of tenancy from year to year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TheodoreMoore" hpid="Mr. Kingsmill Moore Mr. Kingsmill Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kingsmill Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>In the Dáil it was held that it should follow the 1923 Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, though I do not think that this provision is as clear as the 1923 Act.  It is provided here that the Act shall not apply to business premises let from year to year under a tenancy, notice to determine which must expire at the end of some year of the tenancy and be a notice of not less than six months.  As Senator Kingsmill Moore explained, there is a special type of tenancy from year to year, created by verbal agreement, to which the ordinary law applies.  Therefore it is quite possible that business premises let from year to year may be brought within the provisions of the Act if this provision can be circumscribed. Now, under the Landlord and Tenant Act of 1931 and the Emergency Powers (No. 313) Order, 1944, business premises which were excluded were protected in the sense that a new tenancy could be obtained for these business premises when the term expired, but here, if this goes through in its present form, there will be a certain amount of overlapping between this Bill, when it is enacted, and the Landlord and Tenant Act of 1931.  You may then have both Acts applying to the one premises.  So I do not know what case was made in the Dáil for changing the original plan, so to <Col N="184" /> speak, for exclusion, which was in this Bill when it was introduced.  If the Minister reconsiders this matter at all, I think he should reconsider it on the basis of reintroducing the original phraseology which, up to the present, in my opinion, has worked satisfactorily, because if the premises did not fall within the Rent Restrictions Act it fell within the Landlord and Tenant Act.  Here I think it may cause a certain amount of confusion, and I do not think the amendment which Senator Kingsmill Moore has introduced will obviate that confusion.  I put the suggestion before the Minister for his consideration before the Report Stage.</P>
