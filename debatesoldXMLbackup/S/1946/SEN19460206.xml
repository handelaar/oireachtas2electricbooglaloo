    <P>Debate resumed on the following amendment (No. 66) to Section 40:&mdash;</P>
    <P>66.  In sub-section (4), paragraph (b), page 22, line 43, to delete the words &ldquo;which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld&rdquo;.&mdash;(Senator Patrick J. O'Reilly.)</P>

      <P>On the last occasion I was asking the Minister if he could tell me what the purpose of having these words in the section was.  The Minister was frank enough to admit, I think, that they were not in the original draft.  The situation, as I see it, is that a statutory tenant cannot sell his interest under the Bill.  If he cannot sell his interest, I cannot see what there is in it for him to assign. His family is protected, so that question does not enter into the situation. I should be glad if the Minister would explain the purpose of having these words included in the section.</P>

      <P>I am not sure whether we discussed this particular amendment so exhaustively in the Dáil as we have here, but what I understood was that there were other considerations besides cash that might enter into an assignment.  There might be a member of the family who was not actually living in.  The statutory tenant might be a person who might want to assign the tenancy either to a son or to some other member of his family who would not be exactly residing with him at the time.  Anyway, I was given to understand&mdash;perhaps I am wrong; the lawyers may know more about the <Col N="370" /> significance of these words: &ldquo;which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld&rdquo;&mdash;that the court would have due regard to the rights of both the landlord and the tenant.  I cannot see how the suggestion made by Senator Sweetman would apply, that it would be only considerations of cash that would nullify the other provisions.  In regard to that point about cash, I have had representations made by Senator O'Dea and he suggests that we should distinguish between the two types of premises&mdash;say, a mixed premises, a residential and a business premises combined and an ordinary premises, so that a person in a business premises might be allowed to sell his interests.  As the Bill stands, a person could not get anything at all for the goodwill of his shop.  If that is the case, I think there is something for reconsideration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought such persons were covered by the Landlord and Tenant Act but that appears to need amendment too in order to protect their rights.  The difficulty has been put to me that seeing that this matter has been ventilated and that there will be a time lag between any amendment of the 1931 Act and the passing of this measure, there may be a rush by certain people to take advantage of the position that perhaps did not occur to them before.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">

      <P>We had better wait.  I have got notice that the matter is going to be raised.  It has been suggested that the inclusion of these words almost means a direction to the court.  I am not quite satisfied that it does.  I would admit if they did amount to that, these words are taking away something from the landlord that should not be taken away.  On the other hand where a person has built up by his own industry a certain goodwill in a premises, I do <Col N="371" /> not think it proper that he should not have a right to get something for that goodwill if he wishes to dispose of it. That applies to the case of business premises.  I think some amendment, therefore, of the nature effected by the section is necessary.  Anyway, as I say, I am open to be further convinced on this matter, because an aspect of it has been raised here that was not raised in the other House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose the best thing is for all of us, on all sides, to consider it between now and the Report Stage.  In regard to what the Minister has mentioned about Senator O'Dea's point of view, which he has expressed on several occassions during the passage of this Bill, both inside and outside the House Senator O'Dea and I have tried to reconcile our points of view, and I am afraid a situation has been arrived at where he thinks I am crazy and I think he is crazy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Foran</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>It might quite easily be that Senator Foran is correct. Before the Minister brings in an amendment on the lines suggested by Senator O'Dea I think he should consider the matter very carefully.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>There is another difficulty, which perhaps is the real difficulty between Senator O'Dea and myself.  I am looking at it from the Dublin point of view and he is looking at it from the Galway point of view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LouisODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>And the tenure of such premises in Galway and Dublin is as different as chalk from cheese. Senator O'Dea, I think, if we want to be personal, could say that he dealt in dozens of sales that this section would cover.  I have taken the trouble to find out, not only in my position, but also in the position of some other solicitors in Dublin, and in the whole <Col N="372" /> lot of the inquiries I made I could only come across one case.  That is the real basis of the whole difference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LouisODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>There ought to be no difference between members of the House on this question; it is so very obvious.  We must approach this matter not from the point of view of argument.  I was surprised to hear Senator Sweetman say to the Minister that he had admitted that this is not a case for amendment of this Bill. The idea of tying down a Minister to any statement he made at any time is an absurdity in the case of a Bill which concerns the whole of the country, as this Bill does.  This Section 40 contains certain provisions which would ruin nine-tenths of the people of the towns of Ireland.  I am not speaking of Galway alone.  I am taking Galway as an example.  I am speaking of every town in Ireland. Even in Dublin there are people who reside on their business premises, not of course, to such a percentage as in the smaller towns, but there are big numbers of people who will come under this Act, who reside in the City of Dublin, and whose premises are very valuable.  Of course, it applies more in places like Galway, Tuam, Loughrea, Ballinasloe, and every town in Ireland, because in those towns most of the business people reside on their business premises.  It is only in an exceptional case that a man can afford to have a residence outside.  If a man is unfortunate enough not to have a residence outside, and resides on his business premises, this Act comes along and says to him: &ldquo;I do not care what your premises are worth; you are not to get a penny for them. I know you built up your business for the last 60 years, but we will make that business not worth one penny.&rdquo;  That is what this Bill is doing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I say that it is not so much this Bill as the 1923 Act? Surely this is an old provision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>It is in the Principal Act.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LouisODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="LouisODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>Unfortunately, this Bill contains a copy of that obnoxious provision. Of course, for a long time it was not noticed that the provision was in the 1923 Act.  That is the curious thing about it.  There were sales upon sales, and this provision was entirely ignored, but in recent years people began to wake up to its existence, and to point out when a man would sell his premises: &ldquo;You cannot sell; you are a statutory tenant.  You have no right to get a penny for it.  If you do get a penny for it you can be brought before the court, fined £100, and ordered to pay back the money you have received&rdquo;.  That same provision is put in here.  It is a provision which, as I said, will render not worth one penny those houses in which big businesses have been built up during 50 or 60 years.  In fact, it makes it a crime to take a penny for these premises.  It further provides that, if the owner is a bachelor or a widower without children, on his death the landlord can grab the whole concern.  He cannot dispose of it by will or by deed.  He can only die and let the landlord take the premises. That is the position and the very serious position which has to be faced up to.  I am very glad the Minister has come to take my view&mdash;that it is a serious matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LouisODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the position.  It has been held by the court, where notice to quit or notice to increase the rent or notice to reduce the rent has been served, that the tenant, holding on by virtue of that Act, under the altered rent, became a statutory tenant. I tried to get over it in the first instance by suggesting that we could fine down the meaning of statutory tenant to something else&mdash;to where the landlord brought an action against a tenant and the court made an order determining all the interest of the tenant, and saying: &ldquo;We cannot put out the tenant <Col N="374" /> because the Act allows him to remain in&rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LouisODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>For one reason or another like that.  If it were confined to those cases it would not have a very bad effect, because there were very few ejectments taken all over Ireland. There have been various discussions here on the question of whether a landlord is a good landlord or a bad landlord. You can say that all the town landlords of Ireland are good landlords. The last thing in the world they want is to evict a tenant.  In the year 1905 a curiosity occurred in the nature of an ejectment by Lord Clanricarde against Mr. Martin Ward of Loughrea. Mr. Ward was evicted because he became Secretary of the United Ireland League.  Lord Clanricarde brought an ejectment against him, got a decree and put him out, but there was such a <i>furore</i> that the Town Tenants Act of 1906 was passed, which allowed for certain compensation.  That was the first of those Acts that was passed.  Lord Clanricarde himself was rather a good landlord.  One of his tenants said that if you owed 11½ years' rent he would take a half-year's rent.  It was only when he was fought that he became a tyrant.  He did, in this case; he brought this ejectment, and the Act of 1906 was passed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1915 there were no evictions; no ejectments were taken when the 1915 Act was passed.  It was passed because it was passed in England, and made to apply to both countries.  In 1917, there were no evictions worth talking about. In 1920 there were no evictions when the Act was passed, or up to 1923. Those Acts did possibly hold certain tenants in their possession, but although the landlord did not evict he did take advantage of the Acts.  Landlords, in my opinion, are people who have to put up with a good deal.  All the rates were increased.  In 1914 our rates in Galway were 9/11; to-day they are 30/-.  In every other town the rates went up in the same way.  Those Acts enabled the landlord who paid the rates to add to the rent the difference between the 1914 rates and the rates in <Col N="375" /> existence at the time he served his notice.  They also allowed other increases.  The landlords naturally took advantage of that.  They served notices upon all their tenants, and they increased their rents.  They did not do that for the purpose of putting out the tenants.  They had no notion in the world of putting out the tenants.</P>
    <P>They merely did it for the purpose of getting the increases to which they were entitled under the Act.  To say, therefore, that those Acts protected all the tenants of Ireland is a fallacy.  They may have protected two out of every thousand tenants, but that is all they did, and apart from the fact that a certain fixity of tenure was given to the tenant, the Act of 1923 deprived him of very valuable rights.</P>
    <P>Now, we have amendments here. Senator Kingsmill Moore has an amendment which would make the position worse than it was.  The effect of his amendment, if accepted, would mean that a statutory tenant, occupying one half of the house, could not sub-let the other half to a tenant that would require the accommodation very badly; that no matter what the requirements are, he cannot sub-let.  Then we have this amendment of Senator P. J. O'Reilly.  The effect of the sub-section is that the tenant will not assign the premises or any part thereof without the consent in writing of the landlord, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, and the Senator wants the words&mdash;&ldquo;which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld&rdquo; deleted. But what was the law before the Act concerned was passed?  The law was that a tenant, in connection with any letting, could assign portion of his holding unless there was an express provision in writing preventing him from doing so.  That applied to every letting agreement, except for a period of about seven years, from the passing of the 1923 Act to the Landlord and Tenant Act of 1931.  During that period, it was implied as a condition to every letting that the tenant could not sub-let, but apart from that it was always the practice that the tenant could sub-let unless there was specific agreement in writing that he was not permitted <Col N="376" /> to do so.  That is a matter of common law, and we are now depriving the tenant of rights to which he was entitled.</P>
    <P>Now, if I had my way, I would exclude, not alone business houses, but also dwelling-houses, because there have been many cases of dwelling-houses in which people have resided for 50 or 60 years, during the course of which they spent hundreds and even thousands of pounds in the improvement of these houses.  Now, however, if these people are made statutory tenants under this Bill, the tenancy dies with the man concerned, unless he has a wife or a child residing with him at the time, and the property reverts back to the landlord-property which, as a result of the expenditure by the tenant on improvements, may have become very valuable.  I know cases of business houses in towns, the value of which it would be very hard to estimate.  If put up for sale, they might go for many thousands of pounds and yet, according to this Bill, they would not be worth anything to the tenant if the Bill goes through in its present form.  Now, that will have to be changed.</P>
    <P>Senator Sweetman gave me an answer the other day.  He said that I had forgotten that all those cases came under the Landlord and Tenant Act of 1931.  It is he who has forgotten that they do not come under the Act of 1931 unless a notice to quit was served; in other words, unless the landlord now is foolish enough to give the tenant a new notice to quit, he need not do so.  Although the tenant is required to give notice that he is giving up possession, we find, under sub-section (2) of this section, that the landlord need serve no notice to quit on the tenant.  Now, I have pointed out that most of the notices to quit or demands for increased rent were made before the Landlord and Tenant Act of 1931 was passed.  Under that Act the tenant had to move within one month of getting the notice to quit, or not later than three months before the period of the lease expired, and if the tenant does not know the law, and does not move accordingly, then his rights are lost; but this will deprive <Col N="377" /> the tenant of even the rights that he had under that Act.  It simply says here that, since your rent is being increased or reduced, as the case may be, you are therefore a statutory tenant, and being a statutory tenant, the landlord need not serve you with any notice to quit.  By keeping that notice to quit away from you, the landlord deprives you of the rights you had under the Act of 1931.  Senator Sweetman says that it is the Act of 1931 which should be amended.  No; it is not the Act of 1931 which does the injury; it is this Bill, and therefore it is this Bill which must be amended in order to prevent that harm being done.</P>
    <P>I think that that should be clear to everybody, because if there are tenants in Ireland who have not been made statutory tenants, even now, under the 1923 Act or this Bill, the statutory tenant can be so crippled that he cannot take advantage of any other Act.  If the tenant dies without having a wife or child residing with him, nothing can be done.  If there is a wife, the tenancy reverts to her, and if there is a child it reverts to the child, but it does not revert in the case of another child, but goes back to the landlord.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHearne" hpid="Mr. Hearne Mr. Hearne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hearne</NameTxt>
      <P>My experience, while not anything on the same scale as Senator O'Dea's, is similar to his.  I know that in my own town there are quite a number of shops and business premises on which the tenants reside. Some of them have resided there for over 40 years.  These tenants have built up a prosperous business there during the course of the 40 years.  That business is something to which the landlord has contributed nothing, either by benefit or good will, and the prosperity of the business is due entirely to the business acumen and ability of the tenant.  If Senator O'Dea's idea of the legal aspect of the letting is correct, he has certainly convinced me that the 1923 Act did something that was unjust to tenants of such business premises of long-standing. These tenants built up certain assets to which no one but themselves contributed anything, and it would seem that now they can be deprived of <Col N="378" /> any financial benefit or reward, and that is something for which nobody in this House would stand, in my opinion. These tenants built up and developed the premises; nobody else contributed to these improvements, and I think it should be impressed on the Minister that there should be a differentiation between that type of premises and others&mdash;that is, on premises on which the tenants reside.  I am not prepared to go quite as far as Senator O'Dea, and to say that private houses which have been occupied for a considerable number of years should be accorded the same rights as the other cases. There is certainly nothing like as strong a case in connection with private houses as there is in the case of business premises where the business has been built up over a number of years.</P>
      <P>I can give one example that comes very forcibly to my mind.  I know people in my own town who have been in the same business premises for over 40 years.  They have built up a fairly substantial business, but for one reason or another they have not purchased the premises.  Their rent is exactly the same as it was at the start.  Their business which was small, has developed pretty considerably, and now, in the end, they may feel like retiring.  It would be deplorable if the goodwill attached to those premises should not have a cash value attached to it, and they would be unable to get any financial reward at all for the goodwill they have built up over 40 years.</P>
      <P>It seems that the goodwill will go back to the landlord, and I consider that would be most unjust to them.  The Minister would be well advised to consider leaving with the tenant the right to get the financial reward which the public may assess as the value of the goodwill of premises such as these.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnOReilly" hpid="Mr. P.J. O'Reilly Mr. P.J. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid there are some misunderstandings regarding the effect of the 1931 Act, and the purpose of the present Act, and as a Senator responsible for this amendment, it strikes me that it would be well to give an opportunity to members of the House to consider further the <Col N="379" /> points raised by Senator O'Dea and Senator Sweetman.  There is an old saying that when doctors differ, something happens the patient.  Here, we have experts on each side giving opposite opinions, and making it difficult for an ordinary Senator to form a sound judgment.</P>
      <P>I am rather afraid to venture into the technicalities of the 1931 Act, because I thought the arguments which were used on the last occasion would be sufficient to convince everybody of the desirability of accepting this amendment. I know something about the 1931 Act, and I would refer all concerned to the definition of the word &ldquo;tenement&rdquo;.  If we look at Sections 19 and 20 we find that Section 20 says:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Subject to the provision of this Act a tenant of a tenement to which this Part of this Act applies shall, on the termination of his tenancy in such tenement, be entitled to a new tenancy in such tenement on such terms as may be agreed upon between such tenant and his landlord or as shall, in default of such agreement, be fixed by the court.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Then, Section 19 appears to be equally important.  It goes on to explain what may happen on the termination of a tenancy, and I understand that the cases mentioned by Senator O'Dea are covered by that section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LouisODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, would the Senator read out that portion dealing with the application to determine any new tenancy?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnOReilly" hpid="Mr. P.J. O'Reilly Mr. P.J. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>I have said that I would not like to enter into a debate about the provisions of the 1931 Act. Where would the layman come in between the eminent lawyers on both sides of the House who have given different views?  Nowhere, I would say.  I would like to cut out legal technicalities for the moment.  What is this Act?  Is it a Rent Restrictions Act, or a Sales Restriction Act?  I am beginning to wonder which it is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has pointed out again and again that it is a Rent Restrictions Act, and if we look at the definition of a statutory tenant, <Col N="380" /> we find that it means a person who retains possession of any premises by virtue of this Act.  Therefore, if people do not retain possession of any premises by virtue of this Act, they do not come into the picture, good, bad or indifferent.  With the permission of the House, I would like to read something which was read before.</P>
    <P>It is the view of a person who, I would venture to say, is the most experienced lawyer in the City of Dublin, a gentleman very well known personally to the Minister.  I will give his name later on if it is necessary.  He is a person with the widest possible experience of the management of property, and he is himself the owner of house property, although his principal wealth is not in that particular type of property.  I venture to say that he is probably the most experienced lawyer in the country.  His opinion is:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In the Landlord and Tenant Act you are dealing with cases where there are leases or long terms in question apart from the Act altogether, and consequently the tenant would naturally have some interest in assigning the premises when there is still a part of the original term to run, but in the case of the Rent Restriction Acts and this new Bill there is no period of time to run in connection with the existing letting, and nothing to assign except the artificial legal period made or granted by the Rent Acts themselves.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>So, unless a person comes within this Act, this amendment would not affect him at all.  I have considered this matter very carefully, and I have, as I said, been fortified by good legal advice.  I am convinced that if you want to keep up the pretence that a landlord has some interest in his premises, then this amendment should be accepted.  If we do not want this pretence to continue, then by all means defeat the amendment, and the landlord will have no further claim on the property.  Now, it might appear that I am interested in this matter purely from an owner's standpoint.</P>
    <P>I happen to own a certain number of houses, but none of the amendments I have suggested would affect these houses to any extent, and I can claim <Col N="381" /> to be speaking impersonally in this matter.  I put the larger issue before the Minister, the issue which everybody knows, that if these Acts continue in force there will be no more private buildings for letting, particularly if this objectionable addition to the Act is allowed to continue.  I say that it is going to affect the interests of a large number of people, the class of people able to pay only small rents, because there will be competition from other people, who normally should be residing in houses built by private enterprise, for the cheaper class of house, and in that way, I would say all are concerned.  If we are drifting, or perhaps I should say if we wish to drift, into the position in which no building will be done except by the State and the local authorities, then there is a lot to be said in favour of these Acts, but if we wish to support the idea of private enterprise, and if we consider it is a form of enterprise which should be encouraged and allowed to continue, we should look with great suspicion on the lines added to this Bill which have never before appeared in any Rent Restrictions Act, either in this country or elsewhere.</P>
    <P>I would appeal to the Minister to take this big issue into consideration, the question of the stoppage of private building, and that this will encourage people to get behind the amendments submitted by Senator Kingsmill Moore and accepted by the Minister at the previous meeting of the House.  It would be a direct encouragement to such people, it would facilitate them in getting around the amendments, and those amendments would have to come out of the Act or some others would have to be inserted to govern the position.</P>
    <P>As I have said, I feel great reluctance about entering very deeply into the discussion.  Had I known that Senator O'Dea was going to develop this argument, I would have given as much time as I could spare, since the last meeting of the House, to consider the points he has raised, but we have very eminent lawyers among us, and I am sure they will give us the benefit of their opinions.</P>
    <P>I suggest the advisability of giving further consideration to the matter, <Col N="382" /> and I would be prepared to assist towards that end by withdrawing those amendments until the Report Stage. For my own private information, however, I would like to have the benefit of the opinions of these eminent gentlemen between this and the next meeting of the Seanad.</P>

      <P>I had not the advantage of hearing Senator O'Dea's speech, and I think it would be very unsuitable at this stage to attempt to give a general lecture on landlord and tenant law, but I imagine it should be possible to look into the matter between now and the Report Stage.  Perhaps I should mention the following matter for the guidance of the House. I imagine that the type of case mentioned by Senator O'Dea, if there had been no 1923 Act, would have been that a notice to quit was served by the landlord in the case of a yearly tenancy.  If a business had been built up on a yearly tenancy, the tenant had the option of accepting the notice to quit and going out without saying anything, or of claiming the rights that were given him under the Town Tenants Act to get compensation for disturbance.  That was the position if there was no 1923 Act. What alteration did the 1923 Act make?  The answer is, precisely none. If a notice to quit was served under the 1923 Act, the tenant had still the option either of going out or saying: &ldquo;I am not going out without making a fuss.  I accept the notice to quit but I make my claim under the Town Tenants Act.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>In other words, the 1923 Act made no difference whatsoever in the way of cutting down the previous rights of the tenant.  Now we have to consider the effect of the 1931 Act.  A section in that Act&mdash;I think it is Section 3&mdash;says that where a person remains on as a statutory tenant the statutory tenancy shall be deemed to be a continuance of the previous contractual tenancy for the purposes of the 1931 Landlord and Tenant Act.  That means that a statutory tenant remains on after a notice to quit and has all the rights of compensation for improvements which were given him under the Act.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 68:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 23, line 39, after the word &ldquo;let&rdquo; to insert the words &ldquo;<i>bona fide</i>&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a section which deals with the particular kind of letting&mdash;one which has given me some trouble.  The section provides that Sections 37 and 38 shall not apply to premises let to a person during his continuance in any office, appointment or employment, or let for the temporary convenience or to <Col N="385" /> meet a temporary necessity of the landlord or the tenant.  It has been brought to my notice that a number of lettings have been made in this manner by people who know exactly what the Rent Restrictions Acts provide and are resolved to circumvent them.  In the West, especially, a number of cases have arisen in which the landlord has induced the tenant, anxious to get a house of any kind, to acknowledge, in some way, that the letting is temporary and for the convenience of the tenant or the landlord.  That takes the letting out of the Act completely.  What we have been doing here will be of no avail so far as that class of tenancy is concerned. The matter was raised in the Dáil, and it seems to me that the Minister was quite willing to meet the case if he were satisfied that there was any side-stepping of the Act.</P>
    <P>During the debate in the Dáil, Deputy Moran, who is familiar with the part of the country in which these cases most frequently occur, said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;If you get an agreement under which a tenant admits and declares that the letting is for the temporary convenience of the landlord and himself, such agreements have been upheld and it is a way of getting outside the provisions of the Act.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>A question was raised as to the Deputy's interpretation of the provision by Deputy McGilligan who said: &ldquo;Do you mean that somebody pretends that there is a temporary convenience letting and gets away with it?&rdquo; Deputy Moran replied:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Yes.  I have had experience of special provisions like that under the legislation that exists.  In practically every letting agreement, where you intended to give the landlord a chance of recovering his premises when he wanted them, you put in a provision that the letting was for the temporary convenience of the landlord.  There were cases in which such agreements were upheld in which the tenants admitted and declared that the letting was for the temporary convenience of the landlord, although, in fact, no such reasons existed at the time of the letting.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="386" /> The Minister referred to that matter later in the debate and said: &ldquo;I find that the question has been decided.  In 1925, a case was brought and the Chief Justice held that, whether a letting is for temporary convenience or not, is a question of fact, to be determined by the court.&rdquo; Since the debate in the Dáil, I have been discussing the matter with two practising barristers. They confirmed the statement that those agreements were quite common. A case in County Sligo and another in County Mayo, in which barristers were engaged, were cited to me, showing that, in these cases, agreements were signed that the lettings were for the temporary convenience of the landlord and tenant whereas the tenants advised their legal representatives that they signed under duress.  To get a tenancy, they were prepared to sign this agreement that the letting was for temporary convenience.  I have endeavoured to meet the point in my amendment but I do not know whether I have succeeded or not.  However, the insertion of the words I propose cannot weaken the provisions of the Bill. I think that the insertion of those words would have the effect of ensuring that a bogus agreement would not be palmed off to prove that lettings were for temporary convenience.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LouisODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's statement, made in the Dáil, is correct. This is a question of fact.  I do not know where Deputy Moran got his information, because he practises before the same Circuit judge as I do.  That judge held, soon after the Act of 1923 was passed, that the fact of putting in a declaration that a letting is for temporary convenience does not conclude the matter, that it must be proved to the satisfaction of the court that it was made for temporary convenience.  That decision was upheld on appeal, and I think that it has always been the law. The words proposed would not, I think, do any harm, but I think that the 1923 Act provides greater protection than is afforded by this amendment.</P>

      <P>I agree with what Senator O'Dea said, but I do not think that it would do any harm to <Col N="387" /> insert the words proposed.  Senator Duffy has not envisaged the case in which there is only an oral agreement. In that case, the decision depends on the evidence as to what was said at the time.  It occurred to me that Senator Duffy might desire to provide that agreements for temporary convenience lettings should be in writing. In the case of small tenants, that might be somewhat onerous.</P>

      <P>There is only one point that appears to me to arise in connection with the section&mdash;indirectly I must confess.  Senator Duffy mentioned a case the other day where tenants on one particular estate had to go to the solicitor for the landlord to have an agreement made.  One of the reasons for the necessity of an agreement for letting is that there are certain terms which are optional and which are operative unless provided for in a written agreement.  The Minister might consider the question at some future stage&mdash;it is obviously improper on this Bill&mdash;of providing some definition in regard to the matter which would obviate a lot of the necessary costs and agreement.  I did not realise that it was improper to raise it on this Bill until I had started to call attention to it.</P>

      <P>In sub-section (1), page 25, line 7, to delete the word &ldquo;controlled&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is a case in which we are dealing with the restriction on the payment of money in the form of what is called &ldquo;key money&rdquo;, deposits, premiums, etc., in relation to the renting of houses.  Sub-section (1) of the section provides that a person shall not, as a condition of the grant, renewal or continuance of a tenancy or sub-tenancy of any controlled premises require the payment of any fine, premium or other like sum.  This prohibition applies to houses which are controlled for the purposes of this Act, that is to say, houses which were erected before 7th May, 1941, and to houses within certain limits of valuation.  I am endeavouring to secure the deletion of the word &ldquo;controlled&rdquo; so that the prohibition contained in Section 51 will make it illegal to demand a fine or premium in respect of any letting.  I am quite prepared, if the Minister accepts the principle that the prohibition should apply to houses within the range and the scope covered by this Bill, to have the sub-section redrafted for the Report Stage so as to exclude houses over £60 valuation if there is a desire to exclude them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am satisfied to bring into the section <Col N="391" /> houses, which, if they were erected before 7th May, 1941, would be controlled houses.  In other words, if houses are being built in future I want the section to apply to them, if they are within the £60 limit, to ensure that this practice of demanding fines and premiums will be discontinued.  To an extent this amendment is related to a subsequent amendment and probably some of the things which I should like to say in connection with it might be more properly discussed on the later amendment.</P>

I think that would be the effect of it.  I do not know if the Senator means that.  What we are concerned with is to try to prevent the payment of this key money&mdash; to prevent people from increasing the rent of a controlled house by getting a deposit.  We want to stop that.  But surely to goodness, in the case of a person who thinks it is a better arrangement for himself&mdash;he may have a sum of money in hand and say: &ldquo;I will pay this in consideration of a smaller annual sum for years to come&rdquo;&mdash;he should be allowed to do that when the house is not controlled.</P>

      <P>The Minister wants to control houses to a certain date.  He recognises that that has certain drawbacks as well as certain advantages. After that date, the bargain as to what is to be paid is free.  As long as it is free, he does not mind whether you pay a high rent&mdash;remember that the rent is to be negotiated anyway&mdash;or whether you pay a low rent and a lump sum. Senator Duffy wants to extend the control beyond 1941; when he cannot get complete control he would like to get partial control.  Therefore, from his point of view, I think what he is trying to do is not unreasonable.  But I think it is unworkable, because, when the rent has been negotiated and not controlled by the State, simply to control it to the extent that you cannot arrange it in one particular way would to my mind be absurd.  For that reason I agree with the Minister.</P>

      <P>There may be arguments against my proposal but I have not heard them.  The argument has been used that we finished control on 7th May, 1941.  I am not reopening that question.  I am suggesting that if the practice of permitting the landlord to demand key-money, to demand deposits, is a bad one socially, then I think my amendment has a social aspect.  The section means that so far as houses built after 7th May, 1941, are concerned, nobody can get them unless he has a certain sum of money in his pocket to hand up.  The person who needs a house most, but who has no ready money, cannot get a house at all. That is what the Bill is doing.  That is what I am trying to remedy.  If the Minister or Senators who are better authorities than I am on the technicalities of the Bill say that what I am aiming at is not done by the amendment, I am satisfied that an amendment to the section should be redrafted, but I am pointing out that there is no use in telling me about a free bargain in the case of lump sums; there is no such freedom where the person has not got the money.  I am trying to cover that aspect of the matter.  I am endeavouring to meet what I believe is a great social need. If the Minister does not do that I cannot compel him.</P>

      <P>It seems to me that there is no need to introduce the question of ethics at all.  Senator Duffy suggested that if it is right to prohibit a fine under certain conditions it is equally right to prohibit that fine under other conditions.  But what is the reason for the section at all?  It simply seeks to ensure that rent restriction will be effective as far as houses built up to 1941 are concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If you amended the section it would not have that effect, because it would enable people to come along and pay a <Col N="395" /> sum of money which, capitalised with the rent payable, would give you a rent prohibited under the Act.  I have stated what I assume to be the main purpose of the section as it stands.  As pointed out by previous speakers&mdash; putting aside the question of ethics, which does not apply&mdash;it simply means that it has been agreed that houses built after 1941 shall not be subject to control.  Therefore, the Minister is not going to accept an amendment which would have the effect of cutting out what has already been agreed upon.</P>

      <P>This is a proposal to meet one aspect of the advertising business, in relation to the payment of fines and key money. Sub-section (4) of the section prohibits any person from making or offering to make any payment, or giving or offering to give any consideration the requiring of which would be in contravention of the section, or advertising or publishing any such offer.  Now, there are other kinds of advertisements common to this matter.  There is the case of advertisements offering a reward to any person who will give information as to where a house can be got.  In other words, the offer is not an offer to give possession of the house, but to supply information as to where such a house can be got, and in this amendment the proposal is to insert the words &ldquo;or advertising or publishing an offer to give a reward for information concerning the letting of controlled premises&rdquo;.</P>

All the amendment does is to try to prohibit the advertisement or offer of reward for information.  That has nothing to do with the auctioneer.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 73:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before Section 52 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where under an agreement for the sale of a dwellinghouse to which this Act applies, the purchase money is to be paid by instalments with interest and the purchaser is permitted to occupy the dwellinghouse before the purchase money is paid in full, such instalments shall be payable over a period not exceeding <Col N="398" /> 30 years, and the rate of interest shall not exceed 7½ per cent. on the balance of the purchase money outstanding from time to time.</P>
    <P>This, of course, is taken straight from the similar Act in Northern Ireland, and it is taken because of the recommendation of the Town Tenants (Occupation Tenancies) Tribunal, page 33, paragraphs 59 and 60.  If the members of the House care to read through that report they will find that on this particular point the report is absolutely adamant that something should be done.  Paragraph 60 starts off by saying:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In addition to this provision there are certain kinds of fraudulent evasion of the Acts, which should be frustrated.  This need was recognised by the Legislature of Northern Ireland in its Rent Act of 1932.  A device is sometimes adopted of purporting to sell a house to the tenant on a deferred payment system.  The tenant continues in occupation, but acquires no legal interest or title until a certain sum is repaid by periodic instalments.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I am not going to weary the House by reading the whole lot of that paragraph, but I would just add the last sentence of the paragraph, in which the report states that the particular Act in Northern Ireland should be adapted to suit our requirements and embodied in any amendment which may be made of the existing law.  I raised this matter on the Second Reading and I was very surprised to note that no such section was embodied in this Bill.  The Minister, in his reply, told me that he had had no evidence that that was happening.  It seems to me extraordinary that there was no evidence that that was happening: that the chairman of this tribunal should sit down and make a report and that he and the other members of the tribunal should produce a long paragraph covering a whole page of typescript about a thing of which the Minister says that there was no evidence whatever.  That appears to me to be so fantastic that I find it impossible to believe.  It seems to me, therefore, that it would be at least desirable that something should be done about it now, because the members <Col N="399" /> of that tribunal could not have produced this report <i>in vacuo</i>, if Senator Hearne will allow me to use another Latin expression.  It appears to me that is the general principle of law, and I think that this thing of sitting down just before you bring in anything is not right, and that we should not accept it in a codifying law.</P>

      <P>On the point whether it is good practice or not, I would say that it is necessary and desirable to have evidence when you are dealing with restrictive legislation.  It is both a good principle and a good practice in restrictive legislation that people should not go out and anticipate things of that kind unless they have some evidence.  It may be a different matter in other types of legislation but it is fairly serious when it comes to a definite restriction on sales.  I think this tribunal went through the Northern Ireland Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no doubt that there must have been plenty of evidence in the North of <Col N="400" /> Ireland as to what was happening, but we have no evidence of it here, and until we have, my attitude is that we should not anticipate that sort of thing until we know that it is becoming a nuisance and a burden to a section of the community.  Only then would I feel disposed to interfere.  I am quite satisfied that the tribunal saw the Northern Ireland Act and considered what was happening there, but I understand the position is that the Department has no evidence that it is happening here.  I do not want to accept the amendment, and I am assured that it is not comprehensive enough even if it were necessary.</P>

I was going on the assumption that the tribunal was a tribunal of reasonable men who were not going to bring in this suggestion without having some evidence before them but, of course, the Minister has now blown that argument sky-high.  So far as Senator Sir John Keane is concerned, the whole purpose of this amendment was to prevent fraudulent evasion of the Act.</P>

    <P>To a certain extent, this is tied up with the last section we have passed, but I am not absolutely certain whether the wording in Section 51 regarding the giving of any pecuniary consideration, would include what I had in my mind. Suppose, for example, the owner of a house is offering it to let and says: &ldquo;Very well, I will let you that house, at the controlled price, provided you will buy that table for £100&rdquo;.  I am not absolutely certain that we are covered against that already.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 75:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before Section 52, in page 25, to insert the following new section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>52.  Where, before the passing of this Act, any person has as a condition of the grant, renewal or continuance of a tenancy or sub-tenancy of any premises required the payment of any fine, premium or other like sum, or the giving of any pecuniary consideration in addition to the rent and where any such payment or consideration was made or given in respect of any such premises, the amount or value thereof may be recovered in any court of competent jurisdiction if proceedings for such a recovery are commenced within twelve months after the passing of this Act but not otherwise.</P>
      <P>This is a proposed link, to some extent, with an earlier amendment of mine.  In this amendment, I am endeavouring to deal with payments already made in respect of this whole house.  It is known that many devices are adopted by landlords to secure for themselves the use of large sums of money, where the property is a large one, in respect of which no return whatever is given to the tenants.</P>
      <P>It has been mentioned to me that in one area of Dublin there are 1,000 houses in one property, in respect of which deposits amounting to £15 or £20 have been made.  The sum involved is now between £20,000 and £25,000, and there are no dividends, interest or return of any kind.  In another case, brought to my notice this afternoon, a controlled house was let, at the controlled rent of 10/- a week, but the landlord brought it up to £40 a year, a difference of 5/- a week, and explained to the tenant that the margin between the 10/- and the 15/- was a sum in respect of security which would be returned when the tenant was leaving. What is happening in this case is this: the tenant has a sum of between £15 and £25 on deposit with the landlord.  These deposits have been made in the past, and therefore are not prohibited by the Bill.  The Bill only deals with future payments.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">

      <P>It does not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>The tenant is under an agreement to have returned to him the amount of the deposit when he is leaving the house, but he does not always get it.  One tenant who spoke to me on this matter explained to me that he found his house with whitewashed walls, and he decided it would be more comfortable if the walls were papered.  He papered the whole house and spent a considerable sum of money. A year or two later he was leaving and when he was settling up with the landlord, the landlord deducted £10 from £15 deposit, explaining that he would have to take the paper off the walls and get them re-whitewashed.</P>
      <P>In another case the tenant was handing up the key.  There was a deposit of £20 and the landlord pointed out that the tenant had changed the door on the house.  What happened in the house in question was the tenant on entering it found the front door was made of plywood and that it had shrunk.  He happened to be employed in a firm of building contractors, and he got a very excellent door made for his house and had it hung.  When he was leaving, the landlord pointed out that the hall-door&mdash;a very excellent door&mdash;would have to be taken away and that £15 must be deducted for the transaction.  He handed back £7 10s. to the tenant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The tenant happened to be talking to a neighbour who told him that the front door had been taken away by an official of the landlord concerned, and was actually in his possession.  The tenant pursued the matter, and went to a solicitor, who demanded a refund of the £15 and got it.  That is the kind of thing we are doing.  It is the kind of transaction this amendment is designed to cover.  I am endeavouring to secure, where a sum of money has been paid by way of deposit or fine or premium in respect to controlled prices, that that money will be recovered if proceedings are commenced within 12 months after the passing of this Act.  In other words, I do not want to open the gate for some person, who remains in one of these houses for six or seven years, at <Col N="404" /> the end of that period to take proceedings to recover the amount of the deposit.  I want to secure that only those who take proceedings within 12 months after the passing of the Act, would secure the advantage which this amendment is designed to provide.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not prepared to accept this amendment.  As far as controlled premises are concerned any sums paid by way of fines or premiums are recoverable.  It is different in the case of deposits.  If a landlord acquires a certain deposit for rent, say in a case like that mentioned, in which the Senator might think there was an improvement but which the landlord might think the reverse, the Attorney-General says that &ldquo;deposit&rdquo; is not in the same category as a fine or a premium.  It is different.  I think it is justifiable that a landlord should be able to protect his property, or to have some guarantee for the rent by way of deposit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>If a landlord wrongfully forfeits a deposit the matter goes to court.  If there is any dispute it will be taken to the courts for decision. Furthermore, according to the amendment the proposal does not seem to be confined to controlled premises.  It simply says &ldquo;premises&rdquo; and might apply to any premises.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kingsmill Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 77:&mdash;</P>
      <P>At the end of the section, in page 27, to add a subsection as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(2) To avoid doubts it is hereby declared that where any tenant shall or shall have <i>bona fide</i> reconstructed any premises by way of conversion into two or more separate and self-contained flats or tenements, such reconstruction shall not as between the tenant and his immediate landlord operate to exclude the premises so reconstructed from the provisions of this Act or the provisions of the Act of 1923 and the Act of 1926.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This refers to a rather extraordinary claim put forward recently.  The 1923 Act, Section 3, sub-section (5) provides that that Act shall not apply to dwelling houses that since April 2nd, 1919, have been <i>bona fide</i> converted into flats.  The object was that if a person had spent money in creating new dwelling houses he should not be controlled in his rent by the provisions of the Act.  It has been sought <Col N="406" /> recently to operate that section in a very peculiar way.  In one case which came under my notice, and which I am told is typical of others, the tenant of a house converted it while she remained in it into two separate flats, one of which she retained for her own use and the other of which she let.  As she had to provide the money she performed a public service.  But her immediate landlord, who had raised no objection to the conversion into flats came along afterwards and said: &ldquo;Ah! You now come within the actual wording of the 1923 Act.  This work has been done since April 2nd, 1919, converting the house into two separate self-contained flats.  It is true that you did that, but the Act only deals with the fact, and according to its wording, if in fact a house has been converted into two or more separate flats it is out of the Act.  You are not protected from the smart notice to quite which I am now about to serve. As landlord I will be in a position to put you out, taking the benefit of the money which you expended in creating flats.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If Senators read the wording of the Act of 1923, literally, that house would have to come out of the protection of the Act.  It is absolutely certain that to hold that it has come outside the protection of the Act is flying straight in the face of the object of the section, and the whole tenor of the Act.  I seek to have it made quite clear that, as between a tenant who has spent money in creating flats and his immediate landlord, the landlord cannot take the benefit of the tenant's work because of the accidental phrasing of the 1923 Act.  As hard things have been said about landlords, I may add that, in this case, the landlord is not a private person but a municipal corporation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="TheodoreMoore" hpid="Mr. Kingsmill Moore Mr. Kingsmill Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kingsmill Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>That depends on whether the conversion is so extensive that the tenant would come within the doctrine of waste&mdash;that is to say, that he has destroyed the general nature of the premises.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>

      <P>I shall have to consider this point.  It is rather hard on the landlord if a tenant can alter his premises without his consent.  If I were the owner of a house, I should resent that very much.  Houses built after 1919 were not controlled but, under the Emergency Powers Order, flats were controlled up to a certain date and we are proposing, on Report, to extend that control to flats constructed since.</P>

That is a process which is known, I think, to most people, and it is a process which will without any question succeed in this case.

      <P>I move amendment No. 8:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 3, Section 3, after sub-section (4), to add a new subsection (5) as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(5) Where an extra room in or attached to a house is provided at the expense of the owner or occupier who would have qualified for a grant under the provisions of this section if such grant had been applied for, the house shall not, on any valuation or revision of the valuation thereof <Col N="412" /> coming into force within seven years after the completion of such provision, be increased on account of any increase in the value of the hereditament or tenement arising from such provision.</P>
    <P>I gather that amendment No. 10 is intended by the Minister to substitute for my amendment No. 8.  The only thing I would like to ask him is why there should be any fundamental difference between Section 4 and the new Section 5.  Apparently the new Section 5 will only apply to a house that has been built or reconstructed with the aid of a grant under the Housing (Financial and Miscellaneous Provisions) Acts, 1932 to 1944.  It is not at all clear to me why there should be any difference between the two sections.  Both provide that there may not be an increase in rates.  It appears to me&mdash;and this is a point I should like the Minister to clear up&mdash;that if a person gets a grant under this Bill, he will not be liable for an increase in rates whether or not the house has been built or reconstructed under the Housing Acts, 1932 to 1944. It is not clear to me why if that is the case, it should be confined to that class only.  I am not going to attempt to quarrel with the Minister about it, but I think we are entitled to a clear explanation of the distinction between the two.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I was under the impression that I made my attitude in this regard quite clear on the Committee Stage of the Bill.  I do not think that the Senator's amendment, as drafted by him, is proper to this Bill at all because it relates to a general remission of rates in respect to a house which has neither been built nor reconstructed under the Housing Acts. It is provided under other statutes that if a house has been reconstructed or built during a particular period, a certain remission of rates may be granted.  These houses are dealt with under the Local Government (Remission of Rates) Acts.  I did say, therefore, to the Senator that, while I was sympathetic to the amendment, if he wanted to deal with the comprehensive terms of his amendments, he would have to wait until the Local Government Bill at present before the Dáil <Col N="413" /> came to the Seanad when he would have an opportunity of discussing it. That attitude did not appeal to the Senator, but I went to this extent at least to meet him.  I said that provided the amendment was confined to those houses which were built or reconstructed under the Housing Acts, I would introduce an amendment on the Report Stage of this Bill which would at least cover some of the houses the Senator had in mind.  We have got to remember in this connection that so far as the houses dealt with in sub-section (4) of Section 3 are concerned, they are houses in respect of which an application has been made to the local authority for a grant on the grounds that the premises and the applicant both fulfil certain conditions.  In the case the Senator sought to cover by his original amendment, no such application had been made and, in fact, no stipulation was included that the owner or the occupier of the premises would even have consulted the medical officer at all.</P>
      <P>I have made this concession to the Senator: if the owner or occupier can get a certificate from the county medical officer of health that he would in fact have been entitled&mdash;for that is what it amounts to&mdash;to a grant under this Bill by reason of his domestic circumstances, that is to say that there was a person in the house who was suffering from tuberculosis, that the additional accommodation was necessary to enable that person either to secure proper treatment or to be segregated from the other members of the family, and that the house was suited for the provision of this additional accommodation, but for reasons of his own he did not apply for the grant, I am putting that person in the same position as a person who had made an application in the ordinary way.  I am only making what I think is a reasonable reservation, and that is that the premises of the person concerned will have been built or reconstructed under the Housing Acts.  If, however, my amendment does not satisfy the Senator we can both withdraw them.</P>

      <P>I am astonished at the <Col N="414" /> method adopted by the Minister.  He must know perfectly well that I have no personal interest in this, good, bad or indifferent.  The only question is whether it is a desirable thing or not. If his only interest in the matter is whether it pleases me or not, and there are no merits in it, I am surprised he went to the trouble.  I agree that on the Committee Stage the Minister stated that he was prepared to accept the principle, provided it was confined to houses which came under the Housing Acts.  I read through the Report, and I asked him again to make clear the reasons why a person who did not get a grant when they built the house, the house being of the same size, should be precluded from the benefits of the Act.  I think the amendment as it stands is very much better than no provision at all.  I am still quite unconvinced as to the sound reasons for the distinction between the two.  But, although I am opposed to the Minister, I am not going to give him an opportunity to withdraw a provision which would benefit a certain number of persons whom I assume he thinks should be benefited.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 9:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 3, Section 3, before sub-section (6) to insert a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(6) Every regulation made by the Minister under sub-section (5) of this section shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas as soon as may be after it is made, and if a resolution is passed by either such House within the next subsequent twenty-one days on which that House has sat annulling such regulation, such regulation shall be annulled accordingly, but without prejudice to the validity of anything previously done under such regulation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I dealt with this matter on the last occasion.  The actual form of the wording of the amendment is, of course, the standard form that is in every Bill.  So far as the necessity to table regulations is concerned, I do not think that is questioned by the Minister.  The Minister <Col N="415" /> was of opinion on the last occasion that, because this Bill is, under the last section, cited with the Principal Act, that automatically meant that the provision for tabling in the Principal Act governed, also, regulations that should be made under this Bill.  I do not think that is clear, and I think it would be far better that it should be set out clearly in this Bill.</P>

      <P>(a)  a house has been built or reconstructed with the aid of a grant under the Housing (Financial and Miscellaneous Provisions) Acts, 1932 to 1944,</P>
      <P>(b)  the county medical officer of health or medical superintendent officer of health acting for the area in which the house is situated certifies that a member of the household of the house is suffering from pulmonary tuberculosis for which he is undergoing treatment and that the accommodation of the house prior to the provision of the extra room referred to in paragraph (c) of this sub-section was inadequate for his proper treatment or for his segregation from the other members of the household, and</P>
      <P>(c)  it is certified&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i)  that an extra room has been provided in or attached to the house,</P>
      <P>(ii)  that the provision of the extra room has been completed in a proper and workmanlike manner, and</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="416" /> (iii)  that a grant has not been obtained under Section 3 of this Act in relation to the extra room,</P>
    <P>the valuation of the hereditament or tenement consisting of or including the house shall not, on any valuation or revision of the valuation thereof coming into force within seven years after the completion of such provision, be increased on account of any increase in the value of the hereditament or tenement arising from the provision of the extra room.</P>
    <P>(2)  In paragraph (c) of sub-section (1) of this section, the word &ldquo;certified&rdquo; means, in relation to the matters specified in that paragraph, certified by an officer appointed by the Minister to certify those matters or, in case of an appeal to the Minister from a refusal by the officer so to certify, by the Minister.</P>
    <P>(3)  A person aggrieved by the refusal of an officer appointed under this section by the Minister to certify the matters referred to in paragraph (c) of sub-section (1) of this section may appeal against the refusal to the Minister, and on the appeal the Minister may, as he thinks proper, either confirm the refusal or give the certificate which was refused, and the decision of the Minister on the appeal shall be final and conclusive.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 11:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 4, before Section 5, to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>5.&mdash;(1)  Where a county medical officer of health or medical superintendent officer of health certifies that a member of the household of a house situated in the area for which such officer acts is suffering from tuberculosis for which he is undergoing treatment and that it is desirable either for the furthering of such treatment or for the proper segregation of the sufferer that there should be provided an outdoor hut or shelter within the curtilage of such house the following provisions shall apply:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="417" /> (a)  the local authority administering the Tuberculosis Prevention (Ireland) Acts, 1908 and 1913, in the area in which the house is situated may provide and erect such outdoor hut or shelter for such period or periods as the county medical officer of health or medical superintendent officer of health may from time to time certify to be necessary;</P>
    <P>(b)  the local authority may, if it thinks fit so to do, make upon the householder or the sufferer such annual or other charge in respect of the cost of erection and the use of the hut or shelter as may be reasonable in the circumstances of the case.</P>
    <P>(2)  The Minister may make regulations for the purpose of this section.</P>
    <P>When I was adumbrating this amendment on the Committee Stage the Minister made a remark which at the time very much impressed me.  He said that an amendment of this nature did not come in naturally on a Housing Bill, but I gathered that he was rather in favour of some such provision appearing in some Act in the immediate future.  But thinking it over, I am not so sure that the Minister's objection is as strong as I thought it was at first. The argument appeals to legal men like myself who like to have compartments where they can find things easily. Unless I am assured that a similar provision will appear very shortly in some other Act, I am rather inclined to press this.  Parliament has laid down a great many precedents for itself, which are not confined within too strict legalistic lines.  There is an Act of Parliament which provides simply that one Richard Rose, cook to the Bishop of Rochester, should be boiled to death without benefit of clergy.  At that time, of course, Parliament took rather a poor view of cooks who, having the opportunity of poisoning their masters, took advantage of that opportunity.  I merely give that as an example of what Parliament can do when it likes.  I suggest that this particular amendment is of such importance that the House could quite properly introduce it into a Housing Act.  Before I go any further <Col N="418" /> with explaining the object of it, if the Minister can tell me that either in the new Public Health Bill or in some Bill to be introduced and debated at a very early stage he will introduce provisions substantially the same as this, I shall not occupy the time of the House any more.  Otherwise, I shall have to urge the necessity of introducing the amendment into this Bill.  Perhaps the Minister will give me some indication.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The position, of course, as I think the Senator is aware, is that for a considerable number of years local authorities have assumed that they are empowered to provide those chalets, and in fact some 14 local authorities have provided a number of them.  Those chalets have been accepted by us for the purpose of recoupment under the Tuberculosis Acts.  That would seem to indicate at any rate that there is power under existing statutes to provide those temporary shelters. Whether there is or is not power under existing law, that position I think will be clarified in the new Public Health Bill, which will undoubtedly authorise local authorities to provide temporary accommodation of this sort, and will of course allow the local authorities concerned to secure the benefit of such recoupment as they may be entitled to under the Tuberculosis Acts.</P>
      <P>With regard to the amendment itself I would be very strongly opposed to including it in a Housing Bill.  The Housing Acts are designed to deal with permanent structures, with houses and homes and habitations.  They are not designed to provide temporary accommodation of any sort.  For that reason, I would be very strongly opposed to the inclusion of this particular amendment.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That the Clerk of the Seanad be and is hereby authorised to compile and issue, in respect of the year 1945, a return or returns showing:&mdash;</P>
      <P>1.  the number of days on which the Seanad sat for the transaction of public business;</P>
      <P>2.  the number of attendances made by each member of the House;</P>
      <P>3.  the number of Bills which were&mdash;</P>

      <P>(b)  passed or accepted by the House;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="420" /> 4.  the number of Bills amended in the Seanad, and</P>
    <P>(a)  the number of such amendments inserted in each Bill, and</P>
    <P>(b)  the number of such amendments accepted by the Dáil;</P>
    <P>5.  the number of divisions taken in the House and in Committee of the whole House;</P>
    <P>6.  the number of divisions in which each member participated and the number of divisions in which each member failed to participate;</P>
    <P>7.  the number of motions debated, distinguishing between&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  Government motions, and</P>
    <P>(b)  Members' motions;</P>
    <P>8.  the number of occasions on which each member participated by formal speech in debate, and the total number of columns of the Official Debates occupied by the speeches of each member.</P>
    <P>I do not think that this motion requires very much explanation.  It seems to me that its purpose should be quite clear.  The purpose behind the motion is simply to have made up, officially, by the officers of this House, a return of the proceedings and transactions of the House.  There is nothing unusual in that except that, of course, I should say that such returns have not been made up, so far as I know, in any official manner in this House heretofore. I have a recollection, however, that on occasions material much similar to what is asked for here was used and has been used in public in relation to the transactions of this House.  I think it is true to say that individual members of this House are constructing this information for themselves and using it outside, and I feel that if that is to be done, it should be done officially and should be presented to the House by the officers of the House&mdash;the Clerk of the Seanad, and so on.  It is the practice in many legislative assemblies to have a return each year of the work done.  That was the practice of the Dáil up to the emergency&mdash;not quite in <Col N="421" /> the form which this motion seeks, but in a more elaborate form.  I have here a copy of the Order Paper of Dáil Eireann for 8th February, 1939, and it contains no less than six motions, moved by the Leas-Cheann Comhairle. The first motion asks that there should be laid before the Dáil a return showing with reference to 1938, the number of days on which the House sat, and so forth, also referring to the number of hours devoted to different business, such as the Estimates for Public Services, and so on.  It really runs into two pages of the official return of Dáil Eireann.  My point is that a motion similar to this was moved year after year in that House, until about 1940. So far as I know, an almost similar motion has been moved during the last four or five years, and I understand that the practice was only dropped as a result of the emergency conditions, but that I do not know.  However, the common practice in legislative assemblies is to ask for a return of the business transacted during the year and how the various decisions were reached.</P>
    <P>The House will remember that on the last day we met members of this House were appointed to the Joint Committee on Privileges.  It seems to me that that Committee should ask for some information as to how the business of the House was transacted, and I want to say that my primary purpose in asking for this motion to be taken to-night is to ensure that the return shall be made by the House itself, and that we should not have to wait for the Joint Committee to do so.  Of course, such a return as this is very easily compiled. I have not heard any objection, from those in a position to judge, that there will be any difficulty in compiling the information.  As a matter of fact, any member of the House can compile the information for himself, if he spends the necessary time on it, but we are not prepared to accept a return compiled by a member of the House, possibly, for his own benefit.  It seems to me to be obvious that if this thing is to be done at all, it should be done in a proper manner and with official sanction. I see that there is an amendment on the Order Paper to this motion.  I have no objection to the amendment, but I do not think it is related to <Col N="422" /> the motion at all.  I have no objection to the amendment being taken, but I want to draw attention to the fact that this is a proposal to get information as to the work done, and nothing else.  I do not want to occupy the time of the House discussing a matter like this. The motion has been on the Order Paper, I think, almost two months.  It should be clearly understood, and I think its implications are known.  I want to emphasise, however, that I have no personal interest in having this return made.  I could easily compile such a return for myself.  I simply want to ensure that if such a return is to be made and used, it should be a return made officially and to the order of this House.</P>

      <P>I do not think that one can logically object to the motion. It is obviously statistical, with the object of getting a record of the business done by this House, but it has a certain amount of danger in it, I think. It is not a danger which is liable to affect me because I think that my record is fairly good, but there are a certain number of members who may feel themselves being pillioried.  The return may show that a certain number of members have taken a formal part in the proceedings of the House, and that some have attended very badly, but whether it is a good thing to encourage members to talk whether they have anything useful to say or not is another matter.</P>
      <P>I would much rather have the House act spontaneously.  If members have something to say let them come here, and if they have nothing to say, let them stay away.  That is much more satisfactory.  I would have doubts as to the effect of this motion, whether it will produce artificial behaviour, or artificial conduct on the part of certain members.  Such conduct would not improve the conduct of our business; it might, indeed, hold up the proceedings of the House to an unwarrantable extent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. M. Hayes Mr. M. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me that two things ought to be said at once about this motion.  A motion for a return with regard to the proceedings of the House should be discussed, at the outset, in the Committee of Procedure and Privileges.  The best way to deal with this motion is to ask the Committee of Procedure and Privileges to consider whether an annual return should be made about these or similar matters and, if so, what form such an annual return should take, and what matters it should contain: that is number one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As to number two, it seems to me that Senator Duffy is labouring under a misapprehension that you can apply the statistical method to determining the value of a Parliamentary Assembly, because, very emphatically, you cannot. Statistics are proverbially difficult to handle, and it is quite easy to draw a wrong conclusion from a certain <Col N="424" /> set of figures.  Statistics about a House of Parliament such as this can be entirely misleading.</P>
    <P>It is not possible, as Senator Sweetman has already indicated by way of a question, to determine what is required. We are asked to set down the number of occasions on which each member participated by formal speech in debate.  You can indicate the number of times that a man or woman intervened in formal debate, but there is no method of finding whether he talked sense or nonsense, or the extent of his irrelevancy.  You have no means of determining at all, by way of statistical return, what kind of member of the House he is.</P>
    <P>That can be determined only by his fellow members, and by the electors, if they took any interest in that particular type of thing.  Presumably, they do not.  I do not understand why Senator Duffy objects to members of the House keeping their own figures.  I think they are quite entitled to do it, but they are difficult figures to apply. For example, No. 1 is easily ascertainable. So are numbers 3, 4, 5 and 6, if people troubled about them, and number 7 is not very difficult.  Number 8 appears to me to be not worth the trouble at all.  It would only indicate that certain people sit in their seats and never speak about anything, perhaps because silence is golden, and possibly because ignorance is bliss.</P>
    <P>All that is very difficult to determine and certainly the Clerk of the Seanad, competent as he is, could not possibly evaluate either the eloquence or the silence.  I think number 8, therefore, should not be adopted at all.  Similarly the question arises of the number of attendances of members of the House. I had considerable experience of endeavouring to form a plan for that in the Dáil, and the answer is that it cannot be done because you cannot determine what an attendance is.  A person can turn in, make his bow and go off immediately and be recorded as attending, or, as has happened in this House, a person can get a petrol voucher certified by the Clerk of the Seanad for the purpose of attending the Seanad, rush in at 8.30 and intervene in an ignorant manner in a Debate, in <Col N="425" /> order to have his name recorded in the Official Debates.  Whether he is less reprehensible or more reprehensible than those who simply come in and go out or those who say nothing, it is not for me to say, and no return will indicate.  It appears to me that the motion is based upon what I might call a misapprehension.  The argument that if you have a certain amount of statistics you can determine the value of a Parliamentary Assembly is quite understandable but quite unsound.</P>
    <P>For that reason we ought not to adopt a motion of this kind in the House, but we ought to let the Committee of Procedure and Privileges consider what steps it can take about a return, perhaps at the same time considering what steps it can take to remedy what are abuses.  I speak with considerable Parliamentary experience and with the most profound pessimism, in saying that I do not think the committee can evolve any system.  The whole Parliamentary idea is based on the notion that if you become a member of Parliament and do not do your work, you will be thrown out, but the experience is that the more work you do the most danger you are in of being thrown out.  I am not complaining about that, but that is a fact which everybody knows.</P>
    <P>The amendment which Senator Foran moved, but for which there was no seconder, belongs to the type which is absolutely valueless.  A Senator may be quite right to withdraw an amendment after proposing it with the intention of bringing it at another stage and to have that information available without notes and comments capable of being understood by everybody is completely useless.  My suggestion is that we should not adopt the view that by getting a certain number of figures, we can determine the value of any contributions to the Debates that members of the House make.  We cannot.</P>
    <P>The House should agree that the matter should be brought before the Committee of Privileges by the Cathaoirleach so that the question of a return should be considered, leaving the committee free to suggest a return <Col N="426" /> and to suggest what form it will take.  For that reason, if the motion is put to the House, I would be against it and I suggest that the proper way to deal with it is to send it to the Committee of Procedure of Privileges.</P>

      <P>When I see motions about the Seanad I become very sceptical whether they are genuine.  I remember on a previous occasion that the Labour Party in this House voted for the abolition of the Seanad and I wondered when I saw the motion in the name of Senator Duffy whether his object was to discredit the House or to improve it.</P>
      <P>I am still not quite confident that I am prepared to give Senator Duffy the benefit of the doubt, and to say that his object was to improve this House.  I think he has certainly some grounds for trying to make improvements, when we consider that a number of Senators, who went to considerable trouble and expense to be elected to this House, come in to sign the roll, who are still drawing allowances for expenses and other remuneration but who have but once attended.  There is ground for some action to be taken there.  That class of people are drawing money under false pretences.  For that reason, I think Senator Duffy has some justification for putting down the motion.  I appeal to him to adopt the suggestion of Senator Hayes, and to bring the matter up at the Committee of Procedure and Privileges.  If he does that I am sure that something can be done to remedy the grievance under which he thinks the House is suffering owing to the non-attendance of many Senators.</P>

      <P>Like Senator Hayes I want to say that I dislike the whole tone of this motion.  On many occasions I tried to find out from various Senators what might be the reason why the motion was put down and nobody seemed to have an idea.  As we listened to Senator Duffy to-day I think we all expected to hear some reason why he put down the motion or what purpose he sought to serve.  We listened in vain.  The motion seems to me to have been conceived without due thought. The number of days the Seanad sat is very easily obtainable.  I am sure it is only a few Senators who do not keep the Order Paper for reference. The motion asks for the number of attendances made by each member of the House.  What exactly constitutes an attendance?  What purpose is to be served by the publication of such information?  Will we ask the Clerk of the Seanad when compiling the information to say at what hours members turned in and at what hours they retired?  Otherwise there is no point in setting out the number of times that Senators attended.  I speak as one who has been pretty attentive to my responsibilities, in the matter of attendance in particular, and it is a question whether we should ask the Clerk of the Seanad to distinguish between people who live convenient to this House and people who live a very great distance from it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again, should we ask the Clerk of the Seanad to find out from members who have not attended as regularly as they might, whether there were any special circumstances that prevented their attendance, as one would expect them to attend.  Unless one goes into all that kind of detail it would be unfair to the House to publish information of this kind.  The Committee of Procedure and Privileges might decide that a table of one kind or other might be issued, but anybody who had experience of statistics, or the handling of statistics, would be very slow to use any such table.  Dealing <Col N="428" /> with the number of Bills submitted to the House, surely every Bill has identification. Every Bill when dealt with in the House receives a number and date.  One has only to look at the volume for the year to know the number of Bills that were submitted to the House.</P>

      <P>I believe I said that the Bills had identification.  If I used the word &ldquo;number&rdquo; I am sure I corrected myself by using the word &ldquo;identification&rdquo;.  The motion also asks for the number of amendments inserted in Bills and the number of such amendments accepted by the Dáil.  The number of amendments that might be put down in this House on occasions are very numerous.  To the Bill we had before us to-day there were between 70 and 80 amendments, so that one would want to know what reason a Senator had for putting down a particular amendment.  How often are amendments put down for the deliberate purpose of altering a Bill?  How often are amendments put down because a Senator has a <i>bona fide</i> doubt as to the meaning of a particular section or a particular word and, having heard an explanation, is prepared to withdraw?  If the information is to be of any value some details on the lines I suggest would have to be included.  Senators can realise that if a table or a report is to be of any value a mass of information would be required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="429" /> At the same time it can be realised how utterly impossible it would be to deal with such a table with any degree of satisfaction.  The motion also asks for the number of divisions taken in the House and in Committee of the whole House.  One might as well suggest, when seeking that information, that the Clerk should show on what side a Senator voted, &ldquo;Tá&rdquo; or &ldquo;Níl&rdquo;. Surely that would be very important information.  Merely to ask for the number of divisions taken in the House, and to expect people to gauge from that the value a Senator rendered to the community by taking part in the division, does not make sense.</P>
    <P>A request regarding the number of occasions on which each member participated in debate is, I think, the least commendable portion of the motion.  It also asks for the number of occasions on which Senators participated by formal speech.  Would we ask the Clerk of the Seanad to decide how much of the speeches delivered here were read from manuscript?</P>
    <P>The whole idea inherent in this motion, as I think Senator Hayes mentioned, is that the privileges of the House should be abused.  If the number of columns filled by a Senator in the Official Reports is to be taken as a criterion of that person's value in the House, what is to prevent a member taking up any dossier with which he may be presented and proceeding to read it, or endeavouring to base a speech upon it, and, in that way, fill up columns and columns of the Official Reports.  The public then are to judge by the number of columns filled the value of that member's services to the House and to the community.</P>
    <P>Again, whether members should on every occasion, or on any particular occasion, get up and speak in the House is very questionable.  There are 60 members of the House.  The sitting lasts each day about five hours.  If every member is to stand and hold forth on every conceivable topic that comes before the House, how is the business of the Seanad to be done.  If members of the Dáil, who number 130 or 140, were to be judged by the number of speeches they make, and the length of those speeches, the whole <Col N="430" /> procedure of Parliament would be reduced to chaos.  Much more might be said against the motion.</P>
    <P>This House has a number of very distinguished members.  I agree that we do not see some of them very often, but I do not think that that makes them less valuable members of the House.  On a few occasions I have met some of them in the Lobby, and their views were well worth canvassing.  I am sure that they are not without making their views known to their fellow members.  To ask the Seanad to say that, because a member does not stand up and hold forth on every conceivable topic, thus filling columns and columns of the Official Report, he must be taken as a person unfitted for membership of the House, is to ask too much of a responsible body.  I hope that we shall not be asked to vote on this motion, that it will be gracefully withdrawn, especially in view of the suggestion made that the Committee of Procedure and Privileges might be asked to consider whether a report on some of the matters raised in this motion might not be presented periodically.</P>

      <P>Because I consider that, before any attempt is made to get out statistics, we should have the carefully-considered opinion of a meeting at which officials would be present and would inform us as to what was done in the past.  To the best of my recollection, figures which were got out in the past tended to be misleading.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think that the members, taken as a whole, give as much time or care to the business of the House as they might.  If anybody could suggest a statistical method which would ensure a better average attendance&mdash;I do not care twopence how often Senators <Col N="431" /> speak&mdash;I should be in favour of it.  I have a certain amount of sympathy with Senator Duffy in endeavouring to find a suitable form of resolution.  I could, just as easily as Senator Buckley, criticise this motion in detail.  I cannot support the motion as it stands because I do not think that the preparation of such statistics as are proposed would achieve anything.  They might be used by certain newspapers to create a false impression.  There is no question of party politics in regards to this motion. One Party is just as good or as bad as another.  I should be in favour of sending the matter to the Committee of Procedure and Privileges to see if it could find any form of statistics which would be of value.  Frankly, I am sceptical as to that but I am not prepared to say that no returns would be of value.  We could easily deal with this motion humorously.  I should not assume, as Senator Buckley did, that the proposer thought that long speeches were meritorious.  Senator Buckley assumed that, if a member had so many columns of the Official Report under his name, it would be of merit.  I am not so sure that he would not be regarded as a person who was wasting public money by taking up so much space in the reports.  I think that any kind of general statistics would be certain to be misused.</P>

      <P>I am of opinion that this motion should never have seen the light.  It is undignified and unworthy of the position which this House ought to occupy in the esteem of the community.  I am puzzled as to how it came to be put down.  If this yardstick of value&mdash;the length and frequency of speeches&mdash;were to have the effect of shortening speeches which, during the year I have been in the House, it was an ordeal to listen to, it would achieve the only good purpose it is possible for it to achieve.  Here, quotations and interjections find their way into the Official Reports.  At this stage, after many members have spoken, I can merely repeat what has been indicated. If there is to be a return as to speakers on every Bill and every amendment, I can see no meaning in that requirement in the motion that every member <Col N="432" /> is expected to say something, no matter how stupid, on every topic.</P>
      <P>In doing that, we should stultify ourselves and the Seanad would lose any value it has in the Parliamentary life of the country.  I feel strongly on this matter and, as the newest member of the House, I have the temerity to say that this motion should not have been put down.  It would not be creditable to a golf club and it would not be creditable to the Seanad.  I hope that it will be decently buried.</P>

One of my objections to the motion is in respect of the requirement as to the number of attendances. I can see no way by which we could decide what is an attendance in the House.  I understand that there is at present a return of attendances and that a member is recorded as attending if he turns up five minutes before the adjournment.  That, I understand, is the practice.  I do not know whether it is just or unjust to a number of members of the House.  In some cases, it is not just.  I do not know what is meant by the words &ldquo;formal speech&rdquo; in the motion.

      <P>One previous speaker referred to the difference in attendance made by a person, say, living in Dublin and a person living in Donegal.  Certainly if there is to be a list of attendances there should be some indication as to the relative difficulty of Senators in making such attendances. There is a certain plan followed in making out the cost of living figures. Certain items of food being much more largely used than others are weighted; and I imagine, if a list of attendances is to be compiled, there should be a system of weights attached to the attendances of members according to the distance which they have to travel to the Seanad here.  In fact it might be necessary to prescribe certain travel zones and make the rates vary according to these zones.  There is also the question of the person who makes a five minutes' attendance. The attendance would have to be weighted accordingly and there would be all sorts of difficulties.</P>
      <P>In justice to Senator Duffy, I should like to say that he is aiming at something which is very important, namely to secure a better average attendance in this House.  I think for that reason we should be grateful to him for having called attention to the matter. Whether the particular plan he suggests is the best way to secure that result is another question.  As regards the question of &ldquo;formal speech&rdquo;, some difficulty might arise in the interpretation of the meaning of the word &ldquo;formal&rdquo;.  I take it that when a Senator is proposing a motion, he makes a formal speech in support of that motion; but if when other motions are under discussion he interjects a remark or makes a brief contribution of some kind, that would not be a formal speech.  I would support the suggestion made by Senator Hayes that the matter be referred to the Committee of Privileges for general consideration and, in that event, perhaps Senator Duffy would see his way to withdraw the motion.</P>

      <P>The motion at least has done one thing.  It has enabled a number of people to say what they do not know about motions.  It seems to me that the motion is perfectly clear. Members may not like it but that is another question.  There is very little room I think to start talking about what is a formal speech.  Surely that must be fairly clear to everybody.  If a person makes a speech, he is entitled to ask to have that recorded as a speech, but if a person interjects a remark, even though it may be an intelligent remark, he is not making a formal speech.  As to the question of attendance, there are two observations that might be made about it.  Do we not know that there is a number of people who never attend here?  Do we not know that they are very anxious to get into the Seanad, but equally anxious to keep away from it, once they get their names on the list?  As to the actual attendances, in the Parliament of the Six Counties in Belfast a Senator is paid per attendance. They must have some method there of determining what is an attendance, because they pay per attendance and not otherwise.  Surely, if they can discover in Belfast what constitutes an attendance in Parliament we can also find some way of finding what is an attendance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am afraid there are some people, like my friend, Senator Counihan, who are always suspicious of everything they see on the Order Paper <Col N="435" /> particularly when it comes from this quarter of the House.  The Senator need not be so suspicious.  I informed the House at the very start that the information which I seek is actually being compiled by members of the House and is being used outside the House.  I was shown by a member of the House a record he had made of the performances of his colleagues.  If that is being done, and is going to be used against some of us or all of us, it should be done officially.  Actually it seems to me that no matter what we do, we cannot prevent some information being collected regarding the way in which this House does its work in view of the fact that a committee has been appointed to consider methods of elections in this House. This point arises.  As I happen to be a member of the committee, probably the easiest way I can get the information for such a committee is to ask for it.</P>
    <P>I cannot see what is the meaning of this bashfulness on the part of certain members.  It may be argued that some of the lists, if compiled in a statistical form, would not supply the information sought.  That is probably true but at least there should be no difficulty in getting a return showing the number of days on which the House sat.  It has been proposed in Dáil Éireann that a return of that character should be prepared in respect of that House.  A motion was moved by the previous Ceann Comhairle of Dáil Éireann asking for a return showing the number of days on which that House sat, the kind of business transacted, etc.  It further seems to me that these are matters of which we should have some record, so that over a period of years one can see to what extent the Seanad has been engaged in the performance of public business, the number of Bills submitted to the House, and the number passed or accepted by the House.  Is there any difficulty in showing that, or is there any objection to showing it?  Dáil Éireann has asked for a similar return in regard to that House.  What is this bashfulness to which we are so subject when we are afraid to ask for this return?  Again the return would show <Col N="436" /> the number of divisions taken in the House.</P>
    <P>Senator Ó Buachalla asks why we should not go further and show side by side the returns from the Tá and Níl Lobbies.  I have no objection to that if anybody wishes to have it.  I accept the view, of course, that these tables will not measure up accurately or even approximately the value of the work done or the value of the contributions made by individual members.  That is obvious.  I am under no illusions about that.  I never thought you could get tables showing the values of the work done, of the number of amendments submitted, of the number of speeches made, and so on.  All those are of relative value.  But the tables would at least show those who are interested in the form of Parliamentary organisation we have here, with two Houses, the extent to which the Second House is used.  I am hoping too that, if we had statistical information as to how members use the House, it would be a good thing for the House itself, because one day the question will arise as to whether we need a Second House or whether we do not.  It occurred to my mind very forcibly one night last week. We debated a certain motion for an hour.  The motion was put.  A number of people said &ldquo;Tá&rdquo; and a number said &ldquo;Níl&rdquo;.  The motion was declared lost, and a division was challenged.  If it had been declared the other way, there would not have been sufficient people on the other side to challenge a division.  When the division took place, 12 people voted on one side, and 15 on the other&mdash;27 people out of a House of 60 were present to vote on an important matter affecting the public interest.</P>

I am discussing this House, and calling <Col N="437" /> attention to the fact that, when a division was challenged, less than half the members were present.  That is a serious matter.  More serious still is the fact that during the whole time when that particular motion was being debated there were only seven people present, and after the division the number was again reduced to seven.  It will be seen, therefore, that of the twenty-seven people who voted twenty did not know why they were voting on one side or the other.  I think that is a serious matter.  I think it will tell materially against the continuance of a second Chamber if members of that Chamber, who are alleged to be non-party and to be elected purely on a vocational basis, simply come into the House and march into one lobby or the other just as the Whips order them. Surely that is a matter which must concern every member of this House.  If this return were to display the need for more attention being given to the business of this House by its members, I think it would have achieved its purpose.</P>

I am prepared to fall in entirely with the suggestion of Senator Hayes, who, I think, agrees that there ought to be a return.  What form that return should take is another matter.  I am prepared that it should be decided by the Committee of Procedure and Privileges, and if they would in their wisdom submit a report it might be considered at a later stage by this House.

    <P>That, in the opinion of Seanad Eireann, the Government should introduce legislation to ensure, whether by way of statutory recognition of the status of and standards for builders, implied warranties in the construction for sale of new buildings, or otherwise, that the public <Col N="438" /> will not be fraudulently imposed upon by &ldquo;jerry-builders&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This motion really arose out of a discussion on the Second Stage of the Rent Restrictions Bill.  I originated a discussion then on the matter with the Minister for Justice, because of the fact that reference to the problem of &ldquo;jerry-built&rdquo; and unsound houses had been contained in the Report of the Town Tenants' (Occupation Tenancies) Tribunal.  In paragraph 157 of that report, and subsequently, reference was made at some length to a situation which arose to a large extent in the immediately pre-war years&mdash;more so than, perhaps, at any other time There were then a certain number of builders who were not as scrupulous as they might have been in keeping to the standard which the more reputable builders adopted, and, in consequence of their unscrupulousness, very great hardships, indeed, were imposed upon a considerable number of people. Now, it is as well that we should understand that when an ordinary person goes to buy a house, the purchaser takes upon himself the entire responsibility of knowing whether that house is well and substantially built, or that it does not contain any concealed defects.  In many of the building schemes that existed in the period of which I speak, it was a common habit for the purchaser, so to speak, to be given a free lease, and therefore, when he was buying his new house, there would be no necessity for him to consult any solicitor.  If there had been such a necessity to consult a solicitor, the solicitor, if he were advising him properly, would have advised him of the liability that was imposed upon him, and would have told him that he must either take his chance or get the house inspected by a competent surveyor.  However, there grew up a habit, largely, of dealing with new houses on the basis of free leases and, in consequence, the purchaser did not get advice from anybody and, very often, did not appreciate the liability which he was taking on himself, in that he was making himself responsible for the fact that the house had been properly built.  I might perhaps quote a sentence or two <Col N="439" /> from the Report of this Town Tenants' Tribunal.  Paragraph 157 of the Report of the Town Tenants' Tribunal states:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Section 31 of the Housing Act, 1931, made it an implied condition that every dwellinghouse let at a rent not exceeding £30 a year in the Dublin area or £25 elsewhere, is at the commencement of the tenancy fit for human habitation.  An admirable provision worthy of extension; yet at times hard upon an innocent landlord.  Sometimes a landlord may have bought a house from or erected by a dishonest builder, and may be unaware that it is unfit for human habitation.  He may have to pay dearly to the tenant for breach of the implied covenant, without having any redress against the real culprit.  During the building boom, novices who knew nothing about building, and sometimes others who were not novices, built and sold houses that were &lsquo;jerry-built&rsquo;, and some worse than &lsquo;jerry-built&rsquo;, leading to some remarkable actions in the courts. Such frauds can defy detection by the most skilled architect when he can only make a superficial inspection of the completed job.  Inferior materials may be hidden in the structure which disintegrate or perhaps decompose with a penetration of moisture.  Some shocking cases of this heart-breaking class of swindle came before the courts where humble people had put their life-savings into the purchase of a house, only to find, when time and weather revealed the fraud, that they had lost everything.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I do not think that anybody will have any doubt as to the existence of the danger.  The danger is one that affects to a very large extent the young newly-married couple, and it is perhaps, appropriate therefore, that this motion should be discussed in the month of February, when we are approaching the spring, and when their thoughts are turning perhaps in a certain direction.  I think it was Stevenson who once referred to the fact that if what was going to be the home looked very beautiful superficially from the outside in the eyes of a young couple in the spring and <Col N="440" /> if it looked the same when the drabness of the winter came along it was, indeed, home.</P>
    <P>Really the difficulty about this is that the people who are in the position, particularly in the future as I see it, of purchasing newly-built houses will not be able to counteract this fraud unless there is some step taken to assist them in so doing.  There is a variety of ways in which it could be done.  So far as the motion which stands in my name is concerned, I have referred to the question of standards in building, added to the method of an implied warranty, so that if a house which had been built was not properly habitable and was not constructed of good materials, a purchaser would have an action against the builder.</P>
    <P>Perhaps I might deal with the second first of all.  As the House is aware there is a provision in the Housing (Miscellaneous) Provisions Act, 1939, which deals with houses which are for letting.  That section provides that in any contract entered into after the passing of that Act in the case of a house subject to a certain valuation, there shall, notwithstanding any stipulation to the contrary, be an obligation out of which you cannot contract.  It is provided that there shall be an implied condition that the house, at the commencement of the tenancy, is reasonably habitable and an undertaking that it will be kept throughout the tenancy reasonably fit in all respects for human habitation.</P>
    <P>So far as that obligation is concerned, that would not apply in the case of a purchaser, but I suggest that it would be a reasonable stipulation on a vendor to ensure that the house was habitable.  He could not get away from this statutory provision, and in the ultimate event, would have to satisfy a court that the house he had built was reasonably fit for human habitation.</P>
    <P>There have been plenty of cases in the last 15 years&mdash;I cannot speak of an earlier period because my experience does not go back far enough&mdash;in this age of building with concrete blocks, where houses have proved not <Col N="441" /> to be habitable.  I know three specific instances myself where completed houses were purchased by people who could ill-afford the loss, and who when they had completed their purchase in the spring of which I am speaking, thought the houses looked all right.  In the winter, they have found that the houses were weeping and dripping with water that was saturating through what were supposed to be concrete blocks but what in fact were little dashes of cement thrown in to keep together voluminous masses of sand.</P>
    <P>The proportions of the mixture were hopelessly weak and no reputable builder would have used them.  I have suggested one way in which this matter might be met.  The second way I would suggest is by prescribing some standards of building.  That is a question which I can quite appreciate is a very thorny one, but I do say this: in future years, so far as I can see for a very considerable time, we are going to find it very difficult to get all the building materials we require and there will in consequence be governmental Orders as a result of which only a certain amount of building materials, particularly timber, will be released in a schedule for certain builders and for certain works.</P>
    <P>It does appear to me clear, therefore, that if we could arrive at a standard we could at least ensure that those who did not work up to the standard, would, so long as the stringency remained, get no supplies so that they would not be able to continue after they had been found out in the construction of jerry-built houses.  We now come to the question of how best that standard should be operated. The Vocational Commission's Report deals with this matter, not at very great length.  But, in paragraph 604, it does deal with the setting up of a national construction council.</P>
    <P>I would suggest that within the framework of what is advocated in that report, there might be a possibility of working out something that would meet the problem we have to face.  I want to be quite clear on one point&mdash;I am not advocating anything, <Col N="442" /> and would not advocate anything that would mean that the building profession would become something in the nature of a closed shop, because I do not think that would be desirable. But I do not see any reason why a builder should not be treated by statute as being a person of exactly the same importance and the same assistance to the community as, say, a solicitor.  The solicitor's profession is confined by statute and in order to become a solicitor, you have to conform to certain regulations and qualifications, but anybody who conforms to those regulations and qualifications can become a solicitor.</P>
    <P>In the same way I should say that the builders profession should be one that receives statutory recognition, that it should be put on the same plane, and that anybody who conforms to the regulations and the qualifications should be capable of becoming recognised by statute as a proper builder.  I would take that a little bit further.  It appears to me that if you set up a national construction council on the lines indicated in the report, it could do what the report suggests, that one of its functions would be to set up certain standards of work and materials for public buildings and dwelling-houses.  I am not so much interested in business premises.  They do not come into this motion.  This is in respect to dwelling-houses alone.  I think it could prescribe certain standards and, having prescribed these standards we could well make the case that one of the statutory things that members recognised by that council must do is to undertake to keep to those standards of workmanship and materials, so that to anybody who came along they could show that they were going to keep to these standards of workmanship and materials.  They would be entitled to carry out work as a builder and would be entitled to get all the appropriate licences, within the proper priority, for that type of building, as well as being entitled to receive all the appropriate State grants.  Here is the way I think it would be effective.  If any member of that organisation was once shown not to have carried out a job according to the proper standards or with a good <Col N="443" /> type of materials then he would be cut off from any Government grants or any licences he needed, and in that way you would have a sanction for good building, without any restrictive operation on the number of persons who would go into the building trade to build all the houses we require.  It appears to me that that would be a substantial addition to the suggestion of the building operative trade themselves, the setting down of standards according to which they would operate.</P>
    <P>As the House is aware there is something on the same lines in the shape of specifications by the Department of Local Government in regard to grants, to the effect that a job must be carried through under trade union conditions as far as labour is concerned.  I suggest to the House that the analogy is more or less the same.  At the end of the war we are starting out on what we hope is a new era, in which we must make up for the six years during which little or no building, in comparative terms, was carried on.  I suggest very strongly to the House that when we are starting on that era, we should make certain that we are starting on the right foot, and that the buildings that will be put up here will be ones that will really last.  The way to do that is by making certain that we put into new houses materials&mdash;that are now scarce and are likely to remain scarce for some time&mdash; that would be put to proper use.  We should also make certain that the ordinary poor type of person who is investing a life's savings in the purchase of a house should be protected so far as possible from the fraudulent type of builder, who, I am glad to say, is not very frequent amongst builders, but is there.  The investor should be protected from him so that that type of fraud is prevented in either of the two ways I have suggested, or in any other way that anybody else can suggest.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LouisODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>The Act of 1931 must have contemplated something in the nature of the idea with which Senator Sweetman has dealt.  Unfortunately, it was very limited in its scope.  It applied to houses let at £30 a year in Dublin, and £25 a year elsewhere.  Of <Col N="444" /> course, that limited the scope very considerably. The Act also provided that if a house was let for a period of three years or more the section would not be applied.  A person could contract out of the Act by letting a house for three years or longer.  It seems to me to be a pity that there was that limitation of rent.  I would like to have applied it to houses built after the date of the Act.</P>
      <P>There are numerous defects of that kind.  One of the defects I see is that, according to the arrangements made between the architects and the builders, there are certain specified agreements or specifications providing for what is called a maintenance period.  In other words a builder is liable for any defects that occur within six months of the issue of the architect's certificate that the building was complete.  The owner pays the amount mentioned in the certificate, less 10 per cent. which is held back for a period of six months.  If defects are discovered in the house within six months the contractor has to make them good. Otherwise the owner can get the defect remedied by another contractor and can pay him out of the money that was held back.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If defects are not discovered within six months it appears to me that the contractor goes free.  That is a very bad system.  It should be altered.  If there is what are called latent defects in the building which could not be discovered for a certain period of time, and that they then appear, I would make the contractor liable not alone to the employer but to the assignee of the employer.  Very often people get houses built and then sell them, and, as Senator Sweetman pointed out, the unfortunate purchasers later find out the defects.  Probably the foundations were not properly made.  I knew of a case where a row of houses was built without any foundations being laid at all.  I think they are still standing. Probably they will collapse some fine day on the unfortunate occupiers or owners.  There ought to be some protection in such cases.  I do not like the idea of having a sort of closed borough of contractors, but I should like the law to be such that, in every building <Col N="445" /> contract, there would be an implied condition that the materials were of the best, that the work was done in the best manner, and that the contractor would be liable, not alone to the employer, but to the assignee of the employer for a certain fixed period.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir John Keane Sir John Keane">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no objection to this whole problem being examined with a view to legislation, but I see great danger in legislation which would adhere too closely to the methods outlined by the proposer of this motion. I can speak with some personal experience of building.  I have rebuilt a big country house at a cost of £12,000.  I did that almost entirely with handy men.  I could never have gone so far as I did if it had not been for handy men.  That sort of thing is possible only in the country.  I hope that the Minister realises that a considerable amount of building, which conforms in no way to the formal methods outlined in the motion, is done in country districts. In the rural districts, as Senator Counihan will confirm, there are men who call themselves builders and who are prepared to build a house or a cottage or an outhouse for a farmer. They are excellent men.  The farmer supplies the material necessary and they build.  They turn out a sound bit of work&mdash;in every way as good as the work done by the professional tradesman. I cannot see those men ever being brought within the purview of any licensing system.  I should view with great alarm any legislation which limited the activities of these small, enterprising men in the country.  How do some builders begin?  A carpenter or a mason has a certain amount of intelligence and enterprise.  He gets together a little money and builds a house, perhaps, for himself.  As a result of his experience, he may build a house for somebody else.  On the profit realised, he continues to build and, in the course of time, becomes an accepted and recognised builder.  Anything that would impose a number of regulations, other than those we have already, on such a man would be deplorable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope that the Minister will not consider legislation in this connection save in general terms and that he will <Col N="446" /> not consider legislation which would curb the activities of small men of enterprise who want to build in a limited way and grow, by experience, eventually into big contractors.  If you go back to the history of some of our big contractors, you will find that they were, in origin, tradesmen of enterprise. Enterprise of that kind will not prosper in any form under Government regulation.  The Senator referred to people who conform to certain standards. I am not advocating bad building: I am rather the other way round.</P>
    <P>I want to see the best building but I do not agree that, if people do not conform to certain standards, they should not receive a licence to obtain materials.  Is it suggested that we are to be obliged for all time to go hat in hand to a Government Department for leave to buy the building material we require?  That is a deplorable outlook. It is only due to the evils of the moment that the system is justified. I hope that it will be short-lived and that it will be succeeded by free enterprise.</P>
    <P>There is a matter allied to this to which I would like again to call the attention of the Minister.  The Minister may recollect that, on more than one occasion, I have asked him to consider the setting up of a bureau of standards.  There are great dangers in the position in which our industries now are&mdash;sheltered, some of them enjoying monopolies or having restricted competition, and with a small market.  Quality may suffer in those circumstances and the public will have no protection.  Electric fittings, steel and aluminium products are capable of being brought under some form of a bureau of standards.  That is the first line the Minister should take in any legislation to control quality.  The Minister himself said that he was in favour of this proposal. That is some years ago and we have had nothing in the form of legislation of that type since.  While I do not oppose the motion before us, I see danger in it.  I hope the Minister, when he comes to consider it, will do so in its widest aspects with a view to avoiding any attempt to curb enterprise <Col N="447" /> or regularise individual initiative.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCounihan" hpid="Mr. Counihan Mr. Counihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Counihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I must agree, in the main, with the remarks made by Senator Sir John Keane.  Senator Sweetman said that a builder who built a house should be responsible for a number of years for its being a perfectly-built house.  There should be some finality about that.  When a man builds a house and sells it, it is the business of the purchaser to get a certificate from an engineer or architect that the house has been soundly built.  The responsibility for the condition of that house should not remain the liability of the builder for a number of years.  If the Minister made a regulation that a certificate by an architect or an engineer should be given with the house when built, that should be sufficient.  Senator Sweetman says that he does not want to make building a closed borough.  I am afraid that the motion would make it that, if certain standards were to be insisted upon before a builder could enter upon business.</P>
      <P>Some of the greatest builders we had in the City of Dublin were men who could not, originally, conform to regulations of that sort.  We all know builders who built numerous houses in the county and around the suburbs of the city.  If such a regulation as Senator Sweetman advocates had been in force, those houses would never have been built.  It is very dangerous for a Senator to undertake the regulation of matters of that kind.  In my own experience, houses were built, under county councils, the middle of the walls of which were stuffed with turf, which was plastered on the outside.  That was the fault of the county council, the clerk of works and the engineer.  It is almost impossible to guard against these things if everybody on the job does not do his work conscientiously. For that reason, the Minister should consider the matter carefully before making regulations.  If you commence to make regulations, instead of increasing the number of houses to be built, you will curtail it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Sir John Keane mentioned <Col N="448" /> the case of houses built by what are called &ldquo;handy men&rdquo;, particularly in the country.  I know a good many of these handy men who have done excellent work in building on a time and material basis or for weekly or daily pay.  If we insist on the setting up of a standard for all houses, I think we are going to do a great disservice to the building industry and retard the building of houses which are badly wanted. I think the Minister should be very careful before formulating any regulations for the building trade.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrederickSummerfield" hpid="Mr. Summerfield Mr. Summerfield">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Summerfield</NameTxt>
      <P>This motion, as one which is designed to afford protection to the public, must have sympathy from all of us, but I cannot help feeling that the Minister himself must be rather laughing up his sleeve at the suggestion that the Government should decide on more interference in our affairs than is the case at present.  The Government is being twitted constantly about its interference in this and its interference in that.  As a businessman, I join with Senator Sir John Keane in hoping that the need for much of the interference that we have now will soon pass.  For that reason, I wonder whether legislation in this particular matter would be wise or whether it would achieve the object the mover of the motion has in his mind.</P>
      <P>I think it will be generally admitted that, pre-war, access to the building trade, as to my own trade and many other trades, was far too easy, but these trades have, in the main, a lot of power in their own hands and up to now they have not used it to control abuses within these trades.  The builders are a very important and very powerful federation and I cannot help feeling that it is within their own competence so to arrange control of their own trade that they could inflict punishment upon any man calling himself a builder who departed from the code that they feel should be applied in their particular case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the trade with which I am connected myself, we have already taken control of the situation.  Very exacting conditions have been laid down for new entrants to that particular trade.  It is a matter that will be <Col N="449" /> regulated without looking to the Government to see what it can do. While I have every sympathy with Senator Sweetman in what he is trying to achieve, I would suggest that the course which he suggests in his motion would defeat its own object and it would saddle us with the cost of further Government interference, since apparently it is to be a matter for Government legislation which would mean a permanent addition to our national expenditure.  I seriously suggest, therefore, that any abuses that do exist in that very important trade could be wiped out if the builders themselves decide to wipe them out because they can freeze out the bad type of builder by depriving him of the trade discounts which are essential to his continuance in business.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanRuane" hpid="Mr. S.T. Ruane Mr. S.T. Ruane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S.T. Ruane</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to support the motion brought forward by Senator Sweetman.  My only objection to it is that, to my mind, it does not go far enough.  He is concerned with poor people who invest their life savings in the purchase of a house.  My concern is more with poor people who invest their life savings in the building of a house. I do know that since 1923, during the period of office of our two Governments the facilities afforded to such people by way of grants were, no doubt, responsible for the erection of a big number of houses throughout the country.  I know, too, that many of the people who availed of these grants were not possessed of over much of the world's goods or cash and they naturally looked for a builder who could erect their new houses at the smallest price.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was here that people referred to as handy men or people referred to down the country as &ldquo;gubbauns&rdquo;, entered into the picture.  Some of these people were able to talk better than they could work, and to satisfy those who proposed to build new houses that they could put up a better house at a lower cost than skilled artisans.  I should not like to freeze out a tradesman who, after putting some money together, starts as a builder, but I certainly should like to limit the activities of people who have no experience, <Col N="450" /> and who are out on every occasion to rake off the most they can for themselves by putting up some kind of house that, when pebble-dashed or plastered on the outside, will cover up the defects in the interior of the walls.</P>
    <P>As far as the well-to-do classes are concerned, when they propose to build a house, they get plans from an architect or an engineer, and very often they can afford to have a clerk of works on the job.  The business of the clerk of works, as everybody knows, is to see that no inferior workmanship is allowed to pass and that no inferior material goes into the building. Poorer people cannot afford such a service and I believe that it is the business of the Government, or of councils throughout the country, to ensure that people of that type will not be imposed upon by inferior craftsmen who are not too particular about the admixture of sand or cement and who would have no scruples in making a 12 to 1 mixture suffice where a 7 to 1 mixture would be necessary.  I would not look upon the supervision by the Government of houses built for the poorer classes as interference.  I feel there should be some form of supervision, even if it went to the extent of creating a few extra inspectors in the country whose business it would be to pay impromptu visits to places where building was being carried out to ensure that the character of the work was not inferior. I trust that Senator Sweetman's motion will achieve something in the way I suggest and that people who cannot afford the loss entailed in investing their money in the erection of bad houses, without knowing anything themselves about the actual work, will be protected in some way from inexperienced workmen who have very few scruples as far as their work is concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I think this is the kind of motion which can usefully be discussed without being put to a division or without tying ourselves to the exact phraseology of the motion because it raises a matter of very considerable importance.  Senator Summerfield, perhaps not unnaturally, assumed that if anything were to be <Col N="451" /> done under this motion it would be done by Government interference.  I do not think, unless something has happened within the last hour or so, that Senator Sweetman meant by regulations, regulations operated by a Minister, which is a very common form, particularly under the Department of Local Government&mdash;much more so than under the Department of Industry and Commerce.  I am not at all prepared to agree with the last speaker that we could remedy difficulties of this kind by appointing a few more Government inspectors.  I believe the remedy might be worse than the disease, but at the same time I do not think it would cure it.  I am not in sympathy with Senator Sweetman when he thinks that you can have a code for builders the same as you can for solicitors.  If he thinks, because a particular gentleman has complied with the niceties in order to entitle himself to be called a solicitor, that he is therefore a competent solicitor, I completely disagree with him.  Harm can be done, undoubtedly, but I do not think any set of regulations such as might be applied to a solicitor could be applied to a builder.  For my part, if a man were building a house for me, I should prefer him to be a man with good sound experience rather than a man with a lot of certificates attached to him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not at all prepared to advocate a large system of restrictions, but I do believe that there are certain classes who require protection.  In particular, I think that some protection is required for the purchaser of a house which a builder has himself built, and is selling. Thus far I would be prepared to go, but when you go beyond that it is necessary to exercise care.  Perhaps he did not mean it, but it seems to me that Senator O'Dea was almost regarding a contractor in the same way as, on the previous Bill, people regarded the landlord &mdash; someone who was fundamentally bad, or, at any rate, dangerous. Where a house is sold he wants to provide that the original builder will be responsible to the person who purchases it.  I think that is going too far.  Let us suppose that I go to Senator Hearne and persuade him to <Col N="452" /> build a house according to a certain standard.  If it is below a certain recognised standard he will probably refuse to build it, but I imagine that he&mdash;I have never gone to him&mdash;or any other builder will be prepared to build a house that is up to a certain standard, but is not necessarily the best house that could possibly be built. At any rate, it seems to me that that if I make a contract with him or with any other builder, and he builds according to that contract, and I then sell the house, he should be responsible only to the extent of the contract which he carried out.  If there is a contract he is legally responsible to see that it is carried out.  But to place on him complete responsibility to the person to whom I sell the house that that is a good house, and will not give trouble within, say, three years, is to put too much on the builder.  I am not a builder, and I have no particular brief for them in any way, but I think there is a danger there.  When you see an evil and you want to remedy it, in doing so you are very liable to create another injustice, and I think that might easily occur in the case of the contractor.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>If the difficulty is about bad building, and there has been a contract, I should be responsible to the person to whom I sold the house, and I, in turn, could get at the builder. I am not an expert, but am putting the point of view that seems to me reasonable.  Now, I come to the type of house with which I think Senator Ruane is concerned.  He said that there are people who cannot afford to employ an architect.  On the contrary, I would say they cannot afford not to employ him.  A good deal of trouble at the moment is due to people who think they are saving money by not employing an architect, whereas they would really be protecting themselves, protecting the builder&mdash;assuming that he is honest, as most of them are&mdash; and, in most cases, getting a better and cheaper job by employing an architect.  This idea that you can put up just anything, and that it will <Col N="453" /> necessarily be cheaper is a great mistake. There should be more recognition of the importance of the architect and of the protection you get through him.  Remember that the law places very considerable responsibility upon him.  Solicitors will bear me out when I say that he has pretty definite legal liabilities if he undertakes supervision, and the plans are not carried out.  Therefore, by employing an architect you are protected against the builder who is not honest.  You also assist considerably the builder who is honest, and the net cost in the case of a small house is not very much greater. The first point made by Senator Sweetman was that he wanted protection against the jerry-builder.  I do not know what the dictionary definition of a jerry-builder would be.  The kind of person I have in mind is the man who builds a house, with or without an architect&mdash;if there is an architect, he is purely employed by him, and does not supervise the work&mdash;and then sells it.  I think he should be responsible for a considerable time to see that that is a good weatherproof house.  When you get beyond that, frankly I am a bit sceptical.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The skeleton of this motion is that in the opinion of Seanad Eireann the Government should introduce legislation to ensure that the public will not be fraudently imposed upon by jerry-builders.  I do not know whether there has been established beyond doubt that the public have been imposed upon by jerry-builders.  There is no doubt something in the report of the Town Tenants Commission with reference to jerry-builders, but to my mind the matter is somewhat in the air, and I think it will be very difficult for the Government to introduce legislation to ensure that some people at all events will not be imposed upon by the kind of builders who are referred to here as jerry-builders.  Senator Sweetman's motion contains suggestions as to the line of legislation, but I think that it would be very difficult to put those suggestions into practice. Legislation is imposed for the protection of people who cannot protect themselves.  That is why protection was given to the tenants of those small <Col N="454" /> houses under the Housing of the Working Classes Act.  The first protection was given by Section 12 of the Housing of the Working Classes Act, 1885&mdash;60 years ago.  Prior to that Act, a number of houses in a very bad state of repair had been let by unscrupulous landlords to poor people who required small houses, and were able to pay only a small rent.  In fact a great number of them were not fit for human habitation.  The Legislature in 1885, under Section 12 of that Act, enacted that notwithstanding any stipulation to the contrary there should be implied in a tenancy agreement for the letting of one of those small houses a condition that at the commencement of the tenancy the house was reasonably fit for human habitation.  That was implied in the letting.  It was a warranty implied by statute.  In other words, notwithstanding any stipulation to the contrary, the landlord could not contract out of that.  That protection was continued by Section 75 of the Housing of the Working Classes Act, 1890.</P>
      <P>The next step, as far as Ireland was concerned, was Section 31 of the Housing (Miscellanous Provisions) Act, 1931, which has been referred to by Senator Sweetman; and there it was enacted that notwithstanding any stipulation to the contrary there should be implied, in every letting of a house to which that section applied, a condition that at the commencement of the tenancy the dwellinghouse should be reasonably fit for human habitation, and an undertaking that during the tenancy the house would be so kept by the landlord: that is, in a fit state for human habitation.  So, it took from 1885 to 1931 to have legislation introduced placing the responsibility on the landlord to keep the house fit for human habitation during the tenancy.  Up to that time, he was only bound to let a house which, at the date of the letting, was fit for human habitation, and although the house might have gone into disrepair after the letting, the landlord was not liable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, we are dealing here in this motion, not with the letting of houses of a higher valuation than those which come under the Housing of the Working <Col N="455" /> Classes Acts.  I assume that we are dealing here with the building of new houses and the purchase of such houses by people of limited means.  In the ordinary course of events, if a person buys an unfurnished house, there is no implied warranty that that house is reasonably fit for human habitation. If a person takes a lease of such a house unfurnished, there is no implied warranty.  That house might be full of vermin, which would render the house unfit for human habitation, but the lessee has no remedy.  I am assuming that these are houses to which the Housing of the Working Classes Acts do not apply.  In the same way, if you take an unfurnished flat here in Dublin, there is no implied warranty that the flat is fit for human habitation.</P>
    <P>It may be infested with vermin, and you have no redress unless you have entered into an agreement where there is an express warranty given of the fitness of the place.  Now, in the case of a house that has been built by a builder and sold to a purchaser after it is built, there is no implied warranty in law that that house is fit for human habitation. On the other hand, if a purchaser buys a house from a builder while the house is in course of erection, there is an implied warranty laid down that it will be fit for human habitation, because it is reasoned that the builder then knows that he is building that house for a particular person and knows the purpose for which it will be used.</P>
    <P>There is, as I say, legislation on the Statute Book at present dealing with the letting of houses to tenants under the Housing of the Working Classes Acts, as regards the fitness of the houses for human habitation, but there is no other legislation, either as regards the letting or the purchase of houses.  The question then arises whether the Government here will introduce legislation dealing with the purchase of houses in advance of any legislation that has, so far, been enacted in England, where, I assume, the problem has presented itself from time to time.  I am not aware that in England there is any enactment which goes as far as the legislation suggested <Col N="456" /> by Senator Sweetman in his motion this evening.  Section 31 of the Housing Act of 1931 here followed Section 1 of the Housing Act of 1925 in England, and that has now been repealed by Section 2 of the Housing Act, 1936, in England.  So far as I can see, notwithstanding the introduction of a number of Housing Acts in England from time to time, from 1925 to 1936, no effort has been made to introduce legislation of this type.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested here that people have been imposed upon by jerry-builders.  There are, of course, two classes.  First, there is the class of person mentioned by Senator Ruane, namely, the person who obtains a grant to build a house and entrusts the building of the house to a person who might well be described as a jerry-builder. Well, the owner of that house in many cases loses his life savings. On the other hand, we have the case of a person who obtains a loan from a building society or a bank to buy a house, or who obtains a loan on the instalment system to buy out the house.  Of course, I myself think that there ought to be some way in which these people can be protected.  I take it that if a grant is made by the Government, or under the Housing Acts, for the building of houses, certain conditions are laid down.  I have not gone into the matter very fully, but I imagine that such grants will not be made except on the certificate of a surveyor or architect that the house has been properly built.  I think there is a standard specification laid down, although I am not sure about that.  In the same way, in the case of a person who is buying a house that is already built and is ready for occupation, undoubtedly, there should be some protection for that type of person.</P>
    <P>Senator Sweetman has mentioned this idea of the free lease, which enables a person to get a house, but which deprives him of the opportunity of examining the bill, so to speak. Now, it is true that during the war a number of houses turned out to be unsatisfactory, not because of the jerry-builder, in my opinion, but because of the absence of suitable building materials during the war.  I <Col N="457" /> myself know of some houses where the timber used in building them was unseasoned Irish timber which, naturally, after a short time, began to warp.  I think that there were even some cases, where it was difficult to obtain timber, where the timber from demolished old houses was used for the building of new houses, and, of course, that type of timber was very dangerous, because it was bound to be full of dry rot and so on.  At any rate, personally I do not think it would be a wise thing for the Government to lay down standards for builders, as is suggested here in the motion.  I think that that is very much in the air.</P>
    <P>I think that we will have builders and jerry-builders, like the poor, always with us.  Senator Sir John Keane spoke in favour of the handy man.  The handy man may be quite good enough for Senator Sir John Keane, and if he is it is all right, but the handy man must not be imposed on any other person. While I have a certain respect for handy men on the proper occasions, I think a handy man is a danger, not only to the country, but to himself.  I have known of some cases where handy men became contractors on a small scale in country districts, erected a number of labourers' cottages with some success and then started to run for contracts value for thousands of pounds.  That was the end of them, and their sureties have been paying ever since.</P>
    <P>I think myself there should be some way in which the public would be educated to appreciate the good builder and to distinguish him from the bad builder.  There might be some kind of propaganda or publicity with information available for people who require houses.  Undoubtedly, the housing problem is a problem that must be faced in the near future, and except in the case where a builder sells a house which he himself has built, there is little room for legislation.</P>
    <P>It is possible that legislation might be the proper remedy&mdash;in the last resort, I admit&mdash;in cases where houses are sold to a purchaser who had no opportunity of having them inspected during the building.  We know that, as a rule, these defects show themselves only after exposure to wind and <Col N="458" /> weather and a certain amount of wear and tear reveals inferior materials.  In that case, the Government might possibly consider the enactment of legislation which would provide that there should be a warranty implied in the case of a house for sale, the warranty being that the house at the time of sale is reasonably fit for human habitation and would continue so for a certain period.  Of course, this question of enacting by law a guarantee for a number of years is impossible, and out of the question.</P>
    <P>These defects will, no doubt, show themselves in the course of four or five years, and it might be possible, by legislation, to protect the purchaser against a builder who has sold a house which is not worth the money.  In some cases that has happened and the house is impossible to repair and is a loss to the purchaser.  I admit there are certain such cases, but I am not sure they are very widespread.  For these reasons, I think that, at the moment, this question is at the stage of suggestion and the Government might consider it.  If the Government is satisfied there is a problem, then I trust it will give it mature consideration, so that the purchaser of the future may rest satisfied that when he pays the money for his house he will get value for his money.</P>

      <P>After listening to Senator Ryan, I think there is very little I wish to say on this matter. Firstly, I would have liked to get some idea of the magnitude of the problem visualised by Senator Sweetman.  It seems to me that houses are built under different auspices.  In the first case, that of local authorities, is there any problem?  I hardly think so, because, after all, there are engineers and architects supervising the work from beginning to end.  The second possible source of trouble appears to be in the building of houses  private persons, to be used by these private persons themselves, and I think that in that particular case these people do go to the trouble of engaging engineers and architects, and that specifications are prepared which have to be followed during the construction.  I do not think there is a problem there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="459" /> In the third group you have the speculative builders, and I wonder if Senator Ryan has remarked to what extent the problem exists because of the operations of these builders.  I quite agree that dud houses are built just as I am sure that, under the most exacting conditions in industry, machines of a dud nature are turned out, as well as other commodities. Getting 100 per cent. perfection in production seems impossible, and I wonder if it is reasonable to condemn all of the speculative builders because of a few cases.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that what is needed is that people who are desirous of obtaining houses from these builders should be instructed to see to it that the specification is produced to them, and to the solicitors, before they complete the purchase.  If a builder cannot produce a specification from an architect or an engineer, and if he is not prepared to declare that the house has been built to the specification, then the purchaser ought to fight shy of a deal in that particular instance.</P>
    <P>It is true that it may be very difficult to induce people to hold back and insist on seeing specifications in present circumstances.  Houses are undoubtedly scarce, and there is a considerable amount of competition between people for those on offer.  The effect of this is to cause people to take leaps in the dark more often than is advisable.  If they are prepared to take leaps in the dark what, very well, can one do about it?</P>
    <P>The motion would seem to ask members of the House to declare whether they are in favour of an institution of standards not alone in building but in other fields as well.  If I am asked whether I am in favour of the idea of establishing an institution of standards, I have no hesitation in saying I agree with it, but it is one thing to agree, and another to see if it can be implemented in a reasonable time, and ultimately whether the cost would be worth it.  If there is a monopoly in the building trade, we ought to investigate it immediately and secure the establishment of standards. <Col N="460" /> If there is no monopoly but evidence to show that rings exist, I think, no matter what the cost or trouble, we ought to check them and insist that these people will follow standards.</P>
    <P>The whole thing suggests to me the idea of establishing some kind of bureau of investigation, or some kind of court, similar to that which exists in the United States, where, if there is reason to feel that monopoly is operating to their detriment, or that rings are operating, people can lodge a complaint and the whole matter can be publicly investigated.</P>
    <P>Senator Douglas was quite right when he stated that people cannot always afford to consult architects and engineers.  It is true that amongst a great number of people there is a certain amount of uneasiness in approaching engineers or architects because of a feeling that the fees are generally exorbitant.  There is undoubtedly throughout the country a very uneasy feeling with regard to the method whereby engineers and architects on contracts are paid a certain percentage of the cost by way of fees, which, in the public mind, results in the reaction, that the more money the job costs the better for the engineers, and that very often the interest of the individual or of a public authority may be sacrificed.  It seems that the more money is spent the better the job ought to be.  Nevertheless, people's incomes are limited, and they are slow to engage these officials, because they do not think they would be well advised to do so.  The same thing operates in their minds with regard to the transfer of property, that the amounts they are charged by the legal profession are out of proportion to the services rendered. It is a matter that might be investigated by the institute that is in existence, which caters for engineers and architects, to see if the public is wrongly advised, or has wrong information. Something ought to be done to educate the public as to the true position, and to point out whether it is their own ignorance that is causing these grievous losses.</P>
    <P>Another thing that occurs to me about it is this, that it is a pity some <Col N="461" /> institution is not in existence, or that some institutions already in existence, would not undertake the preparation of a series of plans that would be suitable for various parts of the country, and for various types of people anxious to get houses, so that these plans would be adaptable.  It is true that if a person wants a plan for a small bungalow, and goes to an engineer, he would not get it under £15 or £20.  There is generally the suggestion that if he goes on with the building the amount will be set off against that accruing on the work.  We have to realise, however, that the idea of a charge of that kind tends to make people shy of approaching engineers, as they should be approached, as industry would be the better of their services if more availed of.</P>
    <P>As to the reference to handy men, I am afraid our ideas about handy men will have to undergo a change.  It seems to me that in view of the way young men are now being educated, getting an excellent secondary education, and many of them then getting a considerable degree of technical education, with improved methods, it is no great task for them in a short time to become proficient in different occupations. The whole idea, not only in the building trade but in many other trades, is that the lines of demarcation seem to be erased to a considerable extent, and that in regard to those who might be looked upon as handy men some years ago, the term is not now quite suitable as we understood it in the past.  I would not be inclined to despise a man who calls himself a handy man for want of a better title. It is just as well to continue the whole idea of that kind of man being there, and with competition well developed, the balance ultimately is in his favour.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnJosephMeighan" hpid="Mr. Meighan Mr. Meighan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Meighan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was rather surprised at some of the statements made during this debate.  When houses are built by a local body they are under the supervision of county engineers, or by deputy engineers who are on the spot and if there is any deficiency or loose methods adopted that is the fault of the officials concerned.  There may have been cases, and I think it has <Col N="462" /> happened, where when contractors knew some local councillors the defects were overlooked.  I suggest that if the Minister sent a notice to county managers asking them to see that there was strict supervision over houses being built by local bodies there would be a great improvement.  The same applies to small houses in country districts where building grants have been largely availed of.  It would be surprising if the Government paid out grants without having certificates from engineers, or from some one qualified to deal with such matters, to the effect that the money was wisely spent and that a decent job had been done.  If that was not the case it would be an easy way to get money.  I suggest that the Minister should tighten up the regulations so that the public would be satisfied that money was wisely spent. I know very little about speculative building as that is not common in country districts.  If these speculative builders get grants, steps could be taken to ensure that they would not succeed in getting grants if houses were not properly constructed.  When people put their savings into the purchase of houses it is up to them, before making the investment to see that they get decent value.  A man who buys a horse always asks for a guarantee as to the soundness of the animal.  In the same way, a builder should be asked if he is prepared to undertake that a house is properly built, and he should be asked for an engineer's certificate to that effect.</P>
      <P>The engineer would be entitled to go through the house, examine it and see if everything was right.  If it satisfied him, I suggest that the buyer of the house should be responsible for the engineer's fees, whereas if the seller said that the house was all right and if it did not satisfy the engineer, the seller should be responsible for the fees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The last speaker referred to engineers' fees.  I should like to see engineers and architects engaged by anybody about to build a house, especially in the country, because the most ideal sites are not always selected.  If an engineer or architect <Col N="463" /> were employed, he would be able to give advice on those matters.  The people are very nervous about those fees but that matter, which concerns so many and has an interest for future generations, should be easily settled. There should be a few special architects or engineers whose salaries would be borne only in part by the persons concerned and the Government should meet them half way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasForan" hpid="Mr. Foran Mr. Foran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Foran</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that the Minister is getting much enlightenment from this discussion.  I think that it is futile and that it will not help us very much in getting rid of the jerry-builder. The trouble in the building industry, if we go back to 1913, was entirely, or almost entirely, confined to the speculative builder, who was a tinker, tailor, butcher or baker and, very often, a solicitor.  Those formed groups and employed a carpenter or bricklayer to build houses.  The arrangement was that he would build at a certain figure.  If he was able to reduce the price in any way, he obtained commission.  Consequently, he had no inducement whatever to make a good job of the house.  Therein is the root of the trouble in the building trade.  If the House is able to advise the Minister how to overcome that trouble it will have gone a long way towards solving the problem of bad house-building.  The man regularly engaged in the building trade does not, as a rule, go in for speculative building.  It is those groups I mentioned which engage in this work. When there is a rush for houses and they see an opportunity of making money quickly, they form what is known as a building society and employ tradesmen.</P>
      <P>Senator Buckley complained about the fees of architects and surveyors. After all, those people make a substantial contribution to the building industry.  I do not know if their fees are excessive, but what about the solicitors' fees.</P>

      <P>I never knew anybody who did it.  I should be very glad to hear of the number of cases where the house purchasers took action.  I do not think that we have helped the Minister in making up his mind.  We have not indicated the line on which legislation should proceed with a view to safeguarding the ordinary purchaser. Before the war, there was a great demand for houses and people were prepared to buy ill-built dwellings.  Can anybody visualise a similar position in the immediate future?  I do not think so.  The supplies will not be there and, consequently, the speculative builders will not multiply to the extent they did before 1939.  I do not know any more than anybody else about this matter but I suggest that, where a house is sold by a speculative builder, a guarantee should be given that that house would be repaired free by him for, at least, three years, excepting damage caused by the act of God.  That might be some help.  With the best intentions in the world, things will sometimes go wrong.  Floors might, for instance, suffer from woodworm.  The line I have indicated might be adopted by the Minister.  I was amused to hear Senator Sir John Keane talking about handy men.  He said that his house cost £12,000.  I hope he got value for his money, because £12,000 is a great deal to spend on the repair of a house.</P>

      <P>Senator Foran was right when he said that the Minister was being asked to introduce legislation which nobody had, so far, outlined. I am in agreement with the motion generally, but I am at a loss to see how practical effect can be given to it.  I do not think that anybody has shown how that can be done. There has been reference to handy men.  In my county it is said that there is no difference between the handy-man and the finished tradesman.</P>
      <P>The fact is that a lot of men in the building industry started as handy men and while Senators spoke about handy men as against finished tradesmen, they did not indicate where these workers stopped being handy men and started as being finished tradesmen. That is the difficulty.  The very fact of a man having certificates, or whatever sort of documents are necessary to indicate that he is a tradesman, does not in itself indicate that he is a better man than a very efficient handy-man. I agree that the public would need some protection, if it were possible to give it, against improper workmanship but I think the Minister is being asked to do something that it would be very hard to carry out in practice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main idea of course behind this motion is to ensure that people will get good value for their money and that builders will put good and solid workmanship <Col N="466" /> into the building and reconstruction of houses.  Senator Meighan said that houses are being built under the Housing Acts and that there an onus rests on the officials of the Local Government Department to ensure that these houses are sound and of good workmanship.  I am inclined to think that the only onus that can be put on officials of the Local Government Departments is to ensure that such houses are built in conformity with provisions of the Act, that is to say, that they are not less than 500 square feet and not greater than 1,250 square feet capacity.  That, I think, is the only onus that rests on the officials of the Department of Local Government in administering these grants.  A house may be unsound even though it is qualified to receive a grant because these officials hardly go to the trouble of boring and testing the walls.  To ensure that the houses were soundly constructed, it would be necessary to have a clerk of works at the actual erection of these houses.  It would not be possible to have a clerk of works present at the erection of some small house in a backward district in County Leitrim or to send him out to some district beyond Oughterard when a house is being reconstructed to qualify for the grant of £40.  It is not possible for people with a small farm of £5 valuation to employ a clerk of works.</P>
    <P>The only thing I can suggest&mdash;and I am not sure that it would be practicable&mdash;is that the officials of the Department of Local Government in paying grants, should try to ensure that a certain standard of workmanship is observed in the erection of these houses as well as seeing that the houses complied with the other regulations laid down under the Housing Acts.  As regards the handy-man as against the finished tradesman, neither I nor anybody else can say exactly when a handy-man becomes a tradesman because the majority of tradesmen, with the possible exception of those in cities or large towns, started as handy men and ended up as being finished tradesmen. When a worker ceases to be a handy-man and becomes a tradesman is a thing that cannot be decided.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="467" /> There is a scarcity of builders in this country and a lot of the work in rural areas is being carried out by pretty efficient handy men.  Some of them do good work and others do bad work but, generally the man who is getting a job done will try to get the best possible builder he can get.  Very often in the reconstruction of houses, handy men undertake to do the work and to supply all the materials other than stone, sand and lime, for the amount of the grant.  In connection with houses built by local authorities, I do not at all agree that local authorities always get good value for the money expended.  I have one or two cases in mind of houses built by a county council pre-war for £230 and £250 each.  I suggest that no man could build a labourer's cottage for that sum. Of course, we are bound to have faulty houses in these circumstances.  That often arises where you have keen competition between handy men.  When labourers' cottages are built over a scattered area in a county, the work cannot be properly supervised.  To ensure that it would be properly supervised, it would be necessary to have an official on the spot at all times.  If it could be done&mdash;I agree it would be very hard&mdash;some system should be devised to ensure that good workmanship is put into these houses.</P>

      <P>Like Senator Summerfield I was surprised at the appearance of this motion over the name of Senator Sweetman who, I understand, belongs to a Party that is seriously perturbed at what they describe as the growth of bureaucracy but who are, nevertheless, constantly proposing motions here calling the Government to extend further the range of its operations and to do things for the public which the public might reasonably be expected to do for itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is another of these motions for which a plausible case could be made if one assumes, as Senator Sweetman assumed, that the public is incapable of protecting itself.  Underlying this motion is the assumption that the <Col N="468" /> public is at the mercy of the jerry-builder, that there is nothing a person can do to prevent himself from being defrauded when he goes to purchase a house or to ascertain whether a house he is going to buy is constructed of sound materials and is likely to prove durable.  I do not know how far Senator Sweetman thinks the Government should go in protecting the public in commercial transactions. We set up certain standards for foodstuffs because it is considered to be in the public interest that the buyer of foodstuffs should be protected against fraudulent tradesmen.  There is a Bill before the Dáil now to extend the powers of the State, to prescribe standards of quality for foodstuffs and certain consumption commodities, which does not appear to be welcomed by Senator Sweetman's political associates who object to it as an extension of bureaucracy.  People buy milk every day.  People buy whiskey and certain other foodstuffs every day&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;or certain necessities which are required by law to be sold only at a certain standard quality. A person buys a house only once in a lifetime and rarely rushes into a transaction of that kind.  If he has any doubts about the title of the vendor, he consults a solicitor.  If he has any doubts about the quality of the house, he will consult or he ought to consult an architect or an engineer.  He is certainly in a position to get expert advice but the suggestion underlying this motion is that instead of putting on the purchaser an obligation to get expert advice, to prevent himself being defrauded, the State should give that protection instead.  Does that apply to houses only?  People buy horses and I have heard that more fraudulent transactions take place in relation to horses than in relation to houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been so alleged.  For some reason the term &ldquo;horse dealing&rdquo; had become synonomous with trickery in all languages.  Is it suggested, because gullible members of the public may <Col N="469" /> buy horses which are not nearly as good as they looked when gingered up for sale, that the State should step in and secure a guarantee of quality or an implied warranty as to the quality of the horses?  People buy motor cars, and I have no doubt that many second-hand motor cars are sold in consequence of the glowing description of the vendor, which was not proved to be justified when the car went into action.</P>

      <P>Second-hand houses are sold, too, and no doubt the Senator's suggestion here applies to second-hand houses as well as to new houses.  I think we could go much too far in the matter of placing upon the State the obligation of protecting citizens.  Mind you, I do not agree with Senator Summerfield that the State should not interfere at all, but leave it to organisations of traders to impose certain regulations, which has been done in some cases, including the one to which he referred.  While most of those traders' organisations, which are formed for the purpose of limiting supplies of commodities to persons of whom they approve, start off with the highest motives and with the welfare of the public in their minds, they always reach a stage where the welfare of the collection of traders is a predominant consideration.  The growing tendency in that direction which I have noted recently&mdash;it applies not merely in the motor trade but in a number of other trades&mdash;that organised purveyors of materials apply only to members of certain associations, is, I think, a cause of perturbation, and may occasion State action at some stage in order to ensure that the channels of opportunity for enterprising newcomers in business will not be unduly restricted.  I am not in favour, however, of instituting any system of registration or certification of builders, either by the State or anyone else. <Col N="470" /> That suggestion made by Senator Sweetman is based upon the naïve assumption that if one segregates all the builders in this country into two classes, the first class being the persons who could pass any test of proficiency or experience you might impose, and the second class being those who could not, all the honest men would be in the first class, and all the dishonest ones in the second class.  There is no foundation for that assumption, nor do the past operations of a builder offer any guide as to his future conduct. A man may build 50 good houses, and then proceed to build ten bad ones.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not so sure that that is so.  There are other occupations in any event in which the people who are now the most respectable, because they are the most wealthy, are those whose practice was the most doubtful.  In this matter, one must not assume precedents where they do not exist.  Reference was made to the Housing Act, 1931, and I agree fully with Senator Ryan that that does not appear to be relevant to this particular issue at all, because that Act and the previous Acts to which he referred were framed to regulate the relationship between landlord and tenant, and not for the purpose of establishing any particular standard of building, or any code of conduct for building contractors.  I think too that we have to rely in the main upon the assumption that people will protect themselves.  We must assist them to do so.  It is frequently not easy for the public to operate the safeguards which are available to them, and in the case of building there is an obvious need to provide standard specifications of materials.  That has been done.  In the past, we in this country normally adopted the British standard specifications, but latterly a sub-committee of the building council has been meeting regularly, preparing Irish standard specifications for building materials, and is arranging to publish them.  The idea of having standard specifications <Col N="471" /> is to facilitate a person who wishes to specify in a contract for building the use of materials of a certain quality. Instead of having to inscribe in the contract elaborate descriptions of the materials, he can merely quote the relevant standard specification number, and, by doing so, create a contractual obligation on behalf of the builder to use materials of that quality.  Similarly, in relation to other commodities.  I do not know if it is practicable to prescribe standards of building as distinct from standards for building material, but to a considerable extent I think we can afford to the public the means of protecting themselves by the institution of a system of standards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Sir John Keane stated that I had spoken in favour of such an arrangement before, but had done nothing about it.  In fact, it is hoped to introduce in the Oireachtas this year legislation which, amongst other matters, will set up a standards authority.  Let me be quite clear that I do not contemplate that the State should take any obligation to enforce the production of materials only of a prescribed standard quality, or do more than publish those standards after consultation with the industrial and commercial interests concerned, and limit the use of the term &ldquo;standard quality&rdquo; to materials that do, in fact, conform to the standard.  If we have a standard quality cement, then only cement of that quality can be so described.  Somebody may make some other quality of cement, below standdard or above standard, and sell it either because of its cheapness or for some other reason, to persons who want cement of that particular type, but the utmost the State can do is to make it illegal to describe any cement as of standard quality unless in fact it is.  The same would apply not merely to cement but to building materials generally, and to any industrial product or other material which is made the subject of a standard specification.  There is no good in discussing the details of that contemplated legislation now, because the Seanad will shortly have an opportunity, I hope, of going into it in detail, but it <Col N="472" /> may be of interest to learn that the preparation of the legislative proposals is well advanced, and it is hoped to have them submitted to the Oireachtas at a comparatively early date.</P>
    <P>I think that is nearly all I want to say upon this motion.  I dislike the idea of putting upon the State more functions of this character.  It may be that there will be occasions upon which the State cannot avoid taking those functions, because a public interest arises and nobody else has the effective power of protecting that interest.  To revert to the matter that I mentioned before, which was raised by Senator Summerfield, I think there are many cases where, if it is desirable to restrict the number of people engaged in a particular trade or to determine the conditions under which they engage in that trade, it is far preferable that the State should do it, even though it may lead to complaints about the growth of bureaucracy, than that it should be done by private traders' organisations.</P>
    <P>On the whole, however, the more we leave it to the public to protect themselves in commercial transactions, giving them only the facilities and information which will enable them to do so, the better it will be, not merely for the growth of enterprise amongst the people, but also for the preservation of a proper relationship between the State and the public.  Therefore, I can hold out no hope that the Government will produce legislation along the lines suggested here, either for the setting up of a system of registration and certification of building contractors, or for the establishment of an implied warranty in building contracts as to the quality of the materials or the method of construction employed in the erection of buildings.</P>
    <P>I am informing the Seanad that there is at present an organisation working upon the preparation and publication of standard specifications for building materials: specifications which will have no legal basis although, undoubtedly, they will be normally quoted in building contracts and will be made the basis of business dealings in these materials, and that we <Col N="473" /> have in preparation legislation which will establish a standards authority and give to the standard specifications published by that authority certain legal protection.  I contemplate that that standard authority will also have independent power to analyse and inspect the quality of materials offered for sale, and to publish their analyses and comments thereon so that the public will, through the activities of that authority, have available to them the information which will enable them to conduct their buying and selling with a full knowledge of all the facts, and that, in my opinion, is as far as the State should go.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>In one way I was not very surprised at one thing that the debate showed.  I assumed, when I was introducing this motion, that all the members of the House were aware of the contents of the Report of the Commission on Vocational Organisation, but it very shortly appeared to be quite clear that I was incorrect in making that assumption.  That can be understood in respect, perhaps, of Senator Summerfield, but I find it very difficult to see how it could be so in the case of the Minister.  Now, first of all, I do not think it can be suggested that an implied warranty could be regarded in anyway as Governmental interference, and in so far as the question of a standard and status was concerned, I thought I made it quite clear that my motion was along the lines of paragraph 606 of the Report of the Vocational Commission, where it is made perfectly clear that that commission wanted to avoid anything in the way of Governmental interference, that the one thing that they felt was that such interference was leading to bureaucracy, and that therefore this should be a matter for a national council, to be drawn from the producers of raw materials, in connection with building and other matters, and should be given statutory recognition.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, a bureaucracy, of itself, would be one that at least would be run by people who knew <Col N="474" /> what they were dealing with, which sometimes has its advantages.  However, I would not have been drawn into that only that the Minister suggested that this was one of a series of motions.  I do not know what the other motions are, which would make this one of a series.  However, I suppose that on some other occasion the Minister will probably explain that to the House.  I think it was also somewhat peculiar that the Minister mentioned the analogy of foodstuffs and the sale of foods, and said that there was a provision, in regard to the sale of foodstuffs, to have a warranty of that sort, because it just happened that I had with me the wording of one of the paragraphs of the Report of the Town Tenants Tribunal, which is as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It is, therefore, suggested as one of the most important recommendations we can make, that this evil...&rdquo;</P>
      <P>the evil referred to there is jerry-building.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;...more difficult of detection beforehand, and often more cruel in its results than the sale of tainted food, should be dealt with by law, even though building for the time being may have largely come to a standstill.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>In view of that report, it was, to say the least of it, somewhat unfortunate for the Minister to have chosen that analogy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister also dealt with horses and motor cars.  I think he would agree with me that a home&mdash;a shelter over one's self and one's family&mdash;is a necessity, and that however pleasant the possession of a horse or a motor car may be it is hardly a necessity in the same sense as a home is.  It seems to me to be stretching the analogy extraordinarily far to put the home in the same position as the horse.  I am glad to hear that it is considered that during the coming year we will have a discussion on this matter and have legislation fixing standards.  When that comes before us, no doubt we can discuss it and also discuss some of the implications of this motion in a more general way. The actual fixing of some sort of <Col N="475" /> standards is, I think, a matter that will be non-controversial, but I think that the purely aspect of the matter might be more profitably dealt with in this House than in the other House, where, perhaps, they could not be discussed on the same technical lines.</P>
    <P>With regard to what was said by various Senators who took part in the debate, I do not want to delay the House at this late hour by going into the matter as carefully as I might.  It may have been my own fault, and that I did not make myself clear in my opening statement, but it appears to me to be quite clear that the terms of this motion could not possibly, as Senator Ó Buachalla very correctly said, affect two of the three types of buildings.  It cannot affect public authorities, because public authorities do employ their own architects&mdash;we hope, not engineers, because the engineer has nothing to do with housing, and the person who employs an engineer is only wasting his money.  I think we should take the view of Senator Douglas, that if a person can afford to get a properly qualified man, then the only properly qualified man is an architect, but unfortunately an architect cannot tell what defects are there, once the building is completed. He would have to be there all along while the house was being erected before he could say whether there were certain defects or not.  It was particularly for that reason that I thought there should be an implied warranty.  So far also as the second-class was concerned, this motion could not possibly refer to them either.  The motion was intended to refer to the type of builder, commonly called the speculative builder.  Senator Foran said that that was only a passing phase, but these speculative builders will come again in the next few years, as a result of the shortage of houses. No matter what anybody may say to the contrary, we shall see the speculative builder again, and he would not <Col N="476" /> exist if it were not for the shortage of houses.</P>
    <P>It is particularly to deal with this case that I felt something of the nature indicated was necessary. Senator O'Reilly suggested, I think, that nobody had mentioned any plans for dealing with the matter.  I felt inclined at the time to interject to the Senator that it would be wiser for him not to make such a comment without being here the whole time to hear what had been said, because, at the beginning, I suggested that form of plan, and if the Senator had been in the House while I was speaking, he would have heard both forms, and it would be a little more courteous, I would suggest, not to assume that nobody had put forward a plan unless he were here all the time to make certain one had not done so.</P>
    <P>There is only one other point I would like to deal with to-night, and that is the point mentioned by Senator Sir John Keane.  I entirely agree with him that the question of licences and quotas is only a passing phase, but, equally, that should be related to the fact that that the speculative builder is the danger, as I see it, to the public in the immediate future.  If he is going to operate during that period of licensing, before building materials come into full supply again, then I feel the matter could be dealt with.</P>
    <P>However, as I said, I really put this motion down for discussion, not for the purpose of division.  If, in consequence of any discussion, it focuses attention on the fact that a person buying a new house, particularly in the forthcoming period is wise to get a competent qualified opinion before he buys it, then even that attention will have done much good.  I beg leave to withdraw the motion.</P>
    <P>Motion, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 9.30 p.m. until 3 p.m. on Wednesday, February 27th.</P>
