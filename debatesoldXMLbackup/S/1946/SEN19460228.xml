      <P>I have to announce that, in addition to the printed list of amendments circulated to this Bill, we received amendments from Senator Patrick J. O'Reilly to-day at 12.30 p.m. In view of the fact that there was only one day's notice, and that this is the last day for consideration of the Bill, I decided to have Senator O'Reilly's amendments circulated, but it is a question for the House now, in view of the short notice, whether they will be considered.</P>

      <P>I would like to know what exactly the position will be if these amendments are going to be accepted by the House.  Is acceptance of the proposal to consider them by the House to be taken as a precedent? We have rules and Standing Orders governing the conduct of business in the House, and, in giving voice to my own personal opinion in the matter, I would say that the House should stand by its Standing Orders.</P>

      <P>I raised this matter yesterday. It appeared to me to be opening up a very undesirable practice.  An interval of three weeks is allowed, after the Committee Stage of a Bill has been concluded, for the handing in of amendments for the Report Stage. Yesterday was fixed for the taking of the Report Stage of this Bill.  Members, as I say, had three weeks in which to submit their amendments.  I should add that 37 amendments were submitted for the Report Stage of the Bill, and the House spent practically the whole of yesterday considering them.  The House eventually decided that certain matters arising out of the discussion of the amendments yesterday, <Col N="618" /> after the Bill had been recommitted for the purpose of taking the amendments, gave rise to the needs for the submission of further amendments to-day; but it was not contemplated that any amendment of substance, other than an amendment which arose out of the discussions yesterday, would be submitted to-day.</P>
      <P>So far as I have been able to judge, the amendments submitted by the Minister to-day do directly arise out of the discussions yesterday, but the amendments which have just been circulated&mdash;I saw them for the first time about three minutes ago&mdash;raise new matter.  They are not proposals intended to clarify something that was doubtful, or remove some ambiguity or doubt.  They are amendments of substance which will require consideration, and which, in my opinion, would necessitate going into Committee again for the purpose of having them considered. I respectfully submit that they cannot be considered adequately unless the House again goes into Committee for that purpose.  I think that, in these circumstances, it would be a very unwise precedent to permit amendments of this kind to be moved on this stage of the Bill.</P>

      <P>I am very sorry indeed for troubling the House in this matter, but I think it will be agreed that the conditions which arose yesterday were rather unusual.  It is unusual to take the Report Stage of a Bill on the day after the Committee Stage has been finished.</P>

      <P>Personally, I was most anxious that this, the Final Stage of the Bill, should be postponed until, say, next week.  I was prepared to come here any time to consider it, because I consider that the suggestions I have to make are vital and important.  In regard to what Senator Duffy has said that they do not arise out of anything that occurred yesterday, I actually read one or two of the amendments yesterday, and asked the Minister to give them his consideration in the interval.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="619" /> They appear actually in the Official Report of the proceedings of yesterday. Now, I look upon this Bill as being one of the most important Bills that we have had before us for a long time.  It is a Bill that affects the lives of every man, woman and child in this country, and I am glad to be able to say that the Bill has been very much improved since it has reached this House.  I should like to know whether the amendments I have suggested can be discussed now.</P>

      <P>Ba chóir dúinn leanúint dar gcuid oibre de réir rialacha an Tíghe.  Níor chiallmhar an bheart dúinn tosaigh ar chead a thabhairt d'aon tSeanadóir leasaithe a thabhairt isteach ar an nós a tugadh na cinn seo atá i gceist isteach.  Bhí an Teach agus an tAire an-chúramach go bhfaghadh gach éinne neart ama an Bille seo a iniúchadh. D'aon-turas fuaireamar trí seachtaine le leasaithe a cheapadh agus a chur isteach.  Ba leor an t-achar sin dar liomsa.  Ní bhfuaireas na leasaithe seo go dtí go dtáinig mé isteach sa Teach.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>May I suggest, Sir, that this procedure of asking, on a certain day, whether or not an amendment can be discussed, is undesirable?  We had the Committee Stage of this Bill two or three weeks ago, and we had the Report Stage yesterday, although the Bill was recommitted in regard to certain amendments, but that was done by agreement of the House.  I suggest that if these particular amendments do not arise out of the proceedings yesterday, they are not in order, and if they are not in order, then the House cannot take a decision upon them.</P>

      <P>Yes, but the Senator did refer to it and promised an amendment.  However, in view of the fact that there is not general agreement on this matter, I am afraid that we shall have to proceed with the printed list.</P>
      <P>Government amendment No. 1:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In page 5, Section 2, in sub-section (1), to amend the definition of &ldquo;statutory tenant&rdquo; (inserted by the Seanad on recommittal) by inserting <Col N="621" /> after paragraph (b) a new paragraph as follows:</P>
    <P>(c) a person who retains possession of any controlled premises under sub-paragraph (iii) of paragraph (a), or under paragraph (b) of sub-section (5) of Section 40 of this Act, or&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>This is consequential on the amendment I brought in previously, and it has to do with amendment No. 6.  This is concerned with the definition section, and it brings in other sections.  I have another amendment later on which will make this necessary.  It is rather awkward, but the definition will have to be in Section 2.  Accordingly, if the House will agree to accept this now, I can deal with the matter better when we come to amendment No. 6.  Otherwise, I shall have to wait.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The main object of this amendment is to ensure that paragraph (a) of sub-section (3) of Section 40, as that paragraph has been amended in Committee by the Seanad, will not interfere with any right the tenant may have to sublet.  I undertook last night, after the discussion on this, to bring in an amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnOReilly" hpid="Mr. P.J. O'Reilly Mr. P.J. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid that there may be some misunderstanding <Col N="623" /> on the part of some members of the House as to what type of &ldquo;sum&rdquo; is contemplated in the section.  I think it was mentioned yesterday that the money is what is called key money. That is what is intended.  There is nothing, then, to prevent persons from subletting a premises provided that they do not take money for it.  The adjustment that I would make is that the original amendment proposed by Senator Kingsmill Moore be allowed to stand, but that after the word &ldquo;sum&rdquo; the following words be inserted, &ldquo;except a sum or sums asked for or received periodically in the form of lawful rent&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>If these words were added, it would make it perfectly plain that if the statutory tenant has rights otherwise, he would be entitled to sublet and take money for such subletting and the original intention would be upheld, that is, the intention of preventing people getting key money in respect of part of premises which they sublet. The section, as a whole, prevents people from receiving such sum, but there is a certain ambiguity about the word &ldquo;sum&rdquo;.  I suggest that if these words were added the section would be made perfectly clear and the original intention, which is an excellent one, would be upheld.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRyan" hpid="Mr. M.J. Ryan Mr. M.J. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid that Senator O'Reilly has not quite grasped the meaning of this amendment.  On the amendment which was proposed on the Committee Stage it was pointed out that such a provision would preclude a statutory tenant from subletting portion of his premises because, when subletting he would have to give possession.  The intention of this section as originally set out in the Bill was the same as that effected by a similar section in the early Rent Restrictions Acts, namely to prevent people from obtaining key money for the key of the whole premises.  But in order to enable a statutory tenant to sublet he must be in a position to give portion of his premises for subletting. It has been held in England, on the 1920 Rent Restrictions Act, according to a section similar to a section in our <Col N="624" /> 1923 Act, that a statutory tenant may lawfully sublet portion of his premises provided his contractual tenancy does not contain anything to prohibit subletting. So, in order to allow the law to remain as it is I suggested the amendment which the Minister accepted and which is now before the House. Senator O'Reilly would appear to think, assuming that the Minister's amendment is accepted, that something still remains in the sub-section which would prevent a landlord from receiving rent from his sub-tenant.  There is nothing in the section to preclude a landlord who has lawfully let portion of his premises from receiving rent; the sub-section merely deals with giving up possession, and when the words have been deleted the question of receiving rent for portion of the premises does not arise at all.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 6:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 22, Section 40, to insert at the end of the section a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(5) Where, on or after the operative date, controlled premises are lawfully assigned by the statutory tenant (in this sub-section referred to as the assignor), then, in the absence of any express agreement between the landlord and the assignee, the following provisions shall have effect:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  if the premises are, at the date of the assignment, being lawfully used wholly or in part for the purposes of any business, trade or profession, the assignee shall, from the said date, be deemed to hold the premises in accordance with whichever of the following subparagraphs is applicable:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(i)  in case evidence is forthcoming that the premises were, immediately before the creation <Col N="625" /> of the statutory tenancy therein, held by the contractual tenant thereof under a tenancy from year to year or for a term of years or other certain period (not being less than one year), or depending on the fall of a life or any other uncertain event, the assignee shall be deemed to hold the premises from the landlord under a tenancy from year to year, terminable, on or after the expiration of the first year thereof, by either party by three months' notice expiring on a gale day and, subject thereto, on the same terms and conditions as the assignor;</P>
    <P>(ii)  in case evidence is forthcoming that the premises were so held under a contract of tenancy to which sub-paragraph (i) of this paragraph does not relate, the assignee shall be deemed to hold the premises from the landlord under a contract of tenancy of like duration as the contract of tenancy under which they were so held, and, subject thereto, on the same terms and conditions as the assignor;</P>
    <P>(iii)  in any other case, the assignee shall be entitled to retain possession of the premises on the same terms and conditions as the assignor;</P>
    <P>(b)  if the premises are premises to which paragraph (a) of this sub-section does not relate, the assignee shall be entitled to retain possession of the premises on the same terms and conditions as the assignor.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>These are very elaborate provisions.  They are merely to secure that a person who gets a premises will not have better conditions than the original tenant had.  The provision is very elaborate and I am satisfied that the matter is very well covered.  Amendment No. 2 which we have passed, excludes a yearly tenancy subject to three months' notice from the provisions of the Bill.  When this amendment was drafted, three months' tenancies were included.  The three months in sub-paragraph (1), sixth line <Col N="626" /> of this amendment, was put in on the understanding that a person holding a yearly tenancy of which three months' notice had to be given was inside the Bill.  We have, as I have said, passed an amendment which excludes that type of tenancy and I, therefore, propose to substitute &ldquo;two months&rdquo; for &ldquo;three months&rdquo; in that provision.</P>

      <P>I think that I should be in order at this stage in expressing my gratitude to the Minister and the Minister's staff for the patience, care, courage and consideration which have been shown throughout debates on this exceedingly complicated Bill.  I have no doubt that the Bill is leaving this House a better measure than it came to it.  That could not have been possible had not the Minister and the Minister's staff given a very considerable amount of time to the task and been in a mood to consider every point put up from every side of the House.  The remark was made yesterday by a person who was listening to our proceedings that, for the first time, he had seen a legislative Assembly working as a real organism in which the Minister, the Civil Service and members of the House from different Parties seemed to be co-operating like the organs of one body towards a single end&mdash;that of producing a better Bill.  That is, I think, what the Seanad was for.  That is, I think, what the Seanad can be. The fact that we have co-operated in the production of this measure in that manner is due very largely to the way in which the Minister and his staff have been willing to put their time and attention at the disposal of members of this House in discussing in an unofficial way some of the difficulties which must arise on a technical Bill of this nature.  I am, probably, expressing the feeling of the House, as well as my own, when I make these remarks.</P>

      <P>If Senator Kingsmill Moore had not caught your eye before I did, I had intended to mention how gratifying it has been to the House and, especially to older members like myself, to see the spirit of cooperation that prevailed between the House and the Minister.  I have been in the House for many years and I <Col N="628" /> have never seen the House work under better, more harmonious or more useful conditions.  Personally, I do not like the principle of the Bill but I realise that one cannot always get what one likes.  I hope the Minister will be alive, in the interest of enterprise in the building industry, to the necessity for decontrolling the higher denomination of houses as soon as he considers it advisable to do so.</P>

      <P>I should like to make a few valedictory remarks about the policy implicit in this rent restriction legislation in the light of everything that has gone before, including the very valuable discussions we had in Committee.  May I join with other speakers in saying what I, too, had intended to say&mdash;how much we appreciate the attitude of the Minister to the House, his genial tolerance of suggestions from every side and his willingness to help in disentangling the scheme contained in a very difficult Bill. I hope it will not sound impertinent on my part if I also say that the Bill has profited considerably by the expert discussions that have taken place in which many Senators participated but, particularly, the legal fraternity whose presence in the House has greatly strengthened its deliberations.</P>
      <P>In spite of my admiration for the Minister and my feeling that the House has excelled itself in its treatment of this whole matter, I felt that I was making my best contribution on the other stages by sitting back in open-eared, if not open-mouthed, admiration for the talents of the Minister and my colleagues.  Nevertheless I had the feeling that the House was engaged in a kind of Sisyphus task.  Senators will remember that, in pagan mythology, a certain gentleman called Sisyphus was condemned, in the lower regions, to roll a stone up to the top of a hill.  The stone immediately it got there, commenced to roll back, so that he had to keep repeating the operation.  I admired the straining backs and creaking muscles of my Senatorial colleagues and the Minister in rolling that stone to the top of the hill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This policy of rent restrictions began about 30 years ago.  It is a British <Col N="629" /> policy, and the essence of it has been continued under our present régime, and the fact that it is not of Irish origin will, I hope, enable me and, I hope, the House, to consider it with a certain freedom of mind which might not be so easily available if it had been a policy of distinctly Irish origin.</P>
    <P>May we inquire, for a moment, what would have happened to rents and to the value of houses if there had never been any rent restrictions at any time during the past 30 years?  In the first place, rent would have risen very substantially in the years following the first Great War, and the value of houses would have risen very substantially, too, and there would have been no substantial difference between the market value of a house with vacant possession, and a house, subject to a tenancy, but there would have been a limit to that rise in the market value of houses and the rents of houses.</P>
    <P>That limit would have been defined by the cost of reproducing equivalent to housing accommodation under the conditions of price of materials and labour and so on, that prevailed in the inter-war period, and as soon as the older houses had risen to that level, then there would have been a balance between supply and demand, and house values would have settled down at whatever level was determined by that balance.  The fact that large profits were made by the owners of old houses and new houses would have stimulated new buildings, and, under conditions of private enterprise, this building would have flourished in a profitable atmosphere, and we would have had a continuous building of houses.</P>
    <P>Probably we would have had a less acute shortage of houses to-day than we have had in that event.  However, for various reasons, the régime of those days decided that that policy was a bit too strenuous for the community to tolerate and we had the restrictions of rent.  If we had no restriction of rents, the owners of existing houses would have made considerable windfall gains, so-called unearned increments, which would, of course, have aroused the envy of their fellow-citizens, but it might perhaps have <Col N="630" /> the effect that the builders would have gone on investing their money in building houses.  We might, in consequence, have had more money for housing if we had allowed a certain section of the community to get away with all windfall gains.</P>
    <P>But, the policy of rent restriction has not had the effect of abolishing the windfall gains of all owners of old houses.  It had the effect of confining gains to those landlords lucky enough to get vacant possession of their houses to enable them to sell them at a higher value with vacant possession. On the other hand, there arose a difference between the value of houses which were not subject to incumbrances. It became more advantageous for landlords no longer to let their houses, but to sell them, and there was a great increase in the number of houses for sale, compared with the number for renting, which tended to aggravate the problem of housing in another way.</P>
    <P>Another effect of the Rent Restrictions Act was to divide the windfall gain between the owners of old houses and the tenants occupying such houses, in cases where those houses were occupied by tenants who acquired statutory rights.  The rent restrictions legislation, in effect, gave two of the three &ldquo;f's&rdquo; to the tenants.  It gave them fair rent, or at all events, a rent defined by law, whether fair or not, and fixity of tenure, and I am not sure that it did not make it possible to acquire something in the nature of a saleable asset in the form of tenant right.</P>
    <P>It had the effect of transferring a substantial share in the totality of rights which constitutes ownership, from the landlord to the statutory tenant, and, in effect, it brought about a situation of dual ownership of houses rather similar to that which existed under the Land Act of 1881, which gave the tenants fair rent, free sale and fixity of tenure.</P>
    <P>This share of the windfall gain which went to the tenant under the rent restrictions legislation, was, in effect, money's worth and it was extremely difficult for the law, and I believe even impossible, to prevent that money's <Col N="631" /> worth from becoming money in certain indirect ways.  If you like, you can define the tenant's share of that windfall increase as the capitalised value of the difference between the controlled rent he was paying and the rent he would have to pay in a free market if there had been no control, or, more precisely, you can say the tenant's share of the windfall gain was the difference between the market value with vacant possession and the value of the house sold, subject to a controlled tenancy.</P>
    <P>With regard to the possibility of turning money's worth into money, I might mention an experience of my own in which, if I had known more about the law, I might have turned into actual hard cash.  In 1918, I succeeded to the tenancy of a small house in Ranelagh at a rent which a previous tenant had been paying, and was, doubtless, protected by the law.  The landlord offered to sell me the house for £400, and foolishly, I did not take him on.  Equally foolishly, about three years later, I left that house and the landlord proceeded to sell it for about £1,000.  If I had been wise, I would have bought the house in 1918 for £400, left it in 1921, and then sold it for £1,000.  In that way I could have turned into money this element of money's worth which is one form of gain, and which is partly transferred to the tenant under the operation of this rent restriction legislation.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect of this rent restriction business, and that is that it introduces a new element of uncertainty into the whole business of providing houses for renting purposes from the point of view of private enterprise. It is a common-place to say that every addition to the risk that is associated with any form of private enterprise causes an increase in the percentage return on capital which is necessary as a minimum income of inducement to move the spirit of private enterprise. All this rent restriction legislation operates to increase the risks associated with the enterprise of building houses for renting purposes, and, therefore, raises that minimum income of expectation which I have just referred to.  If the law goes further <Col N="632" /> than that and says that you may not receive more than 8 per cent. or 15 per cent., or any given percentage, in return for any given expenditure on alterations and improvements, and if the private enterpriser considers that that fixed maximum return is less than the amount necessary to move his spirit of private enterprise, then private enterprise will simply sit back and do nothing, and there will be a paralysis of that element in our economy on which we have hitherto relied for the increase of necessary wealth.</P>
    <P>At the moment, besides the additional risk incidental to the fact that the mailed fist of the law has come in to determine the relationships between house owners and house tenants, and has taken the place of the velvet glove of free contractual relationships, in addition to that, we have also the uncertainties which are part and parcel of the present situation in which the world finds itself.  Nobody knows what the future level of prices will be in the world as a whole or here in Ireland.  No one knows what the price of materials and labour concerned with the building of houses and the like is going to be in the course of the next two or three years, but, some people may quite legitimately suspect that, after a preliminary rise, there may be a fall, or that, after a disastrous inflation, which is also quite possible, there may be a disastrous collapse, so that the business enterpriser who contemplates investing his money in the building of houses may find that a house now costing, say £1,500, may very well be worth only £1,000 or £800 in five or six years' time if there should be as serious a collapse in prices as that which occurred in 1929 and 1921.</P>
    <P>I do not undertake to prophesy what will happen, but my hope is that it will be possible to stabilise prices at a level not very far from the present level or, possibly, somewhat below it, but you never can tell.  The business man will be justified in regarding this additional factor of uncertainty as a reason why he requires a higher percentage return on his capital.  He will require that his percentage return on <Col N="633" /> his capital in a new investment should be higher than it otherwise need be in order to move the spirit of private enterprise.</P>
    <P>Let me illustrate that point in relation to a small enterprise which I am contemplating at the moment myself. I have arranged to build a greenhouse. It will probably cost me about £25.  If I build it for my own use and amusement, I shall probably grow tomatoes in it.  From that point of view it does not matter a hoot whether it is worth £10 in three or four years' time, or £30.  Suppose I was building that greenhouse to rent to somebody else as an investment, and to draw income from it in the form of rent; under one of the sections of this Bill the maximum dividend, or interest, that I might receive from that investment would be £2 a year, or 8 per cent.  I might reckon that if I let it at the legal rent of £2 a year that after four years I would have got four sums of £2, but equally, after four years I might quite reasonably find that the whole house would be only worth about £15, in which case the element of depreciation would more than swallow up the whole return that I would get under this fixed maximum rate of interest.  In fact, I think nothing less than a rent of about £5 would induce me to consider renting the greenhouse on which I have just spent £25 at present prices.  That illustrates the present uncertainty that is hanging over all this kind of thing.  I think that the same principle operates in connection with the expenditure of capital on alterations and improvements of houses, as well as in the building of new houses.  That will tend to restrict the activity of the private enterpriser, because of the rigid limits put by law on the return that the private enterpriser may receive.</P>
    <P>So far I have been rather gloomy, pessimistic and destructive in my criticism.  I hope to end up on a more constructive note before I sit down. My feeling about this whole kind of legislation, and the control which it imposes, however necessary it may seem from some points of view, is that it is essentially negative, and creates perhaps more problems than it solves. If it kills private enterprise in one sector of our economy, among that class <Col N="634" /> of people who engage in private enterprise on a small scale in building houses for renting, if it has the effect of killing private enterprise in this important sector of our economy, then it is going to diminish the increase of wealth in the course of the next few years, and create a gap among our services and commodities, including the provision of housing accommodation.  It is going to intensify the danger of that inflationary situation which now threatens the whole world, for there is no sovereign remedy that I am aware of for that kind of inflationary situation except the most rapid possible increase in goods and services of all kinds.  To kill private enterprise is to create the danger of diminishing the production of goods in the next few years unless our economy is so Sovietised that public enterprise will replace private enterprise in the sphere vacated by the latter.  Unless this is so we may be in some danger, in our effort to safeguard the interests of the tenant, of throwing out the baby with the bath of water.</P>
    <P>I think that we must bear in mind that the policy involved in this Bill must be supplemented by some more positive policy, or else this whole process of rent restriction may do more harm than good.  I would have said a few weeks ago that the policy involved in this legislation had produced no alternative except that public enterprise should step in and undertake, as a social responsibility, the whole duty of providing houses for every class of the community.  Now that that duty is no longer going to be undertaken by the kind of private enterprise with which we have hitherto been familiar, there is perhaps a third alternative which may take the form of a kind of corporate private enterprise, a kind of large-scale organised private enterprise, different in scale and different in its economy and methods from the small scale operations of the builder who puts up two or three houses, and capable, therefore, of effecting considerable economies in the cost of the maintenance and repair of houses.  My ideas naturally travelled in that direction in consequence of having read in <Col N="635" /> the Press the report of a body known as Associated Properties, Ltd.  The Minister may probably be aware of that body.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephJohnston" hpid="Professor Johnston Professor Johnston">
      <NameTxt>Professor Johnston</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  However, I should like to put on record some of the contents of the report of that body. The report says:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Notwithstanding the very large increase in such items during the past ten years no tenants of the company have ever had their rents increased. They enjoy a compact house with two living rooms, three bedrooms, kitchenette, bath, etc., with garden plot front and rere.  Service for electric light, power and gas, at all inclusive rents ranging from 16/- to 23/6 per week.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The report goes on to say:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;On the liabilities side, issued and paid-up capital of £317,886 shows no change from last accounts. A full year's dividend on the 114,660 new preference shares issued on 8th October, 1944, is charged in the accounts for the year.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This body, I understand, owns about 1,000 houses in various suburbs in Dublin, all of which are let at rents of that kind, and they contemplate building more houses as soon as materials and labour are available.  Now, Deputy O'Connor, who is a director of the company also says:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Shareholders will no doubt be interested in the effect of the new Rent Restriction Bill.  There was never any danger that the income of this company would be reduced or affected in any way by reasons of rents being controlled.  The rents and conditions of tenancies are so much better than any other property owners could hope to provide, that there was no danger of reductions being made by reference to rents of comparable premises built since the <Col N="636" /> year 1919.  There has always been a keen demand for tenancies of our houses, and this fact alone is sufficient evidence of the favourable conditions offered by this company.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>So that, although I had thought at first that private enterprise had been killed stone dead by this legislation, still it would appear that in this kind of private enterprise they were able to pay a final dividend at the rate of 6 per cent. per annum, less tax, on the preference shares and a final dividend at the rate of 9 per cent. per annum, less tax, on the ordinary shares, on the capital invested, for the half-year ended 31st December, 1945, which was quite an attractive return on the capital invested.  Now, if I had any interest or any influence in advising the owners of existing property, let at rents, in cases where these owners are concerned only with one or two houses, I would say to them first of all to bear in mind the fact that under this Bill the owners of such property are being ground between the upper millstone of this rent restriction control and the lower millstone of rising costs of administration of property, with the result that in such neighbourhoods as, say, Fitzwilliam Street, net profits from rents are diminishing.</P>
    <P>I think that what such people should do is to get together and amalgamate their interests along the lines of the Associated Properties, Ltd.  I suggest that 100, or so, of these people should get together and form a company and sell their houses to that company, and set up a large-scale organisation to provide for keeping all these houses in the best possible way.  Of course, the owners would be paid for their houses not in money, but in shares; in that way, they would become shareholders in an amalgamated company and might obtain a reasonable return on the capital invested.  If you had, say, 100 houses concerned, there would be a capital of something like £500,000 involved, and various economies would arise from that, assuming that the people concerned had the necessary type of organisation and had the proper management to provide for the maintenance of their houses.  In that <Col N="637" /> way, they might widen the margin between the gross rent obtained from their property and the cost of administration and maintenance.</P>
    <P>There is also another case: that many houses may be carrying heavy mortgages.  I think that about 6 per cent. would be the interest on some of these mortgages, and it would be quite possible for a company of that kind to refinance these mortgages at a somewhat lower rate of interest.  Later on, when materials which cannot now be imported are available, that might provide the nucleus for the provision of new houses in the suburbs.  After all, a housing corporation or association, with £500,000 worth of house property let at a rent, would be in a very strong position to issue mortgage debentures for, say, £100,000, and in that way money would be forthcoming to provide new housing for the Marine Lake or Ballymun areas or elsewhere. In that connection I might say that there are various bodies, even including the trade unions, who cannot get more than 3 per cent., and if you had corporate bodies of the kind I have mentioned starting up all over the city you might get an organised demand for fresh loan capital, which would be a gilt-edged security to large-scale lenders, and which would lead to increased building activities on a financial basis.</P>
    <P>I have discussed that question with people of my own professional outlook and, so far as I can see, it sounds quite correct theoretically.  The only question is whether houseowners will react to the situation and endeavour to help themselves and the public generally to escape from some of the consequences of this rent restriction legislation, which has killed small-scale private enterprise in building houses for renting.</P>
    <P>I hope the State will do everything possible to encourage such development. For example, if the State would allow the sale of individual houses to private housing corporations free of stamp duty it would be a concession, or encouragement, to corporations of this kind.  In this connection I would remind the House and the Minister of the American proverb regarding the <Col N="638" /> proper relations between Government and private business.  It is that an ounce of public stimulus or encouragement should produce a ton of private enterprise and initiative.  I want to see the revival of private enterprise in some form and I think corporate private enterprise is the only possible form for this purpose.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not expect to speak at all at this stage, but I thought it might be unfair to the Minister if the eulogies which have been extended to him were confined to those who postulated the interests of the landlords during the passage of this Bill. I do not want to get into an argument with any of my colleagues here concerning the rights of landlord or tenants, but I think it must be obvious to any one who reads this Bill now after it has been amended, that two of the three Senators who have spoken before me made very good use of their time in considering this Bill. My only regret is that before the debate seemed to reach its conclusion Senator O'Reilly did not participate, because if he had carried his congratulations to the Minister I could imagine that when he had finished a lot of salt would have been rubbed into the wounds in the Minister's soul.  I would seriously suggest that when the Minister goes back to the Dáil with this Bill and asks it to accept the amendments inserted here, against my voice and vote, he should tell the Dáil, frankly, that a number of things have been done to the Bill which will weaken it from the point of view of the tenant. One of the things we did yesterday was to pass an amendment proposed by the Minister&mdash;amendment No. 16&mdash; which authorises a landlord to charge 15 per cent. in respect of any sums expended by him in excess of two-thirds of the basic rent of the premises during certain specified years.  That concession, he did not enjoy from the Dáil.  In addition to that the tenants of small premises, when the Bill left the Dáil, were entitled to go into the office of the clerk of the District Court and have their complaints listed and disposed of free of cost, but now this privilege is confined to premises erected after the 2nd April, 1919.  There <Col N="639" /> are a number of other amendments which have been inserted in the Bill which make it less unsatisfactory from the landlord's point of view.  Senator Sir John Keane said he would prefer that there would be no restrictions at all, but since restriction is inevitable, he accepts this Bill as the best of its kind from the landlord's point of view.</P>
      <P>I would like to ask these people who think that there should be no restriction in respect of rents, what is likely to happen in a market in which there is short supply without restriction on price?  Is it not obvious that if you take away this restriction on rent, if there is no fixing of rents, the sky will be the limit?  A certain poet one time visualised an earthly paradise somewhere east of Suez, where there were no Ten Commandments. I think you could have a similar paradise west of the Shannon or east of the Shannon if some of the boys who invest their spare cash in houses had their way.  Senator Johnston read a report from a particular concern of rather recent growth, which had a very small investment of public money but their assets were now something more than £500,000.  I do not want to be emphatic on this because I have not checked the figures but I think the total sum provided by the public was £175,000.  My recollection is that each house erected by the company was showing a net gain of £150, and I believe they erected about 1,500 houses.  That would give an accumulated profit of £225,000 or more. That was a satisfactory method of investment, but we have now guaranteed them that if they spend any money on improvements or repairs they are entitled, so far as this Bill is concerned, to charge 15 per cent. on that money spent on their own property.</P>

      <P>I do not think it is fair for the Senator to misrepresent the position in that way.  They can charge 15 per cent. on money spent in excess of a certain amount.  It is grossly unfair to suggest that they can charge 15 per cent. on all moneys spent on repairs, and I do not want that to get out.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am going to quote from the section so that there will be no mistake:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="640" />&ldquo;In the case of a landlord, during a period comprising the two years 1945 and 1946, or 1946 and 1947, or 1947 and 1948, or 1948 and 1949, or 1949 and 1950, expending an amount in excess of two-thirds of the basic rent of the premises in putting the premises into a reasonable state of repair, he will be entitled to a sum equal to 15 per cent. per annum on such excess or excesses of expenditure.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I am not going to argue whether that is a large sum or a small sum.  I am merely drawing attention to the fact of what we have written into this Bill in this House.  To some people this may seem a small sum; to others it may appear large but I merely refer to it as evidence of a tendency, evidence of the approach of this House to the problem confronting it.  One of the points made here by Senator Johnston at one stage of the Bill&mdash;he contradicted it later so that I am not sure which horse he is riding in this race &mdash;was that this procedure of rent-restriction was going to kill private enterprise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>I read a statement in yesterday's <i>Daily Mail</i> regarding what is happening in Great Britain and it is at least as likely that the present British Government will promote collective enterprise in building as the Irish Government will.  I do not know whether our present Government is Socialist or not.  It seems to me that it is Socialist&mdash; baptised in the waters of a totalitarian Jordan.  At all events, the Government of Great Britain clearly endeavours to promote public, as against private, enterprise in house-building. What is the result?  The <i>Daily Mail</i> said yesterday that private builders had made by far the bigger contribution to housing since the end of the war; they had erected 1,116 permanent houses on new sites in England and Wales, compared with the local authorities' achievement of 352. Seventy-six per cent. of the houses erected in Great Britain since the war have been erected by private enterprise <Col N="641" /> and 24 per cent. by public authorities.  There is no reason to think that legislation of this kind, which corresponds with legislation in Great Britain, will have a different effect here from what it has had in Great Britain.</P>
      <P>The figures quoted by Senator Johnston afford ample proof for the contention that big profits are being made out of housing and out of building houses for letting.  The concern with which he has dealt has been paying 9 per cent. on its ordinary shares. It made a flotation about 18 months or two years ago and issued its £1 shares at 26/-.  A considerable sum was involved&mdash;about £175,000.  The shares were bought up in 20 minutes or half an hour.</P>
      <P>I regret that the Bill has been altered in this House in a manner which will make it of less service to the poorer tenants, in particular, than it would have been as it came to the House.  I have no desire during these closing stages to hinder the progress of the Bill in any way.  The majority in this House are entitled to alter the Bill in any way they wish and they are entitled to get facilities for doing so.  I do, however, regret that we allowed a number of those amendments to go through yesterday and to-day without all the consideration they required. When we see the Bill printed, some members of this House may come to the conclusion that it contains provisions the significance of which they had not fully appreciated.</P>

If there were a competition between Senator Duffy and myself as to the number of amendments proposed, I should imagine that he would win.  I did put in amendments which I had taken over, more or less, second-hand.  I am sorry that I gave a certain amount of trouble to the Minister in so doing.  I have made up my mind that, no matter what advice I get or who gives it, it will, in future, have to meet my own approval before I submit an amendment in accordance with it.  Homer can nod on occasion and mistakes are made in places in which one would not expect them to be made.  Members of the House could help Ministers by being extremely careful in preparing and submitting amendments.  If that were done, we could reduce the number of amendments and give greater consideration to those put forward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At a very early stage of the proceedings&mdash;before Christmas&mdash;I dealt, more or less, with the philosophy of rent restriction and admitted that the Minister had to contend with untold difficulties.  He had to please quite a large number of people and, sometimes, no matter what he privately and personally thought would be the right thing to do, he had to make sacrifices so as to get the support of the great majority of the people.  This question of rent restrictions is a very delicate affair.  It affects the life of every man, woman and child in the country, and, therefore, the Minister must be very sensitive to public opinion.  I said something yesterday about the ideas we got from the West.  I also had to complain about some of those put forward by Senator Duffy.  I think that Irish public opinion has got to be moulded before any Minister will be able to put forward an ideal Rent Restrictions Bill.  The Minister cannot move too far in advance of public opinion, and public opinion must be trained and educated.  We must even <Col N="643" /> forget our selfish interests before we can form a true and unbiased judgment on the various elements of a Rent Restrictions Bill.</P>
    <P>Now, we worship, as it were, false gods, too often, and we do not know we are doing so.  Senator Duffy feels in his heart and soul he is worshipping the true God, such as that he advanced this evening.  Those who have been accused of advocating the landlords' interests may, too, in themselves, suffer from super-egotism and selfishness, and they may be wrong. The idea is to find the happy medium where we have to bear in mind that suffering must be undergone by both sides.</P>
    <P>Senator Duffy refers to English conditions, and, if I do not make a mistake, I think I am right in saying that we in this country have gone in advance of English laws in the matter of rent restrictions.  The question of consent being unreasonably withheld is covered in England by the requirement that the written consent of the landlord must be secured in the first instance.  So far as I know, the policy in England at the present time is expressed in the philosophy of the words &ldquo;without the written consent of the landlord&rdquo;.  Too often we interpret these words in one way, and one way only.</P>
    <P>If we look at the persons of the judiciary and trace up their history, we see they are part of the national history. There has been a struggle from time to time against people owning property.  There is a sort of natural bias in the direction of favouring tenants as against owners of property. That has been put in rather vulgar terms by saying: &ldquo;we are agin the Government&rdquo;.  We have to remember now that we have our own Government, and it is our duty to support it rather than to go against it.  I would suggest that Senator Duffy might look up how far we have gone and he will see that we are a little in advance of people outside, but while we have gone so far, public opinion regarding private property has got a very severe shaking.  It is my advice to the Minister that he should try to do <Col N="644" /> something to restore the confidence that has been lost since the Rent Restrictions Acts came into force.  I do not know how many houses Senator Duffy has&mdash;perhaps he would enlighten the House on that matter?</P>

      <P>I am trying to put the case for an equity which is, if you like, absolute and not based on references to some particular interest. Senator Duffy expressed regret that certain amendments were not accepted by the House.  I am pleased with some of the amendments that have been accepted and I think the Bill has been enormously improved here.  But there are one or two amendments with which I am dissatisfied, and it is my regret, and will always be my regret, that the House did not see its way to consider the amendment which I wished to put before it.  I endeavoured to cover one of the big clauses in the Bill, and I venture to tell the Minister and the House that the operations of the Bill in the near future will prove that to be a fault, and I would be surprised if the Minister has not to come to the House again to ask that the Bill be amended. <Col N="645" /> I do not intend to specify the particular faults I see, but, again, in conclusion, I wish to thank the Minister for the fine, tactful way in which he received the House, and I wish to thank him also for the amendments he accepted at my own particular request.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>It will probably be almost out of order not to start by thanking the Minister or praising the Minister, so much so, that he is probably getting a bit suspicious.  I do not propose to follow on that line.  Contrary to Senator Duffy, I think the Minister deserves a measure of credit that this Bill has been dealt with in this House very much as a Bill ought to be dealt with.  There has been very free discussion in which all members have taken part.  There has not been that show of power in which after the Minister says: &ldquo;I will not&rdquo; everybody jumped into the division lobby to follow what he has said.  In this case, there has been the feeling that if there was a consensus of opinion, as a result of discussion, it would probably lead to amendments in many cases.  I do not agree with Senator Duffy that there has not been adequate time for the consideration of this Bill.  We took the full time allowed to us under the Constitution, but the other reason why I rise to my feet on the Fifth Stage is because it seems to me that there seems to be a very prevalent view&mdash;it should not be here although it is, perhaps, understandable outside the House&mdash;a peculiar attitude with regard to the position of landlord and tenant. Let me say that it is my conviction that there are few things the country wants more than more landlords.  There is a gross and serious need for houses to let.  You can buy a house, but it is almost impossible to get a house to let.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>You want more landlords, whether they be individuals or companies or as Senator Duffy presumably wants it, the State.  Now, the State can be as exorbitant in its claims as we all know, as any individual landlord, and in its charges on the individual.  It seems to me that the man or company showing the initiative to build houses is doing just as much useful work for the community, if not more at the moment,, than any manufacturer endeavouring to <Col N="646" /> develop our national resources, or professor or politician, or auctioneer or builder, and is just as much a useful member of the community.  The sooner we get out of the old idea that it is a bad thing or a doubtful thing to be a landlord, the sooner we will get into a healthy state with regard to housing. Until we do that we should get further restrictions out of our heads.  It may be said that being a landlord myself I am expressing only a landlord's point of view.  But my attitude is in common with most other Senators.  The word landlord is not liked.</P>

      <P>I have no doubt that there may be some such title some day but, in the absence of sufficient knowledge of the Irish language, we must carry on with the old title while trying to get a different attitude towards it.  I think that rent restrictions are just as desirable, or undesirable, as any other type of price restriction.  It is justified when there is an acute shortage, but it is not nearly as good as a measure of competition.  Perhaps, it might be necessary if there were too many houses, but there are not too many houses at present.  During an emergency, it is justified&mdash;it is one of these things all parties have to accept. If you are not prepared to have some form of rent restriction, like price restrictions in an emergency, injustices may be inflicted on certain individuals, because there will be no balance, and too much money will flow in one direction to the detriment of another.  For that reason, I am not against rent restriction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some of the provisions of the present Bill are not the best, but I do not agree with Senator Duffy that the Bill is entirely bad, or that it will worsen the position of the poorer classes of tenants.  It is mainly for the poorer classes of tenants that you have rent restrictions in an emergency, but, in this case, it is needed in the public interest.  In conclusion, I would like to say that this Bill does not solve the housing problem; it may aggravate it. I hope the Government will not imagine that, having passed another <Col N="647" /> Rent Restrictions Act, which will last for five years, they have reached a position of providing houses to let in any way whatever.  The most they have done is to control what is an awkward situation due to the want of houses.</P>

      <P>Just from this side of the House I should like to join in praising the Minister for his great patience and industry in connection with this Bill, and also the very able staff he has around him.  The Minister saw from the start that all of us here who raised questions on the Bill did it for the purpose of improving the measure, and for that reason, I think, he was anxious to meet us as far as he could.  He did not meet me as far as I wanted him to go, but he met me to a certain extent, and for that I am very grateful.  I think when he took out of the restriction clause business houses, he has done a tremendous lot of good for the tenants of Ireland.  It is a very big improvement on the Acts passed by previous Legislatures, both in England and in this country.  I do not like to take up the time of the House, but I should like to join in saying that we are very grateful to him for the patience he has shown in attending to our suggestions.</P>

      <P>In the course of the discussion some members of the House <Col N="648" /> have said this is a good Bill.  Well, that point of view is, at any time, a subjective one.  A landlord may say a Bill is a good Bill if he finds something in it to his advantage.  A tenant may say it is a good Bill if he thinks he may gain something by it.  This is a type of measure which was first introduced during the 1914-1918 war in England.  The first Rent Restrictions Act was passed on the 23rd December, 1915.  It contained five sections and it was entitled an Act &ldquo;To restrict in connection with the present war the increase of the rent of small dwellinghouses and the increase of rate interest on and the calling in of securities on such dwellinghouses&rdquo;. It was an Act which was passed as a war emergency Act for the purpose of restricting the rent of small dwellinghouses.  It was also an Act which enabled persons to retain possession of these small dwellinghouses. So far as Ireland is concerned the Act applied only to houses not exceeding £26 poor law valuation. That Act of 1915 was the mustard seed of this legislation which has now grown to a very big tree.  The Act of 1923 passed by the Oireachtas contained 20 sections.  This Bill contains 59 sections.  The Act of 1915 provided that it should last for the length of that war, six months afterwards, no longer.  The Act of 1923, by Section 20, provided that it should last for three years.  This Bill provides that it shall expire on the 31st December, 1950. Out of that simple problem of endeavouring to prevent the dispossession of small tenants from their houses and preventing them being imposed upon by landlords in respect of increased rent, have grown a number of Acts.  Unfortunately, since then, in the course of this legislation, a number of people with interests have endeavoured to cash in.  That, of course, is not limited to this country.  It also exists in England, with the result that every Rent Restrictions Act that has been passed has presented an almost insuperable problem in its construction by the courts, and in carrying out whatever may have been the intentions of the Legislature. We have come, I say, to the end of a perfect day as far as the Seanad is <Col N="649" /> concerned, but we have not come, I would say, to the end of a perfect world.</P>
      <P>I have a feeling that this Bill contains provisions which are not altogether germane to rent restriction or the retention of possession of houses by tenants of the under-class.  Since the 1923 Act was passed, there has been passed here the Landlord and Tenant Act of 1931; and in the impatience of the Legislature for an amending Act to the Act of 1931 certain provisions of the 1931 Act have been included in this Bill, such as the right of the landlord to withhold consent to the assignment of a statutory tenancy.  This Bill provides that this consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.  That brings in some of the provisions of the Landlord and Tenant Act, 1931, with the result that there will be more overlapping in legislation as between this new Act and the Landlord and Tenant Act of 1931.  Now, I do agree that the manner in which this Bill has been treated by the Legislature is most satisfactory from a legislative point of view.  It is somewhat like the old Romans where the people assembled on the hill passed laws and everybody went away happy.  I have a feeling myself that within a short time anomalies will be detected but just at the present moment it is impossible to foresee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Natural legislation is not what I would call a slow and deliberate process. We have had what may be described as last-minute amendments, and these when introduced into a Bill may produce results which might be foreseen if more time were available. I think that, on the whole, a genuine effort is being made to bring the legislation up to date.  The task has been a very heavy one and, of course, a Rent Restrictions Bill now is not what it was in 1915.  At that time you had poor tenants and rich landlords.  At the present time you have rich tenants and poor landlords.  The tables have been turned socially upon the two classes, landlords and tenants, so that while in the earlier Acts the Legislature took the view that the landlords were well able to look after themselves, the position has now been reached in <Col N="650" /> which the tenants are better able to look after themselves than the landlords. Therefore the landlords require at least as much consideration from the Legislature as the tenant.</P>
    <P>When I hear Senator Duffy say that some amendments have been inserted in this Bill which make it a less valuable Bill, I understand that he means that some provisions have been inserted in the Bill in this House which will make the Bill when it becomes an Act, less favourable to the tenant than it was when it left the Dáil.  Even though it may be less favourable to the tenant, it may be more just as between landlord and tenant.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will explain that for me.  I am not here to expound the Bill.  That was really not my purpose in speaking, but I would simply say that the mere fact that the position of the landlord has been improved in this House does not necessarily mean that an injustice has been done to the tenant.  The same argument might be put forward by a landlord spokesman who feels that the tenant has got some advantage by some amendment in this House, but I think myself, speaking for people who have, so to speak, no axe to grind either as between landlord and tenant, that this House, as a whole, has taken what we may call a detached view of the Bill, and that the members of it have endeavoured, as best they could within the scope afforded to them by amendments or otherwise, to do justice as between landlord and tenant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a piece of legislation which interferes with what I may call the right of contract and the right of individuals, landlords and tenants, to enter into such agreements as they may think fit.  The Legislature controls such agreement.  It interferes with a certain amount of personal freedom, the freedom of contract, and while doing that it must always be careful that it does so for the common good <Col N="651" /> and in a manner that is fair and equitable as between the parties concerned. I think myself that the members of this House have had these purposes in view in their amendments to the Bill and that they have, according to their lights, done their best to do justice as between landlord and tenant.</P>
    <P>I trust that this Bill may, at some time, come to an end, and that the law of supply and demand will enable landlords and tenants to resume their contractual relations.  That, however, may be a far-off day.  Like the earlier Acts that were only to last for a few years, they have lasted for decades, this Bill may last longer than the five years set out in Section 1.  At all events, I am confident that, within a reasonable time, unless we have what may be described as an atomic war, landlords and tenants will get a chance of resuming their former contractual relationships, and that there will be a sufficient supply of houses to meet the needs of the population of the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I expressed appreciation yesterday of the manner in which the amendments introduced by me had been met.  Originally I had 12 amendments down for the Committee Stage, and the Minister met me with regard to ten of them.  I was not met as completely as I would have liked in regard to one or two of them, but then in this world we never get all that we expect.  I agree with Senator Douglas that this Bill was discussed in a very wise spirit.  Another Bill is to come before us, an amendment to a Principal Act, and in regard to which I would say that if the Principal Act had been discussed in the same manner as this Bill has been threshed out, there might not have been any necessity for the amending Bill.  However, that is a matter that we can deal with later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The point that I got up to deal with on this stage of the Bill relates to the question of the cost of repairs to houses that are controlled under this Bill.  That cost is mounting up day by day.  It is going to be very difficult for those people who own a large amount of property that is let to meet that <Col N="652" /> repair bill, even with the additions that have been put into the Bill.  These additions will meet the cost to some extent, but only fractionally.  Therefore, we must not fail to realise the fact that in this type of rent restriction that we must necessarily have for the general good, we are imposing special taxation on one particular class of persons, namely, those who own property for letting purposes.  I agree that, in the special circumstances that exist to-day, restriction is absolutely vital, but we should not lose sight of the fact that property-owners, in submitting to that restriction, are making a special contribution of their own, clear and above their ordinary taxation, in the effort that is designed to reduce the cost of living on those who cannot afford to bear it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say that, in my opinion, this Bill has been very greatly improved since it came to this House.  That has been largely due to the help that I have received from all sides of the House, and particularly from those who have most knowledge of the rent restrictions code.  Senators who are members of the legal profession have given me great help.  In the other House certain amendments were put in which had to be modified here. I think the changes made have improved the Bill.  Certain anomalies were shown to have been put into the Bill in the Dáil.  These would, I think, have led to some embarrassment if the Bill were enacted in that form.</P>
      <P>I think Senator Duffy must be dreaming if he thinks that I want to interfere with the right of anyone to take advantage of the cheap legal provision inserted by this House under Chapter III.  No such thing was done here. That was done in the other House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was no amendment dealing with that aspect of it at all; so the Senator must be thinking of what happened in the other House.  So far as I am concerned, I have no hesitation in going back to the Dáil and saying that as a result of the very long and very careful consideration given to the Bill in this House, they should reconsider the matter.  Surely, there is no other reason for Parliamentary <Col N="653" /> procedure unless we can deal with things in that way.  In both Houses we have done our best to improve this Bill, but, as Senator Ryan has said, perhaps there will still be something wrong found in the Bill, even after all our care.  I think that Senator Duffy actually objected to my accepting any amendments from this House &mdash; possibly, because his own amendments were not accepted.  In some other connection, the Senator suggested that although Deputy Dillon and myself were not friends, I was prepared to accept amendments from him.  Personally, I may say, that we are friends, and however we may differ on public matters, I am quite prepared to consider any good case that is put up to me; but, naturally, I cannot accept a case, when it is not even put before me.  However, as I have said, we have done our best with regard to this Bill in this House, and perhaps I might be permitted to refer to some of the improvements that have been made to the Bill in this House.  First of all, we have the case of the newly erected flats, and surely the provision that has been accepted here is in favour of the tenants of these newly constructed flats.  I think that Senators, as well as the rest of the country, will appreciate that that is an improvement. Another case is where houses have been let at very high rents, and provision is now being made to deal with that matter, as a result of proposals here in the Seanad.  Is not that an improvement? There is also the point that the court is enabled now to have regard to the 1914 rent in the case of Section 9 cases, and that concerns landlords as well as tenants.  Surely, it will not be contended that that is an improvement.  Then, again, Section 43 has been improved by safeguarding the right of a statutory tenant, who owns a business premises or a part thereof, to take advantage of what he thought he was entitled to but which, apparently, he was not entitled to.  I think that that is a big improvement.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of the right of a statutory tenant to assign his premises. That situation has also been improved.  Before this, consent might be unreasonably withheld to the assignment, but now that situation is improved. <Col N="654" /> At any rate, before the Bill came into this House, there were, undoubtedly, certain omissions, and as a result of our considerations here we have made many improvements and, in this particular case, I think that we have done away with the greater amount of hardship.  Accordingly, in all these ways we have improved the Bill.  I may say that I myself had the greatest reluctance&mdash;if it does Senator Duffy any good to hear it&mdash;in asking the Government to bring in emergency Orders or restrictions in regard to certain classes of houses, because we all know that all these restrictions tend to prevent or retard the building of houses, but because it came to my notice that there were cases of people being put out of their houses because of extortionate rents being demanded, and of other unfortunate people who undertook to pay rents which, obviously, they were unable to pay, I had to take this action.  Afterwards, we will ask the Government to bring in permanent legislation to deal with this matter, and not emergency legislation. It was for this reason that I took advantage of the opportunity to restrict the whole of the rent restrictions code, and I think that that will be a very distinct advantage, not alone for the legal people, but also for the ordinary owners and tenants of houses.  From all these points of view I think that, both in this House and the other House, we did a very good job.  We also took advantage of this Bill to deal with the poorer classes of people, who could not afford to pay legal expenses and who are frightened of going into court because of the possibility of their being stuck for costs and being left in as bad, or even a worse, position as if they had not got the rent reduced.  I wanted to bring in that class of people here, and I should like to point out to Senator Duffy that the way in which we have brought in that class of people was done in the Dáil and not in this House.  I should like Senator Duffy to remember that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but the fact is that I was quite satisfied that a certain type <Col N="655" /> of person might take advantage of this and, perhaps, might flood the courts with cases under the cheap system and, perhaps, elbow out people who might really need help. That is why I wanted to restrict the matter in regard to these people who lived in tenement houses&mdash;mostly the type of people who would come under the 1923 Act: the older type of houses.  We did not want to oppose cases coming before the tribunal.  At any rate, I may say that we are going to make trial of this and we hope that, if the situation is as bad as we have been led to believe, this will prove to be some advance on the present situation.  That is all I have to say, but I should like to say that I feel indebted to the Seanad for the way in which they have treated this Bill, and treated me, and I hope that in any other Bill that I may have the honour to introduce here, I will be treated in the same way. As a matter of fact, I may say that the same thing applied in connection with the Censorship of Publications Bill. Even if there were a little bit of heat engendered during the discussion of that Bill, still I must say that I was met by Senators in a very fair way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not have an opportunity of listening as fully as I should have wished to the Minister's speech last night.  Reading his remarks in the other House, he seemed to make the point that this was so much of an amending Bill, designed merely to ease administration and to oil the wheels of the machinery, that it was not a matter of very much importance.  I am afraid that I must take a very different view. I take the view that this Bill does affect a certain vital principle and that, to that extent, it must be regarded <Col N="656" /> as in the nature of a wolf in sheep's clothing.  It is, of course, a measure designed to ease the administration and to clear up difficulties which were, apparently, not foreseen when the Principal Bill&mdash;the Children's Allowances Act, 1944&mdash;was before the Oireachtas.  The Principal Bill did contain a specific provision in Section 19 under which the Minister was empowered to alter the effects of these sections by regulation over a period of 12 months.  There was considerable discussion on that section and the Minister made it clear that he felt it was necessary because the whole scheme of children's allowances and the machinery to operate it would be entirely new and things might arise which they did not then contemplate. Therefore, in Section 19, the Minister was given power, by Order, to alter the provisions.  I have searched and have failed to find any Order made by the Minister under that section.  I may be wrong but, if Orders were made under Section 19 of the Principal Act, altering the provisions, then it would have been more satisfactory if they had been brought to the notice of the other House and of this House.  If one is to judge by the amendments offered to this Bill in the other House, the task of removing difficulties in one particular respect was not regarded by the Minister and his Department as a simple one.  No less than three efforts were made to obtain a satisfactory amendment to Section 3 of the Principal Act&mdash;the amendment to which is now contained in Section 5 of this Bill.  Therefore, this section must receive rather considerable consideration here because under sub-section (3) it defines &ldquo;maintenance&rdquo; for the purposes of the Act in a very special way.  Briefly, the sub-section sets out the persons who are deemed to be &ldquo;maintaining&rdquo; a child.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the 1944 Bill&mdash;the Principal Act&mdash;was being introduced in the Dáil, the definition of maintenance was that the child lived with and was in the custody, care and control of the person claiming the allowance.  During the passage of the Bill&mdash;I cannot recall offhand at what stage, but I think it was in the other House&mdash;the definition was altered to that of &ldquo;normally residing&rdquo;, <Col N="657" /> and it was only after the Bill had first seen the light of day that the new definition was brought in.  I do not know why it was changed at that time. Perhaps the Minister will be able to tell us.</P>
    <P>What I want to say in respect of one of the points in this measure is a thing which one is always human enough to obtain a certain amount of pleasure from saying.  There are few things that give one as much pleasure as being able to say: &ldquo;I told you so.&rdquo;  I refer the Minister to the debate in this House on the Principal Act when it was a Bill.  The portion of the debate to which I wish to refer took place on the 26th January, 1944, Volume 28, No. 5, column 619.  I moved an amendment to the effect that, where a child normally resided with the father, but for reasons of health or convenience was not so residing, there would be an equal entitlement to claim in respect of that child.  It is somewhat gratifying to me to find that the Minister has now to come back to the Oireachtas, to obtain approval, in Section 5, for the principle which I wished him at that time to clarify by legislative enactment, which suggestion he would not accept.  I want to refer particularly to a few remarks made then by the Minister.  In column 621 he said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Senator asks us to pay these allowances to a family even though there may not be residing in the household of that family the requisite number of children.  Some of the children of that family may be living elsewhere, and there may be a contribution to their maintenance.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister is now asking the House to do what I asked him to do then.  I refer also, on the following page, to a final query put by me:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Would the Minister be prepared to accept the principle of my amendment in relation to a child sent down the country for health reasons?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister was not prepared, apparently, to accept that, because he said that the absence of the child would not affect the situation.  As I gather, from the necessity to introduce <Col N="658" /> this Bill, it has been found by interpretation of the Principal Act that absence does very materially affect the legal capacity of a person to draw the allowance.  If the amendment introduced in 1944 had been accepted, there is, at least, a strong probability that many of the difficulties which have, apparently, since arisen would never have arisen.  The Minister opposed the amendment then because he felt it would introduce a means test in respect of some households and that there would be investigation into family circumstances which it was desirable to avoid.  From the information given me, social workers are aware that such investigations have taken place already and, in some cases of which there is knowledge, allowances have been granted to persons who have alleged that contributions have been made, the qualifying conditions of my amendment&mdash;reasons of health or genuine convenience&mdash;not being present.</P>
    <P>The provisions of the Principal Act were very specific as to entitlement and qualification to draw the allowance, but that cannot be said of the present Bill.  The Minister stated in the Dáil that the underlying principle of the Principal Act, that the person with whom the children normally resided was entitled to claim an allowance, was not being altered, but, if that is so, I do not quite understand why the Minister found it necessary to state, in col. 1194, on the 20th of this month: &ldquo;The children will, as I explained, be deemed to reside with their parents.&rdquo;  That is not, I think, in the Bill, but it is going to be dealt with by regulation&mdash;a most undesirable practice with which it would be far better that someone more experienced in it, like my colleague, Senator Hayes, should deal.</P>
    <P>I should like to add that this Bill appears to me to be a further step in the direction of avoiding legislation in the Houses of the Oireachtas, and substituting legislation by Statutory Order.  In this particular case the Bill as it comes into this House provides for Statutory Orders, but I hope that when it leaves it, in view of the recent speech of the Taoiseach, it will <Col N="659" /> not be Statutory Rules and Orders which have not to be tabled.</P>
    <P>The Minister resisted an amendment in that regard on the Principal Act, but he did agree, somewhat grudgingly, I think, that amendments should provide that the twelve months' orders should be tabled while general orders would not be tabled.  I fail to see that when a Bill with such a wide scope and dealing with such wide principles is presented to us why Orders should not be tabled before the Oireachtas so that members can appreciate and understand what is happening.  I hope we shall deal with that matter at a later stage So far as this stage is concerned, I just wanted to mention two matters, and to add that the Bill appears to be one which, for those reasons, will require some considerable amendment before it leaves this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no very strong views on the matters raised by Senator Sweetman but there is one matter in this Bill on which I should like to obtain some enlightenment.  This is an amending Bill, and the Schedule sets out the amendments to the Act of 1944.  Section 9, sub-section (4) of the Act of 1944 is amended by the insertion in sub-paragraph (i) of paragraph (d), after the words, &ldquo;material respect,&rdquo; of the words &ldquo;or by reason of the wilful concealment of a material fact.&rdquo;  Section 12, sub-section (1), is amended by the insertion in paragraph (a), after the words &ldquo;material respect&rdquo; of the words &ldquo;or knowingly conceals any material facts.&rdquo;  When you refer to Section 12, as amended, you will read:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Every person&mdash;(a) who for the purpose of obtaining or continuing a children's allowance, either for himself or for any other person, or for the purpose of obtaining or continuing a children's allowance for himself or for any other person at a rate higher than that appropriate to the case, knowingly makes any statement or representation (whether written or oral) which is to his knowledge false or misleading in any material respect or knowingly conceals a material fact shall be <Col N="660" /> guilty of an offence under this section and shall be liable on summary conviction thereof to a fine not exceeding twenty-five pounds or to imprisonment to any term not exceeding three months.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The persons who will apply for children's allowances belong to all classes of the community, but it is safe to say that a considerable number of these applicants will be persons not highly educated, the ordinary people of the country, who may not know the meaning of a material fact, and who are liable to be imprisoned for knowingly concealing any material fact.</P>
    <P>This Act, the Children Act, 1944, is an Act which has been operated to a large extent by regulations.  It is more or less a kind of skeleton Act, and general regulations have been made by the Minister in respect of it.  One of them is contained in No. 137 of General Statutory Rules and Orders, 1944. These regulations contain in the schedule forms to be filled up by the applicant.  The applicants are asked to set out certain particulars and to answer certain questions.  In fact, one of the questions in Form No. 1 is: &ldquo;Are you an Irish citizen?  If the answer is no, give particulars of the addresses at which you have resided during the past two years.&rdquo;  That will scarcely arise, but in every case there is a specific question requiring a specific answer, and by answering it the applicant makes a statement.  His statement may be misrepresentation; it may be false or misleading.  He may make it, but I cannot see how any applicant can knowingly conceal a material fact.  How is the applicant to know what fact is material unless it is set out in the Act?</P>
    <P>This is not like, so to speak, insuring your life under a contract of insurance where you have to disclose everything &mdash;put all your cards on the table. Here, this Act is being operated, I should say, largely by question and answer, and I say there is no necessity for introducing this penal provision in the Bill.  It may be put in for what is called in law <i>in terrorem,</i> to intimidate certain people, but I think it is absolutely unnecessary, and in an amendment on the Committee Stage, I <Col N="661" /> will move to delete it from the Bill, unless the Minister puts forward some explanation why it has been inserted. It is a small point, but I think myself it is better omitted from a Bill of this sort, because under this Bill you have investigating officers and deciding officers.  You have a very considerable number of officers, indeed, and I think it ought to be possible to work the Bill without these drastic provisions.  In this case, I would like to hear what the Minister has to say as to why it has been introduced, and how is an applicant to know what is a material fact or how can he knowingly conceal what he knows nothing about?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to be very brief. I realise that the Children's Allowances Act presents very serious difficulties of administration.  The Minister made provision in the Act of 1944 to make regulations for a period of 12 months, but in spite of that, certain difficulties have been encountered making it necessary to have this amending Bill. That is no reflection on the Minister, but the type of amending Bill which he produces is a reflection in that it leaves so many things to be worked out by regulation.</P>
      <P>A certain amount of regulation must be regarded as inevitable, but this Bill goes very far.  Under Section 2, the Minister has power to prescribe different days for different purposes and different provision.  Under Section 3 he has power to prescribe certain dates for certain purposes, and under Section 5, which is the main section of the Bill, he may prescribe rules for determining where a qualified child normally resides.</P>
      <P>Section 5 amounts to this: that a person must have a child normally resident with him.  One would imagine that it would be possible to have that defined in the Bill, but the section provides that for the purpose of sub-section (1) of this section, the Minister may prescribe rules for determining with whom a qualified child normally resides.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unfortunately, I was not present when the Minister was opening the Second Stage, but I understand he did not state under what principle he is <Col N="662" /> going to decide with whom a child normally resides, and I do suggest that it should not be impossible to do it in the Bill, if it is possible to do it by regulation, so that a person who wants to know whether he is a person who is entitled to get a children's allowance should find it in one place.  If that cannot be done in one place, surely the Bill should contain the principle rather than leave the whole matter to be prescribed by regulation.  However, we can deal with that on the Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>It appears to me that the principle of the Bill is that the Minister can make regulations and shall not be empowered by principles or guiding rules laid down in the statute under which he makes the Order.  That is one point. The other is that if he does get the power to make regulations, then, most certainly, the regulations should be laid before both Houses under a provision the same as the one he accepted in Section 19 of the Principal Act giving him power to make changes in 12 months.  I would like to ask the House to consider an amendment in Committee providing that regulations made under this Act should be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas.  With regard to Senator Ryan's point, it can be dealt with in Committee. I must say, perhaps, in favour of the Minister, that in an experience of over 20 years of public life I have found people extraordinarily ingenious about not disclosing material facts.  I do not think there is anything unusual in this country to get a letter which fills you with sympathy and which, when you ask about it, you find has failed to disclose a material fact. We know that in this particular instance particularly, as Senator Ryan says, there is a schedule which says a form must be filled up.  Whether in filling up of a form some other penal clause should be put in I do not know. I do know that among the educated and uneducated classes there is an immense capacity for concealing material facts.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanRuane" hpid="Mr. S.T. Ruane Mr. S.T. Ruane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S.T. Ruane</NameTxt>
      <P>While I thoroughly agree with Senator Sweetman as to the Minister's attitude in refusing to <Col N="663" /> accept certain amendments put forward by him, the Bill, as it stood, gave an amount of trouble to the applicants in forwarding their claims, and in so far as these have been remedied in connection with this scheme I welcome this Bill.  It makes certainly for a simplification of the scheme and it removes provisions that deprived applicants from benefiting heretofore. Especially, the removal of the two to six qualifying periods will bring immense relief to a number of people. I know myself of several cases where there happened to be an addition to a family within a few days after the qualifying date and the people had to wait practically six months before the new arrival could come into benefit under the Act.  The removal of that particular section will remove quite a big flaw in the provision of children's allowances.  Then as to the qualifications of applicants, quite a number of people along the western seaboard are migratory labourers and they have to move over to England periodically to get employment there of the type they cannot get at home.  Because of these removals at certain times, the benefits that their families should enjoy were not enjoyed.</P>
      <P>That qualification has now been removed and children residing with their parents and other children residing with guardians, who are responsible for their maintenance, may in future be able to apply for the benefits this Bill provides.  I would like certainly to agree with Senator Hayes that these regulations which the Minister keeps to himself should be put before the House so that we may have an opportunity of discussing them before such power is given.  This Bill is an amending Act. The Act when first introduced was something new in the life of this country.  Naturally, experience teaches those that are administering the Act that flaws will occur from time to time.  It is better to remedy these flaws by an amending Act than to let them go on for an indefinite period.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass) Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>No regulations were made under Section 19 of the Principal <Col N="664" /> Act.  This Bill has been introduced, not so much for the purpose of removing difficulties encountered in the administration of the scheme, as to effect an improvement in the scheme which experience has shown to be possible.  I want it to be quite clear, however, that in so far as the improvement relates to the definition of &ldquo;qualified person&rdquo;, that the present practice is not quite as was assumed by Senator Sweetman and other Senators who followed him.  In the Principal Act, while the main condition to be met by the claimant was that of maintaining the child, in respect of whom he was claiming, the wording of the section was designed to make it clear, that proof of maintenance would be the fact that the children were residing with him.  It is not correct, as Senator Sweetman assumed, that children absent from the parental home on the qualifying date have been excluded in calculating the amount of the allowance payable or in determining the qualification of claimants for allowances.  They have been, in fact, included where they were normally resident with the parents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reason why it was desired to remove entirely the reference to maintenance and to rely entirely upon normal residence was because of the confusion that had been created by the use of the two terms and the conflicting claims submitted in respect of the same children where they were being maintained by one person while ordinarily resident with another&mdash; absent from the home in which they were normally resident on the qualifying date.  The amendments which Senator Sweetman sought to move on the main Bill in Committee were not practicable when the qualifying condition was maintenance.  If these amendments had been accepted in relation to the Bill as it then stood, it would have involved an examination of family circumstances and family means which it was desired not to undertake. The improvement which this Bill makes requires only one condition to be met by the applicant and removes most of the confusion or any risk of conflicting claims.  Perhaps, it is too much to say that the risk of conflicting <Col N="665" /> claims is removed entirely, but there will certainly be less difficulty in determining them,</P>
    <P>I am not sure what Senator Ryan's difficulty is in regard to the proposed amendment to Section 12.  It would be a material fact if, on the qualifying date, a child was resident in a reformatory. The Senator will, I am sure, see that that material fact could be concealed by the claimant when making a claim without any positive misstatement of fact.  I do not agree at all with the Senator that the fewer threats we have the better is legislation of this kind.  I think Senators well know that there are many people in this country who would never dream of defrauding a neighbour of half-a-crown, and yet would not have the slightest hesitation in defrauding the State of half-a-crown and are deterred from doing so only by the possibility of punishment.</P>
    <P>It is necessary, in order to ensure compliance with the details of legislation, that it should be understood that punishment will follow attempts to defraud. I doubt very much if it would be possible to secure compliance with the conditions which are necessary to be enforced in administering a scheme of this kind unless it were known that penalties could and would be imposed for non-compliance.</P>
    <P>During the discussions on this Bill in the Dáil, all the Deputies who spoke bore testimony to the sympathetic manner in which the scheme had been administered, and I think it is true to say that there has been no attempt whatever to interpret the provisions of the legislation to the detriment of claimants.  On the contrary, the aim has been to ensure that a children's allowance will be paid where there is a group of qualified children, even though there are abnormal features in the circumstances of the children's home, and wherever the legislation could be strained to authorise a payment that would not be altogether illegal, that has been done.  That is the reason why it is desirable that, instead of having set out in the Bill the regulations which will determine questions concerning where a child normally resides, it is proposed here that the <Col N="666" /> Minister should have power to make-the rules on which the deciding officers will work.</P>
    <P>I mentioned, in introducing the Bill, that the primary purpose behind the rules so framed would be to relate the children to their parents, to make the parent the qualified person, even though the children were not actually resident in his home on the qualifying date, provided that the family circumstances were such that they could beheld to be normally resident there: that is to say, that the link between the parents and the children had not been finally and permanently broken. Many hard cases will arise, however, and it is not very easy to make hard and fast rules now that will cover every possible case.  If we could make these hard and fast rules now, they would be inserted in the Bill, but it is because our experience has shown that if we are to deal with hard and unusual cases we must have a certain flexibility, that this device has been adopted.</P>
    <P>Precisely the same objections apply to the proposal that these rules should be framed in Orders and laid upon the Table of the House as apply to their incorporation in the body of the statute.  90 per cent. of the cases will be normal cases, with the parents living together and the children with the parents and in which the circumstances of the home will be easily ascertainable; but there will be a residue of cases where the conditions will be entirely abnormal: where the parents will be separated, not legally separated perhaps, and where the children will never have lived with their parents.  There will be the case of children without parents who will be resident with guardians who may or may not be relatives.  In every case we are ensuring that the Act is sympathetically administered, and where there is a group of qualified children together, the children's allowances will be given.</P>
    <P>You must give the Minister in charge of the scheme certain powers to make regulations.  If you are to tie him up with red tape you can do it, but the net effect will be to ensure that the administration of the scheme will be more rigid, and that people will not <Col N="667" /> get the allowance who otherwise might get it.  This objection on the part of some Senators of giving executive powers to Ministers to carry out the intentions of the Oireachtas, as expressed in legislation, is largely theoretical.  Ever since an octogenarian judge in England wrote a book on the subject, a whole lot of theorists have got that idea into their heads.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is functioning all right at the moment.  It may be of interest to the Seanad to know that, in the enforcement of the Act up to date, it has been necessary to institute prosecutions only in a very limited number of cases.  I think that the total number of prosecutions to date has been only 25, and when one considers the very large number of qualified persons, and the substantial number of persons who thought they were qualified and tried to sustain claims, that is a very small number indeed, and <Col N="668" /> indicates that prosecutions were not instituted except where serious and obvious offences were brought to light.</P>
      <P>The proposal, in Section 3, to fix different qualifying dates is, of course, a part of the scheme to enable the new method of grouping applicants to be adopted, and the net result will be beneficial to new applicants.  It will operate to the extent that, instead of two qualifying dates in each year, there will be six qualifying dates.  The power which is being taken in the Bill to vary the first payment period could not be subject to formal regulation as it will be used in individual cases.  In such cases, the matter will be decided by the deciding officers, as it would be a physical impossibility for the Minister to decide that for himself.  In the case of an individual moving from one place to another, the payment period will be made to terminate on the same day as every other claim in the same area, but the variation of the first payment period is an essential part of the whole device to facilitate new claimants coming into the scheme and to give facilities to people moving from one area to another.</P>

    <Title>Harbours Bill, 1945&mdash;Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass) Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a Bill to make better provision for the management, control, operation and development of harbours.  I feel sure it is not necessary to stress the need for ensuring that the management and control of our harbours is as efficient as it can be made.  Ports and harbours are an integral factor in the transport economy of the country.  They provide the links between land and sea routes for external trade and, to a smaller degree in this country, for internal coastwise communication.  The development of industry and commerce may influence the character of the facilities required at particular harbours, or may alter the relative importance of harbours, but it does not lessen the importance of harbour facilities to the State as a whole.  As good transport services are vital to the expansion of industry and commerce, the proper management and development of our harbours is essential, particularly in an island country such as this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senators will have noticed that this Bill, which deals with a special type of transport facilities, is unlike other Bills dealing with transport matters that we have had under discussion from time to time in so far as it does not propose any concentration of those facilities in large units.  It has come to be accepted in this country and elsewhere that undue competition in transport is not in the ultimate public interest and that the transport needs of the country can be served more efficiently and progressively <Col N="671" /> by concentrating transport facilities in large units.  Other Bills which we have had before the Oireachtas from time to time dealing with transport matters provided for such concentration but a different principle is being applied in respect of this legislation.  There is, I think, a substantial difference between transport services and harbour facilities. Harbour facilities are more akin to roads than to commercial transport businesses and it is not considered that centralisation is an effective means of securing greater efficiency or better service.  This Bill does not, therefore, propose to achieve any concentration of harbour facilities.</P>
    <P>The need for a reorganisation of harbour authorities and for a complete revision and codification of the law relating to harbours has, I think, been recognised for a long time.</P>
    <P>The knowledge of the state of confusion and mismanagement which existed in many harbour authorities led to the establishment in 1926, by resolution of both Houses of the Oireachtas of a Harbours Tribunal. That tribunal was set up following on the adoption of these resolutions by the Dáil and Seanad, and carried out a very full investigation into the state of the law relating to harbours and the practice of harbour authorities.  It visited all the principal harbours of the country and heard the evidence of commercial interests and of witnesses from various organisations concerned with the efficiency of the harbour facilities.</P>
    <P>The report of the tribunal was published in 1930 and during the course of the years between 1930 and 1940, it was examined in detail and decisions taken to prepare proposals for legislation to give effect to its recommendations. There was a very large number of old Acts which had to be considered, and a great deal of detailed matter to be taken into account.  The Bill now before the Seanad was, in fact, ready for introduction in 1940, but having regard to conditions then existing, and the general desire in these conditions to avoid unnecessary legislation, and having regard also to the difficulties <Col N="672" /> that would have been experienced in putting the Bill into operation in those conditions, it was not introduced until after the war had ended.</P>
    <P>The Ports and Harbours Tribunal to which I have referred found that the administrative control of the harbours of the country was regulated by a very large and unco-ordinated volume of legislation, both general Acts and local Acts, and that wide diversity existed as between one body and another in the character and extent of their powers and functions as well as in their constitution and make-up.</P>
    <P>The tribunal drew attention to the fact that no attempt had been made at any time to co-ordinate the activities of the various Acts, to assist or supervise their operation and development, or for the protection of the interests of the users of the ports and harbours. In their report they made two main recommendations.  The first was that the provisions of the various general Acts relating to harbours should be replaced by a general consolidating Act embodying in modern form such of the existing statutory provisions as experience had shown to be valuable and desirable.</P>
    <P>The second main recommendation was that the Department of Industry and Commerce should be given the general oversight of harbour administration and be placed, as regards harbours, in much the same position as that occupied by the Department of Local Government in relation to local authorities.  The tribunal further proposed the adoption of a fresh policy based upon its suggestions and recommendations to the end that the various harbour undertakings might, under the general guidance of the Department of Industry and Commerce, be brought to the highest level of efficiency in the interest of the trade and commerce of the State.</P>
    <P>The Bill, as drafted, gave precise effect to all the main recommendations of the tribunal.  Any departure there was from the recommendations of the tribunal was on matters of minor detail only.  The procedure adopted was to base the Bill on the tribunal's recommendations and to bring it to <Col N="673" /> the Dáil in that form.  It received a Second Reading in the Dáil and was then circulated to all harbour bodies in the country and other bodies interested in harbour facilities which were asked to submit any observations they had, and to make suggestions on the provisions of the Bill for such changes and additions as they considered necessary.</P>
    <P>A very large number of suggested amendments was received from these harbour authorities and other bodies, and they were very closely examined, and such of them as appeared to involve an improvement of the Bill without departure from the main principles laid down by the Ports and Harbours Tribunal were adopted and embodied in the Bill by amendments moved on the Committee Stage of the Bill in the Dáil.</P>
    <P>The Bill, as it comes to the Seanad. embodies, therefore, not merely the recommendations of the Ports and Harbours Tribunal but also the modification of these recommendations which the harbour authorities themselves proposed and which were adopted by the Government and by the Dáil after the Bill had been first circulated.  The Bill applies to the four principal harbours, Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Waterford and to 21 other specified harbours.  All the harbours governed by the Bill are those mentioned in the terms of reference of the tribunal, except the harbour at Buncrana which developed into an important port subsequent to the establishment of the tribunal, and consequential on the expenditure of a large sum of money on the development of that harbour.</P>
    <P>The Bill does not apply to the State harbours administered by the Office of Public Works or to harbours under the management and care of county councils or railway companies.</P>
    <P>The harbours are grouped into two classes&mdash;the four main harbours, and the 21 secondary harbours.  There is, however, provision in the Bill by which a harbour may be moved from one class to another by Ministerial Order, or a new harbour included in either class, if the development of its trade and the <Col N="674" /> expansion of the facilities provided there, justify such inclusion.</P>
    <P>It will be understood that in the course of time, some harbours will gain in importance, others will lose in importance, and there is power to change the status of a harbour following such changes under the Bill as drafted.  The provisions of the Bill apply equally to all the specified harbours, with the exception, that the harbour authorities for the four principal harbours are comprised of a larger and more diversified membership, and each of them is required to have a general manager, and to promote a superannuation scheme for the benefit of officers and established staff.  The provisions of the Bill which relate to the reconstitution of the harbour authorities, and the provisions which relate to the general procedure of harbour authorities and the removal from office of members of harbour authorities for stated reasons, will come into operation on a day in an appointed year.  The Bill provides that it need not be the same day for each authority.  All the other provisions of the Bill will take effect as from the date upon which the measure is enacted.</P>
    <P>I assume it is not necessary to elaborate the case for the reconstitution of harbour authorities.  As Senators will be aware, many of the existing harbour authorities are constituted in a manner which is not only obsolete and inconsistent with democratic principles but one which does not make for efficient management.  There is at present, as I have mentioned, considerable diversity, and each harbour board is constituted on a basis peculiar to itself. At Cork, the harbour commissioners are largely composed of members appointed by the Cork Corporation.</P>
    <P>At Foynes the harbour commissioners co-opt their successors and at certain harbours, provisions for the appointment of commissioners have become obsolete and vacancies exist which cannot be filled until the existing legislation is amended.  The number of the members of harbour authorities varies from as few as seven in some cases, to as many as 37 in another.  The system of election of harbour boards has, in practice, been largely one of co-option and nomination of representatives <Col N="675" /> of those firms and shipping companies which were actively interested as users of the harbour.  In many cases the harbour authorities have come to be regarded as closed corporations.</P>
    <P>The principle of election is not followed generally.  There were in fact no contested elections at Dublin or at Sligo for many years before the emergency.  At Dundalk, a contested election is exceptional, and in the case of that harbour, at an election held in 1944 only eight persons voted out of an electorate of 500.  There has been, it must be confessed, a regrettable lack of public interest in matters affecting harbour authorities on the part of the community.  The fact that the public are not directly rated or taxed for the upkeep of harbours may account, to some extent, for the lack of interest.  The fact that the public do not pay directly through rates and taxes for harbour maintenance is not, however, a measure of their interest in the efficiency with which harbours are conducted, and the adequacy of the facilities provided, because as producers and consumers, they are very much affected by the cost of moving goods through these harbours and ports.  They may not pay directly through rates and taxes, but they certainly do pay indirectly, in the price of commodities, for the upkeep of the harbours, although it is not apparent that they realise the full extent to which they contribute to them.</P>
    <P>The general scheme now proposed recognises that the management of ports and harbours is largely a matter for local bodies.  I do not mean local government bodies.  I mean bodies constituted on a local basis.  It is intended that the new harbour authorities should be representative of the classes of persons and the interests which are directly concerned in the use of the undertaking.</P>
    <P>It is desirable that each authority should comprise a reasonably compact membership to facilitate the expeditious discharge of business, and, at the same time, be not too unwieldy.  It is proposed, therefore, in the Bill, that the harbour authorities, when reconstituted, will have as membership: <Col N="676" /> in the case of Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Waterford a total of 23, divided as to five to be appointed by the corporation (in the case of Cork, one of those to be appointed as a local representative will be so appointed by the Cobh Urban District Council); four of the 23 members will be appointed by the chambers of commerce, two each will be appointed by the Federation of Irish Manufacturers, organisations of live-stock traders, and an organisation representative of labour interests.  Four members are to be elected by persons who pay tonnage rates of £20 or more, and four are to be nominated by the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  The tribunal recommended that, in addition to securing representation on harbour boards for various local interests, the Minister for Industry and Commerce should have the power to make direct nominations.  The reason why that power was given to the Minister was to ensure that any local interest that should be represented on a harbour authority and did not secure that representation through any of the other nominating bodies, could nevertheless be appointed thereon by the Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>
    <P>In the case of Galway Harbour, and some other smaller harbours, where the Minister has that power of nomination now, the importance of it has become self-evident.  In some cases, the persons most concerned with the trade of the harbour and the use of the harbour do not secure representation on the harbour board through the local body or other nominating authority, and obtain it only by Ministerial nomination. It is, I think, a desirable procedure. Certainly, my experience in the exercise of the power which I now have in relation to some harbour authorities, would appear to suggest that the power of direct Ministerial nomination is highly desirable.  In the case of the smaller harbours it is proposed that the total membership of the harbour authorities should be substantially smaller, consisting of nine or 11 members; 11 members where a chamber of commerce exists, and nine, where there is no chamber of commerce.</P>
    <P>In the case of these harbours, it is <Col N="677" /> proposed that four of the members will be appointed by the local authorities (there may be two local authorities concerned); two by the members of the chamber of commerce where such exists, two to be elected by persons paying tonnage rates, and three to be nominated by the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  The Bill provides in respect of these smaller harbours that the Minister in exercising his power of nomination must include, among the three persons placed on the harbour authority by him, one at least who will be representative of Labour interests.  One or two additional local authority members may also be appointed in certain circumstances when a local authority renders financial assistance to a harbour authority, and that local authority is not already an appointing body.  The continuity of an existing harbour authority is not affected by the change of membership, nor is the position regarding property, liabilities, mortgages, stock, contracts or agreements altered.  The general aim is to constitute harbour authorities in such a way that there will be a balanced representation of the various interests concerned in the development and management of each port.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned that the tribunal proposed that the Minister for Industry and Commerce should be given a general oversight of harbour administration. One recommendation was that the officers of the Department should have the right of attendance at harbour meetings, but on consideration I decided that it was neither necessary nor desirable that that course should be followed, and consequently the Bill does not provide for such powers.  The Bill provides that the Minister can remove from office members of a harbour authority on stated grounds: if they refuse or neglect to comply with statutory requirements or are found, after the holding of an inquiry, to have failed in the discharge of their statutory duties.  Provision is made in the Bill for the holding of a local inquiry into the performance by harbour authorities of their powers, functions and duties and into a variety of matters such as harbour finance, borrowing, the conditions of the harbour, <Col N="678" /> the rates charged and the accommodation and facilities provided.  It will be understood that the power given for the holding of a local inquiry is an important one for commercial interests. It is frequently alleged that the management of a harbour is operated to give an advantage to some commercial interest to the detriment of others.  Many provisions in the Bill are framed in order to ensure that such special advantage cannot be improperly granted, that everybody shall have the same rights to use the harbour facilities, and that in every respect the administration of the harbours cannot be subordinated to private commercial interests.</P>
    <P>Provision is made for the continuity in office of existing officers and servants.  As certain positions fall vacant they will be filled through the Local Appointments Commission.  I have mentioned that the four principal harbours will each be required to have a general manager.  There are, as some Senators know, already general managers at Cork and Waterford.  The Dublin Port and Docks Board has decided to appoint a general manager. The position has been advertised, and is at present being filled through the machinery of the Local Appointments Commission.  The four principal harbours will be required to submit a superannuation scheme for their officers and established staff within two years of the date of the enactment of this measure.  In the case of the smaller harbours it is not considered practicable to impose upon them the obligation to have superannuation schemes, because the institution of a superannuation scheme assumes continuity of revenue which may not be in fact realised in the case of some of those smaller harbours.  What the Bill proposes, in relation to the smaller harbours, is that they may establish superannuation schemes for their staff with the consent of the Minister, where the Minister is satisfied that the prospects of the future harbour revenues are such as would justify such a course.</P>
    <P>Under the existing system of legislation a special Act or provisional Order under the General Pier and Harbour <Col N="679" /> Acts is necessary to create a new harbour authority to revise the constitution of existing harbour authorities, to authorise the construction of new works, or to provide additional borrowing powers.  The number of Acts has multiplied and the statutory provision has grown more complex.  I am sure that many Senators will remember a number of these Acts coming along from time to time confirming provisional Orders made under the General Pier and Harbour Acts. A number of them dealt with quite unimportant matters.  At present a number of harbours have exhausted their borrowing powers and require extensions to enable them to proceed with urgent works of reconstruction. Without statutory sanction, they are unable to borrow or to proceed with the new works.  Cork is an example of that position.  If separate enactments had to be obtained by each of the harbours requiring special powers within the next few years there would be a multitude of private Bills, and a quite considerable expenditure for the individual harbour authorities concerned. This Bill obviates a great deal of that unnecessary legislation. It provides that the Minister for Industry and Commerce may authorise a harbour authority to construct works or acquire land compulsorily.  He may fix or vary the limits of a harbour, transfer a harbour to a local authority, or transfer to the management of a harbour authority any specified port or pier.  If compulsory acquisition of land arises on a large scale, and in the case of the transfer of a harbour to a local authority, or the transfer of a port or pier to a harbour authority, or an alteration in the harbour limits, the matter must be brought specifically before the Oireachtas, and provision is made to that effect in the Bill.  A survey may be made of the intended site of any works which a harbour authority proposes to construct.  Completed works and works in course of construction may also be included within the provision designed to ensure that proposed works of an extensive nature are sound from an engineering point of view.</P>
    <P>Hitherto, when moneys were required <Col N="680" /> for capital works they have usually been borrowed on mortgage on the security of the harbour revenues. When the borrowing did not exceed £100,000 and was for the purpose of financing new works, sanction could be obtained by means of a provisional Order.  The maximum limit was set in the relevant section of the special Act or provisional Order, and in many cases the borrowings were earmarked for specific purposes.  The Bill provides a general power to borrow with the consent of the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  The consent of the Minister for Finance is also required where the borrowings are large, that is to say over £200,000 in the case of Dublin, and over £50,000 in the case of other harbours.</P>
    <P>The tribunal made certain recommendations in regard to the method of granting financial assistance to harbour authorities.  They recommended that State assistance should be made available for schemes which the harbours were unable to finance out of their own resources, and that when such approved schemes are not of national importance that the State contribution should be conditional on a contribution from the local authority.  They considered that when State aid was given it should be by way of loan or by guaranteeing loans raised by the harbour authorities concerned.  In the past local authorities have only been empowered to assist harbour undertakings when a loan from the Local Loans Fund was concerned.  The assistance given by local authorities for essential harbour maintenance during the past few years was authorised only by an Emergency Powers Order made under the Emergency Powers Acts. This Bill proposes that a local authority, with the consent of the Minister for Local Government, may assist a harbour undertaking by a contribution or guarantee, or may themselves raise a loan where the harbour authority is unable to do so.  The supervisory power given to the Minister for Local Government and Public Health is considered desirable for the purpose of ensuring that local authorities will not unduly burden themselves with heavy financial commitments.</P>
    <P>In the past, the only methods open <Col N="681" /> to harbour authorities to obtain financial help from the State were in the form of loans from the Local Loans Fund, administered by the Office of Public Works, which loans normally required a guarantee from the local authority; or by grants from the Special Employment Schemes Office, or from the Employment and Emergency Schemes Vote, the grant in such cases being conditional upon the prevailing unemployment conditions in the harbour area; or by occasional grants made on the recommendation of the Minister for Agriculture for the dredging of fishery harbours, or by loans for work of a capital nature guaranteed under the Trade Loans (Guarantee) Acts or, during these last few years of the emergency, by grants administered by the Department of Industry and Commerce towards the cost of essential maintenance.</P>
    <P>The position is that, heretofore, the State has not accepted the position of having any obligation to assist financially in harbour development.  It has now been decided as a matter of policy, however, that State aid should be made available for the purpose of harbour development in cases where harbour revenues would be unable to support the necessary borrowing.  It is intended, however, that the assistance will be given subject to the conditions recommended by the Ports and Harbours Tribunal.  These conditions were, first, that in the case of harbours primarily of local interest, assistance should be forthcoming from local authorities in the areas concerned, and, secondly, that the expenditure would be likely to result in a perceptible reduction of freights and costs of handling goods or would be likely to confer other benefits on the community such as providing supplies at lower prices and enabling exports to be forwarded more cheaply and expeditiously. In all cases it is intended that the supervision of the engineering aspect of schemes for which State aid is provided will be entrusted to the Office of Public Works.</P>
    <P>During the emergency, as Senators will know, a number of the smaller harbours have suffered considerable losses and have accumulated arrears of <Col N="682" /> maintenance.  It has been decided to make special provision in such cases during the next five or six years.  The harbour authorities will, however, be expected to show that their incapacity to meet the situation which has arisen was not due to lack of economic management and that the expenditure would be likely to result in the revival of trade at the port and confer benefits on the community of the nature referred to in the tribunal's report. Assistance by local authorities will be required in all such cases.  There are a large number of miscellaneous provisions in the Bill which it is hardly necessary to refer to at this stage. There are, however, a few which I think I should mention.  The Bill unifies a lot of the existing mass of legislation in regard to management, control and operation of harbours, and that legislation is made of general application. A harbour authority may be required to submit proposals for the dredging of their harbour and may be required to have the dredging carried out in a specified manner.  Harbour authorities are empowered to provide facilities for aircraft and to make charges for such facilities.  With regard to charging powers, the existing maximum rates are preserved until varied by a harbour rates authority.  Uniform powers are provided in relation to the charging of tonnage, goods and service rates.  The Bill provides that rates are to be charged equally on all persons, and harbour facilities are to be available equally on payment of appropriate rates.  The lists of rates must be open for inspection.  These provisions are in the main a codification of existing legislation.</P>
    <P>There is a provision in the Bill which is new in harbour legislation in this country, and which empowers a harbour authority to take steps to improve the conditions of casual employment of dock workers by introducing a system of registration of workers and by confining employment to registered workers.  I had some doubts, and still have some doubts, about giving that power to harbour authorities, because I think that in so far as it is desirable to confine employment to registered workers, the obligation should rest more directly on the employers of <Col N="683" /> dock labour and on the trade unions concerned, rather than on the harbour authorities, to take the necessary steps. In fact, I have caused an inquiry to be made into the general question of the de-casualisation of dock labour along the lines of what has been proposed in recent British legislation.  I cannot say what that will result in, but at any rate I decided to leave this section in the Bill, even though a port authority might not take any action under it.  I do not think the section will do any particular good so far as the larger harbours are concerned, but in the case of smaller harbours the harbour authority may be the only organisation in the position to take action.</P>
    <P>Under the Bill nine general Harbour Acts will cease to apply to the specified harbour authorities, and over 100 private Acts and provisional Orders will cease to have effect in so far as they are inconsistent with the new legislation.  The Bill is not one which lends itself easily to discussion of principles at this stage.  The main discussion in the Dáil was on the Committee Stage and, in fact, it was necessary to have a recommittal on Report Stage. Many of the members of the Dáil were members of harbour authorities and, naturally, were very interested in the Bill.  For that reason, I think that Senators also will find that discussion of this Bill will be more useful on the Committee Stage rather than on Second Reading.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the last remarks of the Minister, that this is not a Bill on which time can be usefully spent on its Second Stage.  In so far as it aims at or endeavours to improve the administration of harbours and harbour board authorities, I think that the Bill would be non-controversial, and in the case of a Bill of that kind I think it would be agreed that it is not desirable to have much discussion on the Second Stage.  However, I have one strong objection to make to the Bill, and I should like to state it now.  The Minister may hold my views to be somewhat Victorian, but I think that it is a bad principle for the Minister to be able to nominate <Col N="684" /> his own representatives on a board which he has power to abolish.  The Minister can nominate a certain number of members to the board, and if they fail to make their appointments or elections, the Minister has power to nominate other representatives.  I see no particular objection there, but in this case the Minister is seeking power to nominate representatives not for himself but for other people.  As regards the four members he selects himself, he may or may not, so far as the Bill is concerned, appoint persons who are his representatives, or persons who, he may think, represent additional interests.  If it is intended that these four representatives, in the case of the larger harbours, are to be representatives of interests which failed to get representation, I think that the Minister should say so and, when he nominates those four, state what interest he considers they represent.  That would make it clear that they were not his representatives and, when attending meetings of the harbour authority, that they were not speaking on his behalf.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the power to abolish the board after inquiry is concerned, I gather from the memorandum that that power has been taken on the theory that the Minister should have the same powers as the Minister for Local Government.  We may, therefore, assume that such powers will be exercised in much the same way as they are exercised by the Minister for Local Government.  I am glad to say that this Bill places some limitation on that exercise but not quite so much as should be placed on it.  My view is that a local authority, whether a harbour authority or other, which is elected or partially elected, should be abolished only after a public inquiry and after the person holding that inquiry has made a public report.  My reason for saying that is that the persons who elected the body which, it is alleged, failed to carry out its duty and which is abolished by the Minister concerned, should be able to see the report made by the responsible person who held the inquiry so that, when they are called upon at some future date to elect the authority again, they will be able to use their <Col N="685" /> judgment as to whether they should elect the persons concerned or not. The local body may be abolished by the Minister after a secret inquiry or after an inquiry which is partly public and partly secret or which is entirely public.  The report made as a result of the inquiry may or may not be published so far as this Bill is concerned. In view of the reference to the Department of Local Government in the memorandum, I assume that, in pursuance of present policy, it would not be published.  That may mean that when the new body comes to be elected, some people will be inclined to re-elect a whole body to spite the Minister, if they do not like him, or to reject the whole body, if they want to support him.  An electorate which consists of chambers of commerce, the Federation of Irish Manufacturers, representatives of labour and others of that type should be told why the person who held the inquiry recommended the abolition of the authority. I think that you could count on the electors, when called upon to elect a new body, refusing to elect the former members if the facts were known to them.</P>
    <P>Under this Bill, the Minister must, in varying periods up to three years, arrange for the election of another body.  That is good so far as it goes. But, in my opinion, a year would be quite sufficient.  If it is intended to have local authorities controlling the harbours and if such an authority is abolished, the electors should have an opportunity within a year of appointing another body.  The object of the abolition is not to introduce government by commissioner but for the purpose of getting an efficient local body. The provision in connection with local government by which a body may be almost indefinitely abolished is bad.  I am glad that, in this case, a definite limit has been introduced and that a new harbour authority will be elected within a certain period.  But for those principles, which I think are bad but which are more or less consistent with the general tendency at present, the Bill, particularly as amended, is, I think, a good Bill and one which the House should pass.</P>

      <P>On behalf of the live-stock trade, which I represent, I support the principle of this Bill.  We are rather surprised at the attitude of the Minister towards our particular organisation&mdash;the national executive of the live-stock trades.  We cannot understand why he goes out of his way to try to discredit this organisation, which has done so much good for the members of the live-stock trade.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Counihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall explain that as I go on.  In the first instance, the Minister refused to have the national executive of the cattle trade represented on harbour boards at all.  The Minister refused to give the national executive the power to nominate, the same as the chambers of commerce and manufacturers.  We considered that that was a very discourteous act, which discredited us.  We thought that we were as worthy of the right to nomination as the other bodies.  I believe that the attitude of the Minister to the national executive is due to his not understanding the work which we are doing and the composition of our body.  I hope I shall be able to convince the Minister and the House of the importance of the national executive and that, on the Committee Stage, he will have no objection to accepting amendments which I shall propose.  The national executive of the live-stock trades is the only body in the State responsible for the transport and protection of the live stock exported from the Twenty-Six Counties to Great Britain.  They are responsible for their safe transport and their protection against slaughter owing to foot-and-mouth disease and against hold-ups in Great Britain through the prevalence of foot-and-mouth disease in the area.  The live-stock trade, in all these cases, compensates the exporters of live stock if they are killed or injured in transport or slaughtered by order of the British Government at the port of landing. <Col N="687" /> The Minister said in the Dáil that the Minister for Agriculture thought it was undesirable to give statutory powers to one organisation.  I am glad to be able to inform the House that a deputation from the cattle trade waited on the Minister for Agriculture yesterday, and he agreed with the suggestions for amendments which we are to introduce on Committee Stage. He promised to use his influence with the Minister to have them accepted.</P>
      <P>With regard to that statement, I want to say that if it was only one organisation, we would be in thorough agreement with the Minister, but the national executive is not one organisation&mdash;it is an organisation of organisations. They represent the whole cattle trade in the Twenty-Six Counties.  It is made up of six cattle trade organisations and one pig buyers' and pig producers' organisation.  That totals seven, and the chairman and vice-chairman of each of those bodies represent the national executive.  There are two of those organisations, one in Cork, one in Belfast, one in Derry, and one in Sligo, and there is the Irish Pig Buyers' Organisation, making 14 in all, comprising representatives of dealers in cattle, sheep, pigs and horses, who might also be included, in the whole Twenty-Six Counties.  With regard to the statement about giving the organisation statutory powers, I would like to explain to the House that the national executive already have statutory powers.  They are a nominating body for the Seanad.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Counihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Under one of those Bills, no shipping company in the Twenty-Six Counties can accept any cattle, sheep or pigs for export to Great Britain without having the appropriate levy paid in the shape of a tax affixed to the consignment note. The Slaughtered Animals Act was introduced by the late Minister for Agriculture to allow the trade to compensate for the cattle slaughtered at British ports of landing.  After the Treaty was passed, no British Government would accept responsibility for cattle while they were in British ports. They denied responsibility, and the Irish Government would not accept responsibility either, so that when our live stock was in a British port they were practically in &ldquo;no man's land&rdquo; and nobody would take responsibility. They were nobody's children, and I advocated strongly that the Irish Government should compensate those people who lost considerable sums of money through the slaughter of their animals.  Some of them were nearly broke at the time.  All they had was lost and confiscated, and, at that time I remember my friend Senator Tom Foran telling me that he was so tired of listening to me advocating compensation that he suggested we should organise a flag day to pay the poor cattlemen.</P>
      <P>However, the Minister for Agriculture gave us a Bill to tax ourselves, which we did, to pay for any cattle slaughtered by order of the British Government in any of their ports.  That Act has since been extended to provide compensation for cattle held up through the prevalence of foot-and-mouth disease in any area where Irish cattle may be before they are sold to the British customers.  The fund of that Act has reached the sum of about £40,000.  At least, it was that some time ago, and something may have been paid out recently because of outbreaks in England during the last couple of months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other Act, which the present Minister for Agriculture introduced on the request of the cattle trade, was the <Col N="689" /> Exported Livestock (Insurance) Act. That Act provides in respect of beasts purchased in this country and exported through an Irish port to any market in Britain that the animals will be insured for a considerable time, 72 hours, after getting into the market. The funds of that Act are in the neighbourhood of £180,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Counihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry I annoyed Senator Tom Foran by talking so much about the cattle trade.  I have a good deal more to say on it, but the only remark I have to make now is that we are rather pleased with the Bill and with the Minister's statement that he intends to carry out the recommendations of the Ports and Harbours Tribunal.  Two members of the national executive gave evidence before that tribunal, and our principal recommendation was that the Dublin Cattle Market should be removed to the North Wall and that <Col N="690" /> municipal lairages for the export of stock should be provided.  Those two proposals of the cattle trade were unanimously recommended in the Report of the Ports and Harbours Tribunal and I would like to hear from the Minister what he intends to do about that particular recommendation.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to see that the Minister has extended shipping representation, although we have no great love for the shipping companies.  Still, they are an important body, and I think I might suggest the Minister's nomination should also include representatives of the railway companies. The railway companies have a very important function to perform at the meetings of the harbour boards and I think it would be well to have them represented.  I hope when I put in these recommendations later the Minister will have no objection to accepting them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>I am going to be rather close to Senator Counihan, while not just exactly following his line.  I have to express some surprise that the Minister in drafting this Bill has seen fit only to include one small group of producers among those entitled to have representation on the harbour boards of the country.  Perhaps I might express my surprise that Senator Counihan had no word to say about farmer producers.</P>
      <P>To me, the harbours of the country are like the gates going into a man's farm&mdash;you must be concerned about them.  You must have some rules about opening and closing them.  The harbours are the gateways out of the farmers' markets and they are also the gateways through which many of the necessities for our productive efforts must come.  The Minister has made provision for the trader.  Trading, as I see it, has come to be such an exalted occupation that it is much more profitable, and, apparently, much more honourable to be a trader than to be a producer.  I think we ought to try to reverse that attitude of mind, and I will put it to the Minister that if the farmers were not producing the cattle, there would not be much room for cattle traders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="691" /> While it is of vital importance that the people who are trading through a port will have a voice in the management of a port, and it is of vital importance that people like the cattle traders will have a say, and will be able to place the benefit of their knowledge and experience at the disposal of a particular harbour authority, I think it is of much greater importance that the producers of the country should have a voice with regard to how the business of these harbour authorities should be conducted.  It is true that we are in the main, to-day, only exporting cattle but we are producing something else in addition.</P>
    <P>There were other days when we were exporting butter, bacon, eggs and poultry and I hope we will get to that point again.  The more quickly we reach that stage the more profitable life will be here for everybody.  I should like to suggest to the Minister that he turned a blind eye to that side of the nation's life and that he is not making the proper approach to opening up that wider field of activity into which we want to see our farmers enter.  We have in this country many great co-operative organisations.  They were exporting a very considerable quantity of the country's produce in the past and they were importers as well.  They are the direct representatives, they are the mouthpiece of the producers of the country.  They ought to be the primary concern of every Minister, and essentially of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, because his industry and his commerce can only flourish on the basis of a flourishing agricultural industry.</P>
    <P>So, Sir, I suggest to the Minister that the people who must be more directly concerned about the use that is to he made of our harbours, the way they will be managed, the distribution of the rates, properties, and accommodation that the people are to enjoy must be as intimately concerned as anybody else.  I know, of course, that the cattle traders must have lairage accommodation and must be granted facilities of a kind suitable to their trade.  Apparently, the Federation of Irish Manufacturers are a not unimportant <Col N="692" /> section of our community. Senator Hayes, I heard him, whispered &ldquo;simple souls&rdquo;.  Not so simple, I would suggest, at all, and perhaps that is why the Minister has given two representatives to the Federation of Irish Manufacturers.  I do not know what proportion of their manufactures. they are exporting, and I do not know to what extent they are using the harbours of the country or are going to use them in the future.  It is perfectly right that they, too, should have a voice, but I cannot understand the point of view of the Minister.  Perhaps it is because he may be convinced by some people that the cattle trade represents the producers of the country and that the producers are adequately represented on the harbour boards by the cattle traders.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCounihan" hpid="Mr. Counihan Mr. Counihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Counihan</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, may I explain that the cattle trade represents the producers as much as any farmers.  In the organisation of which I have the honour to be chairman, we have five members of the Seanad, Mr. Quirke, Mr. Sweetman, Mr. James McGee, Mr. Parkinson and myself.  I think we represent the producers, as well as the farmers, whom Mr. Baxter was talking about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not saying a word against them, but Senator Counihan has made a disclosure that is very interesting. I am not going to pursue that now, but it seems to me that the Minister must be under the impression that the cattle traders were really representative of, and could talk for, the producers of the country.  Obviously, they cannot.  They can speak for a particular branch, and for a particular interest in a particular branch.  It is one thing to produce cattle, and it is another thing to be interested in trading in cattle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A man, I grant you, may be both a trader and a producer.  A man may be using his farm, putting cattle on it, keeping them for a month and then bringing them off to export them.  I know that to many people that is a very profitable manner of using one's land, but that requires specialised knowledge, special circumstances, and special conveniences that are not open <Col N="693" /> to the man in Connemara or Bunbeg in Donegal.  Definitely, it is not a fact that the producers of this country will be adequately represented by two members of the Cattle Traders' Association.</P>
    <P>I do not mind who they are or how competent they are to represent that particular branch of the country's industry.  It is important they should be there but what I want to urge is that the Minister should take into account the other branches of the country's economy, the pig producers, people who are killing their pigs, the co-operative societies, the people in our creameries producing butter, the big dairy societies that have, in addition, their egg and poultry branches, whose exports in the past were a considerable proportion of our total exports.</P>
    <P>In turn, these people are importing artificial manures, machinery and all the requirements of our farmers in their ordinary everyday work.  Those people have a direct interest in the management of our harbours.  I think it is of vital importance that consideration should be given to that particular interest on these boards particularly on the more important harbours.  I regret very much that the Minister has not seen fit to put in as one of the categories direct representation of the producers and I confess quite frankly, that if there is a necessity to include the Federation of Irish Manufacturers, the farmers as manufacturers are far more important.  They are far more important as exporters and importers.</P>
    <P>Who can pretend that they have not, therefore, a direct interest in the management of our harbours, and in the way the space along our harbours may be allocated, either for exporting or importing purposes?  I hope the Minister will give consideration to that.  I must try and see whether I would have as much ingenuity as Senator Counihan, and introduce some proposal to meet this on the Committee Stage if the Minister does not feel disposed to do so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>In the early part of his speech the Minister conveyed to us the impression that the Harbours Tribunal on whose report this Bill is founded made a recommendation that the relationship between the Minister and the harbour authorities should correspond more or less to the relationship that exists between local authorities and the Department of Local Government.  I think he asked us to infer that that recommendation was implemented in the Bill.  I think that it is not, and I think that the Minister is to be very heartily congratulated on the fact that it is not.  The relationship which is proposed in this Bill is of a kind that one might like to see existing between a local authority and the Department of Local Government.  You have in the Bill an effort to secure a representative body of people, representing various interests&mdash;I am not going to discuss these interests&mdash;all having the right to use the port.  In the case of the larger ports at any rate they will be appointed to the harbour authority.</P>
      <P>As regards the manager, his position, as far as I can form a judgment on the Bill, does not differ very widely from the position of the existing general manager in the case of Cork, a position which was created voluntarily, and of their own volition, by the Cork Harbour Board 15 or 16 years ago. Under the Bill the supreme authority in the port is the harbour authority. The manager is the executive officer. Certainly, he can exercise certain functions, particularly in relation to staff; but in the long run he is subject to the harbour authority provided for in the Bill.  I think that is one of the things that we have a right to mention now, and one of the things on which we might congratulate the Minister in his preparation of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to say now that, in my opinion, this is one of the best-drawn, one of the best thought-out and one of the most competent Bills that has come before this House in my time. It is excellently presented, and I do not think there will be many people to find fault with it.  There are certain aspects of it that one might like to see altered.  For instance, the <Col N="695" /> Minister is taking power in relation to harbour works, in such cases as he thinks proper, to make a provisional Order after the holding of a local inquiry.  That, I think, is a very proper thing.  In that way the local people will know what is being done. The inquiry will be a public one, and those supporting the proposal of the harbour authority, as well as those opposing it, will be entitled to give evidence at it.  The Minister will then have the opportunity, before seeking power to implement his provisional Order, of judging how local opinion and local feeling have reacted to the proposition.</P>
    <P>One of the things that I think might be done would be to continue that idea further in relation to a proposal, let us say, to abolish a harbour authority.  I do not visualise that the authorities to be provided under this Bill in the principal harbours are going to be abolished in the near future, but there may be difficulties in the case of certain of the smaller harbours.  There were grave difficulties in the past.  In fact, I have the idea that some of the authorities in the case of small harbours were not constituted in accordance with any proper procedure at all.  I had some experience, as a member of the Rates Advisory Committee for six or seven years, in dealing with some of those bodies, and what occurred to me was that the local people, including the harbour officials, did not know what Acts they were operating and did not very much care.  There was one case in the County Kerry in which it was impossible to get a harbour authority elected under the Order under which the authority was constituted.  I think that the people who were entitled to be electors did not exist.</P>
    <P>The principal thing that, in my opinion, this Bill does is to codify all the statutes, orders and regulations which govern these 25 harbours.  It also proposes to modernise them. That in itself is, of course, a great achievement, something for which we have the right to be grateful.  The Minister has achieved a very big task in doing this.  He has reduced what was chaos to an ordered system of <Col N="696" /> government in relation to harbours. He is seeking to get representative people to become members of the controlling authority in the case of harbours.  I do not think that, at this stage, we need quarrel as to whether there are two many farmers or too few, or too many cattle traders or too few. The main thing, in my judgment, is to get a number of people, whether it is nine, 11 or 23, who understand what is the function of a harbour authority and who are willing to devote their time to the functions of their office, and deal honestly with the affairs committed to their charge.  One difficulty, in the past was that, in some of these cases, the members of the harbour authority regarded the port authority as part of a private concern owned by themselves.  I had the experience on one occasion of dealing with a complaint which was made to the Rates Advisory Committee, that in one particular harbour two shipping companies using the harbour were paying totally different tonnage rates and tonnage dues.  On inquiry, I discovered that what was happening was this: that the harbour authority levied a flat rate which was payable by the users of the harbour, but then it had a regulation by which it could make a refund to the company which made 24 or 12 round trips each year.  There was only one company that could satisfy that requirement, and that company received, at the end of the year, a rebate of 50 per cent. of the total sum paid by it in harbour dues during the year.  It happened that a very prominent member of the harbour board was a director of that company, and when he was giving evidence before the Rates Advisory Committee I asked him about this discrimination against another user of the harbour whom I named.  He became livid with rage at the thought that the company in which he was interested should be compared with what he would call a tin-pot company.</P>
    <P>These things merely illustrate the manner in which some people approached their responsibilities in the past.  I think that whatever we may say about the objection to groupings, or to the representation of one section and the non-representation of another, <Col N="697" /> the important thing is that we must aim at getting competent people to run these harbour authorities in the interests of the State and in the interests of the nation, and not in the interests of private firms.</P>
    <P>Now some amendments which were made to this Bill, when it was going through the Dáil, are of tremendous importance.  The Minister has told us that after he got certain recommendations from various harbour authorities and other interests concerned he decided to introduce a number of amendments to this Bill, and I know that other people took a keen interest in the framework of the Bill and brought certain suggestions under the notice of the Minister, and I think he accepted them.  In my opinion, one of the most important of these proposals is the authority conferred on the new harbour authority to provide transhipment sheds, but I think that the importance of that provision has not been fully grasped.  It seems to me that the provision for the transhipment of goods is the modern equivalent or alternative to a free port.  Certain proposals have been put forward in this country as to the establishment of a free port.  I do not want to go into that matter now, but I would say that some of the greatest countries in the world have built up their foreign trade and their mercantile marine business on a transhipment basis.  That is the kind of an organisation which would enable an Irish shipping company to take a cargo in a foreign port and distribute that cargo at a number of other ports before the voyage is completed.  I think that in inserting that provision in the Bill the Minister has done one of the best jobs that has been done for a long time in the interest of establishing an Irish Mercantile Marine.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect of this measure, however, to which I should like to draw attention.  In various sections of the Bill it is provided that the harbour authority &ldquo;may&rdquo; do certain things, with the consent of the Minister.  Now, I do not like to see too many &ldquo;musts&rdquo; or &ldquo;shalls&rdquo; coming into a Bill, but I do think that in this case of transhipment sheds the <Col N="698" /> Minister should put in &ldquo;shall&rdquo; or &ldquo;must&rdquo;, because I think it is essential that there should be a double shift in the case of a ship taking a cargo <i>en route</i> for Glasgow or somewhere-else. Another thing which I think is of great importance is the provision for the decasualisation of dock labour. I can quite realise that it is difficult for harbour authorities to be charged with the duty of making the provisions that are contemplated here in Section 61, but at any rate it represents a notice of the intention of the Government to proceed along those lines, and I think its incorporation in the Bill is. valuable.  If it does nothing else except to indicate to the interested parties that there is a national policy supporting the decasualisation of dock labour, it is valuable for that alone.  I do not, however, accept the view that the section could not go further.  I think that it can go very much further, and I can visualise occasions which may very well arise in which it could go very much further.</P>
    <P>Before I conclude, there are one or two points to which I want to refer and which, I think, may have escaped the attention of the Minister, and seem to have escaped the attention of the Dáil, as far as I can see.  I refer particularly in this connection to Section 83 of the Bill.  I cannot imagine that section being of interest to anybody except the Revenue Commissioners. It seems to me to be something that is totally at variance with the principle of the Bill as a whole. Sub-section (1) of Section 83 says that a harbour authority may make customs entry in certain cases.  Surely, if there are any traders' interests represented in this House, they will realise that this is a complete violation of any control over goods being brought into this country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, I do not follow the Senator, but what is being done in Section 83 is to confer on a harbour authority the right to open a case of goods, shipped and brought into Ireland on behalf of an Irish importer, and to make a customs entry.  Mind you, it is not merely a question of enabling a cargo to be discharged&mdash; many of these technical terms are used in these Bills and in the Customs Consolidation Acts&mdash;but there are other things which might equally be clearly done by the revenue authorities, and I think that the Minister for Industry and Commerce, as the defender of the commercial interests of this country, should be encouraged to take a stand against the implications contained in Section 83 and some other sections of the Bill.  However, I do not want to go into these matters now.  I could refer, for instance, to the provisions of Section 79, in which penalties are provided for a harbour authority in respect of something for which penalties are already provided in the Customs Consolidation Act of 1876, and I think there are also provisions in relation to the same matter in the Merchant Shipping Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot understand where the harbour authority comes into these matters at all.  Their duty is to provide proper facilities for the use of the harbour so that shipping may be carried on for the good of the importer and the exporter, and it is not the business of the harbour authority to interfere with the goods which are being transported.  Certain obligations are imposed on the shipping company or on the master of the vessel, and all these things are provided for in other enactments.  The existing provisions may not be satisfactory in our conditions to-day, but they ought to be amended in relation to the appropriate statutes, and I suggest that the last persons on whom these obligations should be placed would be the harbour authorities.  I do not propose to go into these matters now, but I hope to go into them at a later stage in connection with this section and other sections.  Having made that observation regarding these provisions, I want to say again that I think the Minister <Col N="700" /> has achieved a very great task in a most satisfactory manner in presenting this Bill to us in the form in which it has reached this House.</P>

      <P>I welcome this Bill on general principles.  Like Senator Duffy, I do not think we need take up much time on Second Reading.  It is essentially a Committee Bill.  I shall not take up much time, but I do feel that I know something about at least one port.  That port is the City of Dublin.  It would appear from this Bill and the interest being taken in our harbours now that some good came out of the war.  The fact that people wanted to use our harbours made us realise their importance.  That is borne in on us now and that is all to the good.  Too long have we allowed our harbours to be exploited by the foreigner.  The harbour board in the City of Dublin was largely made up of representatives of cross-Channel shipping. Those people had no interest whatever in the country other than its exploitation in the interests of the country of their origin.  This Bill alters all that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The crimes committed against the citizens of this city and the country at large through the machinations of this port and docks board which governs the Port of Dublin are very far-reaching and have reacted on our trade and commerce.  I shall give two instances.  Dublin Port and Docks <Col N="701" /> Board has, at what is known as the Custom House dock, one of the finest warehouses in the country and comparable with any warehouse outside the country.  It is an extraordinary thing that that great warehouse was repeatedly empty, while private warehouses were chock full.  That is how they managed the port in the interests of the country.  The accommodation owned by the Port and Docks Board which should have been used in the interests of the community was allowed to lie dormant and unused, while the profits of the private companies were enhanced by their great storage accommodation. It did not end there. Dublin Port and Docks Board were responsible for the proper working of the ships coming in here.  Their entire attention was given to providing facilities for the cross-Channel companies, ignoring the deep sea trade and handicapping it in every way.</P>
    <P>I was amused to hear Senator Duffy speaking about transhipment.  The transhipment went on in England to English bottoms coming over here on their own freight terms, which we had to pay.  This Bill alters much of that.  The fact that these people had so long a run in exploiting the country means that the effect will continue for a long time, no matter how the new harbour authority carries on. At the North Wall, they have what is considered one of the most up-to-date grain handling machines in the world.  That is owned by a private company.  It is extraordinary that a private company should get hold of this great machine as against the interests of the people in general. Dublin Port and Docks Board went on handling grain in the same old fashion, while a private company was allowed to get hold of this machine and handle practically all the grain coming into the port on its own terms. These are things that were done in the old days of the Port and Docks Board. To the extent that that is going to be wiped out, I welcome the new Bill.</P>
    <P>I have some misgivings about the Bill.  The Minister has told us that he will regulate the harbour boards on somewhat similar lines to those of the Minister for Local Government.  God <Col N="702" /> help the ports if he does that.  We shall have chaos in the harbours in a short time&mdash;particularly, in the four principal ones.  It is just possible that the manager will be a factotum of the Minister as is the county manager to the Minister for Local Government.  As a victim of the activity of the Minister for Local Government, I hope that the Minister present will not require that his representatives on the public boards will give an undertaking that they will be good boys and carry out his wishes in the future.</P>
    <P>I have more confidence in the present Minister for Industry and Commerce than I would have in any other, but he is not going to administer Industry and Commerce all the time.  Another switch over may bring the Minister for Local Government to the Department of Industry and Commerce.</P>

      <P>I will give the present Minister for Industry and Commerce all the credit and honour that is due to him up to now, but he has introduced a serious feature in democratic rule regarding the boards and to that extent I have my misgivings.  But, I welcome the Bill.  I know it is long overdue, and it is capable of doing great things for the people of the country, the traders and the community at large by removing some of the abuses caused by certain people when they had the opportunity.  The ordinary people will get the benefit, I hope, in the future and that will be reflected in improved conditions generally.</P>
      <P>There will be no discrimination between cross-Channel and deep-sea fishing. The deep-sea men will have an opportunity of carrying on their business and they will be encouraged to call direct to our ports.  Another thing is that tramp ships will be able to come here for foreign or cross-Channel cargoes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I must try to impress on the Minister&mdash;I know he is agreeable and <Col N="703" /> willing if the thing is possible&mdash;to facilitate the decasualisation of dock labour.  That is an important matter, and if the Minister can get rid of the problem he will crown many of the very great things he has done for labour in this country.  I hope he will bend his talents and his energy to bringing about the decasualisation of dock labour.  The need for it is obvious.  Across the Channel, it has been accomplished to some extent, and the obligation is on the Minister to do it here as soon as ever he can, so that conditions at the docks may be made a little more humane for the workers.</P>
    <P>In the course of his speech the Minister mentioned the election of a port authority in which only eight out of 500 members voted.  The same thing applies in the City of Dublin, where a man could walk in with 500 or 600 proxies and get himself re-elected. The people with votes realised there was no use in going there when the dice was loaded against them.  Thank God, that has been changed and we can look forward to a period of prosperity for our harbours in the first instance, and for the traders and community in general in the second.  I am sure that the Minister will be responsive to amendments in the Committee Stage.  All I have to say is that I welcome the Bill on general principles.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Callaghan</NameTxt>
      <P>To facilitate the passage of the Bill I propose to be very brief.  I would like to, suggest to the Minister very respectfully that he might reconsider the constitution of the boards proposed.  Agriculture is the big wealth-producing industry in the country.  It produces more of the export wealth than all the other industries put together, but the Minister has made arrangements for only one branch of the industry to be represented, that is the live-stock industry. There are several others.  The live-stock branch of the industry does not cater fully for all the live-stock trade. In Waterford, you have an export trade in dead meat which is a very technical business, and it would be desirable, in my opinion, that someone with knowledge of the export trade in <Col N="704" /> dead meat should be put on the harbour board with a view to securing proper facilities for the export of dead meat.  At the moment I know there is not a very extensive export, but one day it may be very extensive and if we had support it would become a very big industry.  I respectfully suggest to the Minister that agriculture should be more broadly represented on the harbour boards.  A few days ago the Cork County Council adopted a resolution asking for representation.  That resolution was passed unanimously and I hope the Minister will consider it.  If he does, he will get one or two men with an intimate knowledge of farming problems.  The Cork County Council is 75 per cent. agricultural and there will be no difficulty in securing a representative.  I ask the Minister to reconsider the suggestion I have made and I wish to say that I am generally in support of the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanRuane" hpid="Mr. S.T. Ruane Mr. S.T. Ruane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S.T. Ruane</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret to say that this Bill has aroused very little interest in the county I come from or-in the adjoining counties.  In fact, very little interest has been manifested in the ports on the western seaboard in the last five years and as a result these are derelict, useless and unable to confer the benefits which the end of the war might be expected to revive.  Many people derived considerable benefits from the cheap transit of goods diverted to these ports.  The war has been accepted as the reason for their neglect and I am afraid that many people have accepted that excuse rather too readily.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In some quarters, however, there is a suspicion that the present tendency is to centralise trade and divert it to Dublin and ports in other large populous areas with a view towards supplementing the revenue of the recently reorganised transport system. I trust that these suspicions are unfounded.  My interest in this Bill is mainly concerned with the possibilities it affords for the revival of the trade formerly carried on at these ports which, as I said, conferred inestimable benefits not alone on the people employed in the shipping of cargo but on the many people who benefited by the cheap <Col N="705" /> transport of goods in these particular areas.</P>
    <P>I know that the conditions now obtaining, compared with those under which they successfully functioned in the past, have been very considerably altered, owing to the policy of the present Government, which was necessary because of the emergency in promoting the production of our own needs in grain.  Through their policy the small ports have suffered.  In Mayo to the ports of Ballina and Westport and another excellent port, which is not mentioned in the Bill, Newport, grain boats no longer ply, and if it is intended to revive them something must be done to reorganise the traffic by supplying a substitute to enable them to carry on.</P>
    <P>I have been told that in the destruction of shipping which occurred during the recent war quite a big number of the class of boats, 500 to 800 tons, which serviced such ports, have been sunk, as well as larger vessels, but that the smaller boats are not being replaced.  I do not know what is in that, but I do know that there are many people interested in the revival of the ports on the western seaboard, and any help the Minister can give in that direction will be appreciated.  He can rely on the co-operation of the people concerned, not alone that of the residents of the port areas, but of those throughout the counties served.</P>
    <P>As to the constitution of the harbour boards, I am concerned with one particular point of the Bill which gives representation to people paying certain tonnage rates or to shipowners.</P>
    <P>At the ports that I am concerned with there are no such people, and I would suggest that the Minister might find some means of giving representation on the harbour boards to people engaged in trading, manufacturers, millers and other people that import raw materials for the purpose of carrying on their business.  Naturally, if these people were on the harbour board they would take an interest in the development of the port that they administer and they would be anxious to reorganise traffic in such a way <Col N="706" /> as to bring back some degree of the prosperity that hitherto marked these particular ports.  I know that in normal times, not very many years ago, goods consigned from Britain and Glasgow to Ballina and Westport were conveyed at less than 20 per cent. of the cost that obtained when similar goods were sent to Dublin and transhipped overland to the West.  We will judge this Bill in the West in so far as it helps towards the development of our harbours.  Though the war may be an excuse for their neglect, it is noticeable that since the cessation of hostilities, that whereas traffic has been diverted to other ports, ours are still neglected.  We will judge the efficacy of this Bill in so far as it helps to provide that these ports will be utilised for the flow of goods to the towns and counties on the western seaboard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanODonovan" hpid="Mr. Seán O'Donovan Mr. Seán O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Seán O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be very brief, because I understand the Minister has an appointment pretty soon. In his introduction, I think, he stated that the harbour committee would be in the same relationship to the Minister for Industry and Commerce as the local authority is to the Minister for Local Government.  I think Senator Foran was a bit harsh in his interpretation of these remarks of the Minister. The point I wish to raise specially is a liaison between the local authority of the City of Dublin, for instance, and the new harbour committee of the Dublin Port, which is now called the Dublin Port and Docks Board.  In Section 58 of the Bill, there is provision made for the accommodation of customs officers and officials, and for office accommodation for them.  The matter I am going to mention to the Minister was brought forcibly before the public health officers of the Dublin Corporation within the last couple of weeks, when a large consignment of oranges was brought into Dublin Port. There are no facilities provided at the port for the examination of consignments of bad food or fruit or any such edible commodity.  I think that should not hold in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has always puzzled me to know where the alignment of authority between the corporation and the Port <Col N="707" /> and Docks existed.  The Port and Docks, I understand, are responsible for the maintenance of bridges right up as far as Guinness'.  And the local authority, the Corporation of Dublin, has the maintenance of the streets converging towards these bridges.  These things, I should say, have always confused me, to know where one authority began and the other authority ended.  But, on the question of the supervision of a large quantity of foodstuffs coming into this city, under the new enactment, I think I should, at this stage, draw the attention of the Minister to the inadequacy of the arrangements at present existing.  The situation is that there is no facility and there is no legal provision practically, as far as I can judge, for the examination of food products at the port.  It was specifically stated, whether rightly or wrongly, that the local authority and the public health officials had no right within the Port and Docks district. Where that begins or ends I am not sure, but at the shed at which goods are landed the local authority officials were informed that they had no authority there.  I should like that rectified, if possible, in this Bill, and the rectification that I suggest would be in the section here which gives authority to the customs officials to have their offices and equipment attached to the new harbour board's institutions.  If this be rectified, you can have far better supervision of the foodstuffs that will be imported into this city or into other large cities which are mentioned in the Bill.  I do not suppose there will be large quantities of foodstuffs coming into the smaller harbour committee areas which are delineated in the Bill.</P>
    <P>As far as the bigger authorities are concerned I think that the matter of supervision between the local authority, which is the Dublin Corporation here, and the harbour authority, is not satisfactory at present.  During the emergency very large quantities of foodstuffs in an unsatisfactory and unsound condition came into Dublin and it was by the co-operation or through the initiative of the customs officials, because <Col N="708" /> they intervened at the start, that these goods were not allowed out for human consumption to the citizens of Dublin.  I should say that it amounted practically to hundreds of tons of foodstuffs.  One consignment consisted of beans and another was spaghetti and they were prohibited in the interests of public health from being allowed to the community. By arrangement, they were converted into animal food but the facilities there were provided through the fact that the customs officials intervened with the shipping people.  Now, when you come to a specific case recently, of a large consignment of oranges, there was no arrangement, as far as I can see, through which the local authority could deal with that consignment of foodstuffs at the port.  The result was that they came up into the city and created considerable difficulties in the city and considerable publicity in the Press relative to the importation of them and the distribution of them in the city.  I suggest to the Minister that before the Committee Stage he should look into this matter to see that facilities are afforded in each case to the local authority to be able to supervise the importation of foodstuffs within these new harbour committee districts. There are other points, but I do not want to detain the House now.  It may be easier to refer to them in Committee but I thought it wise to refer to this matter as important for consideration on the Second Reading.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnJosephMeighan" hpid="Mr. Meighan Mr. Meighan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Meighan</NameTxt>
      <P>On the opening statement the Minister has made I am convinced that it was very necessary to have this Bill put through.  With regard to representation for agriculture, I should like to support Senator Baxter but, perhaps, not to such a degree as he would go.  My idea is that the harbour boards should be composed mainly of hard-headed business men.  Of course, there should be due representation given to the various interests concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not agree with Senator Counihan that his body represents agriculture to the hilt.  Whilst I would be very anxious to see the live-stock trade <Col N="709" /> represented, I am afraid that Senator Counihan has the idea of getting representation for it, based on the representation that he has admitted here that he has got.  Certainly, that association is a very important one, and is entitled to representation.  With regard to representation for agriculture, for the ordinary farmer and producer, the Minister could get over that if the representation for those interests was on a provincial basis.  For example, in the province of Connacht there are very capable men on the county committees of agriculture, and if these committees had one or two representatives on the harbour authorities in that province I think agriculture would not have very much to complain of.  I would prefer to see hard-headed business men on these boards, but at the same time I would like to see agriculture represented so that there would be no cause for grievance amongst the agricultural community.  Those representatives should have a place on these harbour authorities and be in a position to voice any grievance brought to their notice.  As Senator Ruane has said, I also would like to see a bit of life added to the western harbours. Some short time ago the members of the Western Livestock Association were very concerned about this matter, and I understand sent a deputation to the Minister to try to get something done in regard to the export of cattle from Sligo port.  If that were done it would be not only a great convenience, but would give a great fillip to the fairs held in the West of Ireland. I hope that the Minister will give consideration to the points I have mentioned, especially with regard to giving representation to agriculture somewhat on the lines I have outlined. I want to make it perfectly clear that, in this matter of representation, I would not like to see the live-stock association left out.  I stand for fair representation for all interests.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Patrick O'Reilly Mr. Patrick O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Patrick O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot understand why Senator Meighan should have drawn such a clear distinction between the hard-headed business men and the agricultural producers.  The only reason I can see for it is that Roscommon has no outlet to the sea. <Col N="710" /> I think that one will find amongst the producers of this country as hard-headed and as competent business men as amongst any other class in the community. I thoroughly agree with Senator Baxter that there should be representation for agriculture, if that is possible.  Senator Baxter disagreed with Senator Counihan when the latter claimed that the Cattle Traders' Association would be on the board to represent agriculture as well as the cattle trade.  The point that I am mainly concerned to make is that if you are to have an effective, efficient harbour authority it should not be too large.  Otherwise, in my opinion, it will be an unwieldy body.  Those who have had experience of local authorities will, I think, agree that it very often happens that when you have a body that is too large it leads to inefficiency.  I would suggest to Senator Counihan that the members of the Cattle Trade Association should be in the chamber of commerce group, and in that way get representation.  I wonder would it be possible for the agricultural producers to get representation through a chamber of commerce?  Perhaps they might.</P>
      <P>Senator Douglas seemed to be a bit annoyed lest the report of the officer holding an inquiry into the activities of a harbour authority should not be published, and suggested that, in all cases, the officer's report should be published.  In my opinion, if the evidence given before the inquiry is not published, then the report should not be published.  I would agree, to some extent, with him that it might not be expedient to do so.  At any rate, I cannot see this matter from the Minister's angle.  Senator Duffy suggested that there should be no censorship, as it were, on goods passing through a port; that a port authority should not be able to exercise such a censorship.  In my opinion it is only right that a harbour authority should be able to check up on the goods and traffic passing through its hands.  It may be argued that the customs authorities are able to carry out sufficient checks in that regard, but it may be that the Minister is of opinion that the present checks are not sufficient.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to say a word about the <Col N="711" /> position created under the Bill whereby the ports of Dublin, Cork, Waterford and Limerick are being placed in a premier position as against the ports of Galway, Sligo and Drogheda.  I cannot understand that, since the ports of Galway, Sligo and Drogheda would normally serve the economic areas that surround them.  Transport in those areas should be so organised that it would radiate from the ports rather than have goods landed in Dublin and then transported to Ballina, Sligo and Drogheda.  I am very interested in the port of Sligo, which at present is in a rather bad way.  Prior to the war a great number of people were employed at Sligo Port and quite an extensive business was done there, but at the moment it is really a derelict.  Surely that port should be developed so that it would serve the economic interests of the areas that surround it.  If that is not done, then the people in those areas will be obliged to continue to pay higher costs for their goods, due to the fact that they will have to be transported from Dublin or Cork or some of the other ports that are being placed in the premier position that I have referred to.  It will mean more revenue for the railways.  I do not think it would be quite fair that business people in the West should suffer hardship as a result of that position. My argument is that the ports I have mentioned&mdash;Sligo, Galway and Drogheda&mdash;since they are major ports, just as Cork, Limerick and Waterford are major ports, should be placed in a position to serve the economic interests they were intended by nature to serve.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator who has just spoken entirely misunderstands the provisions of the Bill relating to the grading of the ports.  The classification of Sligo, Galway and other secondary ports as major ports would, probably, put those ports out of business.  If, at any time, the trade of those ports grows to the point at which it would be sufficient to support the obligations imposed by this Bill on the four major ports, the transformation can be made by Ministerial Order.  No doubt, if, at any time, the harbour authorities <Col N="712" /> of those ports consider that the change would be beneficial to their trade, they will make representations to that effect.  The grading of those ports as secondary ports at the present time, and their exemption from the obligations which this Bill places on the major ports will facilitate, rather than impede, their development.</P>
      <P>The tribunal recommended that the Minister for Industry and Commerce should have the same general powers of supervision of the activities of harbour authorities as the Minister for Local Government and Public Health has in respect of local government bodies.  That is not quite the same thing as saying that harbour bodies should stand in precisely the same relation to the Minister for Industry and Commerce as local government bodies stand in relation to the Minister for Local Government.  Senator Douglas and other Senators who addressed themselves to this matter have, I think, been misled into assuming that there is a fundamental similarity between a local government authority and a harbour authority.  A local government authority can, by its extravagance, impose fairly heavy charges on the ratepayers of its area or it can become niggardly and, in the interests of the ratepayers, refuse to provide essential services.  In either event, the Minister for Local Government can step in and rectify the mistake.  A local government authority cannot go out of business.  Unless the Minister for Local Government steps in, in the event to which I have referred, either the ratepayers will pay because of the extravagance of the local authority or they will suffer inconvenience owing to the lack of services and facilities.  A harbour can go out of business.  The essential difference between a local government body and a harbour authority is that the latter is a business enterprise, operating in competition with similar enterprises throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the harbour authority becomes extravagant so far as the salaries of its officials are concerned, or if it engages in the expenditure of money upon nonessential services, or in a useless way, then the harbour rates will be increased <Col N="713" /> or the harbour facilities will be curtailed.  In that event, traders and shippers will go elsewhere, and will be at full liberty to go elsewhere. Many a harbour in this country has lost trade to a neighbouring harbour because its charges were too high or the facilities it offered were inadequate. It is necessary to get that clear distinction between a harbour authority and a local government body. A harbour can go out of business, and if not properly managed will go out of business.  No method is practicable by which traders and shippers can be compelled to use a harbour which is not properly managed.  I want that aspect of this problem kept clearly in mind by those who urge that harbour authorities should be constituted like a national convention, with representation of all possible interests.  A harbour is a business undertaking, and the Bill is concerned with the method of electing the people who will be responsible for directing that business undertaking.  We do not decide who will be on the harbour authority; we decide who will have the right to put people on it.  In determining the electorate, we must have special regard for trading interests, because it is trading interests that are primarily concerned with the efficiency of the harbour services, and the rates and charges payable for their use.</P>
    <P>May I make it quite clear to Senator Counihan that the national executive of the live-stock trade will get representation on the major harbour authorities not as representatives of the producers of cattle but as representatives of traders in cattle.  It is as traders they are getting the representation and the same consideration will apply in respect of other persons who may go on the harbour authority. A harbour is a place where goods come in and go out.  Those goods are shipped by traders and, while producers have, undoubtedly, some interest in the efficiency of the harbour facilities, it is no greater interest than they have in the efficiency of the internal transport services or other matters that indirectly affect the profitability of production. The provision in the Bill for representation for live-stock interests does not &mdash; and certainly was not intended&mdash;to <Col N="714" /> constitute any discourtesy to the national executive of the live-stock trade.  It is precisely similar in form to the provision for the representation of labour interests and no representative of labour interests has suggested that the provision was discourteous to the trade union movement. I do not accept as accurate the account which Senator Counihan has given of the interview which took place with the Minister for Agriculture.  All the Bill provides is that representation will be given on the four major harbour authorities to the organisation which is certified by the Minister for Agriculture to be most representative of those who cater for live-stock interests.  I take it that the purpose of the delegation which went to the Minister for Agriculture was to convince him that the national executive of the live-stock trade was the most representative of such organisations and to make sure that he would certify that organisation for the purpose of exercising this power of nomination.  That was quite right but the Bill is being so framed as to ensure that no new harbour legislation will be necessary for a long time. Therefore, I think that the section should stand as it is.  So long as the national executive of the live-stock trade is the most representative of such organisations or is the only organisation representative of the trade, it will receive the certificate of the Minister for Agriculture.  But the national executive of the live-stock trade went out of existence before and may go out of existence again, in which event we should like to be able to give representation to live-stock interests without further legislation.</P>
    <P>Senator Douglas regarded the power of nomination given to the Minister in respect of harbour authorities as undesirable. I do not agree with him. The old régime has come to an end, so far as the ports of this country are concerned, and it will be the aim of the Minister for Industry and Commerce as, I hope, it will be the aim of every nominating authority to ensure that the people placed on these harbour authorities will be concerned with general, national, economic development and not solely with the interest of any particular type of trade.  The <Col N="715" /> Minister for Industry and Commerce has that power of nomination in the case of the Galway Harbour Board, under an Act passed some years ago, and he has similar power in the case of some other harbour authorities.  It has proved very useful.  I think it is true to say that, in the case of Galway, on more than one occasion, neither the local authority nor the chamber of commerce nor any other nominating authority put on the board one or two persons who were obviously the right persons to be put on it.  It may be that there was a sort of open conspiracy in Galway not to nominate the best people on the supposition that, if they did not do so, the Minister must do so.  That technique could be used, even under this Bill, to force the hand of the Minister and to decide, in advance, whom he must nominate.  In the case of Galway, if the power of Ministerial nomination had not existed and if other bodies had nominated the same persons that they did, the situation would have arisen that the most important traders in Galway and the most important representatives of shipping interests there might not have been represented on the harbour board at all.  While that will rarely be the case under this Bill, because the system of election here is likely to secure adequate representation for trading interests, the Minister's power will be available, ultimately, to secure that the harbour authority is so constituted as to enable it to protect all local interests.</P>
    <P>So far as Section 83 is concerned, if Senator Duffy will read the whole of the section, he will get a clearer idea as to what it is intended to do.  It is primarily intended to give a harbour authority power to prevent the <Col N="716" /> obstruction of the harbour by the failure of private individuals&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am quite satisfied from the Senator's remarks that re read only the first sub-section of the section.  If he will read the whole of the section, he will understand what it is about.</P>

      <P>No.  The harbour authority still have power to make entry, and I think that that is wrong.</P>

      <P>Only where there has been a failure to make such entry which would result in the dispatch of the business of the harbour authority being obstructed.  That is the case.  So far as Senator O'Donovan's point is concerned, we cannot enact public health legislation under this Bill.  It is quite true that there is inadequate warehousing accommodation at Dublin, and I think that the Dublin Port and Docks Board are fully aware of that. The delay in the distribution of oranges some time ago was attributable to the inadequacy of facilities available.  But matters relating to the protection of foodstuffs should be dealt with in connection with a Public Health Bill, and I do not think that the position could be improved by provisions in this measure.  I think that most of the other points that were raised deal with matters that could be more usefully discussed in Committee, because they are matters of detail rather than of the general principle of the Bill.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
