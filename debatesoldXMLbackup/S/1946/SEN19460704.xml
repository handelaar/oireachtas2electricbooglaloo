      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the business is entered on may I, Sir, through you, ask a question of the Leader of the House?  Yesterday's Order Paper for the Dáil contained a substantial number of Bills that are down for Second Reading for next Tuesday. Can we have any indication of how many of these Bills it is expected to pass before we rise for the recess? Some of them, such as the Industrial Relations Bill, for example, arise out of the passing of the Emergency Powers Act.  I understand, of course, that it must be passed, but there are others, such for example, as the Industrial Research and Standards Bill, and the Air Navigation and Transport Bill.  Are we to understand that these are to be added to the programme that is to be put before us, and, if so, can we be told at what date in October the House will rise?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hearne</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that while there is a considerable amount of business before the House it is desirable that all the Bills indicated by Senator Hayes should be passed by the Seanad before the recess.  It is desirable, I understand, that the Industrial Research and Standards Bill should be passed in this session in order to have the bureau established.  The passing of the Air Navigation and Transport Bill is also necessary since, I understand, it may be necessary to have some agreements implemented under it.  In that connection, I would suggest that members of the House should be given an opportunity of expressing an opinion as to the number of days in each of the weeks ahead the House should meet so that the business before us may be <Col N="324" /> completed.  I would suggest that the House should meet on Tuesday next so as to expedite the completion of the business before us.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>It is extraordinary how little Ministers change in spite of the politics.  Ministers always have Bills which take years to frame and when they are framed they become immediately urgent.  I can understand that, if the Air Navigation and Transport Bill is based on some agreements, there may be a question of dates, and that it would be necessary to pass it.  I suggest, however, it is desirable that we would not be called upon to do all this programme in the last week of July.  The programme that appears before us now is an enormous one, and I suggest to Senator Hearne that there should be some consultation about it outside the House so that when we meet after 7 o'clock it may be possible to put some proposals before the House for meeting on Tuesday next.</P>

      <P>On that point, could we be told what business is to come before the House next week?  I am aware that there are a number of Bills before the Dáil, which is not sitting to-day. In view of that, it would seem to me that we will not have any more business to do next week than that which appears on the Order Paper.</P>

    <Title>Superannuation Bill, 1946  (  Certified Money Bill )&mdash;  Second and subsequent Stages.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Aiken) Frank Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Aiken)</NameTxt>
      <P>The object of this Bill is to provide permanently certain powers which had been taken under the emergency powers legislation in relation to superannuation. Section 1 of the Superannuation Act of 1887 gave power to the Treasury, which has been adapted to mean the Minister for Finance, to make a warrant regulating the grant of gratuities and annual allowances payable to a person employed in the Civil Service of the State who was injured in the actual discharge of his duty without his own default and by some injury <Col N="326" /> specifically attributable to the nature of his duty.  The section prescribed, however, that the maximum gratuity should not exceed one year's salary of the person injured and that the allowance under the section should not, together with any superannuation allowance to which the individual was otherwise entitled, exceed the salary of the person injured or £300 a year, whichever was less. Power was also granted to make an award to the widow, wholly dependent mother and children of a civil servant, who, having been injured in the circumstances I have indicated, died from the injury.</P>
      <P>I propose in Section 2 of the present Bill to replace the authority given under Emergency Powers (No. 356) Order, 1945, to modify the provisions of the earlier Act.  In the first place, a period is being set in regard to death resulting from the injury.  The time limit, as the Bill indicates, is within seven years after the date of the injury and the death must be the direct result of the injury.  I propose further to supply a deficiency in the earlier statute and to provide for the case of the wife who is the breadwinner and who is supporting a disabled husband.  To meet certain income-tax difficulties in regard to the payment of dependents' allowances I have incorporated a purely verbal amendment under which payment can be made to or in respect of the children.  I propose also to remove the upper limit of £300 a year laid down in the earlier Act as that figure is unnecessarily low by reference to modern standards and conditions and I am substituting therefor a proviso that an allowance granted to an injured person shall not, together with any superannuation allowance for which he is otherwise qualified, exceed five-sixths of the actual annual salary and emoluments of the office held by him at the date of injury.  In determining this five-sixths figure, the annuity value of the lump sum payable to civil servants to whom the Superannuation Act, 1909, applies will be taken into account.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the House approves of this amendment and these new provisions are duly enacted, I propose to lay on <Col N="327" /> the Table without delay a new warrant containing the provisions which will hereafter apply.</P>
    <P>Section 3 is entirely new and deals with a special case in respect of which it was found necessary to take exceptional measures when the Public Services (Temporary Economies) Act, 1933, was being enacted.  On account of personal undertakings given to the individual concerned shortly after the Saorstát Éireann administration began to function, my predecessor, who promoted the Public Services (Temporary Economies) Act, felt, after representations made to him from the Opposition Benches, that an exception should be made, and this officer was exempted from the reductions in salary applied to civil servants generally.</P>
    <P>In view of the headline set in the 1933 Act, I have felt that this officer should similarly be exempted from the bonus stabilisation provisions imposed on the Civil Service as a whole.</P>
    <P>The section empowers the grant to the individual concerned of a superannuation award calculated by reference to the salary, inclusive of bonus, which the officer would have received if the Civil Service (Stabilisation of Bonus) Regulations, 1940, did not apply to him immediately before the date of his retirement.</P>
    <P>When the Civil Service (Stabilisation of Bonus) Regulations, 1940, were modified to admit of the payment to civil servants of bonus related to a cost-of-living figure of 210 in lieu of the figure of 185 which had theretofore applied, the Government felt that it would be only equitable that a corresponding benefit should be conferred on pensioners, the determining of whose pensions had been affected by the operation of the Bonus Stabilisation Order.  To meet the difficulty, the Government made an Order entitled Emergency Powers (No. 354) Order, 1945, the effect of which was to empower adjustment of superannuation allowances as from the 1st January, 1945, so as to authorise the payment of a pension computed as if the recipient immediately before his retirement drew remuneration equal to the lesser of the following:&mdash;(a) The remuneration which he would have been in <Col N="328" /> receipt of immediately before his retirement if the Civil Service (Stabilisation of Bonus) Regulations, 1940, had not been made; (b) remuneration calculated by reference to the index number or numbers which exceeds or exceed by 25 points the index number or numbers by reference to which his remuneration was actually calculated immediately before his retirement.</P>
    <P>In simpler language, the effect of (a) and (b) is as follows:&mdash;Where a cost-of-living figure of 205 would have been applicable had there been no stabilisation, the award is revised and related to a figure of 205.  Where a figure of 210 or higher would, but for stabilisation, have applied, the award is related to a figure of 210, the figure of 210 being the upper limit of revision.  The adjustment was, by the Government's decision, confined to annual allowances.</P>
    <P>As Senators are, I think, aware, it is not intended that this Order should be continued under the Supplies and Services (Temporary Provisions) Bill. Accordingly it becomes necessary to make legislative provision to ensure that the pensioners concerned will continue to benefit by the increased rates after the expiration of the Emergency Powers Act, 1939.  I have, therefore, included Section 4 to ensure the retention of authority for the making of these payments.</P>
    <P>The remainder of the Bill consists of the ordinary expenses clause and a citation clause to provide for the inclusion of this particular measure in the superannuation code.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that this Bill should have an easy passage.  Section 2 arises, I think, out of an unfortunate incident&mdash;the death of an inspector of schools.  I myself was interested in that case and I recall that the Act of 1887 appeared to the then Minister for Finance to provide completely insufficient compensation for the person concerned. This Bill enables the Minister for Finance, by warrant, which he states he will lay on the Tables of both Houses, to make better provision for the dependents of a person who dies as a result of injuries in the course of his duty, whether accidental or malicious.  That is one example of a defect found in existing legislation.  It <Col N="329" /> would seem rather absurd at this period that a widow should find herself compensated under the provisions of an Act of 1887, made in entirely different circumstances and from a different point of view.  I think that the Bill is a good one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LouisODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>The trouble I find in dealing with this Bill is that it does not seem to go far enough.  So far as I can see, it does not increase the allowance provided for under the Act of 1887.  Paragraph (b) of Section 2 states: &ldquo;Any allowance granted under this section to an injured person shall not, together with any superannuation allowance for which he is otherwise qualified, exceed five-sixths of the annual salary and emoluments of the office held by him at the date of the injury.&rdquo;  I draw attention to the words &ldquo;together with any superannuation allowance&rdquo;.  My recollection of the Act of 1887 is that you could give a gratuity or a superannuation allowance but that you could not give both.  It did provide for a year's salary up to £300, if it were greater than the other sum.  This provision allows only five-sixths of the annual salary.  That does not seem to me to go sufficiently far. It does not seem to increase the allowance payable on the death of a civil servant.  If a man were only a short time in the employment of the State, his salary would be small and five-sixths of that salary would be a very meagre allowance, having regard to the alternative provided under the Act of 1887.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Senator O'Dea has missed the particular point involved. Under the old Act of 1887 the maximum amount which a civil servant's widow could get if he died or was killed was £300 a year, even if his salary was £1,500.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>Three hundred pounds was the limit even if his salary were £1,500.  If he were a judge, although I do not know that this would cover judicial posts, he might have had a salary of £2,500.  The widow of a civil <Col N="330" /> servant, if he were killed, no matter what his salary was, could only get £300.  This Bill allows us to go to five-sixths of his actual salary and emoluments at the date on which he received the injury.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps we could finish the discussion on this section very shortly if the Minister, instead of quoting the Constitution, would tell us what he has in mind about &ldquo;special circumstances.&rdquo;  We had examples from him yesterday of special circumstances which would enable a person to appoint a substitute to act for him during absence necessitated by membership of the Oireachtas.  Senator O'Dea mentioned yesterday the case of an officer of a local body who was pursuing a course to get better qualifications for himself.  I agree with that. I know, for example, that a national teacher can get leave from the Department of Education to appoint a substitute in his school while he is attending a university course.  He cannot get it always, but the possibility is there of his getting it and I know from personal contacts that some of them do.  It costs a teacher money, of course, but the Department is prepared to grant leave in certain circumstances for a teacher who wants to go to a day course to get an honours degree.  I do not agree with Senator Sir John Keane that the section should be amended so as to provide that the office holder should have nothing to say to the selection of a substitute.  I agree with Senator Ryan that &ldquo;substitute&rdquo; is a better word than &ldquo;deputy&rdquo; because otherwise we are likely to get a bit mixed.  I think that provision should be preserved as it exists in the Bill.  The Minister, of course, should have power to determine <Col N="332" /> whether the substitute's qualifications are sufficient for the purposes of the post.  Neither am I quite sure that we should make an absolutely statutory bar that the person who appoints the substitute should not in any way get some pecuniary benefit from the post.  That is a general proposal to which there might be objections. I should like to leave the circumstances of each particular case to the Department involved.</P>
      <P>A great deal of extraneous matter was drawn into the discussion yesterday. Nobody is questioning&mdash;I am not going to discuss it&mdash;whether local officers should be eligible for membership of the Oireachtas and, as long as they are, obviously they must be allowed to appoint substitutes.  I mention no names, but supposing a man is a member of the Oireachtas and is living in Dublin and his wife is an officer of a local body in Kerry, Cork or Donegal.  Are these &ldquo;special circumstances&rdquo; which should enable her to get leave of absence for a prolonged period?  Personally, I do not think they are, although I think a member of the Government has quite a sound case.  If the Minister would tell us that, we could get over this business quickly.  I am tempted to quote the Constitution but I think the Minister's constitutional point is absolutely childish and expressed with all the impudence that ignorance so frequently carries.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>Must not the section be interpreted for all time by different people?  Why should the Minister be asked to say what his interpretation of the Act is?  He may give one interpretation and the Senator may give another and both may be wrong.  We are making the law and it has to be interpreted as it stands for all time and there is no use in asking a particular Minister what is his interpretation.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Local Government at the particular moment, whoever he is.  In spite of the talk in the country, there is a certain continuity of government.  We had an example of that here to-day at the beginning of business.  Ministers resemble one another in that every Minister has a Bill which is urgent and wants it passed immediately.  There is great continuity in that.  There is an endeavour to have continuity.  As a matter of fact, the Minister for Finance indicated to us on the Superannuation Bill to-day that representations were made to him that a promise was made about 1923, recognised in 1933, recognised again in 1940 and recognised now in 1946.  That shows a certain amount of continuity in the Ministerial attitude towards citizens.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Dea is wrong in saying that the Minister may interpret &ldquo;special circumstances&rdquo; and be wrong. The Minister cannot be wrong; he has the power and will exercise it.  It may be my opinion or Senator O'Dea's opinion that, in a particular case, the Minister was wrong.  The Minister is getting the power and his successor will have it.  It is and always has been possible to set out by way of principle &mdash;and sometimes by way of a speech on general principles&mdash;what the general administrative practice is going to be. That is done quite commonly.  Senator O'Dea must have heard Ministers over and over again say that they are doing now what was done in 1928 or some other years.  That is quite a common line of argument.  When we are asked to give special powers to the Minister, it is quite legitimate to ask him to indicate what he thinks about types of cases and what kind of administration he is going to give.  Otherwise, we would have to put into the Bill a whole series of cases; and, in this particular instance, I believe that is not practicable. There are certain cases we all agree about and the Minister could indicate what the other special circumstances are which he has in mind.</P>

      <P>One may as well ask the meaning of the word &ldquo;absence&rdquo; in <Col N="334" /> the 1941 Act, where the Minister has power to appoint a deputy in the case of absence or illness.  Does that mean enforced absence or some other kind of absence?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Senators have been talking around this section and amendment pretty well.  I would like to acquire some further clarification of the section.  Sub-section (1) says that &ldquo;where the appropriate Minister&rdquo;&mdash;which is not necessarily the Minister for Local Government&mdash;&ldquo;is of opinion&rdquo; that the duties of a certain person should not be performed during a particular period.  That indicates to me that the initiation comes from the Minister.  I feel that that does not cover ordinary cases of sick leave, annual leave or any other leave of absence.  Ordinarily, a local official does not have a deputy employed while on annual or sick leave but someone else has to make up the duties for him. If he is more than six months on sick leave, he is told to get out on pension; and on that, as an aside, I might say that the officials of local authorities have nothing like the satisfactory terms of the pensionable employees in the Civil Service whom we discussed to-day.</P>
      <P>The direction in this case seems to come from above downwards, as it indicates that &ldquo;the Minister is of opinion&rdquo;.  It does not indicate at all that the application is coming from an individual official, through his local authority, to the Minister.  I would be glad if that were the interpretation, as I have an interesting experience to relate.  Almost 20 years ago, I applied for one month's special leave for the purpose of sitting for an examination&mdash; which I was fortunate in getting through, without the leave&mdash;and I offered to get a man to take my place, and to pay him to perform my duties. My application was refused and if I could have appealed to the Minister at the time I might have done so.  I give that as an example to show that this section does not seem to apply at all.  If it does, the discussion seems to be in order.  If it cannot be applied, all these points about an officer recommending an official to take his place seem to be out of order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="335" /> On the point Senator Keane raised, if the authority had to look for someone, they would have to advertise. When I looked for a month's leave for a specific purpose&mdash;a commendable purpose&mdash;I said I would get someone to take my place.  Having suggested and recommended such a person, it would rest with the local authority to be satisfied and I presume that would be sanctioned by the central authority. I fancy the onus would be placed on me to suggest a <i>locum tenens.</i>  On the other hand, the local authority would have to publish an announcement and select a person, which would be very difficult.  I have been rather confused as to the interpretation of the section and the debate that has taken place upon it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir John Keane Sir John Keane">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a great difference between asking the holder, who seeks to have his duties done by a deputy, whom he suggests might be suitable and giving him a statutory right of nomination.</P>
      <P>The statutory right of nomination does give a certain vested interest to the holder in regard to his deputy.  Only one consideration should govern the appointment of a deputy, that is, the public interest, but the public interest does not get full play under any system which allows nomination to the holder.  Unless the Minister gives some very convincing reason, I propose on Report Stage&mdash;for what it is worth; it is not worth very much, I know&mdash;to put down an amendment to delete that right of nomination.</P>
      <P>Would the Minister give some information with regard to the question of emoluments?  Has he in mind that in no circumstances shall the holder retain emoluments for the office?  It seems most undesirable that he should retain any.  Will the local authority be told, or will the public know, if emoluments are retained, to what extent they are retained?  There is very considerable public uneasiness in resect of this question of retaining emoluments when deputies are functioning.  I feel the Minister, if he does sanction retention of emoluments, should let it be known what the arrangements are, or, better still, he should accept a statutory provision that no emoluments are to be retained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="336" /> Lastly, I think the Minister should give the House some indication as to how he will exercise his discretion in considering special circumstances.  I know he cannot in a reply cover the whole ground, but I will put a special case.  Would he sanction a deputy in the case where a local official, a lady, wanted to appoint a deputy in order to join her husband, who is a civil servant, living in a distant area?  That is a definite case.  So-and-so is a civil servant employed in Dublin.  His wife is a local authority employee in a place some distance away.  Would he, in that case, consider the appointment of a deputy would fall within the category of &ldquo;special circumstances?&rdquo; I hope the Minister will answer that. I am entitled to ask him to answer it. It may be hypothetical, but it will be some indication of what he has in mind in the exercise of discretion in regard to &ldquo;special circumstances.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>There is nothing more remarkable than the inclination which we have, when difficult matters are under discussion, to try to cut or shape our cloak to suit our friends and, perhaps, on occasions, to suit ourselves.  I gather it is all very well that I should have this power to authorise the appointment of a deputy if by any chance the public officer involved happens to be engaged in politics.  Then, those who are pretty critical about the scheme say it is quite a proper thing, in these circumstances, that the Minister should have power to appoint a deputy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Membership of the Oireachtas in this case, yes.  On that point it may not be perhaps without certain historical interest to disclose to the House that there was actually, in the year 1922, a Statute which forbade officers of public authorities to be Members of Parliament.  We were not the Administration at that time.  We did not initiate the practice, but it suited some people to ignore that particular Statute and, the precedent <Col N="337" /> having been created, it has been ignored ever since.  I have not heard any person suggest that that was done from a wrong or political motive or for any purpose but the highest regard for the best public interest.</P>
      <P>I was saying, Sir, that it is extraordinary how we all like in matters of this sort, to make sure that our friends will be on the right side of the line.  I am not concerned about political circumstances.  I do not mind whether there would be a vacancy created in this or that other constituency if a prominent member of mine or any other Party were to be precluded from sitting in the Oireachtas so long as he holds a public office.  I am concerned by this section to ensure that if a reasonable case is put up to me for the appointment of a deputy, I will have the authority of the Oireachtas to permit me to authorise the person who makes that application to appoint a deputy in circumstances which appear to me to justify an appointment.</P>
      <P>I will not, by giving any outline as to how I should deal with some hypothetical circumstances, bind myself in any way or, perhaps, arouse in the mind of some unfortunate public officer the hope or expectation that, if he comes along to me with a case that suits him exactly, he is going to be permitted to appoint a deputy, when I may find, on looking into the case, that the circumstances do not warrant me in issuing that authorisation. I should then perhaps be charged with a breach of public faith.  For that reason, I am not going to detail any of the circumstances which I would regard as special circumstances. Whether there are special circumstances or not will emerge when any particular case is brought to my notice and I will then become the judge of what I consider to be the special circumstances which would justify the appointment of a deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a multitude of cases that have emerged in the past in which it would have been, I think, right and proper that this power might be exercised&mdash;cases of people who were not ill themselves, but who had a near relative ill, cases of people who <Col N="338" /> were faced with sudden family calamity which would necessitate, perhaps, their absence from duty for a certain period. There has been a number of cases with which I was unable to deal because of the fact that I did not feel at all certain as to what my powers were.  I feel that in matters of this sort we shall have to rely, as is customary in matters of general administration, upon the desire of the Minister to exercise his functions with strict regard to his responsibility to the Dáil but also with some regard to human considerations.  That is all that we are asking for in this section. I may be ignorant, perhaps, of certain circumstances.  I do not know whether I am speaking with the impudence of ignorance but Senator Hayes has professed a great deal of ignorance on this matter.</P>

It is not a particular case; it is a general case.  I do not know what the circumstances of Senator O'Donovan's case were but anyhow that does not matter.  I think a professional man who wanted a month's leave at his own expense in order to get a better qualification should certainly get it unless the public service for the particular moment prevents him.

      <P>In a general way, yes, with due regard, remember, to the interests of the public service.  When I say that I do not want it to be taken that, if some person feels like taking a trip to America, this would be an excuse to get permission, or that I would be quite justified in letting him go.  I want to make it quite clear that it will not be given unless a proper case is made to justify the authorisation. With regard to the point Senator O'Donovan made, I think he was really concerned to ensure that the initiative in a matter of this sort would not always have to come from the Minister. I think the Senator can rest assured that if some person brings to the attention of the Minister facts which render it desirable that sub-section (1) of the section should be given effect to, the Minister will then proceed to act on that basis.</P>

      <P>It is there to cover the case in which the Minister is satisfied that during a certain period there might be a conflict between private and public interest, so far as an officer was concerned, a conflict which, if it existed, might make it perhaps desirable that the officer should cease to function altogether for a certain period &mdash;something which the officer perhaps could not do unless he got special authority to appoint a deputy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>One would imagine that the wording should be &ldquo;need not be performed.&rdquo;  Senator O'Donovan's point is rather a good <Col N="340" /> point&mdash;that the office &ldquo;should not be performed&rdquo; rather indicates that the Minister has come to the conclusion that the particular person should not be there.

      <P>I can understand the Minister's reluctance to answer the hypothetical case I put to him, although it was a perfectly straightforward case and one of a kind which might normally happen, but I do not quite appreciate his reluctance to answer my questions about the nomination.  I take it that he is adamant on the matter of the right to nominate and also on a refusal to have statutory provisions against the retention of emoluments.  Both of these matters, I am afraid, I shall have to bring up again on the Report Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one feature in connection with this measure which, to me, has been rather encouraging.  There has been a good deal of research into practices on the other side, where they have, of course, a long record of legislation in local government, but I am rather disappointed that in this matter we have not had the assistance of Senator Ryan, who is very diligent in his researches with regard to the publication of local government inspector's reports, but who has not been of similar <Col N="341" /> assistance to us in this matter. We have no right to claim it, of course, but we hoped that we might have had his assistance with regard to the appointment of deputies.  Experience of that kind would be a help to us.  I can see a deputy with very few years' service, the holder of an office with five years' service, being allowed, in circumstances like those I have indicated, to join her husband who is a civil servant, and being 20 years away from duty, during which period the deputy is acting.  Is that a desirable state of affairs?  There is no time limit in the section and I feel that there should be some attempt to impose a time limit on the period during which deputies should be allowed to function. I hope the matter may again be considered on Report.</P>

      <P>Am I to understand that this section is in addition to the provisions of the 1941 Act in regard to illness?  I note in the Schedule that Section 19 of the 1941 Act has not been repealed, and I therefore presume that it is still extant.  If so, will the Minister tell us whether, under the 1941 Act, in the case of certified illness, the Minister has power to continue the approval of the nomination of a deputy for as long as the holder of an office may be ill, or is there any restriction in time in respect of it?  There is a restriction in the initial stages, but can it be renewed again and again?  The Minister in his Second Reading speech indicated that, as well as illness, there are some other cases which were covered by the 1941 Act, and I should like to be a little clearer as to what, in his view, is covered by that Act.  We had an indication of what it is intended to cover in this Bill, but perhaps the Minister would indicate what he intended to cover under the old regulations as against what is being covered in this measure.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Senator looks at the Local Government Officers' Regulations, 1943, he will see what the Minister for Local Government thinks was covered by the 1941 Act.  There is, however, a much more precise reference in these regulations to medical officers of hospital or dispensary districts <Col N="342" /> than there is to any other type of officer, whereas Section 38 is a general section giving authority to deal with all officers.  With regard to sick leave and so on, paragraph 20 of the regulations sets out that the manager may grant sick leave to any officer incapable of performing his duties owing to illness or physical injury and may pay salary during sick leave.  Then follows a long statement of the circumstances which runs to almost two pages.  I do not suppose the Senator wishes me to read them.</P>

      <P>These cover what might be described as the ordinary routine type of cases and do not cover any cases in which special circumstances may arise.  On the question of emoluments, I think it would be quite impossible to lay down a rule that all the emoluments would be payable to a deputy, because in, say, the case of a dispensary doctor, he not only appoints his deputy to carry out his duties as dispensary doctor but also appoints him to look after his private practice.  We would simply get into a state of the utmost confusion and certainly one which would clog the administration unduly, if we put in a general statement that all emoluments are to be reserved to the deputy.  I think it would be quite impossible for us to keep publishing these arrangements from day to day.  One may be perfectly certain that, where the deputy satisfies the requirements of the Minister, which are that he is fully qualified, and, by ability and experience, a proper person to fill the post, the terms he will make with regard to emoluments with his principal will be sufficiently exacting to leave that principal very little profit out of the farming out of the office, which is what the Senator appears to fear.</P>

Apart from its legality, it is also a matter of public decency.  In a case of that kind what is of public interest is of more importance than the legality of the position.  What I mean is, that where a person is appointed to a position, and temporarily appoints a substitute&mdash;where that goes on for a period of years&mdash;I think the holder of the office should be given the choice of adopting one or other of the two careers he is trying to follow.  Where people enter political life and leave behind them positions under local authorities, <Col N="344" /> it is not unreasonable to suggest that special circumstances should be reviewed and these persons asked to choose one career or the other.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Minister will accept this amendment.  It is actually in accordance with views he expressed on the Second Reading, when he stated that the section does not imply that an officer must devote all his hours to his official duties.  It appals me to think that we should pass the sub-section as it is.  It reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(k)  requiring holders to devote the whole of their time to the duties of their offices.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That means, as far as words convey anything, that it is not alone waking hours or sleeping hours, but all hours must be devoted to the duties of their offices, even on Sundays and holidays. The words cannot mean anything else. I shall mention to the House a case where the Oireachtas, when passing certain legislation, considered that such and such was the interpretation to be given it, or that such would be the interpretation of a Minister in charge of a Bill when it was going through the Oireachtas.  But if it goes to court&mdash;it is just possible that some day the interpretation of this section would be discussed <Col N="345" /> in court&mdash;I can picture no other interpretation being given to it by a judge, but that sleeping hours, waking hours and all hours are to be devoted to the services of local authorities.  I know that is not what is meant.</P>
    <P>On the Second Reading the Minister stated that it was not intended that all waking hours should be devoted to the duties.  What I suggest is that the officers should devote the total hours of duty to the office.  I think the Minister should accept the amendment, as it seems to be his interpretation of what is meant.  If the wording of the section is to remain I violently disagree with it.</P>
    <P>When the Milk and Dairies Act of 1935 passed through the Oireachtas I am quite satisfied that Section 60 was interpreted by every member of the Oireachtas as it was interpreted by local authorities.  That section reads:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(1)  It shall not be lawful for any person by himself or his servant to sell or deliver to a purchaser in any highway or public place milk from a vehicle or from a can or other receptacle unless there is conspicuously inscribed on such vehicle, can or receptacle his name and address and (as the case may be) the words &lsquo;Bainne ar díol&rsquo;, &lsquo;Uachtar ar díol&rsquo; or &lsquo;Bláthach ar díol&rsquo;.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is why you see the words &ldquo;Bainne ar díol&rdquo; on milk cars.  The intention of the Oireachtas unquestionably was, that anyone delivering milk on the public street should have the words &ldquo;Bainne ar díol&rdquo; on the cars.  When the matter was brought to court and a case made before the district justice, it was pointed out that a person who delivers milk at a door-step or in a garden is not standing on a public highway; that the only person to whom the section could apply was one selling milk in College Green, and having a bugle, the same as for the sale of ice cream.</P>
    <P>I am speaking from actual experience. It means that no case can be brought, because, although the milk is being delivered through the thoroughfare, it is not being sold on the thoroughfare.  That is an example. No matter what the interpretation of the Oireachtas may be and no <Col N="346" /> matter what the Minister says his interpretation is of the words in the Bill, if it happens to go before a justice or a judge he will say that the person must devote the whole of his time, and that is every hour of the day. That is not so preposterous, because I can say that I can be called on at any hour of the day or night and must answer that call.  I have answered it on numerous occasions.  Therefore, if this thing is interpreted generally, it will apply to every official, whether he is a junior clerk or any type of inspector. I think the Minister should seriously consider not having such words enacted in this Bill.  He did mention that the term &ldquo;whole-time&rdquo; has been defined in numerous previous Acts.  I do not know what these are.</P>

The important thing is that I have to be there at the start.  Knocking-off time does not apply to me.  I have to do the work while it is there to be done. I have to do the work at any hour of the day or night, even on Sundays and holidays.  I have no objection to that. But, as it was discussed, I can certainly say that if this Bill is passed as it is I would undoubtedly be debarred from being a member of the Oireachtas by that section.  I have never spent an hour of my official time performing my duties in the Seanad.  I am here in my own time, namely, during my annual leave.  I have never come here otherwise than on my annual leave.  It may be a hardship, but I accepted the position.  I was free to come here because I could come here in what I regarded as my own time.  If this were passed, I would not be entitled to come here, because the whole of my time must be devoted to the duties of my office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it is very reasonable that we should put into this that he shall devote the whole of his hours of duty to <Col N="347" /> the duties of his office, from such a time in the morning until such a time in the evening.  Unquestionably, the officer should devote the whole of that time.  If he is not doing it, apart from breaking any regulations, in many cases his own professional organisation will see that he will do it.</P>
    <P>There must be some intention at the back of this section to restrict whole-time professional men from doing outside practice.  If that be so, surely their own professional organisations are there to restrict them.  I certainly never have, and I would be very quickly rapped on the knuckles by my professional organisation if I tried to practise outside of my official hours, or to do anything else than give my services to the local authority.  If that would apply to engineers, architects or anybody else, surely they have their own organisations to prevent whole-time local authority officials from doing these things.  Whatever is at the back of the introduction of this as an additional section, I think it is too farreaching and more restricting on any local official than ever has been the case before.  In the Act of 1941, Section 19 (1) (c) gives the Minister the power of determining the hours of duty.  He has the power to make regulations determining the hours of duty.  I think that paragraph should be deleted if we are to insert now an additional paragraph (k) saying that holders shall devote the whole of their time to the duties of their offices. There is no sense in paragraph (c) indicating that the Minister can make regulations to determine hours of duty, because the hours are all hours of the day or night.  I ask the Minister to consider this reasonable proposition seriously.  He has stated that he is a reasonable man when he has a case made to him, and I think I have made a very strong case and that he should consider it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid that in the circumstances in which Senator O'Donovan finds himself, to adopt his amendment would merely intensify his disabilities, because he has told us that he is on duty at all hours; that he may be on duty for the 24 hours around. <Col N="348" /> Therefore, if I am to substitute for the word &ldquo;time&rdquo; the words &ldquo;hours of duty&rdquo;, requiring holders to devote the whole of their hours of duty, the whole of the 24 hours of the day, to their office, I think that Senator O'Donovan's plight would be even worse than it is at present.  For that reason alone, I suggest that we should not consider his amendment.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Donovan has referred to Section 19 of the Act of 1941 and called attention to the fact that under sub-section (1) of that section the Minister is empowered to determine hours of duty.  But there is nothing in the section which gives the Minister power to require people to devote the whole of their time within their dutiable hours to the functions of their office. That is a flaw in the section as originally drafted which we are now endeavouring to remedy, for that reason and for other reasons.  I have a whole list of things which I may prescribe, covering remuneration, payment of travelling expenses, hours of duty and providing for records of attendance, but I have not the power, which is essential, to ensure that these things are fulfilled or that the conditions which regulate the grant of remuneration are complied with.  I have no power to require an officer appointed by a public authority to come to his office at the time he is supposed to.</P>

      <P>It may be implied, but we want to make it explicit.  I think that that is very desirable.  If a person is appointed to a public office and paid out of public funds and somebody comes along and says: &ldquo;This man is not attending to his job,&rdquo; although the Minister has power to fix hours and all sorts of conditions relating to remuneration, travelling expenses, etc., the Minister has not power to attach to the conditions of this man's appointment the fundamental condition that during the hours that he is supposed to be in attendance he will in fact be giving the attention to his duties which the post requires. That is one aspect of this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The next aspect is that there has been continuous difficulty arising out <Col N="349" /> of the Superannuation Acts of dealing with the question of pensionability.  The law in that regard has been very unsatisfactory. The Union Officers' Superannuation Act of 1865 prescribes that that Act applies to any officers whose whole time has been devoted to the service of the union.  There have been attempts made to clarify that condition by substituting the words &ldquo;entire time to the service of the union,&rdquo; but we have all through the Superannuation Acts, up to 1925, the phrase that &ldquo;pensionable officer means any officer who devotes the whole of his time to the service of one or more local bodies.&rdquo;  If that phrase were to be interpreted in the same unreasonable way as Senator O'Donovan suggested, nobody would get superannuation. But we have interpreted it in a reasonable way.  We want to get rid of the question which now frequently arises when an officer retires, as to whether he was appointed to a whole-time post or not, and we can do that by specifying in the conditions of appointment that the post is a whole-time one.</P>
    <P>How are you to define a whole-time post unless in the terms indicated here &mdash;a post which requires its holder to devote the whole of his time to the duties of the office?  We have to deal with this in a reasonable and rational way.  It is not proposed to ask any person to give the whole of his attention to a post during the 24 hours of the day.  Senator O'Donovan has suggested an amendment and I have pointed out that his particular case would be worsened rather than improved by the amendment.</P>
    <P>But there are posts which are regarded as whole-time posts and which in future would be described as whole-time posts where it is not possible to fix hours of duty, and perhaps it is not desirable.  Take the case of a rate collector.  He may be a whole-time man and yet you cannot say that he will collect rates only between the hours of 10 o'clock and 5 o'clock and, if anybody wants to give him rates before the hour of 10 o'clock in the morning or after 5 o'clock in the evening or wants to pay them on Sunday at the Church door, that he cannot take them and that he will not be regarded as <Col N="350" /> doing his work properly unless he has fixed hours of duty and collects the rates during that period.</P>
    <P>I stated in the Dáil and here that it is not intended to alter, to their detriment, the positions of any existing officers.  It is not proposed to require officers to give the whole of their time unreasonably to the duties of their posts, but it is desirable that the Minister should be in a position to say: &ldquo;I require you to devote the whole of your time to the duties of your post,&rdquo; and if any question arises in relation to that matter I am perfectly certain, just as in the case cited by Senator O'Donovan, that the courts will interpret these conditions as reasonable, and if there is any doubt it will be to the benefit of the individual rather than to the benefit of the State.</P>

      <P>That is one of the difficulties I see.  If it were to refer only to future employments, when the appointments are to be made it could be indicated whether they were whole or part-time.  The Minister mentioned the position of rate collector.  I wish he would make some attempt to clarify that position.  At the moment it is most difficult.  I know a man who had <Col N="351" /> a very big collection district and it was held he was not a whole-time officer because he did other work.  Another man who had not half the amount of his collection to make resigned and it was held that he was a whole-time officer because he had not another appointment.  Something should be done to clarify that position.</P>

      <P>The Minister stated that there was a flaw in Section 19 of the Local Government Act, 1941, and that this section has been brought in to remedy that flaw.  I think there is a flaw in the section which the Minister is introducing, because, as it reads, it would empower him to make an Order requiring a person who is employed as a part-time officer to devote the whole of his time to the duties of his office. I suggest that on the Report Stage the Minister should bring in an amendment inserting before the words &ldquo;requiring holders&rdquo; the words &ldquo;in the case of whole-time offices&rdquo;; that would require holders to devote the whole of their time to the duties of their offices.  That applies only to a whole-time office.  As the section stands, in the case of a dispensary doctor the Minister could make an Order requiring him to devote the whole of his time to the work of the dispensary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Only.  He should have power to apply it only to whole-time officers.  The intention is that if a man is appointed to a position as a whole-time officer, he should devote the whole of his time to the duties of his office.  If he is part-time the Minister ought not have power to make an <Col N="352" /> Order, as he would have under this section, requiring that part-time officer to devote the whole of his time to the duties of his office.  I think it is a reasonable amendment.</P>
      <P>As regards the point raised by Senator O'Donovan, it would require the repeal of a whole code of superannuation Acts to make his amendment fit in with his idea as to what a whole-time officer should be&mdash;that is that he should devote the whole of his hours of duty to the office. I think Senator O'Donovan is quite safe in saying that the Minister will not require a whole-time officer to devote all his waking and sleeping hours to his office.  Of course, the definition of whole-time officer has been very unsatisfactory especially when it is a question as to whether such an officer of a local authority is or is not entitled to a pension or whether he is entitled to a pension under the superannuation Acts.  Therefore, if the Minister takes power to require holders of offices to devote the whole of their time to the duties of their offices he should only have power to make such an Order for whole-time officers and, therefore, I suggest the section should be amended on Report.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to consider on the Report Stage the points raised by Senator Ryan.  It is not quite so easy to deal with the matter in the way he suggests because it is contemplated that at some time or other a number of amalgamations may take place.  We might amalgamate two or three part-time officers and, by reason of an aggregation of duties, they might in fact become whole-time officers.  If I were to accept the amendment precisely in the form suggested by Senator Ryan it might subsequently be difficult for me to convert, say, three part-time offices into a whole-time office.  I would, however, like to emphasise this particular aspect of the amendment of the section&mdash;that is, it will make it clear beyond doubt that if we are able to do this, whether the person has a pensionable office or not, that would be of particular importance in relation to another measure which is now being drafted and which I have been pressed to introduce in connection with superannuation <Col N="353" /> of officers employed by local authorities.  I may say straightway that, unless we are able to solve this problem of pensionability by some simple declaration such as I have proposed here, it might not be possible to introduce that Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would suggest to the Minister that he cannot make any Order requiring the holder of an office to devote the whole of his time to the duties of that office unless and until the status of that officer has thus been determined.  There must be some determination that the officer is a whole-time officer.  The Minister must determine that first.  Not until then, can the Minister make an Order requiring the holder of such an office to devote the whole of his time to the duties of that office.  That is what I suggest and it is a condition precedent that the status should be determined before any Order is made.</P>

      <P>Before I withdraw, I would like to say that I have not received much enlightenment in the debate that has just taken place. Senator Ryan has pointed out that the question of a whole-time officer is very indefinite.  At the same time he wants to amend this still further by putting in a whole-time officer shall devote the whole of his time.  I am strenuously <Col N="354" /> opposed to &ldquo;the whole of his time.&rdquo;  Words can only mean one thing.  I fear that no matter what the Minister may say, or what the Act may mean, a still further interpretation may be put upon this matter by the legal fraternity.  I may say now that I have a deep distrust of legal people.  In the debates in this House one legal representative will emphatically assert that so-and-so is the correct interpretation and a colleague of his will equally emphatically declare that such-and-such is correct.  When the matter comes before a judge on the bench he may say that both these gentlemen are wrong and that his interpretation is the correct one. The point I wish to emphasise is during his &ldquo;sleeping and waking hours&rdquo;.  I think some definition is absolutely essential as far as hours of duty are concerned.  The position here is definitely unsatisfactory in my opinion.  However, the Minister has said that he will look into the matter between this and the Report Stage.  In those circumstances I somewhat reluctantly withdraw the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayden</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to move the deletion of Section 41.  I am surprised at the Minister for Local Government and Public Health introducing such a pernicious section into any Bill.  In that section he wants to pin down the employees of a local authority. I have been a member of a local authority for 26 years.  During all that time I and my brother councillors have advocated a living wage for the workers.  Some time ago in the other House the Minister for Local Government and Public Health said that those workers were a privileged class. These workers work an eight-hour day from Monday morning to Saturday night for a miserable 39/- a week.  Their only sustenance during that day is a drop of tea and a bit of bread without butter, sitting on the side of the road. Every day is for them a black fast day. If the Minister regards this class of workers as privileged then I am afraid that he has fallen into a very grave error.  We have been asking our council to increase the wages and they took from last January to April to get <Col N="356" /> an increase of 3/- &mdash; that is, from 39/- to 42/-. To my amazement I discovered at the last meeting of the council that that 42/- a week had not been paid.  The position is that if these workers are employed on work which previously came under the board of health they only receive 6/6.  If they work on the roads they get 7/-.  They have not yet received that increase of 3/-.  The Minister wants to pin down the road workers still further now by the introduction of this section.  I think it is very unfair to a local authority that they have no power to give their employees a decent living wage under present conditions.  The workers to-day, with even 42/- a week, are living under the most miserable conditions and trying to eke out a miserable existence for themselves and their families.  I know families to-day who cannot attend divine worship because they have no clothes.</P>
      <P>A suit of clothes costs £9 or £10. How could a man with 42/- a week be expected to pay that for a suit of clothes, and at the same time educate his children and provide them with the necessaries of life?  I appeal to the Minister to withdraw the section.  I am sure that he is a kind-hearted man, and that if he came down to the rural areas with me and saw the condition of some of these unfortunate road workers, how they are trying to eke out an existence, he would not ask the local authorities to pin them down to the 1942 rate.  The road workers and the agricultural labourers, on whom this nation depended for its food supplies during the war, are deserving of some better recompense from a Christian and a Catholic country than that which they are getting in the way of wages.  They are entitled to be provided with a decent standard of living.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The position in regard to this matter is that the Minister has already power to control the remuneration paid to officers.  It is proposed in this section, within limits, to take power to control the remuneration paid to all the employees of local authorities.  If it is right that the Minister should control the remuneration of one section, then surely a democrat like Senator Hayden cannot <Col N="357" /> deny that there should be equality.  It is not proposed that there should be a privileged class in the employment of local authorities whose remuneration is not subject to control.  As to the adequacy of the remuneration, I do not propose to enter into a controversy on that.  The point at issue here is whether there should be some controlling authority in the interests of the community.</P>
      <P>I pointed out on the Second Stage of this Bill that the State is, by far, the largest contributor to the funds of local authorities and that, in many cases, it is the largest single ratepayer: that it pays the agricultural grant and other subventions which go to local authorities. Therefore, the State is very largely responsible for maintaining and carrying on these services.  If public moneys are voted by the Dáil for the purpose of providing certain services, surely the Minister who represents the Oireachtas in a matter of this sort should have the power to see that these moneys are properly devoted to the purpose for which they were intended&mdash; that is the purpose of providing the services&mdash;and that an undue proportion of them is not diverted under political or local pressure, to the payment of undue remuneration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, the standard which the Government has taken since 1942 by which to determine the adequacy of the remuneration is a very simple one.  It is the remuneration which has been agreed upon as that which might, in present circumstances, be reasonably offered to agricultural labourers.  The agricultural labourer is a person who resides in the same district as the road worker and the general mass of county council employees.  He has to work a 54-hour week.  He has not such security as the great majority of employees of local authorities have.  He has, perhaps, a rather more exacting taskmaster in a way, and most agricultural labourers have to give very good value for their wage.  I am not so certain that, in all the circumstances, the road worker is so laboriously occupied as the agricultural labourer.  In all these circumstances it seems to me that we have not been unfair to county council employees and road workers.  We have said that for <Col N="358" /> a 48-hour week they will be allowed to get as much as the agricultural worker gets for a 54-hour week.</P>
    <P>There are other circumstances to be taken into consideration too.  If we can manage to get over the difficulties about part-time and whole-time officers and the question of pensionability relating to the tenure of a post, there will be, in due course, a Superannuation Bill coming along here, and under it local authorities will be empowered to provide pensions for their workers. These pensions will be paid anyhow on what would be reasonably favourable terms to the road workers concerned. The agricultural labourers have no such prospect, at the moment at any rate, of getting a pension in the same way, and I think that, taking it all in all, we have a just right to try to exercise some general control over the remuneration paid to this section of workers.  I think we have exercised that right fairly reasonably.</P>
    <P>The section in the Bill, it should be noted, provides that road workers can get, without the sanction of the Minister, the rate of wages which they were in receipt of in 1942.  If their remuneration is to be increased above that level the sanction of the Minister is required, and the sanction of the Minister, I think, has been given with reasonable fairness in most cases.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>Possibly Senator Hayden would be satisfied if the words in the section, &ldquo;not greater&rdquo;, were changed to &ldquo;at the same rate&rdquo;.  On the question of pension rights for workers in certain areas of most counties, it is to be remembered that road workers are employed only for an alternate week or a fortnight.  Their employment is of an intermittent nature.  There is a great danger, therefore, that unless special provision is made for them they will not be entitled to a pension.  I do not know whether it is the intention of the Minister to make provision for pensions for them, especially in view of the nature of their employment.</P>

      <P>Section 45 enables the Minister to direct the road authority which made the application for the bridge order or any other road authority to prepare and furnish to him a preliminary report. The Minister will not direct the preparation of such a preliminary report unless he is satisfied that there is substance in the application for the bridge order.  If an authority proposed to build a bridge which would be so costly that its commercial and social value would be entirely offset by the very high costs to the ratepayers and the State, the Minister might say: &ldquo;We shall no longer proceed with this matter&rdquo; and the preliminary report <Col N="360" /> might show that there were physical difficulties which could not be overcome. It would be very unreasonable, in these circumstances, to require the road authority, responsible under the direction of the Minister for preparing these plans and enabling the Minister to make his decision, to meet the full cost of the preparation of the plans. In these circumstances, all the local authorities who might have benefited by the bridge, if its construction had been deemed desirable, should bear the cost.  It is not possible to accept the amendment.</P>

The provision simply means that the Minister must be consulted.  It is not suggested that there should be any delay in the reconstruction of a bridge.  It is merely a matter of public policy to ensure that there be co-ordination between the two Ministers concerned.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;The Government, on the nomination of the Taoiseach, have appointed the following persons to be Parliamentary Secretaries pursuant to Section 7 (1) of the Ministers and Secretaries Act, 1924, with effect from the 9th June, 1944:&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 30:</P>
      <P>In sub-section (1) to insert after the word &ldquo;means&rdquo; in line 35, the words and brackets &ldquo;(other than an advertisement for any hotel, guest house, shop or other place of business)&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is the section which prohibits traffic signs on roads except when those signs are in accordance with the regulations which the Minister shall make prescribing the size, shape and colour and character of such signs.  Let me state at once that, perhaps, the making of regulations prescribing the size, shape, colour and character of the signs is an executive act but suppose we leave that for the moment. The difficulty that I am in is that I want to ensure that this section will be operated so that it will not be an undue hardship on ordinary traders, advertising their establishments.  I understand of course that the signs which the local authorities are to put up will be standardised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be entirely wrong, as I agreed with the Minister on a previous occasion, that these signs should in any way advertise any private person's business, but it appears to me unfair that existing private signs should be interfered with.  I know one particular sign on the Naas Road which says &ldquo;So-and-so's garage, 200 yards.&rdquo;  Under the wording of this section as it stands at present, that advertisement would be a breach of the law.  Clearly the Minister could not permit the ordinary local authority's signs to be the same <Col N="366" /> size as that.  There is another sign on the same road which, I think, at least one other Senator on the other side of the House knows, perhaps, as well as I do.  It reminds you that a certain hotel is within 300 yards and, when you have passed that hotel, you see another sign which asks you whether you called to that hotel which is 300 yards back.  I fail to see why the proprietor of that hotel should not be entitled to entice you to go back and sample his wares.  As long as you permit without question an advertisement for, say, Bile Beans to be set up without regard to the scenery of the locality, I fail to see why you should prohibit or restrict in any way a person from putting up an advertisement on private property which may be 30 feet from the road, advertising the fact that he has an hotel or a garage three or four miles ahead or that such-and-such a hotel or an establishment can be reached by the next right turn, or some direction to that effect.  I do not think the section when it was being drawn by the Minister originally was meant to restrict such advertisements and I hope therefore the Minister will accept the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrederickSummerfield" hpid="Mr. Summerfield Mr. Summerfield">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Summerfield</NameTxt>
      <P>There is quite a lot in what Senator Sweetman has said and I think the Minister, on looking into the matter, will agree that something should be done to safeguard signs already in existence.  In some cases, of which I am aware, the person concerned had actually bought an interest in the particular site on which the sign is standing.  I have no intention of delaying the House by going into details beyond stressing the point raised by Senator Sweetman.  I think it is something which the Minister might consider between now and the Report Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that Senator Sweetman's case is already fully covered by the section.  The section does not say that no road sign except an official road sign shall be erected.  It merely prescribes under sub-section (10) that a person other than a road authority shall not provide a traffic sign visible from a road without the consent of the Commissioner. <Col N="367" /> That immediately rules out signs such as &ldquo;Did you call to ...?&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>But look at the definition of &ldquo;traffic sign&rdquo;&mdash;a sign, notice, or instrument.  Clearly, a notice that Sweetman's Hotel was &ldquo;the next turn right&rdquo; or &ldquo;three miles ahead&rdquo; is a notice indicating a place to which the road leads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrederickSummerfield" hpid="Mr. Summerfield Mr. Summerfield">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Summerfield</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a famous one on the road to Howth, saying such-and-such an hotel is 300 yards further on.  It is on the roadside.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I would draw the Minister's attention to the last words of sub-section (2), that &ldquo;no traffic sign shall be provided which is not in accordance with any relevant regulations.&rdquo; Quite clearly, the regulations which the Minister is going to make are regulations standardising the yellow and black signs on the finger-posts all over the country.  It is quite proper that there should not be a different type of finger-post in Kildare from the type in County Carlow.  If the Minister will express his intention on this section, I take it that that is the type of regulation he intends to make.</P>
      <P>The whole thing arises in the definition of &ldquo;traffic sign.&rdquo;  If the definition were restricted to mean purely a finger-sign, directional or official local authority sign, we could get somewhere. I appreciate that the Minister very properly does not want to have private people, in the city, say, for their own purposes, putting up a &ldquo;No parking&rdquo; sign outside their premises. All sorts of private individuals have decided that, by so doing, they could prevent anybody leaving a car outside their premises for a 20 minutes' waiting period.  That, of course, is entirely erroneous and those signs should not be permitted.  On the other hand, people should be given a proper chance to advertise their wares and, if the advertisement happens to indicate something of assistance to the user of the road, saying the distance or that such-and-such a place is just off the road in a certain direction, they should not be prohibited from doing so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="368" />
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no absolute prohibition at all in this section.  Sub-section (10) merely prescribes that &ldquo;a person other than a road authority shall not provide a traffic sign visible from a road without the consent of the Commissioner.&rdquo;  Some of the signs which have been described here do not appear to me to come within the definition of &ldquo;traffic sign.&rdquo;  I do not want that to be taken as an authoritative decision on the section.  Some of them &mdash;possibly the one which states that a garage is 300 yards further down the road&mdash;might be taken as a traffic sign. If such a sign were erected without the consent of the Commissioner, the court might take a very lenient view of it, provided it was not a sign which simulated an official traffic sign.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One must not forget that there may be a real possibility, not merely of causing certain inconvenience to road users but of creating a positive danger for them, in allowing signs to go up without any regulation or control whatever.  The real difficulty about the Senator's amendment seems to me to be that it would permit precisely that. It would give any person who wanted to advertise a hotel, a guest-house, shop or other place of business complete liberty to put up any sign he wanted.  I was talking about inconvenience. It is quite a favourite advertising device to put up in large red letters the word &ldquo;Stop&rdquo;.  That might be inconvenient, as a person on a journey might slow down.  If he were going fast and, being followed by a vehicle going at equal speed and dangerously close, were to stop suddenly on seeing what seemed to him to be a most minatory danger sign, he might create an accident.  That sign may be an occasion of danger to himself and to those following him.  It is precisely for that reason that we think, in the interests of road users, some control should be exercised by some authority on the type of sign that may be erected close to our main traffic ways.  I think you cannot find a better authority to determine the type of signs it is permissible to erect as advertising signs than the authority which is generally charged with ensuring that the roads are used safely, that <Col N="369" /> is, the Commissioner of the Gárda Síochána.</P>
    <P>In all these circumstances, I think the Senator will realise that this has not been put in merely with the desire to impose undue restrictions on those wishing to erect signs, but to ensure that those signs, when erected, will not be misleading, that they will not be a source of inconvenience and a possible danger to road users.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanODonovan" hpid="Mr. S. O'Donovan Mr. S. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to ask the Minister whether the traffic signs, the amber and black signs, put up throughout the city and country at present were not put up by the Automobile Association?  I understand the Automobile Association erected some of them.  If they did so, having got the permission of the local authority, they would be prohibited now, as the sub-section says:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;A person other than a road authority shall not provide a traffic sign visible from a road without the consent of the Commissioner.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>If I am correct in saying that the Automobile Association put up some of those signs, which convenience everybody, they would be precluded from doing it now by that sub-section (10).</P>
      <P>I entirely agree with the limiting of power to people to put up signs, posters or hoardings at cross-roads or other places throughout the country. They are a positive danger.  Apart from the case instanced by the Minister, where the word &ldquo;stop&rdquo; might be taken to mean there was danger and be the cause of an accident, there is the danger of a motorist driving along and reading these various notices&mdash;I have done it myself and I appreciate there is a danger in it.</P>

      <P>The Minister has only adverted to sub-section (10) but my difficulty is in the joint construction of sub-sections (2) and (10).  I am quite satisfied to accept the point of view that a person who is going to put up a sign of the type I have indicated should obtain the consent of the Commissioner of the Gárda that the sign is not going to be a danger to the public using the road.  But the difficulty that I see is that the Minister is going to make regulations that will prescribe the size of traffic signs.  I do not think there is any doubt whatever&mdash;that is very dogmatic but I think it is true&mdash;that the type of sign I have indicated is covered by the Minister's definition in the beginning of the section and if the Minister would deal with sub-section (2) in such a way that his regulations, while covering what I might call the local authority signs that he wants standardised all over the country, would nevertheless leave private persons free to erect signs in such dimensions as they may consider suitable, subject to the overriding power of the Commissioner of the Gárda, I would be quite satisfied as to danger.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>On the point raised by Senator O'Donovan, I think he is not strictly accurate.  The erection of these traffic signs, directional signs, throughout the country, is the joint work of the Automobile Association and the local authorities.  The Automobile Association provide the materials; the local authorities do the work.  Therefore, I think he may rest assured that no difficulty will arise in relation to them.  I cannot see how we can get over the point which has been raised by Senator Sweetman except to put the onus on those who wish to erect advertising signs to ensure that their signs will not fall within the definition of &ldquo;traffic sign.&rdquo;  If they desire to have a sign of such a nature that it would be covered by the de-definition &ldquo;traffic sign,&rdquo; then it would have to conform to the general regulations <Col N="371" /> prescribed for traffic signs.  I am afraid there is no way out of that.</P>
      <P>We are under many obligations to people who use the roads.  They pay for them&mdash;do not let us forget that&mdash; particularly those who travel long distances in motor vehicles.  They have not merely built the roads but, in fact, I think, they very largely maintain them.  I do not want to enter into a controversy as to how the burden falls precisely, but they very largely maintain the roads of this country and it is our job to make them safe and convenient; first of all, for them.  If, within the limits that safety and convenience require, people want to advertise their goods or their places of resort, they are quite at liberty to do so.  But people can see at once that if there is any directional element in the sign, that sign must conform to the regulations to ensure the safety and convenience of the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister would be more correct in saying that, if there is any directional feature in the sign, it would be much more satisfactory for it to meet with the approval of the Commissioner rather than conform to regulations as regards size.  I understand the purpose of this section, as introduced by the Minister, is to ensure standardisation in regard to the signs which are going to be erected all over the country by local authorities.  I do not know whether I am correct in regard to that or not.  I think that, so far as sub-section (2) is concerned, that is what was in the mind of the Minister, that he wished to ensure that every local authority would erect the same type of sign.  I suggest that the Minister would be perfectly protected in his anxiety to keep the roads safe if, instead of accepting the amendment in my name, that under sub-section (2) he should make regulations prescribing the size, shape, colour and character of traffic signs to be erected by local authorities, and that all traffic signs, whether they were going to be erected by local authorities or not, would have to be erected with the consent of the Commissioner of the Gárda.  If he was prepared to meet me on sub-section (2) in <Col N="372" /> that manner, I would be quite satisfied that any person who wants to erect an advertisement containing some directional feature would have to go to the Commissioner for the consent given under sub-section (10).</P>
      <P>All I want to ensure is that, if the Commissioner is satisfied, the size of the sign will not be regulated by something that was not intended to regulate it.  The Minister is going to make regulations saying that the signs shall be approximately I foot by about 2 feet 6&mdash;that is the ordinary sign that there is at present.  As long as an advertisement containing a directional feature is not a danger to the public using the road, why should not it be of any size that the advertiser wishes, if the Commissioner of the Gárda is satisfied?  I think it could be met quite easily on sub-section (2) rather than in the definition way that I have raised it because the definition way is wider.  I would ask the Minister to look into that between now and Report.</P>

      <P>I move, on behalf of Senator Duffy, amendment No. 33:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before Section 71 in page 31 to insert the following new section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>71.  (1)  It shall be lawful for a local authority with the sanction of the Minister to prescribe scales of allowances in relation to the attendances of its members at any of its meetings or at meetings of any committee or subsidiary body of such local authority.</P>
      <P>(2)  Scales of allowances prescribed under the next preceding sub-section of this section may provide for the payment to members of the local authority of such sums as may appear reasonable to recoup such members for expenditure by them on the purchase of meals and for loss of wages or other similar income arising out of their attendance at such meetings as are mentioned in the next preceding section of this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="376" /> (3)  It shall be lawful for a local authority to pay out of the funds under the control of such authority any allowance claimed by any of its members in accordance with the scale of allowances prescribed under sub-section (1) of this section.</P>
    <P>I often think that the Minister for Local Government must regard members of local authorities as millionaires because he remains so adamant in his refusal to make some little provision for members of local authorities who give so much of their time to the service of the country.  I have known councillors on many occasions to do three days a week at public meetings, leaving their work during the emergency when their services were so much required at home for the production of food and going to council meetings to look after their public business.  About two years ago, we had a discussion on an agriculture Bill, and I understood the Minister for Agriculture to say that he would get in touch with the Minister for Local Government, with a view to having some provision made whereby out-of-pocket expenses would be paid to local representatives.  I think that is only reasonable.</P>
    <P>All sections of the community are paid for their services, and I do not see any reason why local representatives should be public benefactors.  I met a councillor in my own town some time ago who said to me, as I told the Minister some time ago, that he had travelled 24 miles for 3/- travelling expenses, and that, on going into a café to get his dinner, he was told that his dinner would cost 3/6, when he was allowed only 3/-.  It is only reasonable that the Minister should be a little generous to local representatives who are doing good work and who have done it for years without any remuneration. It is time something was done to repay them for their services.  We are not asking anything big in this amendment; we are merely asking that they be allowed out-of-pocket expenses, which would not amount to a considerable sum.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I might mention a particular case which is entirely relevant <Col N="377" /> to the amendment.  There is a mental hospital, as the Minister is aware, for the combined counties of Carlow and Kildare which is some distance outside the town of Carlow. For many years, it was the custom, when members of the committee of the mental hospital met, as it was impossible for them during any adjournment of their meeting to go back into Carlow to get their meals, to provide them with lunch in the mental hospital.  The Minister will agree that that was an entirely proper arrangement which facilitated the members of the committee in carrying out their duties.  When the county manager came into existence in 1942, the first thing he did was to decree that the members of the committee should not get their lunch in the mental hospital any more, which means that these members have to spend a considerable time going back to Carlow to get their meal and a considerable time returning to the committee.  It came to our notice in the county council only last week because the members of the committee were apparently long suffering, and I understand that the matter has been submitted to the Minister, but it does appear to me that, when members of a local authority are giving up their time to public business of that kind, they should be facilitated in this respect.</P>
      <P>I do not altogether agree with the amendment in regard to payment for their services&mdash;payment for loss of wages being, in effect, payment for their services.  I think it is only reasonable that either the local authority itself should provide the meal for the members when it is necessary for them to be away from home, or, alternatively, should provide in cash a sufficient sum to enable the members to get a meal when they are away from home.  My own view is that, particularly in the case of a mental hospital committee, it is highly desirable that the members should&mdash;if I may use the word&mdash;fraternise together over their food.</P>

      <P>I think I remember Senator Hayden making a similar plea some years ago, and, if I remember rightly, I agreed with him on that occasion. I agree with him now.  Some <Col N="378" /> better provision should be made for the members of local authorities&mdash;county councillors and such people.  I do not believe it is possible to deal with it in this Bill, but I am glad we have the appropriate Minister here to whom to put the matter.  I am sure he will deal with it sympathetically, if not now, at some later stage.  It is a well-known fact that these men travelled 20 miles on bicycles to attend meetings.  They are not necessarily men who can always afford to go into the best hotels for a meal.</P>
      <P>Senator Hayden said that they should not be regarded as public benefactors. I regard the majority of these men as public benefactors.  They are a most unselfish type of people, inasmuch as they give their time to attendance at meetings in all weathers.  If we are to continue to get the best type of people for these councils, some better provision will have to be made for them in future than was the case in the past.  While I do not think the Minister can provide for them in this Bill, I appeal to him to look into the matter sympathetically to see what can be done.  I know that he will do that.</P>

      <P>Times are marching on.  I remember when I was a member of a county council, a good many years ago, one of the representatives who is now a T.D., cycled from Castletownbere to meetings in Cork. There were other difficulties to be faced apart from the cycling, at that time&mdash;1919.  I agree that provision should be made for local representatives somewhat comparable to the provision that is made for representatives of both Houses of the Oireachtas. From my personal knowledge, I am aware that public representatives have to incur considerable expense in the discharge of their duties.  I refer to the position of members of Dublin Corporation.  We have often heard of the amount of correspondence that Deputies have to deal with.  I am quite satisfied that members of Dublin Corporation have to deal with an equal amount of correspondence, inasmuch as they are fair game for everybody with a grievance, persons looking <Col N="379" /> for houses, etcetera.  In order to give members of the corporation facilities for carrying on their work properly, they require some allowance to meet expenditure they have to incur.  It is not so much a question of providing a scale of allowances as out-of-pocket expenses. It is, probably, difficult to provide such a scheme, but control by the officials, such as the city manager or the county manager, might be arranged.</P>

Where, particularly in the case of county councils and committees of management of mental hospitals, and such like institutions, members have to travel long distances, and have to spend the greater part of a day on public business, I concede this, that the ordinary obligations of hospitality might be honoured in their case.  I will, probably, see to what extent I might be able to give effect to that idea between now and the Report Stage.  I should like to say, however, that it is a major issue, and it is not one that a Minister will determine on his own authority.  It may require considerable consideration before giving effect to it.  Therefore, I do not promise to bring in an amendment on the Report Stage.

      <P>There are several points about this section that I am not quite clear about.  In the first place, I should say that I feel that there is need in many cases for changing a name, but that change of name should not be easily effected.  When you change a name place it is very difficult to ascertain what the correct Irish name is.  There is one section for having that properly explored before the new name is officially adopted.  The Bill, as originally introduced, provided that two-thirds of the ratepayers in a district or two-thirds of the people in a street should consent before there was a change of name.  In the Dáil, the Minister was urged to make it a simple majority.  I urge that it should be restored to two-thirds.  People who want to make a change of that kind should have as big a majority as possible, because I feel that it is one of the easy, facile tokens of nationalism to proceed to change a particular name that has been there for a long time, into another name which may seem to be more patriotic but which, in fact, may not be very sound at all from historical and other reasons.  For example, the change from Donegal to Tír Conaill is not historical, and the change from Queen's County to Leix or King's County to Offaly does not in fact correspond with the ancient divisions of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="381" /> If the matter is given mature consideration, Senators will realise that the older counties did not correspond with previous divisions of the country. I give that as an example to show how difficult the position is.  I feel that two-thirds majority is better than simple majority, and better than four-sevenths. If that was the Minister's original idea he should stick to it.  Has the Minister any power to determine what the new name is?  He has in Section 75, I know, but has he under Section 74?</P>

      <P>Yes&mdash;it is 7 (a).  I think it is a perfectly sound idea.  On other occasions I have objected to powers being conferred on the Government but in this case I am rather in favour of it. This is a very difficult matter and one which requires a considerable amount of research, scholarship, and consultation with more than one person to determine what the proper name should be.  I am, therefore, fully in agreement with the idea of not allowing the people or the urban district council to decide as to the name which should be given to the town.  I would like to hear the Minister on the question of two-thirds and four-sevenths.  I am in favour of the former myself because I feel that the change over should be made difficult rather than easy.  Too hasty action in a matter like this is apt to be somewhat misguided and people sometimes regret subsequently a too rapid success.</P>

      <P>Is é tá ar aigne agamsa ná go bhfaghaimís eolas, sar a gcríochnaímid leis na trí hailt seo, an bhfuil sé beartaithe in aigne an Aire nó ag an Aireacht go mbeidh na hainmneacha Gaeilge i gceist á bhfeimiú ina dhlí.  B'fhéidir na fuil in aigne an Aire go mbeidh an scéal mar sin agus muna bhfuil, scaoil-fidh mé leis.  Ba mhaith liom deimh-niú d'fháil cé acu mar seo nó mar siud atá.</P>
      <P>Maidir leis na hainmneacha Gaeilge, is deacar faoi láthair an dlí a aimsiú cad é an t-údarás atá ann chun ainm Gaeilge, nach raibh go dtí seo ina hainm oifigiúil, a chur i bhfeidhm mar ainm oifigiúil nó a tharaingt in úsáid oifigiúil.  Tá, ámhach, réamhnós ann cheana liost ainmneacha na mbailte bpoist ag Aireacht an Phoist d'úsáid go hoifigiúil.  Sa tslí chéanna, tá liost, do réir mar thuigim, ag an Roinn Dlí agus Cirt&mdash;liost ainmneacha bailte fearann, bailte cúirte agus a leithéid eile.  Ní léir dom cad é an t-údarás atá leo sin.</P>
      <P>Má tá an t-údarás chun iad sin d'úsáid go hoifigiúil ann fós, is dócha go bhféadfadh an Rialtas anois féin feidhm do bhaint as an údarás san chun dul ar aghaidh le húsáid na n-áit-ainm Gaeilge in gnóthaí eile, go mór mór in gnóthaí agus i bhfeidhmiú an Rialtais áitiúil.  Ach, mar adúrt, ní heol dom go bhfuil cinnteacht an údaráis sin againn, agus ní léir go dtuigeann an Aireacht Rialtais Áitiúil go bhfuil sin ann.  Caithfidh mé féin a admháil nach ró léir a thuigim an bhfuil an t-údarás ann fé láthair, nó, má tá, cad as a dtagann sé.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ní hionann an saghas ainmneacha atá i gceist fé Altana 74 agus 75, ar thaobh&mdash;bailte fearann, sráidbhailte catharacha agus a leithéid&mdash;agus na hainmneacha atá i gceist fé Alt 76&mdash; sráideanna istigh i mbailte móra, &mdash;ar an dtaobh eile.  I gcás bailte fearainn agus seanranna tíre, tá ainmneacha orthu sin le céata agus le mílte blian, gur féidir 95 fén gcéad acu d'aimsiú agus a dheimhniú le cinnteacht fós.  Is iad sin fíor-ainmneacha cearta na n-áite-anna san, agus is iad sin ba chóir a bheith ina ainmneacha oifigiúla i ngnóthaí agus i bhfeidhmiú dlí agus rialú Stáit.  Ní minic a bhíonn athrú <Col N="385" /> ar aon ainm acu san i gceist; agus ní minic a bheidh iarracht dhá thabhairt chun aon ainm nua do chur in ionad aon chinn acu.  Is siad na bailte agus na fearanna san go bhfuil na hainmneacha cinnte cearta ó shinsearacht orthu atá uaimse ná measfaí iad mar ainmneacha nua nó athrú ar ainmneacha i bhfeidh-miú an dá Alt seo 74 agus 75.</P>
    <P>Má meastar mar sin iad&mdash;má meastar gur ainmneacha nua Portláirge, Corca Dhuibhne, Baile Átha Cliath nó Dubhlinn, mar ba chóir a bheith ar an gcathair seo, nó Muigheo nó An Uaimh&mdash;is breallach, amadántúil an gnó atá ghá bheartú againn fén dlí nua seo.  Ní dóigh liom gur ceart dlí a dhéanamh chun gnó amadáin den tsaghas san a chur ar bun; agus i mo thuairimse is gnó breallach gan chiall a bheith ag achtú go gcaithfear dul ag lorg vótaí an 4/7ú de lucht díolta rátaí ins an gceanntar sin, chun ainm ceart stairiúil na gceanntair do chur in úsáid go hoifigiúil arís.</P>
    <P>Tá súil agam go dtiocfaidh an lá go mbeidh sé de mhisneach ag an Oireach-tas a ordú gurb iad na hainmneacha Gaeilge san&mdash;na hainmneacha cearta ar na háiteanna uile ar fud na tíre&mdash;a chur ar aithint do réir dlí agus ná beimíd lagfáiseach, lagbheartach agus táimid faoi láthair i dtaobh an ghnótha san. Ba mhaith liom go seachnaimis go gcaithfí dul tríd na casáin trioblóid-eacha seo, agus 4/7 plus duine d'fháil chun ainm do cheartú i ngach ceann den cheithre fichid míle bailte fearainn atá in Éirinn.  Ba mhaith liom go bhfuighfí tuairim an Aire ar na nithe sin, agus ná beiminne ag ceapadh dlí chun an obair a dhéanamh níos deacra &mdash;rud atáimíd a dhéanamh anois.</P>
    <P>Sompla ba mhaith liom a luadh de rud a tharlódh mara dtugtar aithint dlí do áit-ainmneacha Gaeilge.

    <P>It would appear from our examination of this matter so far that what is most in the minds of the people as being involved is the Irish language form of place-names as distinct from the English official, bowdlerised form of place names all over the country.  I am not concerned about street names. In referring to this, my purpose is to get information and to find out from An tAire whether it is contemplated that the Irish language form of place names, which place names and which form are in 95 or 98 cases out of 100 the correct historical, topographical, philological form of the names, is involved in this question of getting the sanction of four-sevenths, plus one, of the people to agree that they should be used.  That is the matter on which I should like to get information from the Minister so that our discussion might be clearer.  What I want to avoid is there being any new legislation which would put a difficulty in the way of bringing these place names into official use, a thing which should have been done 25 years ago, if we had the courage or the foresight to tackle the matter then.  It is time that we did it and we should not involve ourselves in legislation which will put difficulties in the way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>It is difficult for me to answer that question without considerable reservations.  I am asked whether the mere adoption of the Irish form of names of an urban district or town would constitute a change of name.  As the section stands, I think it does not prescribe that an adoption in that form would constitute a change. On the other hand, if the section came to be interpreted by the courts.  I do not know what the courts would say, because a question might arise as to whether the Irish form of the name <Col N="387" /> which it was proposed to adopt was in fact the equivalent of the English form of the name.  As the matter stands, however, I think it is reasonable to assume that the English form of the name in most cases has official status, except where in an official document there appears the corresponding Irish form for the English form of the name of the town.  I think in most legal documents, particularly documents affecting title, you will find that it is the English form of the name that is used.</P>
      <P>This section has not been brought in to make it more difficult to change the names of the towns from the English to the Irish form or from the existing English name to the original Irish name.  But it has been brought in to ensure that the change will be effective in every sphere in our legal and commercial life, and, to the extent to which we can make it effective, in our social life.  It has also been brought in to ensure that when the existing English forms have been given the old Irish equivalent or have been abandoned altogether in favour of the Irish names, the change will not lead to needless litigation and considerable loss and, perhaps, a great deal of embitterment as between one citizen and another.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is not an easy matter to deal with.  We cannot assume that a name may be changed effectively by mere usage, for the name which has been in prior use has secured a legal significance in a very widespread way. And I am not sure that if we allowed a name to be changed merely at the instance of a particular group of people, who did not themselves constitute the majority of the people who would be immediately affected by the change, the change would be an effective one.  I understand there are some places in Ireland where, for instance, the names were changed by local authorities, local councils, many years ago, and where the English form of the name is the one customarily used by the inhabitants of the town, and it is not much use in trying to bring about these changes if we allow, as the Taoiseach said on one historic occasion, <Col N="388" /> the engine to run away from the train.</P>
    <P>Those who are interested&mdash;and I am interested; I would not have taken the trouble to try to work out this procedure if I were not keenly interested &mdash; in bringing about this change, would very usefully employ themselves, I think, and would do a great deal of very useful work for the language and from a propaganda point of view, if they set themselves the task, where it is proposed to use an Irish name or an Irish equivalent for a town, of securing the assent of the required majority, four-sevenths of the inhabitants of the particular place, for the change.  This is not a simple question, and I should certainly hesitate&mdash;in fact, I would go to the point almost of refusing&mdash;to say that I would be prepared to provide that in all circumstances the courts should hold that the adoption, by popular usage and without going through this machinery, of an Irish form of the name of a town was an effective change of name.</P>
    <P>We must be quite clear about this. If we are to change names, if we are to bring about widespread changes in the forms of those place names which are in common use, we shall have to have a procedure which is effective in every case; we shall have to have a procedure which will govern the difficult case as well as the easy case; we shall have to have a procedure which will bring about an effective change and an effective recognition of the change in cases where there may be a dispute as to what should be the proper form of name.</P>
    <P>Everybody knows my limitations in regard to the Irish language, but I have seen very heated controversies as to what is the proper form of a place name and, indeed, what is the proper form of a surname, and I have not any doubt whatever that such controversies might arise&mdash;I am not going to say in regard to those particular names which Senator Sugrue has mentioned, but in regard, at any rate, to many place names.  I can see controversies springing up which might create difficulties for people who would have to interpret legal documents and might even be detrimental to bringing about the adoption of a <Col N="389" /> recognised Irish form of an existing English place name.  For that reason, we must provide that, whenever an Irish name is to replace either an anglicised version of an Irish place name or an English name which has supplanted the original Irish name, we shall have some form of procedure which will ensure that the proposed new name will be considered by all those authorities who are interested in the change.</P>
    <P>We start off from what, I think, is the natural assumption, that the people most interested in the name of a place, whether it is a street, townland, urban district or city, are the people who live there.  They are the people whose private interests may be in some way affected by the change. We start off and we give them what is their natural right to, if you like, ascribe a name to the spot where they will ordinarily be found.  It is true that nobody, when he goes to live in a locality, puts a new name on the locality.  He is, in general, content to accept the old one when he arrives there; but it may create some difficulty for him if you proceed, without his consent, to change that name and give it another.  It may, if it does not create difficulty for him, annoy him to the point that he will dispute your right to change the name and it is as well, therefore, that this change should be brought about with the consent and goodwill of those immediately concerned, because if you do not bring it about in this way you will, in the case of some towns, have it that the inhabitants, out of sheer cussedness, will stick on to the old name.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, they will defeat you.  Having secured their consent to the name, we have then to satisfy ourselves that the change in the form in which it is proposed to be used is the proper one.  There is a commission or a committee which I set up when I was Minister for Finance&mdash;it was in suspension during the war years &mdash;and it has been working on that subject for a considerable time.  It will shortly resume its functions.  Apart altogether from the fact that we must <Col N="390" /> be careful to ensure that the new name will be in its proper form and that it will be generally the original Irish or older name of the place, we have also to make certain that every Department of State, as representing the people as a whole in the particular interests with which these Departments deal, will be made aware of the contemplated change and will be able, if they have any particular interest or if they find a difficulty will be created for them in that change, to make representations in regard to it.</P>
      <P>Finally, we have to proceed in such a way, by a well-defined and regulated procedure, as to ensure, if any legal dispute should arise in relation to a place cited in a document, that the courts will be able without any difficulty to satisfy themselves that, in fact, the place as redesignated by its old Irish name is the place referred to under an English name in the legal document.  It is better that we should be at great pains to ensure that, ultimately, no dispute will arise as to the form of the name, or as to the fact that the name has been changed, because if we do not do that then I foresee that we are going to open the way for untold opportunities for disputes between the citizens in which lawyers and pedants will be engaged and in which the people may ultimately be mulcted. That is why we have taken this procedure.</P>
      <P>To get back to the point at which I started, if I really want to have this thing done effectually, I should approach it from the point of view that when the name of a place is to be changed it must be done formally and officially.  Accordingly I should proceed to get the assent of four-sevenths of the inhabitants.  That does not mean to say that I, personally, should go around and canvass four-sevenths of the inhabitants. All it means is that we should get the representatives of the townspeople in the first place to make up their minds if the change is desirable, and then when they have done that proceed to determine whether four-sevenths of the inhabitants of the place will assent to the change.  That will be done by the official machinery of the local authority.  It will not involve anybody in undue expense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="391" /> I do not foresee that there will be any difficulty in getting local authorities to take steps to secure the assent of four-sevenths of the inhabitants of their areas.  After all, at this stage of our history I think we are entitled to hope that at least four-sevenths of the people of this country are in favour of bringing Irish place names into use. I think it would be adopting a defeatist attitude if we were to assume that we were going to have any difficulty in getting such a comparatively small majority as four-sevenths of the total inhabitants of the country in favour of a general movement to replace the English place names by the correct Irish names.</P>
    <P>If I were to take the opposite view, and were to believe that the majority of the people, at this stage of our existence, were opposed to the adoption of Irish place names, then I should indeed begin to believe that a great deal of the work that has been done for the Irish language and a great deal of the nation building work which has been undertaken over the past generation, and for 50 years or more, had been fruitless and wasted.  I do not believe that one bit, and I am confident that there will not be any great difficulty experienced in securing compliance with the procedure that is laid down in these sections.  While I am confident, and while I hope and assume that the necessary majority will be readily obtained for the change, at the same time it has got to be remembered that as a Minister and as a member of the Government I cannot act on my own assumption, and I cannot act on other people's assumptions either.  This being a democracy I have to allow the people to have their own views on the matter.  As a Minister I cannot, at any rate, impose on the people, whether some of them express a desire for it or not, a change merely by a sort of dictatorial <i>fiat.</i>  Bearing that fact in mind, as well as those other considerations which I had in mind when giving instructions for the drafting of these sections, I think that as presented to the House they represent the right and proper way to make a change.</P>

Tá ceist le socrú ansin, ach sa Ghaeltacht, i gContae na na Gaillimhe, mar shompla, ní chuireann na daoine an leagan Gallda ar na ceanntracha no ar na dúichí, beag nó mór.  Do mhínigh an Seanadóir O Deagha dhúinn an scéim atá acu i gContae na Gaillimhe éileamh ar na rátaí a chur amach i nGaeilge agus na hainmneacha áitiúla <Col N="393" /> i nGaeilge chó maith.  An bhfuil sin dlisteanach?  Do réir mar thuigim, is baolach liom gur mí-dhlisteanach an cúrsa é.</P>

      <P>An rud is annamh is iontach.  We must have a scheme for this&mdash;a legal scheme.  The scheme in the Bill is not a bad scheme and the great thing in its favour is that, before you change the name of a place, you must consult the people of the place. Senator Ó Siochfhradha puts forward the plausible idea, in which I for a time believed, that you have only to pass a law to change all these names.  Of course, you can do that but what is the use of passing a law if you have not the people with you?  The scheme in the Bill, as drafted, provides that four-sevenths of the people of an area must agree with the proposed change.  My amendment suggests that two-thirds of the people be necessary to effect a change and I am as much in favour of Irish names as anybody else.  But I appreciate the difficulty.  Senator Ó Siochfhradha cleverly took an example from Kerry.  All Kerrymen are clever. He dealt with Corca Duibhne.  He has made a study of Corca Duibhne place-names. He knows that it is easier to establish the Irish names there than it is elsewhere.  It is much easier to give the Irish name of Dunquin than the Irish name of Terenure where I happen to live.  We used to call it Tír an Iubhair.  Then it was called Tor Fhionnbhair.  My own private opinion is that nobody knows what the Irish name of Terenure is.  The idea that you can change a name by law, regulation or decree is quite wrong.  The scheme in the Bill means that you must take the people with you.  The harder you make it to change a name, the more chance you have of the name <Col N="395" /> being adopted.  Until two-thirds of the people want to change the name of a place, it is better not to change it.</P>
      <P>The Minister said&mdash;there again I agree with him&mdash;that what has been done in the last 50 years in the Gaelic movement and in the last 25 years by an Irish State with regard to what we call Gaelicisation will be called into question if you cannot get two-thirds of the people of an area to agree to an Irish name.  If, in 1946, 25 years after the establishment of an Irish Government, you cannot bring two-thirds of the people of an area with you to change the name of a place&mdash;to change Clonmel, say, to Cluain Meala &mdash;you should sit down and examine your conscience.  I have been in favour of that for a long time.  If they do not agree to it, then, mind you, what all of us have been working for has been rather a failure.  My contention is that the more difficult you make it to change the name, the more chance you actually have of the new name being put into use.</P>
      <P>Let us take a few of these names of which I happen to have experience.  I gave an example when speaking in Irish.  You can change Dublin into &ldquo;Baile Atha Cliath&rdquo; but the change will not affect the people of Dublin. You will still hear them calling it &ldquo;Dublin&rdquo;.  You, first of all, have to get a change in spirit amongst the people.  You have got to have a certain amount of that work done in the schools and to get a certain point of view into people's minds.  Take another example.  Kells, a nice tidy monosyllable, has been changed into Ceannanus Mór.  It is pronounced Ceannanus Mór and Ceann-an-us Mór.  I should prefer to hear it called Kells than to hear it called Ceann-an-us Mór.  I happened to have a friend in Kells who was ill and I rang up frequently to learn how he was getting on.  Perhaps I would ring up Trunks and say: &ldquo;91399; can you give me Kells 7&rdquo; and a voice would say very emphatically: &ldquo;Oh, what you want is Ceannanus Mór&rdquo;.  If you do use the Irish name, there is always the risk that if you do not get a person at the exchange who knows Irish you may waste a lot of time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="396" /> If I ring up and say in Irish: &ldquo;Can you get me Kells?&rdquo; and have to wait until I get a person who understands me, the unfortunate man about whose health I am inquiring may be dead by the time I get through.  I remember one night I did that.  I asked: &ldquo;An bhfuighfeá Ceannanus Mór a seacht dom?&rdquo; I could hear a voice at the other end asking: &ldquo;Where is that?&rdquo; and another voice replying: &ldquo;Oh, that is Kells 7.&rdquo;  I suppose if I had not been in a hurry, I would have insisted on talking Irish to her.  The point is that until you get a real change based upon what the people want, you are humbugging yourself.  You are carrying on what is merely a demonstration instead of a reality.  You are deluding yourself by what the French call a manifestation.  Take a place like Bagenalstown.  The only time it is called Muine Beag is when there is a general election on and strangers go down there.  At every other time it is called Bagenalstown, or so I am told.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>Portlaoighise is easy enough to deal with but take a name like Portarlington.  Suppose you change the name Portarlington to Cúl an tSúdaire, you would have great difficulty. Until you get a majority of the people to agree to the change, at least two-thirds of the people, you will not get anything effectively done.</P>
      <P>It is suggested that there may be some difficulty with regard to sending a rates demand to Dunquin or to Connemara.  Article 8 of the Constitution says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Ós í an Ghaedhilg an teanga náisiúnta is í an phrímh-theanga oifigeamhail í.</P>
      <P>The Irish language as the national language is the first official language.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That would probably cover the matter. Again if you are marking rolls you meet with all sorts of difficulties.  You get, for instance, the name Máire Ní Bhroin.  That, you would be inclined to translate as &ldquo;Mary Byrne&rdquo; or &ldquo;Mary O'Byrne&rdquo; or it might be &ldquo;Mary Agnes O'Beirne&rdquo;, but I remember getting a great shock when a student who gave me that name told <Col N="397" /> me that her name in English was Una Wybrant.  The name Byrne is a very common name in Dublin, but it is most difficult to know exactly what the translation is when you get the name in Irish.  The problem is a very difficult one.</P>
    <P>I am in favour of the scheme in the section, because first and foremost it bases the change upon what the people of a particular area want.  I would prefer however two-thirds majority to a four-sevenths majority.  Secondly, I am in favour of the scheme in the section because it does not leave&mdash;and here I am going against my general view&mdash; to the local people power to change the name.  It submits the matter to the Minister, who, presumably, will have machinery at his disposal to determine what the new name should be.  Thirdly, I am in favour of the scheme in the section because it gives some kind of legal certainty.  I do not agree with Senator Ua Buachalla who said that if the present situation is uncertain and vague it should be left so. I do not think that is right.  It should be made as sound legally as we can make it.  You have an enormous amount, as Senator O'Dea said, of land registration in English names and you must have advertence to rights that have been acquired.  Changing Waterford into Portlairge would involve some difficulty if you are carrying on a business in Waterford because you will probably have a big collection of notepaper with the heading &ldquo;Waterford&rdquo;. It would be no trouble to me to observe the change if I were merely living in Waterford but if I had a business in Waterford, out of which I was making a living, no matter how patriotic I might be, I would prefer that the name should remain Waterford. That might be a low point of view but I understand it exists.  I think the scheme is a good scheme but I think the greater the majority you get for a change in the first instance, the better chance of success it will have.  Therefore, while supporting the scheme in the section I think the majority should be two-thirds instead of four-sevenths.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HelenaConcannon" hpid="Mrs. Concannon Mrs. Concannon">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Concannon</NameTxt>
      <P>This discussion has lost sight of one very important point, namely, that neither two-thirds of the <Col N="398" /> inhabitants nor four-sevenths of the inhabitants, will have any opportunity at all of expressing their views as to the change of name.  It is only ratepayers who will have that chance. That, I think, is a very retrograde step.  At least the people who are entitled to a vote on local government suffrage should get an opportunity of expressing their views.  The ratepayers, I presume, would be the older people who would be accumstomed to the existing name and would have no desire to change it.  I quite agree that in order to make new names acceptable, the change should have the support of the people.  In other sections which treats of a change of name, the people have an opportunity of expressing their views, but only ratepayers are mentioned in this instance.  I do not understand why that restriction was made.  Another thing is that there is no possibility of changing the name even if a majority of the ratepayers decide they want it changed.  These are all matters which should be taken into consideration.  I think that a suffrage on a matter like this, which affects the people of the coming generation, should not be confined to the ratepayers of the present.</P>

      <P>I would like to say that I sympathise very much with Senator Hayes in his difficulty in the matter of telephoning and getting telephone numbers, especially in certain cases in Dublin.  I would like to tell him, however, that every place must not be measured according to the standards obtaining in Dublin.  I am happy to say that, as far as Galway is concerned, I think we have as slick a telephone service as there is in any place in Ireland.  There one has no difficulty whatever in getting one's number by calling it out in Irish.  If one wants any information, whether in the main office or the sub-offices, one has no difficulty in getting that information as readily in Irish&mdash;perhaps even more readily&mdash;as in English. I hope some time or other that the Cathaoirleach and the Ceann Comhairle will get together and decide to invite some of our telephonists from Galway up to Leinster House, for a spell of six months' duty; in that way they might bring about a most desirable <Col N="399" /> change in the matter of the telephone service.</P>

      <P>I agree, providing you use English.  That is understood. That is my point.  Otherwise, I am not quarrelling.  I am speaking solely of one's ability and one's right to use the Irish language.</P>
      <P>I agree we should be very careful to get the consent of as many people as possible with regard to the changing of the names of the towns.  I do not altogether agree that it is as difficult as Senator Hayes has said.  One notices the extent to which Dun Laoghaire is accepted by the people. Beyond question Dun Laoghaire is the accepted name.</P>
      <P>I do not know what happened in the towns Senator Hayes has mentioned. It may be that the people did not use the Irish names to the extent to which one would like them to use them. Speaking of the places I do know, I am satisfied that the change has been accepted.  A most desirable innovation has been introduced in Galway.  When new areas are developed there only Irish names are given to the streets. I do not know what the legal position is.  In Ballinasloe recently they changed the names of the streets and gave them their Irish titles.  Ballinasloe Council will have to examine into their position legally in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To revert now to the question of getting the consent of the people, I do not advocate opposing the will of the people.  When I was speaking earlier I referred specifically to the Gaeltacht areas.  Just think for a moment of the absurdity of asking people whose language is Irish &mdash; where English scarcely exists&mdash;to take part in a referendum that the names of their districts should be called by the only names by which they already know them.  Think, for a moment, of a place like Casla down in Connacht, where only when some official comes in and compels the people to use whatever few words of English they have, one never hears a word of English.  These people must, according to the law, accept Costello <Col N="400" /> as the name of the area.  That situation is absurd.  It seems to me utterly unreasonable to ask the people of that area to take part in a vote whereby the name of the place is to be called by the only name by which it has ever been known to them and to those who have gone before them.  Now, that is the point I was raising when I said there seemed to be some uncertainty about the matter and when I raised the question of Galway County Council sending out its demand notes in Irish, and only in Irish&mdash;a thing which is very much appreciated.  It did, however, occur to me that there might be some difficulty about that and that such a course might not be quite in in order.</P>
    <P>On the ordnance map Casla is set down as Costello.  However they arrived at that I do not know.  If certain registrations have taken place under the name of Costello that has a certain legal significance.  It seems to me, in view of everything that has been said, that there is a certain doubt about the whole matter.  If there is a doubt I would sooner leave the position uncertain for the time being until we can see further into the matter. That is what I have in mind.  I would not like it to be understood that, in the matter of legislation generally, I would subscribe to the idea that anything we do should be uncertain.  In view of the peculiar circumstances and in view of the turn which the debate has taken.  I should not mind a little uncertainty in this case.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not advert to the fact that the Senator was talking about the Gaeltacht.  It should be possible to make special provision for special areas.  Even in places where Irish is spoken the English name is very often used by officials and in correspondence. I agree, however, that the case he mentions is rather absurd although I do not know the particular area myself.</P>

      <P>I would like to correct a few wrong impressions which seem to have been gathered during the course of the debate.  My desire was&mdash;we seem to have wandered away from it a good deal&mdash;to find out whether it was contemplated that the Irish form of place names would be <Col N="401" /> involved in this matter of four-sevenths plus one or, as Senator Michael Hayes would have, two-thirds plus one.  I know that the English, anglicised, or bowdlerised forms of these place names are the official names.  I know they are the legal ones.  I know that that situation has existed for ages past.  I also know that nobody&mdash;whether ratepayer or other inhabitant of these places&mdash; was ever asked whether he liked the name in that form or not.</P>
      <P>Apparently, we have now become very careful and we are setting up guards and protections for a <i>status quo.</i> We are now attempting to legalise the <i>status quo</i> into permanency by endeavouring to have three-sevenths plus one with authority to defeat the will of four-sevenths. That is exactly what you are seeking to achieve by this legislation.  We are simply entrenching the upholders of the bowdlerised and anglicised forms of these names.  We, in the Oireachtas, have come into being, not by protecting the <i>status quo</i> but by smashing it.  That is the fact.  That is the basis on which our outlook should be now.  In the meantime, we seem to have become exceedingly worried about maintaining the remnants of that <i>status quo</i>, the remnants of that overlordship by another civilisation, another regime, another policy.  We seem to be very much afraid to hurt what is left of that.  If we were as we ought to have been, there should have been no question 25 years ago but to go back and bring into being and into official use anything that was left of the original signs of our ownership and our right to this country and its institutions, including our place names, including all our rights in anything like that and in anything that pertains to the traditions of the race to which we belong.  Our concern now, apparently, is to maintain the <i>status quo</i>, even though we ourselves smashed that <i>status quo</i> under which these things were built up, to smithereens. There seems to be a change of mind in regard to it for the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is what we are asking to bolster up, that every &ldquo;cnoc&rdquo; shall still remain &ldquo;knock.&rdquo;  To put it bluntly, is it not stupid for us to wish to maintain <Col N="402" /> that?  Is it not stupid for us to give any three-sevenths in a district the right to maintain that? Every &ldquo;sliabh&rdquo; shall be a &ldquo;slieve&rdquo; because we will not touch or interfere with the <i>status quo.</i>  Every &ldquo;cill&rdquo; shall be &ldquo;kill,&rdquo; every &ldquo;dun&rdquo; shall be &ldquo;doon,&rdquo; every &ldquo;baile&rdquo; shall be &ldquo;bally,&rdquo; every &ldquo;loch&rdquo; shall be &ldquo;lough&rdquo;&mdash;even in Scotland they spell it correctly in their place names.  We do not, and we will not interfere with the <i>status quo.</i>  Apparently, we are unwilling to do it.  It is well that we should understand that that is what we are upholding and that is what we are asking should be maintained for fear we might hurt the feelings of a three-sevenths plus one or whatever fraction it may be.  I do not think that it reveals that we are very convinced for ourselves, that we are very self-confident in the forces or theories that brought us into existence.</P>
    <P>On consideration, the idea seems to be that we have now achieved this much; we have now got certain people who over-lorded it on us out, but now we will go on in the way they set for us and we must not interfere with the remnants of that civilisation, the remnants of that conquest, the remnants of that subjugation of our people, our language, our place names, and we must not interfere with that because three-sevenths of the people might not like it.</P>
    <P>It is a queer commentary on us who went into revolution against all that, 30 years ago, that we should now stare wide-eyed at our temerity at having gone that length and wonder how we can prove that we are tolerant and that we accept what is left of that old-time thing that we objected to so vigorously and so vehemently then.</P>
    <P>I know that the restoration of these correct names, these traditional names, these names which in themselves bear the correct names of those places, may raise certain difficulties and certain litigation, that there might be the question of identity.  That is an easy matter to get over.  All these names are based on the Griffith Survey which takes in every piece of land, every townland, in Ireland.  These have been adopted by the local authorities and very little change has been made in them.  At varrious censuses, these place names have <Col N="403" /> been published and issued for the purpose of identity and the avoidance of possible litigation.  All that is needed is to put another column into the list of townland names and you will have it plain and straight, with no question of any legal difficulty.  An Seanadóir Ó Buachalla very properly referred to the Gaeltacht and Breac-Ghaeltacht where no name is known other than the correct name, except in the official lists in county council offices.  Those of us who have experience of local government affairs and county council offices know that.  Why should these people be asked to go about among themselves and get signatures of four-sevenths of them to ask that the name&mdash;as Senator Ó Buachalla has put it&mdash;the only name which they know for their own townland, should be in the form in which it ought to be?  I think the thing is very stupid.  That applies to every part of the Gaeltacht and Breac-Ghaeltacht and it applies equally to every part of the country.</P>
    <P>What is the difficulty about ordaining that &ldquo;knock&rdquo; should disappear and that &ldquo;cnoc&rdquo; should come back in the spelling of the places?  Why should &ldquo;kill&rdquo; be retained when &ldquo;cill&rdquo; is the proper and correct form? Why should we have &ldquo;slieve&rdquo; when &ldquo;sliabh&rdquo; is within the possibility of everybody to say and to write?  What are we afraid of?  I do not think people would object to these changes, and if there were an Order issued that for official usage the &ldquo;knocks&rdquo; and the &ldquo;kills&rdquo; and the &ldquo;loughs&rdquo; should disappear, I do not think there would be any objection to it any more than there was objection to the use of Dun Laoghaire instead of Kingstown and Cobh instead of Queenstown and other instances of that sort.</P>
    <P>I do not think the people would object. I believe they would welcome a lead from the Government on the matter.  That is my attitude in regard to it.  It should be the attitude of all of us who profess nationalist outlook and Irish-Ireland views.  I do not want to shove it down the neck of anybody that we must change one name into another.  I would use the correct form officially and let the people get into the habit of using that form gradually in <Col N="404" /> the same way as they have come to use the incorrect forms.  Let them go on calling it Dublin, if they like, but there is no reason why Dublin should not be Baile Atha Cliath or Dúbhlin, which it ought to be.  But you cannot make people use these forms.  Nobody expects that you will. I know people who, of malice aforethought, still call certain places Kingstown and Queenstown.  You cannot help people like that&mdash;you must let them have their way&mdash;but let the correct form be the official form and let us not have such stupid things as &ldquo;Offaly&rdquo;, &ldquo;Knock&rdquo;, &ldquo;Lough&rdquo; and other stupidities in our place-names. It is nearly time we were rid of them and, if we had an inch of pride in ourselves as a race, we should have got rid of them long ago.</P>

      <P>In reference to what Senator Ó Shiochfhradha has said, I should like to point out that after all I did not come here, if I may say so, without having a considerable volume of opinion behind me.  When this matter was before the Dáil we had not that splendid unanimity on the part of those who might be expected to speak for the point of view which the Senator says exists.  On the contrary, there was a rather prolonged debate in which a great deal was said on both sides.  When I introduced the Bill originally, the fraction in it was the two-thirds, which Senator Hayes is anxious we should revert to.</P>
      <P>Against that, there were those who wanted to be content with a simple majority, but there was quite a number of people, who felt, like Senator Hayes, that two-thirds was, perhaps, a better proposal, and four-sevenths was come to as a compromise in a House which, at least, had the mandate of the people behind it.  In dealing with these matters we must remember to be practical men of affairs and have regard to the views expressed by representatives on behalf of their constituents. I do not think one would say that Dáil Éireann is any less national, or any less patriotic, than the mass of the people.</P>

They constitute a special problem, <Col N="405" /> while this Bill is intended to deal with the position which has been created in the greater part of this country over many generations, and attempts to bring about far-reaching changes in a regular and orderly way.  We might, perhaps, on a later occasion devote special attention to the question of Gaeltacht place-names.  It is not going to be such an easy matter.  If we are going to take as a Gaelic place-name a name which is said to be the place-name in common name who is going to determine the question of usage?  We should have some authority to do that.  Certainly the Minister for Local Government would not be the most appropriate authority to deal with it.  If we are to deal with the position in the Gaeltacht, bearing in mind that Irish forms and names are in widespread use&mdash;if you like in universal use&mdash;we have to have special machinery to deal with it. As I am on the question of the Gaeltacht, Senator O Buachalla referred to the fact that rate demand notes go out in Irish.  But, on the other hand, the valuation lists on which the assessments are made are in English.  All that official machinery is still operating on the English foundations and will have to be operated for some time, because ordnance maps and many other things have still to be changed.</P>
    <P>We can proceed, perhaps, a little slowly in regard to the Gaeltacht names because the Irish names are in general use there.  But there, as everywhere else, if we are going to adopt certain Irish names, we must see that they are correct in every respect, and that the forms in which they are to be officially recognised, whether in legal or other documents, will be unchallengeable. I was anxious that we should be able to say that in relation to Irish names which might replace English names henceforward in the rest of this country.  Accordingly machinery is provided by the section to ensure that the proposed changes would be considered in all aspects before the Government makes them and decides that the new names shall be given official cognisance.  Remember that changes can only be made by the Government.</P>
    <P>I do not see that we need to be <Col N="406" /> ashamed of the fact that in regard to proposed changes we do give full consideration to the views of the minority of our people.  I think it is something rather to be proud of, that while in every other country majorities have become tyrannical, at least there is one country in Europe where the majority realises that the minority has rights and is prepared to defer to the views of that minority in a way which some people regard as undue. Bearing in mind the history of our people, the fact that we are prepared to take and to give full weight to the views of any minority amongst us is one of the things that will help to build up the Irish nation on a foundation which will stand whatever stress or storm it may meet with.</P>

      <P>Like Senator Sir John Keane I am in a minority of one as far as previous speakers are concerned.  I cannot understand why a translation from English into Irish or from Irish into English can be interpreted as a cause of difficulty.  This Bill when it is passed will be translated into Irish.  It will not then be a new Bill.  When Dún Laoghaire was substituted for Kingstown&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>As Dún Laoghaire has been mentioned it was not a change of name there.  Dún Laoghaire was the name imposed by statute on a new corporate body, the Borough of Dún Laoghaire, which came into existence by the amalgamation of Kingstown, Blackrock, Killiney and Dalkey.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanODonovan" hpid="Mr. S. O'Donovan Mr. S. O'Donovan">

      <P>I only wanted to indicate that the Irish word is distinct from the English one, and why it is illegal to use the word Dunleary but legal to use Dún Laoghaire.  I base that statement on the Constitution, which states that Irish is the official <Col N="407" /> national language, and that English is recognised as the second language. If I call my home town Clonakilty in English or Clanna Caoilte in Irish, I cannot see why there should be any difficulty about the changing of names. I cannot see how this matter should arise under this Bill, or why using the Irish translation of an English name is going to make a difference.  It seems to be <i>ultra vires</i> as far as the Constitution is concerned.  The Post Office has gone so far as to change the names of places and uses Irish names on the date stamp.</P>
      <P>Is it illegal simply to use the Irish name?  For the same reason, I cannot see why using the Irish form of the name requires a vote of the people concerned. If that is done, will it be illegal to use the English form?  The English form still can be used.  It would be better for us to grade ourselves up to the position which now obtains in the Fíor-Ghaeltacht, where the Irish names only are used.  I am puzzled and I cannot follow the debate on this.</P>

      <P>May I put twopence in the slot?  There seems to be some confusion between transliteration, translation and using a completely different name.  If we are going to transliterate we should transliterate correctly.  When examining deeds, I have often seen an attempt to render an Irish name in English.  There are nine or ten alternatives, none of which is correct.  If we are going to be correct, let us be really correct.  Let us be scholarly and pedantic and, when making a transliteration, let it be correct. If we are making translations let them be correct.  I am in violent agreement with the expressions which have fallen from Senators.  It is a different thing where there are two names both founded in the history of the land, we will say Maryborough and Port-laoighise. <Col N="408" /> Both these names belong to history and both should be preserved and should have equal rights.</P>

      <P>I am sorry we have not had all this discussion in Irish, but it was worth while to hear Senator Ó Siochfhradha say that myself and the Minister are now standing wide-eyed at our own temerity 25 or 30 years ago. It is a difficult thing to change the name of a place.  It is difficult to have a place name right.  If you changed every Knock in the country into Cnoc, you would be persuading one citizen to call it Cnoc instead of Knock.  I was in Clonmel at Easter with a professor who is an authority on place names and on folklore and national traditions &mdash; Professor Delargy.  We were there purely for the purpose of climbing hills and we went to a place called properly Cnoc an Aifrinn.  I said to someone in Clonmel that we climbed Cnoc an Aifrinn and he said: &ldquo;What?  Where?&rdquo; and I had to call it Knockanaffron which, as Senator Ó Siocfhradha knows, is a monstrosity. In Wales there is no regulation about putting up the name of a railway station in Welsh.  You get into a railway carriage at a certain station in Wales and respectable hard-hatted farmers will come to the station and talk Welsh.  Putting the names of the stations in Irish in this country has not made us speak any more Irish. That is what I am interested in.  It is not any use to talk about people having the courage to do certain things.  Senator Ó Siocfhradha said: &ldquo;If, 25 years ago, we had the courage, we would have tackled the whole problem&rdquo;. We had plenty of courage 25 years ago and plenty of problems to tackle, but we were not able to tackle this.  No one with courage or ingenuity has since tackled it until to-night. Is that a fair statement?  With all the courage that Senator Ó Siocfhradha displayed in 1922, and he displayed some courage when it was necessary, there was none to spare for this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I did not put down my amendment because of my consideration for any minority.  I am not concerned here about the minority at all.  I am concerned about quite a different thing. <Col N="409" /> I am concerned about bringing some kind of reality into this matter of reviving our own traditions.  I want to revive our traditions and I have done my share in it, but we must be realists in the matter.  If you have a majority of two-thirds who want to change the name of a place you have a presumption there and then that, when it is changed, it will be operated.  That is why I am in favour of a two-thirds majority.  I am not ashamed, and I do not stand wide-eyed at my own temerity years ago.  In fact I am getting worse rather than better from that point of view; I am becoming more temerarious.  As the Minister told us this four-sevenths is a compromise between a simple majority and two-thirds, if the House is not in favour of two-thirds, I shall not delay the House by dividing on it.  But my object was not concerned with the minority.  My object was to make the change as real as we could make it.  If two-thirds is not acceptable, I cannot help it.</P>

      <P>In sub-section (1), page 34, to delete all words after the word &ldquo;duties&rdquo; in line 49 to the end of the sub-section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am proposing the amendment because I feel that the powers given in this section are rather extensive and should not be given unless the Minister has some very good reason to put forward. If that is so, of course I will not press the amendment.  I hold that local authorities have ample power at the present time for the acquiring of land or property for the purpose of carrying out their duties.  The question of whether they acquire the land by agreement or otherwise does not concern me in moving this amendment. If a public authority has no idea of the purposes for which or the manner in which they want to acquire certain property, they will not be able to give the information to the community which the community are entitled to get as to why they mean to acquire the property.  The people in the area administered by the local authority will have to contribute to the purchase of this property.  They may have to contribute at least 60 per cent. or they may have to contribute the whole of it.  Therefore, they are entitled to know what is the purpose for which the property is to be acquired and what use the local authority intends to make of it.  I hold that giving an authority power to acquire land, notwithstanding that they have not determined the manner in which, or the purpose for which, they intend to use it, is giving them something that, unless in very grave circumstances, should not be given.  They should have their minds made up as to what purpose they mean to put the land to and they should give it as great publicity as possible, so that the people in the locality will have an opportunity of expressing their opinions.  Public <Col N="412" /> opinion will be the best guide as to whether it would be wise to give this power.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not accept the amendment; to do so would be to defeat the whole purpose of the section.  I do not see why we should not encourage local authorities to have some foresight.  In the preparation of town plans and locality plans a local authority may foresee that it is probable they may require at some future date a certain portion of land and that, even in advance of their requirements, it might be a wise and prudent act to acquire that land.  But, even though they may foresee that and anticipate that at some future date they may require certain land, they would not be in a position to determine the manner in which, or the purpose for which, that land would be utilised.  That determination very probably could not be made until, perhaps, other portions of land had been acquired.</P>
      <P>All we are doing here is to allow the local authorities to exercise a certain amount of foresight, to plan ahead, even though the planning would be of a rather tentative and provisional kind. No local authority will purchase or acquire land, particularly by agreement, without the ratepayers, the people they represent, being fairly well aware of the intention of the local authority and what its ultimate purpose might be.  I think the Senator should concede to the local authorities at least this, that if they acquire land they will acquire it with the <i>bona fide</i> intention of using it in the public interest and for the public good.  That is the basis upon which the section has been drafted.</P>

      <P>Would it not be possible for the local authority to specify a number of reasons why they want land?  They might require it for building purposes, to make a playground for children, for a vocational school, or for a cemetery.  These are usually the reasons for which land is required.  The local authority should be able to give a definite reason, so <Col N="413" /> that the people concerned, who will have to contribute something towards the purchase price, will have something to talk about and they can express their views as to the desirability of such land acquisition.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no doubt that a local authority acquiring land will specify, for the benefit of the ratepayers, the purpose for which they intend to acquire it.  The Senator must not lose sight of the force of the word &ldquo;determine&rdquo;.  &ldquo;Determine&rdquo;, in my view, would represent the fixation of a purpose by formal resolution, and it is to avoid the need for that by a formal act of the council under seal&mdash;I do not know exactly how it might be done&mdash; that the section is so framed.  But determination has a legal significance and it is to allow the council to acquire land without having to fulfil these very narrow and rigid conditions which are, I think, imposed on a council by the doctrine of <i>ultra vires.</i></P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 41:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (1) to insert after line 22, the following new subclause:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(c)  Where the person to whom the land is to be disposed of is the person from whom the land was acquired containing an option to that person to repurchase the land at the price paid for it on acquisition.</P>
      <P>This amendment may be defective and may not carry out my intention.  What I am endeavouring to achieve is that where land is acquired by a local authority and that authority subsequently finds that they do not require the land and propose to dispose of it, then in such a case there should be an option to the person from whom the land was acquired originally to repurchase it at the price at which it was acquired by the local authority.  If the Minister accepts the principle of the amendment, it could be introduced on Report Stage in an improved form.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="414" /> It is quite possible that land may be acquired for a purpose that might appeal to the person from whom it is acquired.  He may be a high-minded person, interested in providing amenities for his district, and even if he had other intentions as to the use to which the land could be put&mdash;he might have his own plans laid out&mdash;still, when the local authority approached him for the purpose of acquiring the property by agreement, he would not, being interested in his locality, offer any obstruction by way of driving a hard bargain or making it a difficult matter for the local authority to acquire the particular property.  In the event of the local authorities not needing the land and deciding to offer it for sale, I suggest that the person to whom it belonged originally would have a prior claim.</P>
    <P>I suggest also that the price which was considered fair and equitable when the local authority was acquiring it, should be accepted from the original owner, if he desires to purchase it.  If the local authority have made any improvements in the way of fencing, or draining or levelling it would, of course, be understood that the price to the individual who would get the option would include the cost incurred in the matter of improvements.  That was the idea in my mind when I tabled this amendment.  I hope the Minister will accept it.</P>

      <P>Senator Ruane's amendment might, perhaps, cover land acquired by agreement as well as land acquired compulsorily.

It does appear to be reasonable that if land is taken off a person without his consent, and if it is not required for the purpose for which it was taken, <Col N="416" /> the former owner should have first option to get it back.

      <P>I must qualify what I said earlier.  I cannot see how amendment No. 41 is really relevant to Section 80.  When looking at the amendment, I thought it had reference to Section 79, which deals with the acquisition of land.  It is true that Section 80 deals with the disposal of land, but Section 80 merely amends the present law in this respect: that, with the exception of corporate property, the county manager has full power of disposal over county property.  The purpose of Section 80 is to ensure that no property will be disposed of until the matter has been brought to the notice of the members of the local authority when they will have an opportunity of expressing their views on it.  If they have any objections they can then state them.  When speaking before, I could not see how Section 80 came in, so I was addressing myself to amendment No. 41 as an amendment to Section 79.  I cannot see how that amendment could be made to Section 80.  Such an amendment would have to be made not only to Section 80 but to sections in many other Acts because these lands may be acquired under a variety of enactments.  I submit that the House should not accept an amendment of this sort.  It would have to be a general comprehensive amendment to a number of enactments of which the House at this stage has no knowledge.</P>

      <P>I have some experience of this, and I think that what I say is correct.  Suppose land is acquired compulsorily for housing, the price is fixed by an arbitrator.  I understood from Senator Sweetman that he disagreed with the Minister's assumption that such a price is fair to all parties. My experience has been that where land is acquired compulsorily for housing, and where the price is fixed by an arbitrator, the price is fair.  I think that if the provisions in the section for getting the price fixed by arbitration are worked, as they should be worked, that that should end the deal. I dislike bringing in something that would enable the original owner, in five or ten years' time, to get back that land again.  I think it would be a wrong thing to introduce into a Bill.</P>

      <P>If the owner in the meantime had moved out and another man had moved in, what was going to happen?  The idea that seems to be behind Senator Ruane's amendment is that if a couple of acres of land are acquired from some person that that person should have the right to get that land back again.  If in the meantime the man sold the farm and went away, what is going to happen?</P>

      <P>I can think of a particular case&mdash;I do not want to mention names because I have not got the authority of the parties concerned to do so&mdash;where land was taken over and where the price of the land was perfectly fair, judged by certain standards, but no money could compensate that owner for the damage done to the property that remained on his hands.  If that property were not required by the local authority and were to come into the open market, the local authority, without some provision of the nature of which Senator Ruane has proposed, could hold up that owner to ransom for an incalculable amount.  It does appear to me that where land is taken compulsorily for the general good, if the general good does not require it, at least it should be returned to the person from whom it was taken.</P>

      <P>Perhaps we could discuss this matter on the Report Stage, as time is getting on and the situation is becoming more entangled.  It is true that under the Labourers Acts, where land is acquired for the purpose of labourers' cottages and is not used for that purpose, if it has to be disposed of, it has to be offered to the original owner or at least it has been the custom to offer it but this thing can become preposterous.  Land may have been taken over 100 years ago and considerable development work may have been carried out since, enormously enhancing the value of the land.  Are we to go and offer that land to the original owner at the original price?  I have made the suggestion that perhaps we could discuss this at greater length on another occasion.</P>

      <P>The purpose that was definitely set out when the land was acquired may have had a very <Col N="419" /> strong influence on the owner of the land and may have been the determining factor in his decision to part with it.  The land may have been acquired for the purpose of building a parochial hall, which would add to the amenities of his own district, or it might have been acquired for the purpose of erecting a vocational school in which perhaps his children could receive an education that it would be very difficult otherwise to get.  These considerations may have been the determining factor in getting the man to make up his mind to part with the land.  If the purpose for which it was required is not fulfilled, and if the local authority propose to sell it, who is more entitled to it than the man from whom they got the property in the first instance?</P>

      <P>In page 40, after the words &ldquo;The whole Act&rdquo; in the third column opposite the words &ldquo;Bridges (Ireland) Act, 1834&rdquo; in the second column, to insert the words &ldquo;so far as unrepealed.</P>
      <P>A number of sections in this statute have been repealed already.  In fact, Sections 16 to 22 were repealed by 21 and 22 Vict. Chap. 23, Sec. 1.  Section 7, Sections 11 to 15, Sections 23 and 24 were repealed by the Statute Law Revision Act, 1874 and other sections, also, have been repealed by other enactments.  In the Public Assistance Act, 1939, in a Schedule of Repeals, the words are used: &ldquo;so far as unrepealed&rdquo; and I do not think that this House ought to purport to repeal sections of an Act which have already been repealed by previous enactments. Therefore, I propose in this amendment to put in, after the words, &ldquo;the whole Act&rdquo; the words &ldquo;so far as unrepealed&rdquo;.  In the First Schedule to the Public Assistance Act of 1939, the Schedule of Repeals, a great number of Acts which were repealed already are stated to be repealed so far as they are already unrepealed.

We have had this matter under discussion.  He thinks that the words, &ldquo;so far as unrepealed&rdquo;, would be tautologous and advised me that <Col N="423" /> it would be bad draftsmanship to accept them.  In the circumstances, I am afraid the only thing that Senator Ryan can do is to take suitable opportunity of raising the matter in the courts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No. I am raising it here.  We have the Public Assistance Act, 1939, and I refer the Minister to the Schedule.  There must be some continuity as far as Parliamentary draftsmanship is concerned.  There it will be seen that in a number of cases the extent of the repeal was a whole Act &ldquo;so far as unrepealed.&rdquo;  I have looked at the Index to the Statutes setting out the extent of repeal and in this Act of 1834 already, I think, about more than half the sections have been repealed. Why should the Oireachtas now purport to repeal the whole Act? I think that I am just as good a judge of draftsmanship as the Parliamentary draftsman.  It is pure obstinacy.  They never admit they are wrong.  I am quite prepared to stand over my opinion.  The Minister may refuse to accept it but I am not going to be stultified by being told by somebody who is my former pupil that something is wrong which I know is right.  This is a technical matter, a legal matter, and I am putting my view here.  I am only trying to improve the Bill.  I do not care.  If they think it is not a proper amendment to be accepted, let it be so, but I think it is my duty to help the Minister to produce something that will be more perfect than it comes here.  I have no axe to grind in this matter except that I am anxious to help.  I went to the trouble of going through the Schedule and I have seen that a great number of sections have been repealed already.  Am I to be told that the Parliamentary draftsman &mdash;who ought to know from the Index to the Statutes, which every Parliamentary draftsman should have, that these sections have been repealed&mdash; will not accept it?  I do not think that the Parliamentary draftsman is the person to decide whether an amendment should be accepted or not.  I think it is the Seanad.  But no case can be made for not accepting it and we have the precedent already in the <Col N="424" /> Public Assistance Act, 1939, No. 27 of 1939, in the Third Schedule.</P>

The draftsman, who is my official adviser, is concerned to ensure that when statutes are passed by the Oireachtas they will express the Ministerial intention, and that this purpose will not be defeated either by ambiguous phraseology or by a superabundance of caution.  It is true that even on occasions the Parliamentary draftsman has not been able to ensure that his phraseology will be interpreted in exactly the manner in which it was intended, but, in general, there have been very few of the many enactments passed by the Oireachtas challenged in the courts.</P>

      <P>I suggest to our colleague that he should not be so personal, by saying that he would be better employed at home.  Senator Ryan has given the Bill a good deal of study, but I think we should not <Col N="427" /> put in the words &ldquo;so far as unrepealed&rdquo; simply on the precedent. I do not think it could make any difference to say that the whole Act is gone now when there was only a little bit of it there last week. If we have inserted in the past &ldquo;so far as unrepealed&rdquo; I hope from now on we will have the words &ldquo;the whole Act&rdquo;.  I think Senator Ryan was hurt that we were not more condescending to his point of view.  I should like him to consider our point of view, when he said he would be better engaged at home.  I do not think there is much cause of dispute, whether the whole of an Act or portion of it is repealed.</P>

      <P>If an Act were passed five years ago, and if, in the following year, five or six sections were repealed, and this year we are repealing the balance, it means that the whole Act would be repealed.  This is the common expression.</P>

      <P>Not being a lawyer, I take the view that the whole difficulty in regard to inserting the words, &ldquo;so far as unrepealed&rdquo; is that the Parliamentary draftsmen were here challenging the right or the competency of the authority to repeal the sections of the original Act of 1843.  It is a long time ago, in so far as it affects this particular section.  Probably, the Parliamentary draftsmen were challenging the right or the competency of the authority to amend the particular Act.  That may be an explanation for it and it may explain the difference between the view held by Senator Ryan and the view held by the Parliamentary draftsman.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 50:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 40, to delete the word &ldquo;Section&rdquo; in the Third Column opposite the words &ldquo;Towns Improvement Clauses Act, 1847&rdquo; in the Second Column, and in lieu thereof to insert the word &ldquo;Sections&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I think this is an amendment, which the Minister will accept.  In the Bill as it stands, we are repealing &ldquo;Section 167 to 184.&rdquo;  That should, obviously, read &ldquo;Sections&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 53:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 40, immediately after the words and figures &ldquo;35 and 36 Vic. c. 69&rdquo;, &ldquo;Local Government Board (Ireland) Act, 1872&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Section 6&rdquo; in the First, Second and Third Columns respectively, to insert the words and figures &ldquo;38 and 39 Vic. c. 46&rdquo;, &ldquo;Bridges (Ireland) Act, 1875&rdquo; and &ldquo;The whole Act&rdquo; in the First, Second and Third Columns respectively.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the new Bill is to make legislation for bridges and a great number of the Bridges (Ireland) Acts have been repealed by this Bill, commencing with the Bridges (Ireland) Act of 1813.  Now, there was a Bridges (Ireland) Act in 1875, 38, 39 Victoria, Chapter 46, which is obsolete and out of date having regard to this legislation. It is a one-section Act which says:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;In cases where it is proposed to erect a bridge wholly within the limits of any one county, it shall be lawful for the grand jury of any neighbouring county, upon and after application made and approved at presentment sessions for the county at large to consent to co-operate with the grand jury of any such first-named county, for the purposes of the hereinbefore recited Acts, and to signify such consent by a resolution entered on the record of its proceedings; and thereupon all the provisions <Col N="429" /> of the hereinbefore recited Acts shall extend and be applicable in like manner as if such bridge was proposed to be erected over a river forming the boundary between the said counties, and all acts and proceedings by the hereinbefore recited Acts provided shall and may be done, had, and taken accordingly.</P>
    <P>The term &lsquo;county&rsquo; in this section shall include county of a city and county of a town.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That Act is now obsolete having regard to the legislation which is now in course of being passed.  Under this Bill we are also repealing Section 31 of the Local Government Act, 1925. Section 31 of the Local Government Act of 1925 enacts that: &ldquo;Nothing in the Act shall be deemed to repeal or amend or otherwise prejudice or affect the Bridges (Ireland) Acts, of 1813 to 1875&rdquo;.  That is the code and I submit to the Seanad we ought not to leave the last Act of that code in the air and not repeal it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to reduce the valuation on half <Col N="430" /> rents from a half of the half rent to a quarter of the half rent.  I do not know if the Minister has considered that matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>

      <P>On the Second Schedule, Senator P.J. O'Reilly asked me to mention a point arising in respect of the proportionate valuation. He feels that in regard to some of the smaller boroughs the figure of three-quarters in respect of land which is solely used for arable purposes is too high a proportion.  He understood that the Minister was going to consider the question after the Second Reading.  I did not enter into that discussion at all, but he understood the Minister was going to do something about it.  As the Minister has not, he asked me to give notice to the House that he proposes to introduce some amendment there on the Report Stage.</P>
