    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Senators are, no doubt, familiar with the purpose of this Bill. They will have had an opportunity of reading the White Paper which was circulated along with it, and the recently-published report of the Turf Development Board.  They will also have been made aware of the programme which the Bill is designed to implement from the report of the debates on it in the Dáil.  The necessity for the systematic development of our turf resources for the production of fuel need hardly be stressed at any length.  The experience of the country during the present emergency will have brought forcibly home to Senators and to the public generally the dangers involved in complete reliance on imported fuels, and it will, probably, be generally agreed that, if it had not been for the development of our turf resources during the past five years, the fuel position in this country would have been much more critical than it has been.  The development of our turf resources during the emergency had necessarily to be undertaken in a manner which did not tend towards maximum efficiency, and which was, in many respects, exceptionally costly.  It had to be undertaken, without any systematic planning in advance, through the medium of workers who had no previous experience of turf production, directed mainly by the staffs of country councils diverted from their ordinary duties for that purpose.  Also, because of the nature of the emergency and the inability to procure equipment, production had to be entirely upon a hand-won basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1260" /> Bearing in mind that turf is the only native fuel abundantly available in many parts of the country and, having regard to the desirability of the systematic and efficient development of these resources, the Government requested the Turf Development Board, prior to the emergency, to examine in detail the prospects of the development of turf-production on a large scale by mechanical methods.  The board examined the practice in other European countries and found that large-scale turf production could be achieved on an economic basis by means of intensive mechanisation of the bogs.  Officers of the board visited Germany, Russia and, more recently, Sweden and other Baltic countries where turf production in a mechanised manner has been undertaken.  The benefit of the experience gained from these visits is available to the board and has had an influence in determining the plans of the board for the future.  The method of mechanised production adopted by the Turf Development Board prior to the war was based mainly upon that employed previously in Germany.  So far as the experience of the board is a reliable guide, it justifies the conclusion that similar methods are the most suitable for adoption in the future.</P>
    <P>We now have had experience of the operations of these methods in this country and are in a position to base long-term plans upon them.  Despite the difficulties caused by the outbreak of the war which among other things prevented the board from obtaining all the necessary machinery, it has succeeded in demonstrating to the satisfaction of the Government that the production of turf by mechanical means is possible on an economic basis in relation to the price of imported coal.  Mechanical production of the type undertaken by the board has been found particularly suitable for the generation of electricity from stations situated in the bogs to which I shall refer again later.  There are, of course, other advantages to be gained by the exploitation of turf on a large scale by mechanical methods, including the employment which can be given and, of course, the retention within the country of money which would <Col N="1261" /> otherwise go to pay for the importation of other fuels.</P>
    <P>I should perhaps at this stage make it clear that while the Turf Development Board under this scheme will be concerned only with the machine-won products, that does not mean that assistance will not be given to private interests concerned with the production of hand-won turf.  As the House is no doubt aware, hand-won turf provides, and has always provided, the basic fuel for very large areas in the country, and in some districts no other fuel can afford even a partial alternative. For that reason hand-won turf will maintain an important place in the economic life of the countryside and the small towns and villages in the turf districts.  Moneys will continue to be made available from the Special Employment Schemes Vote for bog drainage and road making where it is considered necessary to assist production or to improve the quality of the turf produced.  The question of competition between machine-won turf and hand-won turf will not arise.  The machine-won product, as it becomes available for industrial and private consumption, will merely reduce the quantity of hand-won turf at present being supplied by the Turf Development Board through the operation of the turf camp scheme or by the county councils, and hand-won turf produced locally by private enterprise will continue to be required for local consumption.</P>
    <P>So far as these private turf producers are concerned they will be free to market their turf where they can find a buyer, and they can charge the best price that they can obtain.  They will be entirely free from restrictions of any kind.  I am referring now to the situation as we see it after the immediate fuel crisis has passed.  For the time being, the emergency restrictions on the movement of turf from the turf areas to the non-turf areas must be maintained.  It will be, of course, necessary for some time yet to maintain the rationing of turf in the non-turf areas.  The board in the carrying out of the scheme outlined in the White Paper will not interfere with the <Col N="1262" /> turbary rights of those who work them for their own use.</P>
    <P>In accordance with the request of the Government the Turf Development Board has prepared a comprehensive ten years' scheme for the development of a series of bogs by mechanical production. The particulars of that scheme are set out in the White Paper together with the estimated annual output on each bog fully developed as well as the estimated cost per ton of the fuel to be produced.  It is estimated that the bogs to be developed by mechanical methods, that is the bogs listed in the White Paper, will each last from 25 to 30 years at the rate of production contemplated.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  The only exceptions to that are the Barna bog and the Glenties bog in Donegal.  The duration of these bogs will be somewhat less.  I should perhaps make it clear that in developing the bogs the greatest care will be taken to ensure that the top layer of peat is left intact during the operations on the bog so that each bog when finally exhausted as a source of fuel will be available for reclamation and will be suitable for agriculture.  I should also state that the bogs listed in the White Paper were selected for their suitability for development by mechanical means.  By that I want to have it understood that the decisive factors were, first, the quality of the turf in the bogs.  The turf in the selected bogs had to be of the requisite quality.  Secondly, it was necessary because of the production methods which the board intends to employ that these bogs should be free of timber. The bogs listed have been ascertained to be free of timber.  Thirdly, it was necessary also that arterial drainage was, or was about to be undertaken in the locality of each bog.  Lastly, from the point of view of the board the marketing potentialities of the bog area had also to be taken into account.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I informed the Dáil, which was naturally interested in the fact that no bogs were listed in the White Paper in Mayo and certain other areas, that a detailed survey of the larger bog areas is at present in progress.  The position <Col N="1263" /> in Cork, Mayo and other counties which are not mentioned in the list contained in the White Paper will be re-examined in the light of any further information becoming available as to their suitability of development.  The fact that only certain bogs have been listed in the White Paper does not mean that the board's programme is to be confined accordingly.  On the contrary, that programme as set out in the White Paper should be regarded merely as a beginning.  If an <i>ad hoc</i> market for a considerable quantity of turf were to emerge anywhere in the course of normal industrial development the board will be free to provide supplies by the development of any suitable bog in the proximity of that market.  Some types of bog are not regarded as suitable for development by the mechanical methods at present used by the board.  In that connection it is important to note that these methods are not to be regarded as static.  It will be the duty of the new board, Bord na Móna, to experiment with other and improved mechanised methods and with alternative means of turf production suited to the characteristics of particular kinds of bog so that bogs not suitable for development by the present equipment, such, for example, as bogs that are known to contain timber, will be developed by other means.  The Seanad will undoubtedly be interested in the question of average costs per ton of machine won turf to be produced under this scheme.</P>
    <P>Prior to the emergency, it was estimated that turf could be produced by these means at the bogs, then being developed, at about 10/6 per ton on the bog, but the incidence of the emergency has so interfered with operations as to render a substantial increase in cost unavoidable.  For example, the wage content in the production of machine-won turf has increased by 50 per cent.  Since the beginning of the emergency the wages paid by the Turf Development Board have been virtually doubled.  It has not so far been found possible to obtain sufficient plant for the full mechanisation of the bogs in production, and, with partial machinery, full production cannot be <Col N="1264" /> achieved, and it would be unfair and incorrect to raise criticisms or make comparisons as to the cost of production until the board can proceed on the basis of full production.  It should be remembered that much of the capital of the board has so far been expended on experiments and on the design of machinery suitable to conditions in this country.  On a return to more normal conditions in the near future, especially in connection with the availability of materials and plant, production costs will tend to decline.  Full allowance has been made for all these contingencies when giving the estimated cost as quoted in the White Paper of between 20/- and 25/- per ton. When quoting two figures like those, I am not suggesting that there will be that margin of doubt as to what the production cost will be.  The cost of production will vary slightly from bog to bog as, of course, conditions in each bog will be somewhat different.  In one case, the cost may be as low as 20/- per ton and in another as high as 25/-, but the average will be around 22/6 per ton.</P>
    <P>It may be remarked that the expenditure of a large sum of money on a mechanised turf production scheme should await the development of suitable appliances for turf burning, but it is wrong to assume that suitable turf-burning appliances are not available. Apart from the turf stoves of the Aga type the household range which has been developed by the Industrial Research Council through the work of Dr. Kettle and the late Professor Taylor is as economic and as good as any such grate in use in any country.  With regard to the industrial users of turf&mdash; and it is contemplated that a large proportion of the turf produced under this scheme will be devoted to industrial use&mdash;there is a wide range of industrial appliances suitable for the use of turf.  There are still some problems to be solved and particularly the stoking problem where very large-scale installations are in use.  That is a matter which will engage the attention of the new experimental department contemplated in this legislation.</P>
    <P>On the question of a comparison between the cost of turf and coal, it will <Col N="1265" /> probably be within the knowledge of members of the House that before the war the gross calorific value of coal imported by the Electricity Supply Board was 11,500 to 12,000 British thermal units per pound.  Turf at 30 per cent. moisture content, as produced at Clonsast, has a value of 6,314 British thermal units per pound.  That indicates that one ton of coal is equivalent to slightly less than two tons of turf at 30 per cent. moisture content.  The experience of the board to date is that in any given period the moisture content of turf will be in or about 30 per cent. Extensive experiments made by the board in 1944 gave an average of 30.3 per cent. moisture, and in 1945 the average moisture content of the turf sold by the board from Clonsast was 28 per cent.</P>
    <P>It is clear from these figures that if turf is to be sold on an economic basis, it must be available at the point of use at a price not in excess of half the price of coal at the same point.  It is intended that the turf produced at these bogs will be sold in the immediate vicinity of the bogs and it is not hoped to replace entirely all our pre-war imports of coal.  These, as the House will remember, averaged not much less than 3,000,000 tons a year and the 1,000,000 tons of turf contemplated in the present scheme will only replace one-sixth of the pre-war imports of coal.  It is intended that the turf will be sold where it can be used most economically and made available at the lowest price and it is in comparison with the price of coal in the same locality that its economic value can best be calculated.</P>
    <P>In the Dáil, efforts were made to compare the price of turf and the price of coal on the basis of both delivered in Dublin.  That is, of course, an entirely false basis of calculation, particularly in regard to hand-won turf. In the port towns on the east coast, coal can always be delivered cheaper than turf produced in the midlands or in the western counties could be delivered.  It is not possible to make any firm forecast as to the probable price at which coal will be available in normal circumstances after the war, <Col N="1266" /> but it is most unlikely that it will be available at a price less than double the pre-war prices.  It may indeed be many years before coal is freely available at all.</P>
    <P>The decline in British coal production has not been yet arrested.  The figures for February, 1946, show that in that month the reduction in total output as compared with the same month in the previous year was not much less than in any previous month. Senators are aware that the Turf Development Board has been operating the briquetting process at Lullymore. That process is still to some extent experimental.  The board is reasonably satisfied that the process is a good one, but they are far from satisfied that the major problems associated with the process have been solved.  It is true that we have been producing briquettes by that process here at a price lower than that at which they are produced in other countries.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister give us some examples?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The price there is about £7 per ton.</P>
      <P>The problem that arises there is one of organising production on a sufficient scale from the bog to make full use of the capacity of the briquetting plant. If the factory can get peat of an adequate density, it can turn out briquettes, but at the present stage of the board's knowledge it is not clear that any known bog can give the factory a supply of peat with the consistency and quality necessary to enable it to work economically, and for that reason the present programme does not include any extensive development in the briquetting process.  It will be the duty of the board to continue its experiments in that regard, and if possible to endeavour to improve that process to a stage at which it can fully and economically be utilised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Because of the extensive nature of the scheme which is now about to be begun, the Government considered it would be inadvisable that a private <Col N="1267" /> company such as the Turf Development Board should be made responsible for it.  The Turf Development Board was set up about ten years ago with a nominal capital of £10, and has been financed entirely by advances from the Exchequer.  It is considered necessary that the organisation should be put upon a firmer and better basis in order to deal properly with the tasks entrusted to it.</P>
    <P>The new body should clearly be given statutory powers of a kind which it would be inappropriate to vest in a company constituted under the Companies Acts even though it was State controlled.  It has therefore been decided that the turf development scheme should be entrusted to a statutory corporation which will be constituted broadly on the lines of the Electricity Supply Board.  That is the purpose of this Bill.  The body so constituted will confine its operations to machine-won turf and to turf products.</P>
    <P>The Bill also contains provision for financing the operations of the new board.  The cost of acquiring and developing the bogs necessary to produce 1,000,000 tons of turf per year after ten years as outlined in the White Paper is estimated at £3,750,000.  It is proposed that that sum should be advanced to the board from the Central Fund as required and that it should be repayable.  Since a period of years normally elapses between the commencement of work on a bog and the time at which full production becomes possible, it is provided in Section 57 of the Bill that interest on all advances made to the board within five years of the passing of this Bill shall be remitted.  At the end of the period it is proposed that the Minister for Finance shall consult with the Minister for Industry and Commerce, and with the new board, to decide, having regard to the state of the board's finances at the time and board's future prospects, whether interest should then become payable and if so from that date, or whether it should be further deferred and, if so, for how long.  That measure of assistance is considered to be the least which the State should offer towards the successful <Col N="1268" /> attainment of the first stage of the turf development programme.</P>
    <P>I think I have said enough to make it clear that it is intended the turf should be produced by the new board by the most economic means, the aim being to make it available at the point of consumption at a price approximating to half the cost of imported coal. The board will not be required to maintain a uniform price but will endeavour to secure an average price which will cover the entire cost of production, including interest on capital and sinking fund payments.  The board's output will be sold without compulsion on its economic value.  If that policy should not be successful for any non-economic reason, some form of compulsion may be proposed but there is no provision in this Bill relating to compulsion and it is expected that it will be possible to avoid it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>In discussing the provisions of this Bill I am relating it to normal conditions when coal will be available and when a citizen in any part of the country will have the choice of buying machine-won turf at the price at which it will be available or of buying imported coal at the price at which it will be available.  I think it would be possible to define the sale areas as areas which would be within a radius of 30 or 40 miles of each of the bogs on which this machine production is contemplated.  It is within these areas that the board will ordinarily endeavour to dispose of the whole of this output which is not required for electricity generation, to which I will make some reference later. If, of course, a sales system can be organised on a basis of direct delivery to consumers, eliminating the charges involved by sale through retailers, then the geographical limit of the area available to the board around each bog might be extended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill has for its main object the establishment of a statutory body the members of which will be appointed by the Government, to undertake the production and marketing of machine-won turf, turf by-products and other bog products such as peat moss litter. The present Turf Development Board will be dissolved and its assets and liabilities vested in the new board.  In addition to the sum of £3,750,000 which will be made available to the <Col N="1270" /> board in repayable advances for the production of turf a further sum of £120,000 has been provided in the Bill for experimental purposes.  It is intended that that money will be made available by means of annual grants from moneys voted by the Dáil.</P>
    <P>The experimental work of the board will serve a three-fold purpose.  The first purpose will be to improve the mechanical process associated with cutting turf and to try out new devices.  I mentioned that in other countries where there are large peat resources methods other than those now employed by the board have been used apparently successfully.  One of these methods is extensively employed in Russia where the turf is extracted from the bog by means of a water jet and brought through conduit pipes to drying grounds where it is spread for drying.</P>
    <P>The board has been experimenting with that method here.  A laboratory scale experiment was undertaken last year, and further experiments on a much larger scale are contemplated this year.  The indications are that it is particularly suitable to the bogs in this country where, by reason of timber in the bogs, the present mechanical production is not suitable, and as it offers the prospect of a large number of harvests, it may prove more economical than the present method.  Secondly, the experimental fund will be devoted to <i>ad hoc</i> problems such as the examination of a turf-coal product which was produced in Sweden during the war, and which served the necessary purpose when other forms of coal could not be procured, but which when produced under Swedish conditions, was exceptionally costly.  There appears to be some prospect, however, that by experiments we may be able to reduce the cost in its application in this country.  Thirdly, long-term research into the constituents of turf. The members of the Seanad are, no doubt, aware that the Industrial Research Council carried out experiments for a number of years in the production of wax from turf, and that it was proven to be commercially possible.</P>
    <P>The board will conclude these experiments, <Col N="1271" /> and if they find that there are reasonable commercial possibilities in the process will, no doubt, operate it. There are other possible experiments which can be carried out in the production of various industrial commodities from turf, and it is intended that the board shall have power to experiment in relation to them, and be provided with the necessary finances.</P>
    <P>I mentioned already, however, that this turf development programme is associated with the electricity generation programme of the Electricity Supply Board.  Undoubtedly, the most economical way of using machine won turf is in the production of electricity. Senators are probably aware that a start will be made at Clonsast as soon as it is possible to obtain a generating plant.  It is intended that there should be erected in the vicinity of Clonsast a generating station to the requirements of which the whole of the Clonsast production will be devoted.  It is hoped that that station will be in use in the autumn of 1948.</P>
    <P>In addition, arrangements are in hand both by the Turf Development Board and the Electricity Supply Board with a view to the erection of a second turf-fired generating station in the area of the Brosna bogs.  It is intended that all base load steam stations will use turf exclusively.  A limit will, necessarily, be set to the number of such stations by the overall demand for electricity.  In the period covered by the Turf Board scheme, up to 500,000 tons per annum of this machine-won turf could be supplied for electricity generating purposes, in addition to the 120,000 tons to be produced at the Clonsast station. That quantity of turf would suffice to generate up to 350,000,000 units of electricity which, with the hydro-electric schemes now being constructed and the board's existing generating plant, would suffice to meet the Electricity Supply Board's estimate of the demand for electricity in the course of the next ten years which the board places at 800,000,000 units.  In order to operate the generating stations with turf, it will be necessary not only to have the turf but to have cooling water.  The provision of water for these <Col N="1272" /> stations constitutes a problem.  With regard to some of the bogs which are situated nearer to Dublin, if no solution can be found there, it will be necessary to resort to bogs which are a greater distance from Dublin where the same problem does not arise.</P>
    <P>Senators may be interested in the employment involved in the scheme as outlined in the White Paper. Roughly, it can be said that for every 100,000 tons of turf produced per year by machines full-time employment will be given to 340 men, and seasonable employment to an additional 340 men. On the basis, therefore, of production at the rate of 1,000,000 tons per year, as proposed in the White Paper, 3,400 men will find employment, and an additional 3,400 men seasonable employment, while drainage works will also employ large numbers.</P>
    <P>I think I have referred to all the principal provisions in the Bill.  A large part of the Bill is devoted to giving to the new board the necessary powers to carry out its work and is, more or less, in standard form.  Other of its provisions detail in the manner necessary in legislation the functions and responsibilities of the board.  The relative clauses are self-explanatory and do not call for any special comment. I recommend the Bill to the Seanad.  I think it is essential that the Turf Development Board, as reconstituted in the manner outlined, should be authorised and empowered to proceed with this turf development programme at the earliest date.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I seem to remember that, not very long ago, a very large and voluminous report was described as being half baked and slovenly.  It would, I think, be very much fairer to apply those epithets to the White Paper that was circulated in connection with the turf development scheme rather than to the 450 page report of the Vocational Commission.  This White Paper, supplemented as it is by the report of the Turf Development Board and by the statements of the Minister made in the Dáil and in this House, forms the basis on which we must decide whether it is wise or foolish to spend £3,750,000&mdash;not our own money but the people's money&mdash;<Col N="1273" /> in this way.  Not only this House and the Oireachtas, but the public as a whole, must decide whether they are going to take this scheme, or whether they are going to be opposed to it.</P>
      <P>It has very often, I think, been commented upon that there is a great lack of an intelligent public opinion. It is almost impossible to have an intelligent public opinion if the Government do not, on every opportunity that is available, put on the Table the whole of the known facts in regard to every social and economic problem with which they have to grapple.  If those known facts were made available to the people as a whole, it would be very much easier for an intelligent public to form an accurate opinion for itself.</P>
      <P>So far as this scheme is concerned I am one of those whom it would have been extremely easy to satisfy, because I take the view that the development of our peat resources is highly desirable from the angle of the development of our national resources, on the one hand and, on the other hand&mdash;I regret that this aspect of the question was only touched upon in passing by the Minister&mdash;from the angle of the reclamation of a substantial area of our country.  I shall come back to that at a later stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to impress upon the Minister and the House that it is because I am genuinely anxious to see our peat resources properly developed I desire to examine carefully and critically the proposals put before us.  It must be realised by everybody that, if this scheme of turf production does not go down with the public, then it marks the end of any chance for the development of our peat resources, not only during our generation but during the lifetime of our children and their children. The Minister must appreciate that, so far as the cities are concerned, particularly Dublin, the word &ldquo;turf&rdquo;, after the past six years, has no pleasant memories.  Whether that is reasonable or unreasonable, does not enter into the question.  The Minister never got over to the people, particularly in the cities, that they were very lucky to have the material in the emergency years that was available.  That was not turf in the ordinary sense of the term.  It was a fuel which we were <Col N="1274" /> lucky to have, and I do not want in the slightest to detract from the value of the work done by anybody in producing that fuel.  It was an emergency fuel which had to be used.  It was brought up to Dublin in a way in which it would not have been brought but for the emergency.  The Minister would achieve much greater success in the future&mdash;I am speaking now, as the Minister was speaking, of the post-emergency period&mdash;if he would admit frankly and openly that the stuff brought up to Dublin and sold as turf during the emergency was not turf, as it should be produced in non-emergency years, quite apart from the question whether it was machine-won or hand-won turf.  It would then be very easy to develop our peat resources in a successful manner.  It is regrettable that that was not brought out more clearly in the White Paper, and it is more regrettable that it was not brought out clearly in the Minister's utterances on this subject.</P>
    <P>So far as the White Paper is concerned, it can, I think, fairly be described as an effort to get the members of the House to agree blindfolded to a proposition.  Nowhere in the White Paper or in the Reports of the Turf Development Board are there accurate estimates other than the estimate contained in one small page of the appendix. In the other House, references were made to the introduction of the Shannon scheme in 1927.  I was not sufficiently old in 1927 to take cognisance of that and I do not propose to make that comparison.  But I do propose to make another comparison.</P>
    <P>I propose to make comparison with the report brought in under the aegis of the present Minister and submitted to this House by another board&mdash;the Electricity Supply Board.  The Minister will himself recollect the meticulous care shown by the Electricity Supply Board in the preparation of their report on rural electrification. That report, extending to 114 pages, was full of accurate, technical information, with illustrative graphs, which enabled people who wanted to get at the roots of the proposition put forward by the Government to see exactly what was proposed.  This <Col N="1275" /> White Paper is notable for all that it omits of matter such as was contained in the report introduced by the Electricity Supply Board prior to the passing of the Act of last year.  It would have been interesting, for example, if the White Paper had given us some information of the area to be developed in respect of each of the bogs, so that it would have been possible to judge whether the expenditure on one bog, as against another, or even on lowland bogs as against mountain bogs, was desirable expenditure.  It would have been possible also for members of the House to consider the question of the life of the bog itself. Twenty-five or 30 years is a very long period in our lives but it is only a trifle in the life of a nation.  We must remember that in dealing with this problem.  So far as the national life is concerned, this is not a long-term operation.</P>
    <P>The appendix deals with the development of Clonsast bog.  Here we find one of the difficulties in assessing the merits of the scheme without the information which, I think, the Minister should have put before us.  The sum of £65,000 is to be spent on Clonsast and the bog is to have an annual output of 120,000 tons.  The Minister, in his opening remarks, agreed that Clonsast bog would have a maximum life of about 30 years.  That means that, out of Clonsast, there is to be produced during this period approximately 3,500,000 tons of turf.  It would have been much more proper if the Turf Development Board had indicated the area of Clonsast which they proposed to develop.  There were originally in Clonsast 8,144 acres of bog.  So far as I can ascertain from any of the technical people concerned, there are at least 7,000 acres of bog still in Clonsast capable of producing 21,000,000 tons of turf.  The Minister proposes to take out of Clonsast for this electricity power station only some 3,500,000 tons of turf.  Perhaps, the Minister would explain how that is and how it is that he is going to erect a substantial, costly plant for the generation of electricity if the bog is only going to last between 25 and 30 years, while there are 21,000,000 tons <Col N="1276" /> of turf available in what is commonly known as Clonsast bog.  That would, on the Minister's own estimate, as given to the Dáil, last about 250 years.</P>
    <P>In the other House, the Minister made comparisons respecting the cost of electricity which will be generated. I should like him to explain to us what proportion of the cost is represented by amortisation of the large plant which is to be erected for only a period of 30 years.  It appears to me, from what the Minister has stated, that when the 30 years are over, there will be no further use there for the developing machinery, and that there will be no use for the building which are to be erected to house the machinery.  I think it has been estimated, so far, that the present utility of the turbine used for hydro-generation is somewhere about 94 per cent., and that, therefore, so far as the turbine in a hydro-electric scheme is concerned, there is no limit to its life; it is purely a question of maintenance. It is not going to be scrapped because it suddenly becomes out-of-date, because obviously the last 6 per cent. of utility is not worth while achieving when it comes to scrapping machinery as a whole.</P>
    <P>I do not know what length of life is anticipated for the generating machinery at Clonsast, but, regardless of the length of life that is anticipated for the machinery, it would appear to me that a length of life of only 30 years for the buildings that are going to house the machinery, and for the very large structures necessary from the point of view of storage, etc., is one that is going to make amortisation excessively costly, and that the cost of the current that is going to be provided will be such that the whole cost of electricity will be increased.  When I talk of an increase, I am not talking of the emergency period; again, I am speaking of it in a long-term way. Therefore, I should like to know whether, in view of the information available in the shape of the bog commissioner's report and the report of the commission of inquiry into the industrial resources of Ireland, it would not have been more satisfactory to put such a generating station in a position, <Col N="1277" /> if one is going to be erected, where it would have very much greater resources to draw upon than merely 3,500,000 tons of turf, which will mean that at the end of 30 years the machinery and buildings will be left there derelict and useless, after having used only 120,000 tons of turf per annum.</P>
    <P>There are some 4,500 square miles of bog in this country and 2,000 of them on the Minister's statement are available for mechanical production.  Surely it would have been possible to arrange that the generating station, having regard to the enormous capital cost involved, could have been placed at some point where it would have a longer life than 30 years?</P>
    <P>I do not know how it is intended to deal with the transport of turf from the bog to the point of sale, or, in respect of Clonsast, to the station itself.  I have been assured that that has not been dealt with up to this by the Turf Development Board in regard to the emergency scheme; it has been dealt with by another Government Department. I should like to be quite certain, in so far as this scheme is concerned, that there is going to be no possibility of the repetition of the ramp that existed in regard to the transport of emergency turf.  It is a common report, that one particular firm, starting from nothing, has accumulated in regard to turf transport about £150,000.  I mentioned on a previous occasion in this House how one individual gave evidence in the District Court that he was making £12,000 a year from the carriage of turf.  No wonder it is said in the turf areas&mdash;it is a matter of common gossip&mdash;that the best possible thing one can get into in the way of a racket at the present time is the carriage of turf.  People are, in consequence, leaving everything else to get into that racket.  I know myself that people have left even the Guards in Kildare in order to get into the turf-carrying ramp.  I sincerely hope that whoever has the responsibility under this Bill the same opportunities of abuse will not be afforded in connection with the transport of turf as were afforded in the past.</P>
    <P>The Minister dealt, in passing, with <Col N="1278" /> the Lullymore briquette factory.  He suggested that the figure of £7 per ton is being charged for briquettes.  I think it would be desirable, not only in connection with that, but in connection with the whole scheme of machine-won turf that is to be operated through this Bill, that we should have placed on record the report of the people who went to the various foreign countries to see what was done in these countries, and that we should know what technical advice was given.  I am not interested in the names of the people, what I am interested in is the qualifications of those who tendered the advice on which this scheme was based.  That should be known by the Oireachtas and the people of the country as a whole, so that if the scheme is a success, as we hope it will be, we shall know what part of these technical reports was correct and what parts were inaccurate.</P>
    <P>So far as Lullymore is concerned, the present figure given by the Turf Development Board for the sale of briquettes is 54/9 per ton.  That figure is arrived at after taking 1/6 per ton off for head office expenses.  It is, I think, a new departure in business accounting that in arriving at the cost of items produced by the business, anything should be taken off the account for head office expenditure.  A much more correct figure would have been reached if we had the figures from the Turf Development Board, both in relation to macerated turf and Lullymore turf.  So far as Lullymore is concerned, the turf produced in briquette from has, I think the Minister will agree, a calorific value of 8½ thousands.  It has, therefore, approximately one-third more of a calorific value than macerated turf, which has something over 6,000.  Taking the Minister's figures for the sale of macerated turf, 20/- to 25/-, or taking the top figure of 25/-, so far as the calorific value of briquettes is concerned, they would have to be sold at something like 33/- or 34/- to be equivalent to the machine won turf from the point of view of pure fuel heat.</P>
    <P>Of course the briquettes have other attractions&mdash;the fact that there is not so much wastage, the fact that they can be pressed into a much smaller <Col N="1279" /> space and that they are cleaner to handle.  I think it desirable that we should appreciate that, at 54/9, the price without the 1/6 to which I referred, they are a luxury article, a luxury article of which we are producing 16½ thousand tons per annum. If the 51,000 tons of peat brought into the factory were used for machine won turf, they would produce some 34,000 tons.  It is questionable if we can afford the luxury of producing it in that manner rather than producing more machine won turf, which would in the long run be cheaper and which, in addition, would give out half as much heat again in the bulk.  Those are some questions I should like the Minister to deal with and I should like him also to amplify whether there has been any possibility of developing the Lullymore method of working from a lateral method to a vertical method. I understand that the quality of the turf has not been quite satisfactory. In Clonsast the whole bog is vertically cut, and so the bad and the good turf are mixed up, but that is not the case in the cutting of the Lullymore bog.  I think it would have been very desirable if the Minister had indicated for the convenience of the public the storage capacity necessary to store briquettes as against macerated turf and as against hand-won turf.  In city houses there is always a great difficulty of storage accommodation and that is why very great importance is attached to the question as to whether briquettes or macerated turf or hand won turf will take up the most space. It is a matter that could very easily have been dealt with in the White Paper.  If it had been made more clear it would have helped the public mind to a considerable extent.</P>
    <P>The White Paper and the Minister indicate and the board would suggest that the production of peat moss is something that is a new thing.  It is no more new than was the production of machine-won turf when Sir John Griffiths suggested it.  In 1920 it was set out that there was an output of some 50,000 tons of peat moss but the Minister now is only discussing a quantity of 3,500 tons per annum.  The suggestion that that is a step towards <Col N="1280" /> getting back to what the production was is misleading and undesirable.</P>
    <P>The Minister at one stage I thought was going to make his case for this Bill on the shortage of coal but in response to a query from Senator Hayes he shied away from that point and went on a different tack.  The proper case to make for this scheme, it would appear to me, is not in any way related to coal but in relation to the fact that it is desirable, if we can do it, to reclaim a large tract of our country which is at present useless.  It is on that general line that the whole plan should have been based.  The important thing we should have been told is the area of land that it is hoped will be reclaimed as a result of the operations of this Bill.  From my calculations the Minister only proposes to operate about 20,000 working acres.  I do not know if he will agree that that is an under-estimate or an overestimate but I have taken that from the figures he has given of the life of the present bogs and the amount of turf that is going to be produced.  Then I want to stress again, that it would have been highly desirable to make known to the public the area that it was hoped to reclaim under the present scheme.  It is stated that it is hoped to produce 2,000,000 tons of turf from the Clonsast bogs and the bogs of Roscommon, but in 1920 it was estimated that the total production of turf from these two bogs would be 15,500,000 tons.  That is a question on which the opinion of the technicians should have been brought before the House and the country as a whole and that would have been much easier to judge the merits of the scheme.</P>
    <P>I find it difficult to understand so far as production in Kildare is concerned if it is going to be sold in the area round the bogs how it is going to do anything more than displace the hand-won turf that is already produced there.  That is not going to be any improvement on the present situation. It is merely going to be a displacement. Hand-won turf has been produced for decades around that area by people who live there and who were able to sell it in competition with coal at a time when coal was at its cheapest <Col N="1281" /> price.  If that hand-won turf is going to be replaced by the machine-won product I think it would be very undesirable. It is one of the grouses I held against the Turf Board in Kildare that in its original years it cut across the operations of the co-operative societies and that it did prevent those societies from disposing of their output.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of the housing of the workers concerned in these schemes.  Some 3,400 workers are going to be permanently employed. Is it going to be left to the Kildare County Council to put up the additional houses that will be required to house those people or will the Turf Development Board do it?  Apart from that question, when the houses have been erected, will they be of such a nature that after the end of the 30 years' lease of life which the Minister has given to these bogs, that they will be of use for agricultural purposes when the bog is reclaimed and when we hope it can be put to agricultural uses?</P>
    <P>I am afraid I have strayed over a great many different points but I want to say, in concluding, that the one essential in regard to this scheme, if it is going to be a success, is to get it over to the public that machine-won macerated turf is of a more uniform quality and of such consistency, even when produced in rainy weather, that it will do the job for which it is essential. Unless that fact can be put over to the public the scheme has not got any hope of success and that fact cannot be put over unless a clear differentiation is made between turf produced during the emergency and turf produced at the moment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DominickMacCabe" hpid="Mr. McCabe Mr. McCabe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCabe</NameTxt>
      <P>We are pleased that the Government is willing to develop the bogs of the country and to use them in every possible way, but I cannot agree with what has been said this evening so far as the matter of generating steam is concerned.  I speak for the co-operative creameries down the country, and during the emergency we had to rely principally on turf.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We were in a position to get sufficient coal from our own mines here but we were prevented from doing so except under a very small permit. <Col N="1282" /> Taking the figure of 138,000 gallons of milk, the cost of the coal which the creamery I am referring to could receive from one of the mines in Leitrim or Cavan would be £176 for eight months.  The cost of turf would be £320, and that represents a difference of £144 which the creamery would have to meet.  That was a considerable cost and it was still more annoying to know that if the creameries in Leitrim, Sligo or Cavan were granted a permit they would not have the slightest difficulty in getting the coal to carry on. We did not grouse, however; we accepted that.</P>
    <P>There is one point however which I wish to stress so that the Minister will be alive to it.  There are types of boilers which are not capable of generating steam from wood or turf. For instance, the locomotive type of boiler is not capable of generating steam in that way unless you can get coal.  The British coal was perfect while we had it but the Irish coal did its work well when we had to rely on it. On one occasion we invited engineers from the Minister's Department in Dublin to come down and examine the boilers and to see for themselves that we were not making a false statement. An engineer came to one of the creameries that had installed the locomotive type of boiler and he admitted it was not suitable for turf or wood. I am sure he made that report back to the Minister's Department.  Afterwards we got a small permit for two tons of coal per month for eight months of the year, and we thanked him for that.</P>
    <P>There was a big point involved for the farmers in this question of fuel. Farmers who would come to the creamery at 7.30 and leave at 11 o'clock had to remain over until 2 p.m.  They were losing their whole day on the farm waiting there until the steam was raised and the machinery put in motion.  My reason for raising these points is to show that turf may be all right for domestic purposes and the turf you are about to produce now may be all right, but it will not be all right for industrial purposes.  My friend, Senator Sweetman, mentioned here this evening that carriers are out for all the work they can get <Col N="1283" /> on turf.  That is quite true.  They are trying to get all the business they can in order to reap the whole of the benefits from the production of turf.</P>
    <P>If you take a rick or a link of turf, as they call it in some places, which a man may sell at £8, the carrier who conveys it seven or eight miles home for the purchaser charges £4.  A man cannot lose his time drawing that by horse and cart because it would take two or three days.  I think, however, the Minister should give full consideration to the people who are producing food.  The creameries are manufacturing the food that is produced by the farmers and, therefore, they should get every facility possible. They don't want anything unreasonable. They want a fair share of the coal that is available in this country. There is no doubt that it is available. It is only reasonable that we should make this demand because we are only acting as the servants of the people who do the production work, the creamery managers and the workers, and they should get consideration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamFearon" hpid="Mr. Fearon Mr. Fearon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fearon</NameTxt>
      <P>The enterprise before us appears to me to fall into three departments, which I may summarise as: motive, method and instrument.  The motive of this Bill is, of course, a very laudable one-to develop a national resource, the development of which will increase employment and the result of which will provide us with, as somebody else has said, a strategic fuel reserve. That is all to the good and I don't propose to waste time praising the motive.  The instrument&mdash;the Bill &mdash;will be discussed in detail subsequently and I shall not deal with it now, but I would like to say something of the method.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am very uncertain about several aspects of the way in which the motive is being implemented, and I could summarise them by saying that they are the questions of machinery being employed, the area being harvested, and the properties of the fuel.  We are prepared to give a substantial sum, about £3,000,000 or £4,000,000, towards this scheme, and before we gaily do so we should give our technicians a run <Col N="1284" /> for their money.  I hope the Minister will attend to that in getting over the difficulties of the project now being put forward.  I would like to have a good deal more knowledge of the type of machinery employed.  We have three types of turf&mdash;hand won turf; excavated or macerated turf, and milled turf.  I take it our interest is particularly concerned with macerated turf in connection with this Bill.  My experience has been that these turf machines are not yet in a satisfactory state of efficient development, and I wonder has some information come out as a result of the war that would encourage us in our confidence in the type of machinery we are going to adopt in this country.  I know that the Bill makes provision for Bord na Móna to carry out experimental work on their own machines, but I would prefer this work to be done before the board got going.  I wonder if the experts can tell me how much working time of a machine is not spent in actual work.  I might explain that in this way: in the olden days of the cinematograph I remember that the film went on for 10 minutes but the performance lasted half an hour, the other 20 minutes being spent in preparing the projector.</P>
    <P>These turf machines break down continually, not so much because of any fault in the machine itself, but because of the problem you put before the machine.  You are putting before the machine the problem of meeting in-homogeneous materials which at any time may surprise the machine.  A useful way of examining the machinery would be to try to find out how much of the working day is spent in trying to get the machine to work on account of stoppages of all kinds.  I think that would be a satisfactory way of finding out if the machinery has reached a satisfactory state of development.  I am well aware of what has been done, but I am far from being convinced that it has reached that satisfactory state unless, as a result of war experience, turf harvesting machines have been considerably improved.</P>
    <P>Secondly, there is the question of the area involved.  How much of the total bog available in the country is suitable for mechanical winning?  Is it 1/15th or 1/20th?  The bog will contain timber, <Col N="1285" /> rock and various materials that are going to get entangled in the machine and cause trouble with the excavator. In that connection I would like to give the following quotation from last month's issue of the journal published by the Institute of Civil Engineers in which they refer to the bog at Lullymore on which a great deal of money has been spent.  They say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;As this question of peat quality is so important, information as to the probable type of peat to be met with as the milling proceeds is being constantly sought.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is to say, that bog surveys have to be going on constantly.  You cannot predict and retire on your prediction, so that after so many years working at Lullymore, they are still in the position that they have to be getting information constantly.  It would seem to me that we will have to get a great deal of information constantly and continually on any material that we propose to submit for the winning of turf by machine methods.</P>
    <P>The next point that puzzles me is the question of the reclaimed land&mdash;storing the surface layer and putting it back. I confess that I do not understand that. In some analysis that was published some time ago about the mineral ash in turf, I think it was shown&mdash;it has not been contradicted&mdash;that a bog extracts from the soil various elements that are necessary for the growing plant.  In this matter of the reclaiming of land there is a question of soil chemistry, and, of course, we have very good soil chemists in this country.  Why put that surface layer back on the land that, presumably, is going to be arable land?  Would it not befoul the growing pasture?</P>
    <P>One of the points that I have noted down is the question of fuel value of turf of 30 per cent. moisture.  At certain seasons of the year the moisture in the turf would be less than 30 per cent.  In dry weather, it could go down to 26 per cent.  In that case what is to happen?  Is that turf to be sold with its 28 or 26 per cent. moisture, or will the moisture have to be brought up to 30 per cent. so that the Turf Board will not lose money on the enterprise?  I am not clear from what the Minister has said as to whether it is going to be <Col N="1286" /> necessary to adulterate the turf with water if the moisture falls below a certain level.  I hope that will not be done &mdash;even though the board may escape losing money by doing so.  I hope that, for example, a cup of water will not be added to the turf which goes to the consumer.  I suggest that we define turf fuel as turf containing 30 per cent. moisture or less, and that in marketing it, it will be marketed not in terms of weight but in terms of heat units.</P>
    <P>There was the other aspect of this question touched on by Senator Sweetman&mdash;the experience of city dwellers with turf.  I do not believe that either hand-won or machine-won turf is a city fuel.  I think that the only form in which turf can be really accepted as a city fuel is in the form of briquettes.  The question of storage is very serious in the cities.  In the case of hand-won turf, it occupies six times the volume of coal, while for machine-won turf the figure is four times.  City houses are not designed for the storage of turf.  Combustion in stoves is only part of the problem.  My own impression from visiting houses in the country is that turf can be burned successfully in the country because they have a &ldquo;Father Christmas&rdquo; type of chimney.  The trouble in suburban houses is that you have not a suitable type of chimney, with the result that there is a lot of flue trouble on account of the accumulation of the products from turf combustion.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I would like to repeat the points that I have put.  The first is whether our technicians are able to put up a good case for present-day machines, and that is the position with regard to breakdowns on the bogs that are working.  The Minister referred to some other methods of turf production.  He also referred to the Russian method.  There was also the method Sir John Griffith brought originally from Dumfries.  It was found to be very troublesome.  The next point is whether it is really worth preserving part of the top layer.  The third point is whether it would not be possible to produce turf with a 30 per cent. moisture, and the fourth point is whether it would be worth while going out on a campaign for the use of turf in the cities in view of the hostility and <Col N="1287" /> disappointment already experienced in connection with it.  I do not think we ought to encourage any more disappointments. Apart from that, of course, one has to say that in late years turf has stood us nobly in many respects, and that while it is part of the land that bears us, it is worthy of every consideration.  It has to be considered, however, whether, before we start the scheme in full, we should not get a great deal more information. The board, I think, should not be expected to carry out too much research. It should be available for it.  Would the Minister say whether, if the target which has been set of 1,000,000 tons, is not reached in ten years, he would be prepared to forego the scheme, or soft pedal on it, or would the business all have to be gone over again?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I must confess to having a certain grádh for the Bill. Possibly that is due to the fact that I was brought up on the edge of a bog, and spent a good deal of the sunshine of my youth there.  It may be that that has determined my whole attitude to this problem of bog development, and for that reason, that I may be less critical of this measure than others. As regards the problem that confronts us in this Bill, I have no doubt whatever as to what the attitude of the country ought to be.  The question that I put to myself is this: have we anything here that is native to the country that we ought to develop?  I do not know what the total area of bog in the country is, or whether the Minister can tell us.  Some of the geographies say that bogs represent one-sixth of the total area.  I cannot recall whether that is one-sixth of the 32 counties or one-sixth of the 26 counties. The truth, at any rate, is that we have an immense area of the country under bog which, on its face, is perfectly useless: it is dead matter, cold and with no life anywhere in it, containing I do not know how many million tons of water and having an influence on our climate and our conditions generally which is very unhealthy. We look at this situation and wonder what we are to do about it.  It is in that frame of mind that <Col N="1288" /> I regard this Bill, and what it contains. If you have one-sixth of your territory in this condition and are doing nothing about it, you have to answer to somebody for your negligence.  There must be some reason why you are not making an attack upon it, so as to replace waste by life.  I know, as other Senators know, that, on small farms, the bog is a very vital part of the whole farm economy.  Food comes first and fuel next&mdash;even before clothing.  That is true of thousands of our farmsteads throughout the country, excluding perhaps, those on the east coast.  If you admit that, on the small farms, the tracts of bog are a very big factor in the economy of the whole farm, you are forced to ask what influence on the economy of the country these vast areas of undeveloped bogs will have if we attempt their development.  What can come from their development? Before I answer that question, I want to say that to leave our bogs as they are while we import British coal seems to me to be following exactly the same policy as that represented by bringing down the Amazon carbohydrates which we could get from the potatoes we grow in our fields.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not understand why we should bring in English, Scottish or Welsh coal to warm our houses or cook our food while, at the same time, we seem to have no alternative but to send our people to the countries from which we import those apparent necessities of life.  That is an economic policy to which I do not subscribe and which I cannot understand.  In our bogs, we have a raw material which we can develop and consume ourselves.  We have there the possibilities of exchange of goods and services amongst our own people.  We may have to import certain machines, or the raw materials for the manufacture of the machines, but, beyond that, we have all the materials which can provide a way of life for a considerable number of our people. What is the alternative if we neglect this type of development?  To that, I have no answer.  I think that there is an obligation on those who dislike this method of development to provide an answer.  In the cities and towns, Senator Summerfield or some other Senator <Col N="1289" /> may argue that there are certain types of industrial development, suited to the conditions of the nation, which ought to be given an opportunity.  If they argue that with regard to conditions in the towns and cities, then it can be argued that, in the countryside, there is an industry which has possibilities of development and which would be of greater value than many of the industrial efforts in the urban areas, because, in the case of most of those, we have to import a considerable quantity of the raw material.  We have the bogs, we have God's sun, we have the physical energy of our people and we have the capacity to harness those things in order to develop our resources.  Then, all we want is the money.  Looking at the matter from that angle, I believe that there is an obligation on the nation to do something about our bogs.  Even though I were faced with a position in which there would be an end to the use of our bogs after 25 years, I should go on with the enterprise.  As Senator Sweetman has said, the development of our bogs is only a means to an end. At present, they are waste.</P>
    <P>My idea is to get the bogs out of the way and see what we shall do with the residue.  That is of far greater importance than the development of the bogs themselves.  You have in the bogs an immense territory.  We have not to shed blood to conquer that territory. There is living space for our people there if we are prepared to take possession of it.  Across the Midlands, you can reclaim large territories either for agricultural purposes or for the purpose of afforestation.  We want land for both purposes.  Right from the beginning, it must be the purpose of the Turf Development Board to make their plans, from the first cutting, so that the residue will be reclaimed as the turf is cut off.  That is how it seems to be proceeding, and I have gone to the place and seen for myself.</P>
    <P>Senator Fearon asked what was the point in turning down the top layer and creating practically similar conditions to those which existed under the surface of the bog.  I was struck by the remarkable conditions to be found in part of the area which is at present <Col N="1290" /> being developed.  You have that top layer with certain constituents of some value for plant life.  When the turf is taken away, you have a certain gravel condition and constituents of lime, which are essential for proper reclamation. That is very fortunate, indeed. It would be a very different proposition if one had to make a case for reclamation based on the transfer of thousands of tons of necessary material to the area.  In this case the materials are on the spot.  In the case of this whole adventure, when the cost is being calculated, it should be calculated on the basis not of the production, sale and marketing of turf alone, but on the immense amount of labour which is going to be involved in the plan of reclamation. It did seem to me that the reclamation must go on concurrently with the cutting of turf.  It is necessary to have drainage and reclamation proceeding at the same time.  There are difficult problems arising out of conditions in part of the bogs, but again I urge that it should be the policy of the Turf Development Board to go forward with the policy not only of turf development but of reclamation of the whole area.  Such parts of the bogs as present difficulties, from the point of view of production of turf economically, should not be left as an eyesore but should be left properly prepared for a scheme of reclamation.</P>
    <P>I should like to urge on the Minister that that should be the plan of the Turf Development Board, so that when the turf is finally cut away in 25 years' time, even though the machines and the equipment that produced the turf and generated electricity have to be scrapped, you would have something else.  You would have the possibilities of green fields, the possibility that men who had toiled in these bogs would be able to build their own homes on the ground where the bog once stood. From my point of view, I confess that this is a picture which makes this Bill very attractive to me.  There will be an opportunity of going into certain other aspects of it at a later stage, but I want to make one or two points with regard to the composition of the board. I want to correct, if I may, a statement which the Minister made in the other House.  I confess that I was rather <Col N="1291" /> astonished at the Minister, who is usually well-informed, making such a misstatement.  I think I would have had to correct him, whether or not he had introduced my name into the debate. The question under discussion at the time was the advisability of having Deputies, members of this board or a similar board.</P>
    <P>I think I am correct in saying that the Minister made the statement that the Board of the Agricultural Credit Corporation was originally composed entirely of members of the Oireachtas. The Minister went on to say: &ldquo;I think Senator Baxter was one.  Whether he was a member of the Dáil or a member of the Seanad at the time I am not sure.&rdquo;  The first point I wish to make is that, of the seven original directors of the Agricultural Credit Corporation, only one was a member of the Oireachtas, and I was not that member.  I was not a member of either House during my period on the Agricultural Credit Corporation.  I do not think there is anything further I need say on that point.</P>
    <P>The board to be appointed under this Bill are given very wide powers, and while Senators Sweetman and Fearon have raised a number of important points here, it is perfectly right that every aspect of the problem should be debated and discussed and anyone who has got a particular point of view should give expression to it. Bogs are strange places if you do not know them and it is very difficult to get to know them.  Even people who spent quite a big part of their lives on the bogs confess that there is a number of things which they do not know about them.  The Turf Development Board when they begin to develop these bogs, will discover many quite remarkable things and their staff will have a considerable amount to learn. As to the people who are to be trusted with this class of development, if I might make a suggestion to the Minister with regard to the composition of the board, I would say that he ought to go anywhere he can to secure those best qualified for the work but he ought to make certain, above all, to secure competence, efficiency and courage in that body.  All these <Col N="1292" /> attributes will be required if the people placed in control of this scheme are to exploit to the full its immense possibilities.</P>
    <P>It occurs to me immediately that, apart from a number of technical people, the board would require to have&mdash;in fact, Senator Fearon made reference to the same matter in a rather oblique way&mdash;a soil scientist right from the beginning.  Right from the beginning it should be the policy of the board to prepare the soil for the next step and they should waste no time about it.  As soon as it is possible for them to do that work, to bring the other side of the development to life once the bogs are taken away, they should go on with the work.  It will take some scheme like that to inspire our people who, mentally and otherwise, have got into a kind of backwash.  With the troubles and trials of recent times they have been completely disillusioned.  It is only by a policy such as this that we shall restore confidence in ourselves.  I was a member of the other House when the Bill which authorised the Shannon scheme was introduced.  The present Minister was not there then; I do not know what he was then thinking about it, but I was a member of the Farmers' Party at that time.  I found myself in the peculiar position that I was the one member of the group who got up and approved of it although I did not approve of many other things the Government at that time were doing.  I believed that the scheme showed imagination and courage.</P>
    <P>That is a scheme which has very profoundly influenced the history of this country and has contributed largely to its security in recent times. There is a vast amount of work yet to be done and we must get at it and do it.  Mistakes will be made and money will be misspent; there is no doubt about that at all, but if the board do their own work with competence and effiency, if they see that their men will work and give good service and get the article produced at the lowest possible price, beyond that consumers can expect no more.  There is a minimum under which you cannot produce any commodity and we must recognise that.  There is a minimum under which <Col N="1293" /> it is stupid to produce a marketable commodity and the world has experience of that.</P>
    <P>Finally, I should like to say that I approve of the Minister's policy in connection with the financing of the board. I would even go so far, apart from the concession which he makes in the section waiving interest, to suggest that it would be wise to have a further safeguard. It is quite possible that the Minister may not be Minister when this plan is in its full implementation.  If it is then a success like the Shannon scheme and other things we have done in the past&mdash;and there are people critical of its success&mdash;not alone shall we have cut away the turf but we shall have produced new land and considerable assets.  That is a point about which I would like to have further discussion. What is to happen with regard to the territory from which the turf is to be cut away?  Is the land to become the possession of the Turf Development Board?  I should like to hear what the Minister has to say about that.  I do not think that if the Minister is to forego the interest now, it should be possible for any succeeding Minister or Government to make a demand on the Turf Development Board for the payment of interest in relation to the charges to-day.  I think that is a safeguard the Minister would be well advised to make.  As far as I am concerned, I wish the measure every success.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Patrick O'Reilly Mr. Patrick O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Patrick O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>One thing I want to refer to is the position of the mines which was raised by Senator McCabe.  He complained of the fact that creameries had to purchase turf during the war period and that as a result of having to purchase turf their fuel cost was much greater.  He also referred to the fact that coal could have been got from the mines in County Leitrim.  As Senator McCabe did refer to that I would like to state that were it not for the fact that the local authorities in Leitrim and Sligo had supported the mines in their areas prior to the emergency there would not have been any coal at all there because the mines would not have been in operation. I suggest that the Minister was quite <Col N="1294" /> correct in the attitude he took because he had the responsibility of ensuring that industries to which coal was vital &mdash;such as the Pigeon House and the railways&mdash;could carry on, but I would remind the members also that prior to the emergency, in the bad old days of the Great Southern Railways before they became the C.I.E., the Great Southern Railways had British coal in Arigna to pull away the Irish coal.  I hope that that will not happen again. The local authorities in Leitrim and Sligo who had supported these coal mines from the beginning suffered as great a hardship as the creameries or anybody else but they did not complain. Vital industries had to be kept going even if that meant a hardship on the local authorities or on the creameries.</P>
      <P>With regard to the carriage of turf&mdash; I do not know if there has been such a ramp in that matter or if all the people who were engaged in the haulage of turf became rich people.  If that was so there would have been many more people engaged in it.  I do not think that any great number of people have made huge sums in the transport of turf.</P>
      <P>Senator Sweetman referred to the fact that the Minister did not make his case on the probable scarcity of coal in England.  I think that that is a very good reason why the bogs should be developed because I think that England made a great mistake when she took her miners out of her mines, and I cannot see again a position where England will be able to export coal in large quantities.  There is a responsibility on the Government of this country to ensure that we will not be left in jeopardy again.  There may have been complaints about the fuel position during the emergency, but were it not for the Turf Development Board and the hand-won turf produced during the emergency there would have been a position of chaos in this country.  I see this scheme as the foundation of an organisation which will ensure that this country will not be left in jeopardy in some future time if an emergency should arise again.  I think that the development of the bogs on the lines set out in the Bill will ensure to some extent that the things which Senator Sweetman suggests will not happen again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1295" /> Under the measure, it is proposed that the turf will be transported over wires and that will eliminate, in my opinion, any prospect of any ramp.  I do not know enough about the matter to say if there has been a ramp in the haulage of turf.</P>
    <P>I would like to say, having regard to the development of these schemes, that the housing of the workers referred to by Senator Sweetman should be improved.  It is my experience that a number of people who went from the west of Ireland to work with the Turf Development Board complained of the housing conditions.  Under the new scheme I hope that steps will be taken to ensure that conditions will be as good as possible.  It strikes me that the workers will be housed in camps or in barrack-like institutions.  Up to the present, I understand that they were housed under conditions similar to army conditions but without the hygiene and cleanliness found in the Army.  I hope that attention will be given to that matter to ensure that for the people who work in these camps the conditions will be as good as it is possible to have in the circumstances. I do not think there is anything more I want to add to what I have said except to say that I see in this measure the foundation of an organisation which will ensure that this country will be self-sufficient and self-reliant as regards fuel, and I agree with Senator Baxter when he points out the necessity to see that the land which is reclaimed under this scheme will not be allowed to become derelict and a useless commodity.  Steps should be taken to ensure that it will be properly developed and reclaimed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TheodoreMoore" hpid="Mr. Kingsmill Moore Mr. Kingsmill Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kingsmill Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>Any approach to this Bill must be marked with sympathy and appreciation of the difficulties which face the Minister.  Fuel and power are two essentials necessary for carrying on any kind of life in a modern civilised community.  Of the better-known sources of fuel and power Ireland has neither coal nor oil, and so we are left with water power which can be converted into electricity, and peat which can also be used to generate electricity.  That was <Col N="1296" /> the problem before the Minister, and it was to be expected he would bring in some plan for the utilisation of these resources.  Early in this year the House considered a Bill for the greater use of electricity, and now the Minister has brought before us a scheme for utilising the resources of the bogs.  At the same time this must only be regarded as a scheme to meet a long-term emergency, a scheme which is essentially of a temporary, though not of a very temporary, nature.  As far as it is possible to prophesy within a period to be counted, perhaps not in years but certainly in decades, the universal source of power will lie in the controlled release of atomic energy, its conversion to electricity and its distribution by high tension cables throughout the country.</P>
      <P>When that time will come it is not possible to forecast exactly, but it will come, and in bringing his scheme before the House the Minister had to bring a limited scheme of a nature which would be sufficiently elastic. With the technical portions of the scheme, I do not propose to deal, except once or twice, by way of illustration, because I am not qualified to do so, but it is on the method which the Minister has chosen to give effect to his plans that I would like to comment. The Minister has chosen the State-controlled board&mdash;the half-way house between State socialism and individual enterprise.  It is a matter about which opinions differ, and must differ.  Some people find in it a combination of the evil of both systems, without their benefits, and others will tell you that it enshrines the benefits without the evils. Personally, I think it is too soon to pass any judgment on the matter, but, while reserving judgment, it is not too soon to devote some attention to dangers which, if they are not watched, will develop into evils.  These are matters that are being canvassed, matters which have clearly given the Minister attention, because he has taken some care in the Bill to provide against two at least of the apparent evils, matters which, if they are sufficiently closely watched, may not actually produce unfortunate results.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first evil of this system, the one of which the ordinary person is most <Col N="1297" /> aware and which he is most anxious about, is the danger of too great an extension of the State's tentacles into spheres to which they do not properly belong.  The constitution of this board is such that the chairman and the managing director and the members of the board are all appointed by the Government.  They are paid by the Minister for Finance, and they are told by the Government what they are to do and how they are to do it, within limits.  They are dismissible by the Government, and here the Minister was clearly aware of the dangers which lie in front of him, for though dismissible by the Government, the reasons for their dismissal have to be revealed to both Houses.  Their non-reappointment, however, is a matter which does not require any explanation to either House, so that in fact the salary and fortunes of the members of the board will be in the control of the Government, and the members of that board themselves, no doubt, will have a great number of well-paid and important posts in their gift and in their keeping. It is a familiar feature of human nature, a feature so human that it possesses almost as many of the lineaments of virtue as of vice that we try to help and advance those in sympathy with us or friendly to us, those who share our views or philosophy of life, and possibly our views on politics.  I do foresee the danger that appointments may be made not entirely uninfluenced, though perhaps not consciously influenced, by the considerations to which I have referred.  I do not suggest for a moment that that weakness to which I have called attention will result in the appointment of a bad man.  That is not the danger.  The danger is that it will not result in the appointment of the best men.  People are apt to be blind to the deficiencies and acutely aware of the merits of those whom they like, and the scales will be weighted in favour of those who are most congenial to the people who have the appointments, even if less individually qualified from a purely technical view of efficiency.</P>
    <P>There is even a greater danger in the retention of people in posts.  If there is one task which it is almost impossible for a person to do, unless <Col N="1298" /> he is forced to do it by the clamour of insistent shareholders, it is the task of dispensing with the services of amiable mediocrity.  All the best instincts in human nature cry out against it and unless the person is forced to do it he will not do it.  The result is a tendency to carry a tremendous amount of useless lumber which ought to be pensioned sufficiently to reward moral merits without retaining intellectual incapacity.  Even from the point of view of the Government, a scheme whereby the Government has so much control tends to surround them with a body of yes-men and sycophants who fall in with their views.  On the principle of &ldquo;you scratch me, I scratch you&rdquo;, and in return for the not inconsiderable emoluments which may trickle into their pockets, they laud with a judicious modicum of praise, awe or wonder those who have been responsible for putting them in places they never expected to reach.</P>
    <P>That is a danger because no Government can succeed unless it is in the way of receiving continuous and I might say, occasionally acid, criticism. I am not going to engage in any acid criticism.  I pointed out before that it was necessary to call attention to these dangers for the purpose of avoiding them.  These Government-controlled boards and companies are dangerous lest they should become instruments for the extension of political power and opportunities for the use of political patronage.  I see the possibility, still far off, but growing, that we might realise in this country that nightmare of the political philosopher which has been realised in other countries&mdash;a condition of affairs where every avenue of honour and of profit lies through obedience to the Government, lies through subservience and not capacity, through submission but not initiative. That is the nightmare of any political philosopher.  It is a thing against which we must be on our guard.  It is a danger which has been recognised by the man in the street and which we in this House shall see even more clearly as a danger which the Minister, in the manner in which he is putting his measures into effect, and the Government will be exposed.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1299" /> The second danger is that any Government-sponsored undertaking cannot fail.  It cannot fail because it will not be allowed to fail.  The Government may not have put all its eggs into one basket, but it has put 3,800,000 golden eggs into one basket and it does not want them to be addled.  If an ordinary commercial company failed to deliver the goods, failed to keep out of debt or to show a profit it would have to go into liquidation, but a Government-controlled board or company will be bolstered up by fresh privileges, protected from criticism, receive periodic golden infusions of blood to keep the life in it.  Its defects will be concealed because it is not its own prestige and resources that are involved but the prestige and resources of the Government, and to a certain extent the prestige and resources of the State. Even where a commercial enterprise would fail, having failed to justify itself, the Government-sponsored enterprise will remain long after it has served its period of utility and long after the time when the scheme shall be abandoned in favour of a different method of producing power.</P>
    <P>I have before alluded to the possibility of the power of the future being generated in huge commercial laboratories, more like enormous factories extending over a quarter of a square mile.  There is another possibility.  A way could be discovered for winning coal more cheaply, when the price of coal would be such that the operations of this board may become uneconomic. But that conclusion will be fought against, and unless members of the Oireachtas again are vigilant to watch it this board may be continued long after it has served its period of utility.</P>
    <P>Again, the Minister seems to be aware of that possibility and has taken certain steps to guard against it in the provision that there shall be put before the Oireachtas a considerable proportion of the accounts and figures dealing with the activities of the board.  I do not think that we will be told everything.  The comment has already been made that we have been told very little.  We are not satisfied, or at least certain Senators are not satisfied, that the methods of turf-winning have been <Col N="1300" /> sufficiently investigated, or that the methods to be adopted are so sound that the scheme itself is one which would stand a thorough scientific and engineering examination.  That is on the technical side, with which I do not propose to deal.  I do think that I am justified, however, in adverting to the fears that have been expressed by other Senators who are more competent to speak on that aspect of the question, and in saying that there is a great necessity for eagle-eyed vigilance lest the defects of the scheme should be concealed, and that a lack of preparation and investigation should not be under-emphasised.  I say that because this is a matter in which State credit and State prestige have been somewhat heavily involved.</P>
    <P>Lastly, we come to the third great danger, and that is that the Government endows its own less legitimate children with powers and privileges which should not belong to them, just as in earlier times kings endowed their less legitimate children with duchies, honours and lands.  This danger is, if I may so phrase it, in full blast in the Bill.  It sticks out all over it.  The Minister is evidently unconscious of it because we find that this new board is to be financed eventually out of the pockets of those who should be its ordinary commercial rivals.  If members of the House have a copy of the Bill before them they will find that under Section 17 the board is given certain specific powers.  Under paragraph (e) of that section the board is given this power: &ldquo;Generally to do all such other things as arise out of, or are consequential upon, the duties mentioned in the preceding paragraphs of this section&rdquo;.  That is a blank cheque to be filled in by the board for any sum it likes.  That might be quite correct in the memorandum of a company which had to be interpreted by a court.  In this Bill it means giving to the board practically unlimited power to do what it likes provided it keeps within the general words which precede this paragraph, the words which are in themselves so wide as to be almost meaningless. If Senators turn to Section 22 they will find the way in which the board is to do this.  Under sub-section <Col N="1301" /> (3) of that section the board will be entitled to construct such works as they may consider necessary, or perform any function, including the vague functions that I have mentioned.  It can interfere with a public road, bridge, railway or inland waterway.  Now it may possibly be assumed that the Minister for Local Government, if he can take a holiday from the congenial task of suppressing local bodies, may look after the interests of the roads and that the roads will be safe in his keeping.  Of course, Córas Iompair Éireann is another of the illegitimate children of the Minister, if the Minister will allow me to say that in a metaphorical kind of way, and he may be trusted to look after that himself.  But what about the inland waterways?  The canals of Ireland have been made for 1½ centuries, and I imagine that, when the factories which are going to be put up are in rubble, the odds are that the ancient barges, converted unnoticeably into something slightly newer, will still be chugging their way along the reedy stretches of the Grand and the Royal Canals.</P>
    <P>What are the powers given to the board to interfere with them?  You get the remarkable fact that under sub-section (4), paragraph (a), the board can at one month's notice put up works which interfere with the canals.  The next sub-section goes on to say: &ldquo;No compensation shall be payable under this Act or otherwise to such canal undertaker in respect of any loss of traffic suffered or likely to be suffered by such canal undertaker after such bridge has been erected by the board&rdquo;.  In other words, the board are to be entitled to put up a bridge which shall interfere with the traffic of the canal company, delay their barges and that may, in many other respects, interfere with the carriage of their traffic, and yet no compensation is to be payable to the canal company.  This board is to be financed out of the pockets of the rival undertaking which has been in existence for 100 years, and the Bill provides that the board, wherever it deems it necessary, can interfere with the canal company and, if it does, no compensation is to be payable.  Surely, that is an example of endowing your <Col N="1302" /> less legitimate child.  It is a power which is utterly unscrupulous.  I would ask the Minister to make his own amendment in that case.  The paragraph, as phrased, is one that it would be quite impossible to justify. It would be impossible to justify the setting up of a turf board with power to interfere with a rival undertaking.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LouisODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Senator will refer to Section 69 he will see that the board cannot do any of these things without the consent of the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TheodoreMoore" hpid="Mr. Kingsmill Moore Mr. Kingsmill Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kingsmill Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I will come to that in good time.  If the bridge is a movable bridge, which presumably is put up over an inland waterway, the Minister may make regulations in relation to its user, and the board has to comply with such regulations. Presumably, it is not a fly-bridge which is to be put up and under which these barges are to go.  It is to be some kind of bridge which would normally form an obstruction and the Minister, without any obligation on him to consult the authorities of the inland waterways, may make regulations&mdash; regulations, no doubt, mitigating the evil but still mindful of this fact that the newest and most favoured child is the Bord na Móna. Then we come to the next sub-section: &ldquo;If it appears to the Minister that such inland waterway has sustained damage&rdquo;&mdash;apparently, it is to sustain damage&mdash;&ldquo;by reason of the existence or user of such bridge, the Minister shall require the board to make good at their own cost such damage and the board shall comply with such requisition.&rdquo;  In other words, if it has emptied the canal, it must close the breach, but there is not a word regarding obligation to pay compensation for the injury.  The physical damage is to be repaired but where is compensation for the injury provided?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If you turn to Section 29 (1) (d), you will find that it gives power to &ldquo;divert, close, remove or otherwise interfere with (either permanently or temporarily and either by agreement or compulsorily) any private road, way or bridge or any canal or other artificial <Col N="1303" /> waterway or any artificial water course.&rdquo;  That gives power to divert the whole canal.  Admittedly under the next sub-section which is concealed by reference to the operation of Section 130 of the Transport Act, it would require the consent of the Minister but, if the Minister is prepared to introduce provisions into the Bill which are, undoubtedly, favourable to the board at the expense of the inland waterways, there is no guarantee that the Minister may not succumb to the same temptation when he comes to deal with the question of what reparation is to be made for damage or as to whether there is to be that power to interfere. Under Section 30 (1) (d), you find the same power to divert waterways as a matter of urgency before conveyance and before the matter has been properly considered.  There may be a question as to whether the Minister's consent is necessary for that.  A question of construction may be involved. There, again, I consider that a wholly unwarrantable power is being given, especially as, in a later section, it is provided &ldquo;no action shall lie at law or in equity against the board or any contractor or any officer or servant of the board or of any contractor for or on account of any act, matter, or thing in respect of which compensation is payable by virtue of this section.&rdquo; That is to say, you can carry out such a thing as the diversion of a canal without any possibility of being restrained. Later, those concerned can be referred to an arbitrator appointed under the Acquisition of Land (Assessment of Compensation) Act and told that he will give them money for what injury they have suffered but it is possible that pecuniary compensation may not be adequate from the point of view of the person affected or from the point of view of the public interest. Section 33 provides a time limit under which application may be made for compensation.  It is a time limit of a year from the time the act is done.  In the case of inland waterways, where the engineering is complicated and the foundations deep, the injury done may not become apparent for some considerable time.  That provision, that application must be made within a year <Col N="1304" /> from the time the act is done, needs amendment.</P>
    <P>I call the attention of the House to the remarkable effect of Section 51. Section 51 carries on for all time certain Emergency Powers Orders made under Emergency Powers No. 92 Order, 1941, and under the Emergency Powers Act, 1939.  These are to become part of the law of the land even after the Emergency Powers Act shall have ceased to exist.  They are to be as effective as a statute, because there is applicable to them Section 49&mdash;that every Order made by the Minister shall have the force of law.  Will the House believe it possible that these Orders, which are to be part of the law of the land in future and which were made in 1941, have never seen the light of print?  I went down after lunch to get those Orders so as to check them up, as they were referred to in the Bill. They are not in the Statutory Rules and Orders.  Having gone through volumes of the Statutory Rules and Orders, I made inquiries.  These Orders have never been printed.  That is the stage to which we have got&mdash; that Orders made in 1941 which are considered so important that they are to be incorporated in the permanent law of the land after the authority under which they have been made shall have ceased to exist, have never been printed or made available in printed form to the public.  Does the House wonder when I say that the third danger which is involved in this kind of Government-controlled board or company is that powers and privileges may be bestowed upon it by the lavish hand of a Government to whom such bestowals cost nothing, powers which are quite unsuited, which are too wide and which involve the endowment of the company at the expense of other members of the public and at the expense of people who will be their trade rivals in the enterprises which they are given power to undertake?  With those three caveats, more as finger-posts than anything else, I think the House must welcome the attempt to develop the country's resources, but it must be watchful lest, through absentmindedness, the adoption of a form of scheme inherently capable of abuse leads to <Col N="1305" /> its ultimate use in a way which produces concrete abuses.</P>

      <P>I do not propose to follow Senator Kingsmill Moore in his exposures of the dangers of patronage, the frailties of deceased royalties and degrees of legitimacy of legislative offspring.  I rise to say that I am one of those who thoroughly welcome this Bill.  It would be the height of folly if we were to await another world cataclysm before we set about the development of our turf resources.  Reference has been made to the use of turf in industry in recent years.  I may say that some of our biggest industries would have had entirely to shut down were it not for the availability of turf, no matter what the moisture content and no matter how unsatisfactory in respect of price.  That is not to say that the Bill before us would not permit the giving of a little more information.  I shall not attempt any destructive criticism.  My views in this regard are similar to those of Senator Sweetman.  I feel sure that every member of the House wants the Bill to be a success.  We do not regard the Bill as a cold-blooded business proposition. Rather do we thank God that we have the chance to debate such a Bill.  It is a form of insurance for the future against what in recent years would have been an absolute catastrophe. It would not be fair, there fore, to judge it by normal standards.</P>
      <P>I look through the Bill and I see that certain bogs are named.  I segregate the probable cost of turf under four headings&mdash;the cost of the bog, the cost of harvesting the turf, the cost of transport, and storage losses and distribution costs.  With regard to the cost of the bogs, as the bogs are known, it is not unreasonable to ask the Minister on what basis of cost these bogs have been, or are to be, acquired.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fact that they need roads and drainage for their development suggests that much of this land has hitherto been more or less waste land, yielding nothing to its owner and nothing to the State.  If the State is to develop these lands at a considerable cost, on what basis is the land to be acquired, and on what basis, if at all, is the land to be ultimately restored <Col N="1306" /> in its improved state to the original owner?  I am not concerned at this stage with the cost at which the bog itself will be developed by the State because, as has been well explained by the Minister, it will depend on the efficiency of the machinery which it is proposed to employ.  I do join, however, with those speakers who have commented on the cost of transport hitherto, and on what I can only describe as the exorbitant nature of the charges in relation to that service. I speak, perhaps, against my own interest in saying this, but I think it is my duty as a public representative to say that there has been gross wastage and gross misuse&mdash;perhaps unconscious misuse; I do not say deliberate misuse&mdash;of public moneys in the amount expended on transport in order to get the turf to its ultimate destination. In reference to storage losses, the Minister might indicate how much of the storage losses it is hoped to save under the scheme now under discussion. Even though we might only prevent 5 per cent. of the storage losses hitherto incurred, the value in the material sense would be very considerable.</P>
    <P>With regard to transport generally, I have always felt personally that the country should be divided into zones. Here is a case where roughly the transport of a million tons of turf is being envisaged, per annum.  That is a very heavy amount of traffic and even though there is a virtual monopoly of transport at the moment, I think that a cheaper rate should be obtainable for the transport of such a vast quantity of turf than the rate which one might expect to be charged for smaller amounts.  If I want transport for 1,000 articles I certainly would look for a cheaper rate per item of these articles than if I had to transport only one article.  If our transport concern is offered the transport of 1,000,000 tons of guaranteed traffic, it should be expected to quote a keener rate than if it had to go out and hunt for the business.  These are very pertinent questions and I am sure the Minister appreciates that I do not raise them in any spirit of hostility to the measure but in a sincere desire to ensure its success.  There is one other small point on which I should like to have an explanation <Col N="1307" /> from the Minister&mdash;whether the board is given power over production and marketing.  I hope the Minister will be able to satisfy me that whatever marketing is to be done will be done through the legitimate trade, that is the ordinary fuel merchants.  I put the question in case it should be overlooked.  I think this is a Bill that the Seanad as a whole will welcome as a valuable contribution to our national economy.</P>

      <P>Any scheme designed to encourage or develop the latent resources of our country, is deserving of support, but the measure of support that it would naturally get from the people would be influenced by a consideration of the amount of capital involved in, and the return therefrom, the particular development. Personally, I do not regard a scheme from which we get a return of less than one-sixth of the normal requirements of fuel consumers at a cost of £3,750,000 a very attractive one.  In looking through the White Paper I notice that the amounts allocated to the different areas brought within the ambit of the scheme are just estimated. With Senator Sweetman I thoroughly agree that with a view towards giving us an idea of how the money is to be spent we should have more particulars.  We should have the itemised expenditure or the estimated itemised expenditure in the different areas in the matter of producing equipment, an idea of the area to be worked, and also the amount given to labour and other incidental expenses.  We have not got these particulars and we have, therefore, no guide as to how the money allotted to the 23 or 24 areas selected is to be expended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Much has been said about the necessity of paying particular attention to the constitution of the administrative board, Bord na Móna.  We all know that the success or failure of any scheme is mainly dependent on the administrative capacity of those onerated with the supervising of the particular scheme.  For that reason the people appointed to Bord na Móna should have, as was pointed out by Senator Sweetman, Senator Baxter <Col N="1308" /> and Senator Kingsmill Moore, a high degree of technical skill and qualifications to fit them for membership of that board.  They should not be in the position that they will have to take for granted any scheme or plan put up to them by the works manager without being competent to pronounce upon its merits or demerits themselves.  They should be able to test the feasibility of any plans or schemes put before them by the works manager, and to suggest alternative plans for discussion or otherwise.  If you have a personnel of figureheads which accepts without comment every plan that the works manager submits, such a body would be neither of use nor ornament and certainly not worth the expense they will entail to the particular scheme.  In so far as the selection of areas is concerned, I notice that County Mayo has been by-passed; why I do not know.</P>
    <P>The Minister suggested that the areas were selected because of the quality of the turbary best suited for mechanised turf production.  It is news to me if, amongst the vast expanse of bog in Mayo, no such areas are available. I know that in remote Achill there is the finest turf in Ireland, and that in remote Erris turf of a very excellent quality has been produced.  It is a pity because of that that something could not be done to give these areas some identification with this particular scheme.  As many of you know, hundreds of men and women, many of immature age, have to leave Achill every year for seasonal employment in Britain.  If work of this particular kind, financed by the State, were made available in their own area, it is quite possible that that big drain would be prevented and that most, if not all of these people would get work at home. Apart from that I think Mayo, because of its contribution to the fuel production scheme from the very start, was entitled to consideration in so far as this new scheme was concerned.  I should like to give you some figures of how Mayo stood up to the appeal that was made when the supplies of foreign fuel were abruptly cut short in this country in 1940-1941.  In 1941, 78,000 tons of turf out of a total production of 89,927 tons, were sent to Dublin.  In <Col N="1309" /> 1942, 75,000 tons out of a total production of 82,000 tons, were sent to Dublin. In 1943, 43,000 tons out of 44,000 tons produced were sent to Dublin, and in 1944, out of 87,767 tons produced, nearly 86,000 tons were sent to Dublin.  I have not got the figures completed for the year 1945, but 58,000 tons have been produced and of that 29,000 tons were sent to Dublin, and 19,000 tons more are on the way.  That big job was successfully done, and as to the expenditure and receipts on it, the particulars of which I have from a reliable source, definitely set out that when the accounts from 1941 to 1945 are closed the debit balance will not be more than £100, if it comes to that amount.  I do not wish to institute comparisons between the manner in which the work was done in Mayo and elsewhere, but if Mayo did not reach maximum efficiency as far as administration is concerned, it got very near it.  Because of that fact something in the way of recognition should come to the county and that recognition could best be given to it by having it included in the present scheme.</P>
    <P>The Minister has stated that another reason for the selection of areas was that these were certain areas in which arterial drainage had begun or was about to begin.  Unfortunately in the west, or at least in Mayo, arterial drainage has not yet begun.  However, there are schemes of drainage formulated and approved of for the last 18 or 19 years which, if given effect to, would add to the turbary of the county by 500 or 600 acres, and as Mayo has not been brought within the scope of this scheme I would suggest that, in order to give employment and to prevent the periodic migration of the people of Mayo to England, something should be done to give effect to some of these drainage schemes.  They are very necessary schemes.  They have been approved of by officials and, as I have stated, they would, if given effect to, add from 500 to 600 acres of excellent turbary to the supply already concerned.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoylan" hpid="Minister for Lands (Mr. Moylan) Seán Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Lands (Mr. Moylan)</NameTxt>
      <P>When this Bill was under consideration in the Dáil there were many expressions of surprise and disappointment that the Bill did not herald a new and expanded forest policy for this country and did not provide much wider powers for the Government to extend not merely the State Forest Service but also private forestry enterprises.  I wish, therefore, to make it quite clear, in introducing the Bill to this House, that it is not the object of the Bill to pave the way for new forestry schemes nor to provide new powers for the Minister in charge of forestry.  Forestry development is not a matter which is dependent on or concerned very much with legislation.  The expansion of forestry in this country does not call for any pronounced reorientation of the existing law.  The problem in forestry in this country consists in planning to secure, at the right time, in the right places, and in sufficient quantity, land suitable for planting; efficient technical and administrative staff; labour; plants, and fencing, tools and other equipment.  Land is inevitably the biggest problem in a country in which there is not anything like enough land to meet agricultural and other needs, and in which much of the waste land not suitable for agriculture is unfortunately equally unsuitable for forestry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1312" /> There are many reasons against a solution of this problem by widespread compulsory acquisition, although, of course, compulsory acquisition must on occasions be resorted to.  I will have occasion later to refer to this matter more extensively, but for the moment I merely wish to point out that circumstances are such that we must depend principally on the land which the State is in a position to purchase by the ordinary methods of negotiation and agreement for our forest needs, and that there is constant difficulty in securing an adequate and consistent supply of land by these means to permit of the expansion of State Forestry efforts on the scale desired and contemplated.</P>
    <P>Technical and administrative staff and trained foresters have in recent years been available to the Department to an extent sufficient to meet current needs.  The technical staff is being constantly expanded to keep pace with the expansion of the service within the limits to which other factors, notably land and supplies of materials and plants, permit.  Unskilled labour presents no big problem.  Seed and plant supplies and supplies of other materials, particularly fencing materials, which must be imported, have proved a serious setback to the forestry service during the war years, but with the resumption of normal conditions of international trade it is my Department's hope that such supplies will soon be available in adequate quantities to meet our needs.</P>
    <P>These are the factors by reference to which the possibility of rapid expansion of our forestry service must be estimated and, as I have mentioned, suitable land and supplies of seeds, plants and materials are the main difficulties.  The land problem is a difficult one, but I think, nevertheless, that very considerable progress has been made over the past ten to fifteen years and it is my hope that that progress will be sustained, and, in fact, accelerated.</P>
    <P>In pre-war years it was the aim of the forestry service to achieve an annual planting rate of 10,000 acres and to maintain that rate until an ultimate area of 600,000 acres of productive forest land was attained.  The <Col N="1313" /> area actually planted annually showed an increase each year, and in 1938-1939 approximately 7,600 acres were planted. Hopes of the achievement of the 10,000 acres a year programme within a few years were not realised because of the intervention of the war, and our difficulties in securing fencing materials under war-time conditions necessitated a severe limiting of planting activities. We are now again busy at the acceleration of our annual planting programme and, with the strengthening and expansion of the staff which it has been possible to effect during the emergency, I have good hopes that the target of 10,000 acres a year will be attained in a very short time provided that the expected improvement in the general supply position materialises.</P>
    <P>That is all I propose to say about the Government's forestry policy, or about the anticipated future of Irish forestry. I repeat that it is not a future dependent in a real sense on legislation and regulations, but on practical factors.  This Bill is concerned only with matters of detail which require settlement in the present statutes governing the conduct of State Forestry in Ireland.  Those statutes are the Forestry Acts, 1919 and 1928, and, since the Bill proposes to repeal them <i>in toto</i>, it may be well to summarise briefly their main provisions.</P>
    <P>The 1919 Act had two objects: it was concerned primarily with the establishment of the Forestry Commission which, so far as this country was concerned, took over the functions formerly discharged by the old Department of Agriculture and Technical Instruction for Ireland in relation to forestry.  The first positive step taken by the Department of Agriculture and Technical Instruction was in 1904.  In the decade preceding the first world war much useful work was accomplished in the establishment of State forest plantations, in an effort to counteract the very heavy clearance of Irish woodlands which had taken place over the previous century.  A commencement was also made with the establishment of the Forestry School in Avondale on the provision of training facilities.  In 1914 the war brought the forestry efforts of the Department of <Col N="1314" /> Agriculture practically to a standstill and the establishment of the Forestry Commission by the 1919 Act represented for this country, as well as for Great Britain, the laying of the foundation stone of a forestry service.  The Forestry Commission's functions in this country have since devolved successively on the Department of Agriculture and on the Department of Lands which is now charged with the conduct of State Forestry but the forestry service is still based on the general scheme contemplated by the 1919 Act, although, of course, its virility has been very much strengthened and its activities considerably expanded.</P>
    <P>The second purpose served by the 1919 Act was to provide a general legislative framework for the powers and duties of the Forestry Commission in relation to forestry.  The commissioners were, inter alia, empowered to acquire land by agreement or compulsorily, utilise and manage land for purposes connected with forestry, make advances by way of grant or loan in respect of the afforestation of land not their property, establish or aid in the establishment of woodland industries, authorise entry on land adjoining forest land for the purpose of destroying rabbits, hares or vermin, and arrange for the compulsory provision of facilities for the haulage of timber from any forest.</P>
    <P>The Act of 1928 amended the provisions of the 1919 Act in relation to the compulsory acquisition of land, principally with a view to bringing those provisions into alignment with the land purchase code.  Otherwise, the only real changes which it effected in legislation concerned with State forestry, as distinct from private enterprise, were minor ones&mdash;a provision enabling the Minister for Agriculture, who was at that time charged with the administration of the forestry service, to obtain requisite information from sawmillers and timber exporters in regard to timber handled by them, and the provision of safeguards against damage to any forest by fire originating on adjoining land.</P>
    <P>The main purpose, however, with which the 1928 Act was concerned was <Col N="1315" /> the control by the Minister of the felling of trees on lands in private ownership. It had become clear that the more rapid denudation of Irish woodlands during the 1914-1918 period had reduced the native timber stocks of the country to a critically low level and that it would be necessary, in order to restore and maintain a safety margin of timber resources, not merely to accelerate the programme of State forestry to the maximum possible but also to provide the Government with power to restrict the wholesale felling of the remaining timber stocks in private ownership, and power to require that trees felled on privately-owned lands would be replaced by fresh planting.  The 1928 Act provided those powers; it enabled the Minister for Agriculture to restrict by prohibition and licence the felling of trees in private woodlands and it empowered him to require persons whom he authorised to fell trees to plant other trees in replacement of the trees so felled.</P>
    <P>I have already mentioned that this Bill proposes to repeal the 1919 and 1928 Acts.  That proposal is made because a number of minor amendments in their provisions which are necessary can be effected more simply by consolidating the two Acts with the amendments necessary in a new statute.  Its purposes briefly are:&mdash; First, to modernise, improve and elaborate the provisions of the existing Acts in relation to the Minister's general powers; second, to provide more satisfactory machinery for the compulsory acquisition of land for forestry purposes; third, to improve the provisions of the 1928 Act in regard to the restriction on the felling of trees on lands in private ownership in the light of the administrative experience gained since 1928, and to rectify flaws in those provisions which have become apparent; and fourth, to confer certain additional powers on the Minister in relation to extinguishment of rights over land held by him, the creation of rights-of-way necessary for the proper management of State forests, the prevention of damage to trees and tree plants by <Col N="1316" /> hares, and the prevention of damage to forest land by fire originating on adjoining uncultivated land.</P>
    <P>The Bill does not introduce new principles nor confer new powers in any major sense and, strictly, it is scarcely necessary for me to say any more about its provisions at this stage. It may, however, help Senators towards consideration of the Bill on the Committee Stage if I avail of this opportunity to give a general summary of the scheme of the Bill with an explanation of the significance of its various provisions.</P>
    <P>The Bill is divided into five parts. Part I contains routine provisions concerned with expenses, prosecutions and other matters which call for no comment.</P>
    <P>Part II is concerned with the general powers of the Minister in relation to the promotion and development of forestry.  Section 9 re-enacts, with certain amendments in detail, none of which is significant, the provisions of the 1919 Act from which the Minister for Lands derives his principal powers relating to forestry.  It sets out what the Minister may do within the ambit of his responsibility for the promotion of forestry and allied matters.  Section 10 continues another provision of the 1919 Act enabling the Minister to establish a consultative committee to advise on matters relating to forestry, and Section 11 repeats a provision in that Act in regard to the power of officers appointed by the Minister to enter on land for purposes of inspection, etc.</P>
    <P>Part III deals with the compulsory acquisition of land, the extinguishment of easements over State forest land and the creation of temporary and permanent rights-of-way appurtenant to forests.  It is divided into three chapters.</P>
    <P>The first chapter requires little comment. It contains definitions and incidental provisions of a necessary nature in relation to proceedings before the lay commissioners of the Irish Land Commission and the appeal tribunal under Part III of the Bill.  Section 15 provides that, in the assessment of the value of any interest in land or the fixing of compensation under this Part <Col N="1317" /> by the lay commissioners, the standards of value settled by Section 2 of the Acquisition of Land (Assessment of Compensation) Act, 1919, shall apply. Section 16 empowers the lay commissioners and the appeal tribunal to award costs in proceedings before them.  Sections 17 and 18 settle the procedure to be followed in the actual disbursement of compensation, and provide for the payment by the Minister, or whoever else is required to pay compensation, of the costs involved in the production of title for the purpose of claiming the compensation. The machinery adopted is based on that of the Lands Clauses Acts, subject to the prior discharge of debts due to the State by any person to whom compensation is payable.</P>
    <P>The second chapter deals with rights over or appurtenant to forest lands. Section 19 enables the Minister for Lands to apply to the lay commissioners of the Land Commission for an order extinguishing easements in or over land held by him.  Its object is to provide an avenue for the extinguishment of any rights to which land was subject at the time of acquisition, and which prove a hindrance to the utilisation of the land for forestry purposes. The powers to be given by the section will also be used in some instances to obviate recourse to the more complicated provisions of Part III in relation to the compulsory acquisition of land.</P>
    <P>Where, for instance, the Minister desires to acquire a particular piece of land, and one person entitled to some right or other over the land which would seriously interfere with its utilisation for forestry purposes is not willing to negotiate with the Minister for the extinguishment of his right, but all other persons interested in the land are prepared to dispose of their interests to the Minister, the Minister can acquire the interests of those other persons by agreement, and avail of the provisions of Section 19 to deal with the recalcitrant party.  In the absence of Section 19, the only course open to him would be to institute compulsory acquisition proceedings.  The institution of compulsory proceedings in a case such as that I have mentioned would be rather like using a shotgun <Col N="1318" /> to exterminate a mouse.  Reasonable safeguards are provided to ensure that the powers given by the section will not be abused.  The Minister will not have an absolute power to extinguish any rights which he may desire to terminate.  He is only empowered to apply to the Land Commission, and it will be for the Land Commission to consider as an independent impartial body whether or not the right is to be extinguished.  An application to the Land Commission by the Minister will be heard in the first instance by lay commissioners, and an appeal will lie to the appeal tribunal.  Extinguishment of a right under the section will impose on the Minister the obligation of paying compensation which will fall to be assessed, in default of agreement, by the lay commissioners, subject again to a right of appeal to the appeal tribunal.</P>
    <P>Section 20 replaces a provision of the Forestry Act, 1919, under which the Minister at present is empowered to make an order requiring an owner or occupier of land to afford facilities for the haulage of timber from any wood or forest to a road, railway or waterway. The section proposes to take this power out of the hands of the Minister and to allot it to the Land Commission. Where an owner of timber requires facilities, in its extraction, for its haulage over land adjoining a wood or forest, he may apply to the lay commissioners for an order granting him a right-of-way exercisable for a specified period, which may not exceed 12 months.  The decision of the lay commissioners on the application will be open to an appeal to the appeal tribunal.  Compensation in respect of any temporary right-of-way granted by an order made by the lay commissioners or the appeal tribunal under Section 20 will be payable to the owner and the occupier of the land over which the right is exercisable, and such owner or occupier may require the person to whom the right is granted to restore the land over which the right is exercisable to its original condition on the expiration of the right.  Compensation will, in default of agreement, be assessed by the lay commissioners subject to appeal to the appeal tribunal.</P>
    <P>Section 21 is concerned with the <Col N="1319" /> creation of permanent rights-of-way appurtenant to State forests.  Where the Minister requires a right-of-way over land in the vicinity of a State forest for purposes connected with the management, etc., of that forest, he may apply to the lay commissioners for an order creating the required right-of-way. The lay commissioners will have the widest possible discretion in regard to their decision on his application, subject to suitable appeal to the appeal tribunal.  Compensation will be payable in respect of rights created under the section, and will, in default of agreement, be assessed by the lay commissioners subject to appeal to the appeal tribunal.  The distinction between this section and Section 20 is that Section 20 applies to woods and forests in private ownership as well as to State forests, but provides only for the grant of temporary rights, while Section 21 has reference solely to State forests, but provides for instances in which a permanent right-of-way is necessary.</P>
    <P>The third chapter in Part III deals solely with the machinery to govern the compulsory acquisition of land for forestry purposes.  The existing procedure as provided by the 1919 and 1928 Acts is being replaced by a procedure retaining the requirement that the concurrence of the Land Commission be obtained as a necessary preliminary to compulsory acquisition, but availing of the machinery of the Land Commission to settle compensation questions instead of providing for their settlement, as at present, under the Lands Clauses Acts.  The new procedure proposed is intended to permit of the assessment of compensation in advance of the final acquisition of any particular lands.  This particular feature of Chapter III is intended to meet the peculiar requirements of the forestry service.  Compulsory acquisition in the normal course of State or local administration is not subordinate to considerations of price.  Usually where a Government Department or local authority requires land for its public undertakings, a particular site must be obtained irrespective of cost, and the relevant statute provides power for the compulsory acquisition of the land and <Col N="1320" /> the settlement of all compensation issues afterwards.  The question of price must, however, be given more significance in relation to the compulsory acquisition of land for forestry purposes.  The forestry needs of the country demand that, ultimately, a certain minimum forest area be created but there is not the same immediate need for the acquisition of any one particular estate or holding as there may be where that particular site is suitable for an aerodrome or some other similar immediate purpose.  If a particular estate or holding can be acquired at a reasonable cost, that is, at a cost which will permit of its economic development as a forest unit, then its acquisition is desirable.  If, however, the compensation payable is likely to prove excessive, it is the better policy to look elsewhere for land for forestry.  It is, therefore, desirable that, before the Minister finally proceeds to acquire any particular piece of land, he should know the total amount of compensation which he will have to pay.</P>
    <P>In regard to the detail of the provisions of this chapter, I do not think much comment is necessary.  Section 22 provides necessary powers for the investigation of title to any land which the Minister proposes to acquire compulsorily. Under its provisions, the Minister will be enabled, where he considers it desirable to acquire land, to require persons having an interest therein to furnish particulars of their interests.</P>
    <P>Section 23 enables the Minister to apply to the lay commissioners of the Land Commission for an order,&mdash;an acquisition order&mdash;authorising him to acquire compulsorily any land which he desires to acquire and is unable to acquire by agreement.  An acquisition order may not provide for the acquisition of land which is required for the amenity or convenience of a dwelling-house, is the property of a local authority, has been acquired by a corporation or company for the purposes of a public undertaking, or is the site of a national monument owned by the Commissioners of Public Works. Subject to this condition, the lay commissioners will have absolute discretion to decide whether or not to <Col N="1321" /> grant an acquisition order in respect of any particular land which the Minister proposes to acquire.  Their decision will, however, be subject to an appeal to the appeal tribunal.</P>
    <P>The provisions which I have just outlined differ from those of the existing law in two main respects.  First, under the existing law, the acquisition of land which forms part of any park, demesne, garden or pleasure-ground or forms part of the home farm attached to and usually occupied with a mansion house, or the acquisition of any land required for the purposes of relieving congestion, is prohibited.  These prohibitions have been removed but the Land Commission will now have full discretion to grant or refuse an acquisition order, whereas, under the provisions of the 1919 Act as amended by the 1928 Act, the Land Commission had no discretion.  Provided any land which the Minister desired to acquire compulsorily for forestry did not fall into one or other of the categories of land the acquisition of which was precluded, the Land Commission had to grant the order authorising acquisition sought by the Minister.  They will now have full power to consider each application on its merits and will, of course, be in a position to have regard to any representations made to them in regard to the possible desirability of devoting the land to other purposes, utilising it for the relief of congestion, etc., or to any plea made by the existing owner or occupier of the land to the effect that its acquisition by the Minister for forestry purposes would deprive him of his means of livelihood.</P>
    <P>This Bill proposes much more limited powers of compulsory acquisition than are normally provided in statutes dealing with State projects for which the acquisition of land may prove necessary, and even the limited powers of compulsory acquisition which are proposed in the Bill will be rarely utilised. Compulsory proceedings will never be instituted where it is reasonably contended that the land concerned is more suitable for, and should in the interests of the community be devoted to, sheep grazing or some other purpose. Afforestation cannot be conducted in this country on the basis of compelling <Col N="1322" /> the owners of land to hand it over to the forestry service against their wishes.</P>
    <P>That principle must be upheld, no matter how difficult it may be to acquire an adequate area of land for the fulfilment of a national forest policy.  If the owners of land or persons entitled to grazing rights on land strenuously, and in all good faith, object to parting with their land or rights, my Department will not proceed to acquire their land compulsorily.  To do so would be to court lasting trouble and loss against which there could be no adequate safeguards.  Compulsory powers of acquisition are required mainly to facilitate the acquisition of land for forestry where there is general agreement that the land should be devoted to forestry, and that the locality would benefit by the establishment of a forest centre, but the Minister and the parties who own or have interests in the land fail to reach agreements about the price, the allocation of the purchase money, or some other such matter.  Compulsory proceedings will also be resorted to in cases where land is subject to interests of so complicated or extensive a nature that purchase by agreement is not practicable.  There is much mountain land in this country devoted to rough grazing and held in commonage by local smallholders, which would be suitable for forestry purposes, and the devotion of that land to forestry would benefit everybody. Its acquisition for forestry by the ordinary method of negotiation and agreement is, however, not infrequently found to be a hopeless proposition. The provisions of Section 23 of the Bill are designed to permit of the operation of the machinery of compulsory purchase in such cases.</P>
    <P>An acquisition order made under Section 23 will remain in force for a period of two years from the date on which it comes into operation and, at any time during that period of two years, the Minister may, under the powers which Section 26 proposes to confer on him, make a vesting order vesting the lands in him in fee-simple. Sections 28 and 29 should be read with Section 26.  They contain necessary provisions relating to the entry of the Minister into possession of land vested <Col N="1323" /> in him by a vesting order made under Section 26.</P>
    <P>Sections 24 and 25 provide for the assessment of the value of any interest in land the subject of an acquisition order, the provisional apportionment of annual sums to which land the subject of an acquisition order is liable in conjunction with other lands, and the assessment of the value of the part of any such annual sum so apportioned to the land the subject of the order. The assessment, etc., will be effected, on the application of the Minister, by the lay commissioners, subject to an appeal by either the Minister or the person enjoying the right, or entitled to the annual sum concerned, to the appeal tribunal.  These sections will enable the Minister to have the values of all interests in land which he proposes to vest in himself, in accordance with the authority given by an acquisition order under Section 23, assessed before he proceeds to acquire the land by making a vesting order under Section 27.  Sections 30 and 31, which provide for the payment and assessment of compensation in respect of land compulsorily acquired by the Minister, contain provisions under which the amount of compensation in respect of any particular interest or interests in the land will, in default of agreement, be assessed by the lay commissioners, with an appeal to the appeal tribunal, but will be subject to the overriding maximum of any value assessed on the interest or interests concerned under Sections 24 and 25.  Section 32 contains necessary provisions as to the allocation of compensation in respect of mortgaged interests and as to the effect of such allocation on the relations of the mortgagor and the mortgagee under the mortgage.</P>
    <P>Sections 27, 33 and 34 require little comment.  Section 27 is concerned with the apportionment of State annuities to which land being acquired compulsorily is subject in conjunction with other lands.  Section 33 provides specially for the more expeditious fixation and payment of compensation in respect of small parcels of land and Section 34 provides for the non-application of the Lands Clauses Acts, except for certain provisions of those <Col N="1324" /> Acts made applicable by other sections.</P>
    <P>Before passing from this part of the Bill, I would like to refer again to the fact that, under these provisions, compensation in respect of compulsory acquisition of land for forestry, the extinguishment of easements over land held by the Minister and the creation of rights-of-way appurtenant to woods or forests, will, in default of agreement, be assessed by the Land Commission instead of being assessed under the machinery provided by the Lands Clauses Acts.  There was some criticism of this proposal when the Bill was under consideration in the Dáil because it was contended that the Land Commission, being associated with the Minister for Lands, could not consider compensation questions impartially. This is a contention which I cannot accept.  Except in matters reserved to the Minister under the Land Purchase Acts, the Land Commission is, and must necessarily be, independent of Departmental control and that independence will, of course, apply equally to the consideration by the Land Commission of questions to be referred to them under this Bill.</P>
    <P>The proposal to utilise the Land Commission machinery to settle compensation questions has been put forward solely because the Land Commission is the most competent body to assess compensation in respect of the type of land with which we are here concerned or in respect of rights of way or other rights relating to lands. By no other means, apart from the utilisation of the machinery of the Land Commission, could such a competent body be obtained for arbitration purposes&mdash;a body with the background of knowledge and experience gained from constant association with, and implementation of, the Land Acts and with the added benefits that the decision, in the first instance, will rest not on one arbitrator but on a group of arbitrators, namely, the lay commissioners designated to deal with matters arising under the Bill, and that there will be an appeal to a higher body, namely, the appeal tribunal, which is also eminently competent to deal with such matters and which will have had no previous knowledge of, or contact with, the issues <Col N="1325" /> under appeal.  The appeal tribunal consists of a judge of the High Court and of two land commissioners to whom, in the ordinary course of their duties, questions or cases that are appealable are never referred before the appeal is taken.</P>
    <P>Part IV of the Bill deals with restrictions on the felling of trees on lands in private ownership and allied matters, and replaces the corresponding provisions of the 1928 Act.  The scheme of control devised by the 1928 Act has proved in general satisfactory and adequate to meet its purposes and is easily workable.  The provisions incorporated in the Bill will merely continue the scheme, with alterations in detail and elaborations the necessity for which has become apparent from experience.  This Part of the Bill is, however, necessarily complicated in its provisions and it may be desirable to summarise the significant features of each section.</P>
    <P>Section 35 contains definitions for the purposes of Part IV.  None of these definitions is significant except that relating to exempted trees, the purport of which I will explain in relation to Section 40.  The section also provides specially for certain cases in which it is necessary to treat with the Land Commission instead of the owner of land, where the land has passed through the hands of the Land Commission, and trees standing thereon have been reserved to the Land Commission, and for cases in which land is vested in the Land Commission and it is desirable to treat, not with the Land Commission who still retain the legal ownership of the land, but with a tenant-purchaser or purchaser who is the equitable, though not the legal, owner of the land.</P>
    <P>Section 36 enables the Minister by Order to exclude any particular species of tree from the provisions of Part IV, or from any of those provisions.  There is a similar saving clause in the 1928 Act.</P>
    <P>Section 37 is the important basic section on which the scheme of control depends.  It provides for the giving of a felling notice in relation to trees over ten years old which it is proposed to uproot, or trees of any age which <Col N="1326" /> it is proposed to cut down, except in the case of certain trees which are being excluded from its operation.  As under the 1928 Act, the felling notice will be given to the sergeant in charge of the nearest Gárda station, who will be responsible for transmitting it to the Forestry Division, and the notice must be given not less than 21 days before the tree is uprooted or cut down.  The provision differs from the corresponding provision in the 1928 Act in so far as a notice will remain effective only for a period of two years, whereas no time limit existed under the 1928 Act, and a notice must be given by the owner of the tree.  The limitation of the life of a felling notice to two years is proposed mainly for reasons of administrative convenience in order to obviate the need for keeping records of felling notices given in perpetuity.  The other change, that is, as to the person who is to give the notice, is a more important one to which I will refer later.</P>
    <P>The exceptional cases in which a felling notice need not be given in respect of the uprooting or cutting down of a tree, as set out in sub-section (4) of Section 37, include the categories of tree which were excepted from the requirement that a felling notice be given under the 1928 Act, and certain additional categories of tree&mdash;trees standing in a county borough, etc., or within 100 feet of a building&mdash;in respect of which a felling notice must be given under the present law, but the felling of which the Minister may not prohibit, and certain other trees such as trees being cut down by a local authority in connection with road construction, trees dangerous to road traffic, or which constitute a danger or obstruction to telegraph or telephone wires.</P>
    <P>Section 38 is a corollary to Section 39 dealing with the prohibition by the Minister of the felling of trees in respect of which a felling notice has been given.  The Minister's power to prohibit the felling of trees under Section 39 is limited to the extent that he may not prohibit the felling of a tree in respect of which it was stated in the relevant felling notice that it was intended to uproot or cut down the tree for the purpose of transplantation. Section 38 contains necessary provision <Col N="1327" /> that, where it was stated in a felling notice that it was intended to uproot a tree for the purpose of transplantation, the tree may not be cut down in pursuance of the notice, or if uprooted in pursuance of the notice must be transplanted and may not be used for any other purpose.  In the absence of this provision it would be possible to evade the restrictions of Part IV of the Bill on the uprooting or cutting down of trees simply by stating in a felling notice that it was intended to uproot a tree to transplant it.  Since that statement had been made the Minister could not prohibit the felling of the tree and, as soon as the statutory period of 21 days elapsed, the tree could be cut down or uprooted and sold to a saw-miller or used for any other purpose. Section 38 will prevent such evasion of the Act.</P>
    <P>Section 39 provides that, within 21 days after the date on which a felling notice is given in relation to any tree, the Minister may make a prohibition Order prohibiting the felling of the tree, and the tree may not then be felled unless the Minister subsequently grants a limited felling licence under Section 40 authorising the cutting down or uprooting of the tree.  The purpose of this provision is to enable the Minister to place a stay on the felling of a tree in respect of which a felling notice has been given where he considers it desirable to have an inspection made by the Department.  If the inspection, when made, makes it clear that the felling of the tree may be permitted then the Minister will grant a limited felling licence under Section 40; otherwise he will refuse to grant the licence and the prohibition on the felling of the tree imposed by the prohibition Order will automatically be absolute.</P>
    <P>Section 40 empowers the Minister to grant a limited felling licence authorising the felling, during a period of 12 months, of any tree in respect of which he has made a prohibition Order.  The power is discretionary except in the case of a tree belonging to one or other of the classes of exempted trees set out in the definition of exempted trees in Section 35.  Under the present law the Minister may not make a prohibition <Col N="1328" /> Order in respect of these exempted trees.  It is considered, however, that the Minister should have an opportunity of satisfying himself by inspection or inquiry that trees claimed to be exempted are, in fact, so exempted. That is why it is now proposed to permit the making of a prohibition Order in these cases but to provide that where the Minister satisfies himself later that the tree is in fact exempted he may not refuse to grant a limited felling licence.  The limitation of the authority conferred by a licence to a period of 12 months is a departure from the present law proposed in the light of considerations already mentioned in relation to the same point as regards felling notices.  The licence will be granted to the owner of the land on which the tree stands instead of the owner of the tree as heretofore.  This is an important change designed to restrain land owners from escaping replanting obligations by selling trees before applying for a licence, thus placing the Department in the position that the licence had to be granted to a sawmiller or whoever else purchased the trees and who, not being the owner of the land, could not be obliged to replant.</P>
    <P>Section 41 empowers the Minister to attach to a limited felling licence, which does not relate exclusively to exempted trees, either replanting conditions or a preservation condition or conditions, or both.  Both replanting conditions and preservation conditions will be binding on the licensee and on his successors in title to lands specified in the conditions, and the particular obligations of preservation and protection will in each case be binding also on any other person who may at any time be in occupation of the land. Where the authority to fell trees conferred by a licence is not fully availed of, the Minister will have discretion to modify replanting conditions or preservation conditions attached to the licence.</P>
    <P>The attachment of replanting conditions to a limited felling licence will not represent a new departure.  Such conditions could be attached to licences granted under the 1928 Act.  The scope of the conditions which will in future <Col N="1329" /> be attached to licences is, however, being widened to express better the intentions of the provision and to ensure that trees planted in compliance therewith will be properly planted and preserved until they are old enough to come within the restrictive provisions of Section 37.  The licensee will be required to plant specified trees on specified land in his ownership within a period of not less than 12 months or such extended period as the Minister may allow, and to preserve and protect the trees so planted until they are at least ten years old, and may, if the Minister so thinks fit, be specifically required to fence the area on which the trees are to be planted as a measure of protection.</P>
    <P>Preservation conditions represent a new departure.  They will require the licensee to preserve and protect for a period of 11 years trees which are growing, or which in consequence of natural regeneration may grow, or which may be planted, on specified land in his ownership, and may, if the Minister so thinks fit, require the licensee to fence the specified land as a measure of protection.  Preservation conditions will only be attached to licences in occasional instances in substitution or part substitution for replanting conditions where the interests of national forestry are likely to be best served by requiring the licensee to preserve properly an existing plantation.</P>
    <P>Section 42 empowers the Minister to attach to any limited felling licence, to which he has not attached either replanting conditions or a preservation condition or conditions and which does not relate exclusively to exempted trees, a contributing condition requiring the licensee to pay a specified contribution towards the expenses of State forestry before felling any tree under the authority conferred by the licence.  The contribution which the licensee will be required to pay will be assessed having regard to the expenses which he would have had to incur in compliance with replanting conditions attached to his licence, if the attachment of replanting conditions to the licence had been practicable and if the Minister had, in fact, so attached replanting conditions.  The power to <Col N="1330" /> attach a contributing condition to a licence is intended to cover rare instances in which, having regard to the number and type of trees which the applicant for a licence proposes to fell, the Minister is of opinion that grounds exist for the attachment of replanting or preservation conditions to a licence and where the Minister is reasonably precluded from attaching such conditions to the licence because of the nonpossession by the applicant of land suitable or properly usable for forestry purposes, or because the applicant reasonably desires to use the only land available for replanting for other purposes and the Minister concurs in the applicant's view that it should be so used or for other abnormal reasons.  The 1928 Act established the principle that an owner of land on which trees were standing, who desired to fell the trees, had in respect of those trees an obligation to the community which he should be required to discharge by establishing a fresh plantation in lieu of the trees felled by him. This provision is based on the same principle and will provide a means of requiring a licensee to discharge his obligation to the community, where he is not himself in a position to undertake replanting.  His obligation to the community will be discharged by his contributing towards the cost of the establishment of plantations by the State.</P>
    <P>Section 43 provides for the suspension or termination of a limited felling licence where the Minister is satisfied that its terms are being abused.  No such power of suspension or termination was given to the Minister by the 1928 Act, but it is necessary and reasonable that there should be such a power.</P>
    <P>Section 44 is concerned with a particular type of case in which it may be desirable for the Minister to refuse to grant a limited felling licence, that is, the case in which an owner of land desires to fell trees the preservation of which is necessary for the purposes of preserving scenic beauty.  Section 11 of the 1928 Act endeavoured to deal with this matter by empowering the Minister to pay compensation to the owner of any tree the felling of which <Col N="1331" /> he refused to authorise solely with a view to the preservation of scenic beauty.  That provision was inadequate and unsatisfactory.  The Minister was empowered to compensate the owner of the tree for the restriction of his power to dispose of it, but the Minister was given no power to ensure the proper preservation and protection of the tree.  After compensation had been paid the owner of the tree could cease to take an interest in it and perhaps wilfully bring about its death or decay.  He would be particularly liable to do so if he wanted to clear the tree or trees concerned off his land. In the amended provision in this section it is stipulated that the Minister may not refuse an application for a limited felling licence solely for the purpose of preserving amenities unless the district planning authority, within the meaning of the Town and Regional Planning Acts, within whose planning district the tree is situated, consents to that refusal.  Where a licence is so refused the owner of the land on which the tree stands may require the district planning authority to acquire the site of the tree subject to the right of the planning authority to acquire also other land in his ownership in the immediate vicinity on which there are standing other trees the preservation of which appears to them equally necessary for the preservation of amenities, or which is required for the purpose of affording protection to, or ready access to, trees being preserved. Compensation will be payable by the district planning authority in accordance with the provisions of the Lands Clauses Acts as modified for the purposes of the Public Health Acts.</P>
    <P>Sections 45, 46 and 47 must be taken together.  Section 45 provides that, where it was claimed in a felling notice that a tree is an exempted tree, that tree may not, when felled, be used for any purpose contrary to that claim unless the Minister has authorised its use for a specified other purpose by the grant under Section 46 of a utilisation (exempted trees) Order.  Section 47 provides that a tree, the use of which for a specified purpose has been authorised by a utilisation (exempted trees) Order, may not be used for any other <Col N="1332" /> purpose.  Provision is made in Section 46 for the attachment of replanting or preservation conditions to utilisation (exempted trees) Orders in the same way as such conditions may be attached to limited felling licences.  These three sections are together intended to close a loophole by which the provisions of the Act might be evaded.  In the absence of these provisions, it would be possible to escape replanting or preservation conditions by claiming in a felling notice that it was intended to use trees for a purpose which would exempt them from the Minister's power to attach either replanting or preservation conditions to a limited felling licence, although in fact it was intended to use the trees for commercial purposes.  Section 45 will prevent any other such use of the trees except under the authority of a utilisation (exempted trees) Order and subject to replanting or preservation conditions.</P>
    <P>Section 48 is concerned solely with ensuring that, where replanting conditions have been attached to licences under the 1928 Act, the licensees will fulfil the obligations of replanting properly.  It provides that the existing conditions attached to 1928 Act licences will be replaced by new conditions of like extent but expressed in the more detailed terms which will be used in future replanting conditions under the provisions of Section 41.  The new conditions so attached will not be more onerous than the existing conditions were intended to be, and they will not impose any fresh obligations upon the licensees apart from obligations in relation to the proper planting of trees and their preservation and protection implied in the existing conditions but not expressly stated therein.  The new conditions will be binding in like manner as replanting conditions attached to future limited felling licences, and the Minister will have like discretionary power to modify the conditions if the licensee does not avail in full of the authority to fell trees conferred on him by the felling licence.</P>
    <P>In considering the replanting, preservation and protection conditions mentioned in the Bill and already referred to by me it has to be taken into account that the Department is <Col N="1333" /> prepared to make a grant of £10 for every acre of replanting done to the satisfaction of the Department in the same way, and on the same conditions, as the payment of the grant applies to fresh plantations.</P>
    <P>Section 49 provides for the grant of general felling licences similar to the general permits for which provision was made in the 1928 Act.  General felling licences may be granted where an owner of woodland, who is managing his woodland in accordance with the proper practice of forestry, desires to fell trees in the course of thinning operations or in the course of clearing land with a view to replanting, without having to give a felling notice in respect of each individual tree felled. The general felling licence will convey an omnibus authority to fell trees for the particular purpose contemplated during a definite specified period without the giving of felling notices.  When a licence authorises the clearance of land with a view to replanting there will be attached to it afforestation conditions imposing a statutory obligation on the licensee to replant.  A wide discretion will be left to the licensee in regard to the type and number of trees to be planted in compliance with afforestation conditions, but he will have to carry out the planting in accordance with the practice of good forestry.</P>
    <P>Section 50 needs no comment.  It is concerned with the statement in licences, etc., of conditions attached thereto.</P>
    <P>Section 51 is intended to prevent a circumvention of the earlier provisions of the Act by making it an offence to remove timber from any tree otherwise than in accordance with the practice of good forestry or for the purpose of preventing grave damage to crops, or to take any action in relation to a tree calculated or likely to result in its death or decay.  In Section 35 the expression &ldquo;cut down&rdquo; in relation to a tree is defined in order to prevent ill-disposed persons from cutting through the trunk of a tree to such an extent as to render the tree liable to fall under the influence of natural agencies.  The definition of &ldquo;cut down&rdquo; given in <Col N="1334" /> Section 35 would not prevent the cutting of a trunk of a tree at a height of more than six feet from the ground or the wholesale removal of branches therefrom, and this section is therefore necessary to preclude the wholesale cutting of trees at a little over six feet from the ground surface or the destruction of trees so as to render them exempt.  The provisions of Section 51 will, of course, not be utilised to prevent people removing branches from trees because they are obstructing paths, etc., or for the purposes of providing cart-shafts or anything of that nature necessary to agricultural pursuits. Such removal of branches would not be contrary to the practice of good forestry.  The section is intended to prevent deliberate evasion of the Act in wholesale fashion, and its provisions will be utilised for that purpose and that purpose alone.</P>
    <P>Section 52 is an elaboration of the restrictions already in existence.  It provides that where a person precluded the Minister from imposing on him replanting or preservation conditions by breaking the law, and is convicted of his illegal act, the Minister will have power to make a replanting Order imposing a replanting obligation on him. A person who complies with the law by giving a felling notice and, in the event of a prohibition Order being served on him, does not cut down his trees until he receives a licence will be liable to replanting conditions by way of their attachment to the licence, and he cannot escape those conditions; even if he neglects to comply with them and is convicted of an offence for such neglect, the obligation to replant remains.  It continues no matter how often or how heavily he is fined for non-compliance. It would be inequitable that the more serious offender who completely ignores the Act would be liable for a single fine and be free from any obligation to replant.</P>
    <P>Indeed, instances might occur in which an owner of woodland who desired to use the land for some other purpose, perhaps of no benefit to the community, or even to let it lie derelict would cheerfully face the prospect of being fined for breaking the law by felling the trees without authority.  He <Col N="1335" /> might regard the fine as a good investment in so far as he would then be free to do with the land whatever he wished.  In such cases the provisions of Section 52 enabling the Minister to make replanting Orders will have a restraining influence.</P>
    <P>Section 53 deals only with the limitation of certain penalties in relation to offences affecting large numbers of trees where the offences were due to <i>bona fide</i> errors.  Section 54 is concerned with the registration in the land registry of burdens on land arising from the attachment of replanting or other conditions to licences, etc.</P>
    <P>Sections 55 and 56 continue provisions in the 1928 Act relating to the reference of objections to a panel of referees. The functions of the panel of referees established under the 1928 Act were confined to the examination of objections to the refusal by the Minister to grant felling licences.  The provisions in the new Bill will enable, not only objections to the Minister's refusal to grant a limited felling licence, but also almost every conceivable objection which an affected party might have in regard to the Minister's actions under Part IV of the Bill, to be referred to a referee.  The Minister will consider every report made by a referee on an objection referred to him and must furnish a copy of the report to the person who raised the objection.  He may take any action which he may consider appropriate in the light of the referee's report to meet the objection raised.</P>
    <P>Section 57 does not require comment. It merely contains transitory provisions necessary to link up proceedings initiated under the 1928 Act with the provisions in the Bill itself.</P>
    <P>I have yet to deal with Part V of the Bill, which is concerned with miscellaneous matters.</P>
    <P>Sections 58, 59 and 60 are concerned with the prevention of damage to woods due to the depredations of rabbits and other vermin and of hares.  Section 58 deals with rabbits and vermin other than hares.  It continues a provision of the 1919 Act empowering the Minister to take steps to prevent damage to trees or tree plants by reason of the presence on <Col N="1336" /> any land of rabbits or vermin.  When the Minister is satisfied that such damage is taking place, or is liable to take place, he may serve a notice on the occupier of the land drawing attention to the damage and urging him to take steps either to destroy the rabbits or vermin or otherwise to prevent the damage, and if the occupier of the land does not comply with the notice the Minister may authorise entry on the land to destroy the rabbits or vermin.</P>
    <P>Section 59 and 60 are concerned with the destruction of hares which are causing damage to plantations.  Section 59 deals with the State forests and has the effect of relieving the Minister and his agents of the obligation of compliance with the provisions of the Game Preservation Act, 1930, in so far as these provisions would restrict the destruction of hares on the State forest lands.  Section 60 confers on the Minister power in the first instance to authorise an owner of planted land, or of land adjoining planted land, to destroy hares thereon, the presence of which on that land is causing or likely to cause damage to trees or tree plants growing on the planted land, notwithstanding the provisions of the Game Preservation Act, and also confers power on the Minister to authorise entry on land adjoining planted land for the purpose of destroying the hares thereon where he has first given an opportunity to the owner or occupier of the land to destroy the hares and where the owner or occupier has failed to do so.</P>
    <P>Section 61 proposes to continue a provision of the 1928 Act designed to minimise the danger of fire started on land adjoining a wood spreading to the wood.  It requires that any person proposing to burn vegetation on any land within one mile of a wood not his property shall serve notice of his intention on the owner of the wood and on the sergeant in charge of the Gárda Síochána station nearest to the wood. The owner of the wood may serve a counter-notice objecting to the proposed burning, and where injury is caused to a wood by the burning of vegetation on adjoining land the person who burned the vegetation will be liable for damages in respect of such <Col N="1337" /> injury if he failed to give the required notice or, having done so, received a counter-notice.</P>
    <P>Section 62 empowers the Minister to authorise entry on uncultivated land to destroy vegetation growing thereon within 150 feet of any wood where he is satisfied that the wood is liable to be damaged by fire originating on uncultivated land, and where the owner or occupier fails to comply with a notice served on him requiring him to remove the vegetation.</P>
    <P>Under Section 63 the Minister will have power to obtain statistical information from sawmillers and timber exporters, dealing with timber in the rough or round state.  A similar power was given to the Minister by the 1928 Act.</P>
    <P>Section 65 proposes to transfer to the Minister for Agriculture powers at present exercisable by the Minister for Lands under the Destructive Insects and Pests Acts.  The powers concerned relate to insects and pests destructive only to forest trees and timber.  It is considered preferable that the Destructive Insects and Pests Acts should be administered by one Department. There will, of course, be co-operation between my Department and the Department of Agriculture in relation to the control of insects and pests which represent a danger to timber or timber trees.</P>
    <P>I feel sure that the members of the Seanad would like the destruction of one particular kind of pest, especially since they had to listen to all that I have read.  I thought it better to give the House the fullest information I could about the Bill, so that Senators would have everything they would need to know about it when they came to deal with the Bill in Committee.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>Unquestionably, the House can have no complaint to make as regards the industry of the Minister in putting his scheme before it, and in elaborating it for Senators.  Frankly, I want to say that I feel grateful to him for the pains that he has taken to explain every section of the Bill to the House.  All that information will be very helpful to Senators when they come to consider the Bill in Committee, <Col N="1338" /> though I must say the Bill is not one which lends itself easily to amendment in Committee.  The comment that I have to make on the Minister's statement is that, as he has made an examination of the Bill before us, of what it purports to do and will enable him and his successors to do, and has considered how all that was to be done, then, looking into the future, he should have given us a picture of what he thinks our forests will be like when that policy of his has finally taken shape.  I would be glad to have heard him analyse for us the distribution of the various types of timber that we are going to have in the respective areas under the heading of hard woods and soft woods, and of their approximate value to the country. It would seem to me that his plan at the moment must be based on a knowledge of what these are going to be worth at some day in the far distant future.</P>
      <P>I have not a whole lot to say on the Bill.  This problem was discussed on two previous occasions.  There is no difference of opinion on it in the House, nor was there in the other House. There are certain aspects of the policy enshrined in this Bill which, I think, ought to get more consideration from the country.  I have commented on the Minister's industry in putting information before the House in regard to the Bill, but I want to say this: that I am not satisfied that the policy he has put before us is as virile as the needs of the situation demand.  Neither am I satisfied that it is as virile a policy as the Minister could have given us.  I should be glad to hear from him why he did not give us that virile policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Earlier to-day we were discussing another aspect of our future activities. Looking out on the country, we obviously are forced to ask ourselves in how far the nation's economy is balanced?  We have to ask ourselves, what contribution we are making towards a better balancing of the national economy.  In order to answer that question you have to see what are the nation's needs, because there are essential needs without which the nation can neither live nor thrive.  One of the most essential commodities for <Col N="1339" /> this country to-day is timber.  We have not got it.  Senators know that this is the least wooded country in Europe. In Finland, approximately 60 per cent. of the entire area of the country is under timber.  We have under 2 per cent.</P>
    <P>About 30 years ago, when I was so much younger than I am to-day and was a member of the Sinn Féin movement, I made contact with a young agricultural instructor.  We talked of our hopes and of our aims.  I remember that one point he put before me was, what should be done when the nation was free.  In his opinion the first thing that the nation would require to do was to carry out a scheme of afforestation. He said that if we had timber in the country we had at the hand of every countryman the material that he required on his farm; that men in the country could do all sorts of things with such a commodity which can be so easily fashioned, and would acquire skill in the handling of it.  All that, he said, would have an immense influence on our lives.  People who live in the country know that that is absolutely true.  As I have said, we are the least wooded country in Europe.  I have no doubt&mdash;nor can anybody else who has any knowledge of timber and of the functions of the tree, both in the root system and in the branches&mdash;what an influence that sparsely wooded condition must have on our climatic conditions, on the health of our people, on our live stock, on the condition of our soil and on everything around us in this island.  I do not think that that is open to dispute.  It is accepted by everybody with any knowledge of the matter.  From that angle, the policy of reafforestation is marching too slowly.  From the point of view of improving the conditions of health&mdash; climatic conditions&mdash;and from the point of view of improving soil conditions the most urgent problem next to food and housing is reafforestation.</P>
    <P>I have not any doubt that our rainfall would be much less if forestry conditions were different.  I remember coming in contact with a new Zealand clergyman who was across here a little <Col N="1340" /> while ago.  He told me of what had been achieved in one of the islands off New Zealand where the rainfall had been immense&mdash;probably, as heavy as it is on the west coast of Ireland. After carrying out afforestation over a number of years, the rainfall decreased to an amazing extent.  He informed me that, as the clouds came along at great velocity, they struck the forests, went up and were across the island before the rain fell.</P>
    <P>The country and the Minister must make up their mind as to what they are after in connection with this problem of afforestation.  The Minister hopes for an ultimate area of 700,000 acres.  I shall not at this stage go into the question of our imports of timber. Neither the value nor importance of timber is open to dispute.  The Minister spoke of land being made available for forestry purposes at such a figure as would make reafforestation an economic proposition.  I do not know what he means by that.  He will have to explain his meaning to us. Apparently, his policy is regulated by his difficulty in obtaining possession of land, by his reluctance to use compulsory powers for the acquisition of land and because he is not prepared to pay more than a certain figure for land.  I think that he mentioned the value of land for forestry purposes as £4 per acre.  He also said that he was not disposed to take possession of land which was required for agricultural purposes for reafforestation.  I should like to have that matter examined.  Earlier, I said that it should be our aim to balance our economy, so far as it is possible to do so, by producing our necessities from within the country. It is not disputed that we can produce timber here.  I do not know how far we have explored the possibilities of producing timber in areas where certain authorities have argued that it is not possible to grow timber.  I do not think that anybody will question the statement that we can produce as much timber as is requisite for our needs. What are our needs?  We have needs from the point of view of health&mdash;the improvement of our climatic conditions &mdash;from the point of view of building, while we require wood pulp and all <Col N="1341" /> sorts of equipment for which timber is requisite.  I have not heard any calculation as to what those needs would amount to.  Are we to take it that the 700,000 acres, which represent the Minister's aim, will supply all those needs?  I am not quite clear on that.</P>
    <P>The Minister made another and a very vital point.  He is not prepared to acquire land for this purpose which can be regarded as valuable for agricultural purposes.  Our area for afforestation is, therefore, limited.  We all recognise that we have more land available, classified as agricultural land, than is necessary from the point of view of providing food for our community. I am not thinking of the provision of commodities which must be used as a medium of exchange.  Let it be remembered that we require all sorts of timber to-day for agriculture and industry and that we can only provide it by exporting commodities from the land and purchasing it in Canada, Sweden and elsewhere.  At present, land is being used for agricultural purposes, so to speak&mdash;that is to say, sheep farming&mdash;which cannot yield more than 3/5 in the year in respect of meat or wool.  I have seen estimates made that an acre of that land afforested would be worth from £20 to £30.  That is a vital consideration from the point of view of the completeness of our economy.  The attitude taken up by certain people is that they are not going to replace men by trees.  That is a complete misrepresentation but I am afraid it is a point of view to which the Minister has fallen victim.  He has not said so but he has said that he is not prepared to utilise for afforestation purposes land that can be used for agricultural purposes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCounihan" hpid="Mr. Counihan Mr. Counihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Counihan</NameTxt>
      <P>And he is right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>Land being used for sheep farming is yielding 3/5 an acre. Its value to the nation is practically nil.  There are thousands of acres of that type of land.  If we were to set about the task of afforestating it in the proper manner, it would mean an increase, possibly, of millions in the value of the nation's assets.  We have to make up our minds that forests are necessary.  If we had the point of view <Col N="1342" /> Senator Counihan apparently has, we would cut all the trees and would not plant any.  We would not use agricultural land for this purpose at all.  What is the purpose of using agricultural land?  It is only people who have no clear conception of the purpose of the use of land who would talk in that way. Use of the land means that you try to give your people as complete a life as you can.  What do you mean by that? To give them all the things necessary for a tolerable existence.  Timber and the products of timber are almost as important to the enjoyment of a complete life as food is.  It is because there is not a proper appreciation of the relative importance of these commodities I feel that our policy of afforestation is rather slow and limited in its ultimate vision.  It seems that we can bring it down to that net point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our whole attitude to afforestation is, I am afraid, coloured by a lack of realisation of the importance of timber and the forests in the life of our people. It is coloured, too, by the fact that we have made no sort of proper investigation or done no real research into the relative values of land that is used for timber and land that is, so to speak, used for other purposes but that indeed is hardly used at all.  In my own county, where, I think, a forestry man has never set foot&mdash;I do not know; that may not be true&mdash;I know an area in the west end which is a mountain side. It extends almost 10 miles from one town to another town, just on the Border.  The area would be almost a mile deep, so that the total area would be over 6,000 acres.  I do not think there is anything to be seen in it except larks.  There are hares there, but no sheep.  A few cattle get up there now and again and, no doubt, some people have acquired rights there.  My whole feeling about the question of rights, where the State intervenes, is that you limit all your activities by the fact that you are prepared to pay no more than £4 per acre for land on which you want to grow hard woods.  The whole question of individual rights should be dealt with, in my opinion, in this fashion: Have a certain policy from the point of view of the nation of what is essential. If rights have to be extinguished, in order that that policy will come to <Col N="1343" /> fruition, I think the community and the nation would be well compensated in the extinction of these rights by putting a value on the rights, apparently out of proportion to the real value.  I am quite satisfied that if the Minister wants to have a policy of afforestation, he will have no difficulty in getting an immense area of land where agriculture to-day does not provide the barest essentials for the family who own it.  He will have very little difficulty in getting ample land if he is prepared to give such consideration for their rights as will satisfy the people who own that land.  His colleague has had to give it, in the case of the Liffey scheme and the Lough Erne scheme. Rights are being extinguished there in the national interest.  People are being made to pack up bag and baggage. People went away from these areas and they were quite satisfied that they got adequate compensation for their rights. All over the country the same problem is facing you on this question of afforestation.</P>
    <P>We are, apparently, limiting our endeavour because of some peculiar consideration as to whether the area for exploitation would be economic or not.  In order to do that, someone has to put an estimate on what the trees will be worth in 60 years.  Who can calculate what the value of such forests or lands will be in 60 years, whoever lives to see that time?  Apparently there must be some plan like that which is influencing the Minister in not going into certain areas because it is not regarded as economic.  If nothing were done by the nation only what people regarded as financially sound, there are a good many things that would not have been attempted at all. In my view one of the greatest assets the Government could have would be forests.  After our liberty, our spiritual heritage and one or two other things that we must preserve, one of the grandest possessions we could hand on to posterity would be fine forests.  I do not think that the Minister in the Bill, despite the exactness of detail with which he has put it before the House, has given us a policy of such extensiveness as the needs of the situation <Col N="1344" /> demand.  While I recognise that the Bill is the machinery that will enable him to do something more than is being done, I do not think that 10,000 acres a year is a target big enough to set before us.  There are men in the country who can be put on to a job like this.  I recognise that, as the Minister says, there were limitations to the activities of his Department for a number of years because plants and seeds were scarce and most important of all, essential equipment like net-wire was practically impossible to obtain but these things are coming back.  The land is there, the men are there and the equipment will be there. The plants and seeds can be made available.  What we lack is the vision to realise that forests are absolutely essential for our people and the spirit to go through with the work.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is perhaps significant that while the Minister repeatedly told us this Bill would not extend his powers, that he would not produce additional forests or achieve that national reafforestation for which the nation has been crying out for a century, he carefully refrained from telling us the reasons for having the Bill introduced at all.  There is no very apparent reason why a Bill of this kind should be introduced at a time when the Houses of the Oireachtas are cluttered with very important and very impressive measures.  We have the Local Government Bill on the stocks, we have the Public Health Bill and we have had the Harbours Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have had a lot of heavy legislation, and special procedure is now being adopted to deal with consolidation measures which will short circuit all the work done in regard to ordinary Bills.  This is purely and simply a consolidating measure.  The Minister has taken pains to tell us in his White Paper that &ldquo;the Bill does not introduce new principles and does not confer new powers, in any major sense&rdquo;. That is the preamble to the White Paper.  That is the preamble to the Minister's speech to-night.  I thought he delivered that part of his speech more in sorrow than in jubilation. He seemed constrained to give an assurance <Col N="1345" /> that this Bill meant nothing, whereas in fact I feel perfectly confident that the Minister would seriously desire that it should mean something.</P>
    <P>Senator Baxter, of course, is a born optimist.  He thinks that the introduction of this Bill will mean the creation of thousands of acres of forest in Ireland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid he does not, and he said so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator spoke as if he thought he could induce the Minister to plant a forest.  The most extraordinary thing about all this is that the word &ldquo;forest&rdquo; is a foreign word in Ireland.  Who has ever seen a forest in Ireland?  There are a lot of woodlands, of course, a lot of old woods that ought to have been destroyed long ago, but there are no forests in this country and there is no intention that there should be forests.  The Minister has no intention whatever of planting a forest&mdash;the planting annually of 10,000 acres is his target.</P>
      <P>I have been looking up his reports to see what he has achieved in the period between 1932 and the end of March last, a period of 13 years.  The average area planted was 5,562 acres per year.  Now, let us leave out the war years.  It may be complained that during the war years there was some restriction on forestry work; taking the eight years prior to the war, 1932 to 1939, the average area planted was 6,162 acres.  These figures will be found in reply to a question in the Dáil on the 7th February, column 579.  There has been no 10,000 acres ever achieved, and so far as one can gather, the Department is preparing itself for giving reasons that it will not be achieved. This is very sensitive Department, I might remind the House.  Whenever anybody says something unkind about it there is usually an interview with the newspapers or a letter to the Press explaining why nothing is being done and why nothing can be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of these occasions occurred in September, 1943; the then Minister was very upset because of some criticism made in the newspapers about his afforestation policy.  He issued a statement <Col N="1346" /> to the Press, in which he then gave explanations as to why it was so difficult to get anything done.  The present Minister is less sensitive; he does not get excited before his critics; whatever criticism there has been of his Department, he has been prepared to sit down and swallow it.  I imagine that perhaps he believes it was well founded, and he probably agrees with it himself very largely.</P>
    <P>The question of the area planted annually has been raised over and over again.  Nobody knows what area is capable of being planted in this country because nobody has ever made a competent survey to find out what area of land is suitable for reafforestation. Some efforts were made to get information years ago, not by our Government, but by the British Government.  In 1908 there was a Recess Commission, a commission set up by the British Government.  I draw attention to the fact that the Recess Commission of 1908 opens its report in this fashion:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We have become so convinced of the urgent need of measures to deal with the subject of forestry in Ireland that we have made particular endeavours to quicken our investigations and present an early report.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Thirty-eight years ago there was urgency about forestry and forestry methods in Ireland, and a British commission, once in their life, hastened to present a report concerning that urgency.  The report is still there, but the forestry has not yet arrived.  The commission to which I have referred, a very mixed body of people, were able to find agreement on this statement:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The maintenance, directly or indirectly, of an area of woodland sufficient to produce the supply of timber required by the country for domestic and farming purposes, for the development of industry and commerce essential to its prosperity and for providing shelter needed for successful agriculture.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>These were the aims set before us 38 years ago.  The commission on that occasion did say that there should be 1,000,000 acres planted.  Actually in the report they made some effort to show where these areas could be planted.  Of course, that itself was a <Col N="1347" /> watering down of the demand which was very prevalent in Ireland and was a repudiation of evidence submitted to the commission and the repudiation of views expressed many years earlier by competent observers.  We had a Mr. Hull, for instance, who was examined as a witness before the Select Committee on Irish Industries in 1885. He gave a survey in respect of various counties and the area in each which he suggested should be afforestated.  For instance, he suggested 500,000 acres should be planted in County Donegal. The Minister now talks of planting 600,000 acres, apart from some shelter belts, in the whole of the Twenty-Six Counties.  Mr. Hull suggested that 700,000 acres should be planted in Galway alone.  He wanted 600,000 acres planted in Kerry, 400,000 acres in Cork, 360,000 acres in Mayo, 300,000 acres in Wicklow and Wexford and, in the centre area, 400,000 acres.  Altogether 3,200,000 acres for those areas, though there are many areas known to us, known to the Minister, known to myself and known to very many others, in which there is a large part of the countryside suitable for nothing else except afforestation.</P>
    <P>I am not talking of the land that Senator Baxter talked about, land valued at £4 an acre.  I do not for one moment suggest that land of that kind should be afforestated at all.  That is the kind of land which gets foolish people talking foolishly about afforestation. Somebody in the Dáil talked about being able to make land suitable for agriculture if it would be reclaimed for forestry purposes.  That of course is nonsense.  There are in this country very many mountain slopes capable of being planted with trees which are not capable of being utilised for agricultural purposes and which in time will not be available for forestry purposes because the surface will have been washed away unless something is done to arrest the destruction of the surface that is going on constantly.</P>
    <P>I noticed the other day a statement regarding what Sweden has been doing. This is just a small paragraph from a London paper, I think it is the <i>Economist:</i>&mdash;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1348" />&ldquo;Sweden has been relying mainly on her extensive forests to supply her with fuel.  She now uses 1,400,000,000 cubic feet of timber per year for fuel purposes&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The writer calculated that that quantity of timber was produced on a 20 years' rotation on an area of 7,000,000 acres, more than double the total area which the expert, Mr. Hull, to whom I have referred, calculated could be planted in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to the areas under timber in certain other countries.  Senator Baxter mentioned that less than 2 per cent. of the land area of the Twenty-six Counties is under timber.  The actual area is less than 1 per cent., if we talk about woodlands and omit all reference to the word &ldquo;forest&rdquo; which is foreign to us here.  I noticed that the target set himself by the Minister was 600,000 acres; if achieved&mdash;it would take him 70 or 80 years to achieve it, on his present basis of working it will take 110 years&mdash;he will have 4 per cent. of the land's surface under timber.</P>
    <P>Wales, which is no more favourably situated than we are, has 5 per cent. of its land surface under timber; Great Britain, 5.4 per cent.; Holland, no more suitably situated, one would imagine, than Ireland for forestry, has 7.9 of her land under forestry; Denmark, 9 per cent.  These are the smaller countries.  Take the larger countries: France has 18 per cent.; Norway 23 per cent., and Sweden 60 per cent.  Now it will be argued that that is a bad balance, and I would agree at once that it is.  I think it would be a fatal error to suggest that 60 per cent. or 30 per cent. of our land surface should be under timber, but I think it is equally absurd to rest content with 5 per cent. or with 10 per cent.  As I have said Great Britain has 5.4 per cent. of its land surface under timber, but the British Chancellor of the Exchequer in his budget yesterday provided £2,000,000 for afforestation in the next year and that in a set of conditions in which expenditure exceeds revenue by £2,000,000 per day.  We cannot provide £250,000 for afforestation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1349" /> Now let us see what is being done in Wales.  I do not want to hold up the House with too many quotations, but I have here an article written by a well-known journalist.  Many people must be familiar with the name Anne Temple.  She writes sob stuff for the <i>Daily Mail</i>, but in this instance she has written in a paper called the <i>Irish People</i> on afforestation in Wales, in which I think she must be very interested. I want to read this small quotation from her article:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In 1913 Wales had 187,000 acres of woodlands.  This represents about 4 per cent. of the land surface. During the two wars these were seriously depleted.  75,000 acres were planted between the wars but even now there are only about 200,000 acres.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Note the figures; 200,000 acres of the land's surface of Wales&mdash;a quarter of the land's surface of the 26 counties. She writes:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;But plans are rapidly going ahead for very considerable increases. The objections of agriculturists who fear the change over from sheep-rearing to timber-growing on the hillsides are being overcome.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I want the House to note that.  We are not doing much to overcome these objections.  So far as they exist, we are intensifying them.  I think it is a tragedy that instead of going out to the people and telling them the value of forests and the employment they provide, not merely in the planting and growing of forests but in the handling by various methods of the products of these forests when they come to maturity, we are talking about timber as if it was something we ought not to have.  Most people in this country who talk of timber and of woods and forests visualise the planting of a few ill-assorted trees, allowing them to grow for some years and then having them cut and sold off the ground in the round or raw state.  No sensible people act in that manner.  No other country but Ireland disposes of any considerable quantity of timber except in a processed state.  Sweden for instance makes 40 or 50 uses of its timber.  Finland does the same.  Most <Col N="1350" /> countries process timber.  They make it into wood pulp for newsprint, silk stockings or other serviceable things rather than export it in the raw state.</P>
    <P>I picked out recently what seemed to me to be a paragraph conveying a world of meaning in relation to the manner in which Sweden deals with its timber products.  It is in the <i>World Digest</i> for May, 1944, and this is what it says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In Sweden to-day we drink trees, we wear trees, we travel by tree power; trees form our houses and trees provide our heating.... We sleep between trees, and it is said that we even eat trees.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is the position that has been arrived at there where almost every conceivable thing is derived from timber.  All that of course is alien to us because we think of nothing but pit props.</P>
    <P>Senator Baxter referred to the form of employment that could be provided by afforestation.  I want to draw attention to the word &ldquo;reafforestation&rdquo; which is so commonly used in Ireland. It is remembered, as the Minister will probably know, amongst the old people that Ireland was once largely wooded. In the country districts they do not talk about forests or about the planting of trees.  They still talk of reafforestation. In the process of reafforestation the volume of employment could be very great indeed.</P>
    <P>I have been endeavouring to make some calculations from information published in various sources, largely in Great Britain.  There very valuable statistics are prepared and are made available.  It would appear that on a forest of 3,000,000 acres, and I refuse to talk about anything less than that, there would be full-time employment for 30,000 regular foresters.  Assuming that this forest was built up on a 25 year rotation, that is to say with the planting of 120,000 acres a year, it would require the employment of 12,000 men for six months each year, and 60,000 men working in the forest once you commenced cutting.  I do not know how many other people might be employed in the work of processing the <Col N="1351" /> timber, but it would not be an exaggeration to say that if we were using timber for wood pulp&mdash;for newsprint&mdash; that employment might easily be provided for another 60,000 people. Sweden employs something like 170,000 or 180,000 people in connection with her woods, forests and timber industries.</P>
    <P>One of the significant things about some of the avenues of employment that I refer to is this: that forestry work is, naturally, work that would take place in rural Ireland.  It could provide employment in the winter months in these areas in which there is very little employment for men on their small holdings.  Take Donegal, Connemara and Kerry, quite a large number of smallholders in these areas have practically no employment on their land from, say, November until March or April in the following year.  Let us see what it would mean for these men if there was some avenue of employment available to them at their doors through which they might earn £50 or £60 in hard cash during the winter months.  It would provide them with ready money to buy implements, fertilisers and seeds, and thereby enable them to improve their holdings.</P>
    <P>The Minister has emphasised the desirability of obtaining land voluntarily by agreement for the purpose of afforestation.  He pointed out how unsatisfactory it is, from the forestry point of view, if land has to be acquired compulsorily.  I do not share that view.  I think that you can bring it home to the people of this country, especially those in the Gaeltacht where the income from the land is so small and where the bulk of them can live only because they export their children to Britain or somewhere else, that a forest can be a valuable thing, and that it can provide full-time employment for a very large number of the people whose lands would be handed over. Further, when the forest comes to maturity, it will provide the raw materials for industries which, in turn, would afford full-time employment for their children in years later.</P>
    <P>In a country in which the marriage <Col N="1352" /> rate is falling, particularly in the Gaeltacht areas, where it is falling at an alarming rate, I think that is a consideration which should weigh not necessarily with the Minister but with the Government.  There need be no compulsion if the facts are stated by enthusiastic people.  If the position is put to the community, as it should be put to them, I think you can arouse enthusiasm for afforestation, and that you will get land suitable for the purpose as rapidly as you can utilise it.</P>
    <P>Senator Baxter seemed to be between two minds in regard to the compulsory powers in the Bill.  Surely the compulsory powers in this Bill are precisely the same as those in the 1919 and 1928 Acts.  There is nothing new about them.  Senators may believe it or not, but the area of land compulsorily acquired in the last 29 years was 529 acres.  What is the price Senators think was paid for that land?  I am sure most would answer about £4 an acre.  Not at all.  We paid 4½d. an acre for these 529 acres.  That is the afforestation policy which this Bill is going to implement.  According to tradition, I suppose that before we finish with this Bill we will have members getting up and congratulating the Minister on his courage in bringing in the Bill. But that is the fact that we paid 4½d. an acre for the land that we compulsorily acquired for afforestation. Now, there is a large area of land in the country which could be got at less than £1 an acre.  The Minister knows the Duhallow country well.  There are members of the House who know it, and know North Cork very well.  I have been looking up the valuation of land in North Cork, and I want to remind the House that the poor law valuation&mdash;the annual value&mdash;of the whole of the 626,000 acres in North Cork averages 9/- per acre.  Some of it is valued at much more than 9/- per acre.  Therefore, some of it is valued at much less than 9/- per acre.  In the urban area of Mallow, which is within that district, the poor law valuation works out at 24/3 per acre.  On that basis, I think that I am safe in saying that a fair share of land in North Cork would, probably, be valued at 2/6 or 3/- per acre.  A very large area in <Col N="1353" /> South Kerry would be valued at less than 3/- and a large area in Donegal would be valued at 1/5.  That is the value of those lands for agricultural purposes.  For the purpose of afforestation, I suggest that the value can be multiplied a hundredfold, apart from the other advantages that afforestation would bring.</P>
    <P>I ask the House to look at Section 10.  It provides for the setting up of a consultative council.  I want to remind Senators that the same provision was inserted in the British Act of 1919. They provided for the setting up of a consultative council.  The Minister was asked in the Dáil on the 20th February for some information concerning the consultative council.  This is his reply: &ldquo;There was a consultative council appointed under Section 6 of the Forestry Act, 1919, but it ceased to function in 1922&rdquo;.  When the British left, the consultative council, which they set up, ceased to function.  Now, with magnificent cynicism, the Minister rewrites that section back into his new Bill.  It is Section 10 of the Bill.  I think that I need say no more to recommend to this House the adoption of the Forestry Bill, 1945.</P>

      <P>We have had a very interesting debate.  I am grateful to the Minister for having introduced this measure in so non-controversial a spirit.  I am, perhaps, more grateful to Senator Baxter and Senator Duffy for adding to the discussion a somewhat wider point of view than that in which the Minister allowed himself to indulge.  May I say how delighted I am, and I am sure we all are, that Senator Duffy is back again with us after his recent illness?  While I welcome his speech in other respects, I am particularly gratified by it as evidence of his complete recovery. There is not much I should like to add to the remarks of those two Senators but a couple of points have been suggested to me by their comments.  The Minister has, apparently, a somewhat rigid view as to what is economic and what is not economic in relation to land that is considered for afforestation.  I think that the view was expressed that any land that cost more than £3 or £4 an acre is out of <Col N="1354" /> the question for this purpose from the financial point of view.  I should like to say that it is quite impossible to have any rigid definition of what is economic in this connection, because, in the nature of the case, some of the factors on which the definition must depend are unknown, and must, at best, be merely a matter of intelligent anticipation.  You know at what price a given piece of land can be acquired. That is one definite piece of information.  You may be able to estimate what kind of annual return that land is giving as rough mountain grazing or sheep pasture or what not. It is, probably, a matter of a few shillings.</P>
      <P>That is another, more or less, definite figure.  But you cannot now foretell what will be the rate of interest over the next 20 or 30 years and that is a material factor in determining what will be the accumulated cost to the State, at compound interest, of acquiring a given piece of land and afforesting it now.  Neither can you tell with any precision what will be the value in 30 or 40 years' time, or whenever it matures, of the timber which that land will produce.  In that connection, you can, by looking around the world at the approaching diminution of the available timber supply and the increasing demands of industry everywhere for available supplies, anticipate that there will be a long-term upward trend in the value of forestry products.  Therefore, I think that you are justified in concluding that we should be fairly liberal in estimating the probable value to the nation of any land which we can now acquire for the purpose of afforestation. I should emphasise that we ought not to be too rigid in our definition of the price limit above which it is not considered economic to acquire land for this purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill before us is primarily one for codifying certain existing legislation. In that respect, it is, doubtless, administratively useful.  But it is also a Bill full of prohibitions and regulations. The whole tone of the measure seems to convey the suggestion that the Minister and his Department are the only people in the country who are interested in growing trees and that <Col N="1355" /> nearly every person, especially every farmer, is doing everything he can to violate the forestry laws, to cut down trees, in fact, while legally they remain standing because they are cut down six feet from the ground.  I hope that the kind of people who do that sort of thing throughout the country are the exception rather than the rule.  But I do think that the fact that so much emphasis is placed on that kind of policeman work with reference to people in the country shows that we have not got the right attitude as between the Forestry Department and the people generally.  One of the principal things at which we should aim is to create in our people, especially our country people, what I might call a forestry mind, to make them appreciate the potential value of a large extension of the area under trees and to get them to co-operate wholeheartedly with the Forestry Department in bringing about this very desirable result.  I hope that that is, in fact, part of the Minister's policy, but, from reading the terms of this Bill, one would get the impression that the Minister was a policeman rather than a forester.</P>
    <P>It is most regrettable that the Forestry Department has to pitch its target so low as 10,000 acres a year and that its maximum aim should be so low as 600,000 or 700,000 acres all told.  I am quite convinced that there are literally millions of acres now providing a very poor sort of pasture, or producing nothing at all, which would be potentially much more productive to the nation if put under trees and made subject to sylviculture rather than agriculture. One of our principal problems is to develop the sylvicultural mind amongst our people and make them realise that it has equal claims to priority, side by side with the agricultural mind and even the industrial mind.  I should like to see a target figure of 100,000 acres a year in preference to 10,000 acres a year.</P>
    <P>I should like to know what would be involved in the way of finance and in the way of the employment of labour in attempting to afforest as much as 100,000 acres a year?  Is it a physical possibility, from the point of view of <Col N="1356" /> available labour, to put as much as 100,000 acres of land under trees every year?  I am certain it is economically desirable though I am not quite so certain that it is physically possible or that labour would be available to the extent required for such a large-scale programme.  There are many aspects from which forestry has a vital interest for the country&mdash;one of the most important being from the point of view of a full employment policy. Doubtless, many other items would enter into such a programme but the one to which I personally attach greatest importance and regard as having the greatest possibilities, would be an ambitious programme of forestry.  Consequently I think that the matter should be approached from the point of view of maintaining a regular demand for all available labour in the country, especially in the winter-time and in the congested districts where labour is all too pathetically plentiful in winter and work on the land at that period is notoriously scarce.</P>
    <P>I suppose that any large scale programme of afforestation must necessarily be mainly a matter for State enterprise because it is one of those things which will not show its fruits within the lifetime of most adult people who might be primarily concerned in it.  Only the State can take a sufficiently long-term view of a policy like that, which will not yield its fruits for 30 or 40 years.  Even so, I think that it would be well if State enterprise could be associated with private enterprise in this matter of afforestation. After all, nearly all the woods we have inherited and most of which have now been cut down, have been the product of private enterprise.  The people who planted these trees are not any longer there in the same capacity and it is very desirable in the national interest that the people generally who are connected with the land should become tree-minded and should be prepared to co-operate with the State in every possible way so as to increase, not only the number of State forests, but also the number of of privately-owned plantations and forests.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1357" /> In that connection I want to make a suggestion which the Minister will I hope consider and let us know whether or not it is practicable because it may be something which is not feasible for one reason or another.  I welcome the provision in the Bill which makes it possible to assess compensation in anticipation of the date at which the acquisition will become administratively convenient.  I should like to go further than that and to create a sort of financial relationship between individual farmers and the Forestry Department which would get trees planted here and now at the expense of the State but would leave open the question of whether ultimately that plantation would be the private property of the farmer or the property of the State.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the Minister should invite individual farmers up and down the country to give the Forestry Department an option to purchase such portions of their land as are obviously more likely to be productive as woodlands than as agricultural land, at an agreed price, such price not to be paid here and now but merely to be fixed. The next step would be for the Minister or his Department to proceed to plant trees on that land and to fence the land.  The State would naturally employ the surplus labour of the farmer and his family and pay them a standard wage.  The ownership of the land on which these trees would be planted would be uncertain.  It might remain the farmer's property or become the property of the State.  I suggest that then in 20 or 30 years' time, when the trees began to reach maturity, it should be possible either for the purchase of the land to be completed by the State on its paying the agreed price plus compound interest, in which case the State would become the owner of the plantation, or, if the farmer opts to redeem the plantation, let him have the right to buy it back from the Forestry Department on paying the expenses incurred by the Forestry Department plus compound interest.  If that kind of scheme could be initiated it might create a kind of constructive co-operation between the Department and individual farmers. <Col N="1358" /> It would have a most valuable psychological effect.  It might work out that the farmer would say: &ldquo;Heads I win; tails the State loses.&rdquo;  But what does it matter whether the State wins or loses so long as the trees are planted? What matter if the right mood is created as between individual owners of land and the Forestry Department? I hope I have made that idea sufficiently clear.  I think, perhaps, it has been adequately expounded.</P>
    <P>There are one or two other matters to which I want to refer.  It has been said that the Forestry Department is much too keen on planting only the more commercial kinds of timber such as Sitka Spruce and Douglas Fir. Personally I regard Sitka Spruce and Douglas Fir as very attractive but there are people who say that, if the present policy is maintained indefinitely, there will come a time when there will be no oak trees, no beech trees or none of the other beautiful and attractive trees left in the country which are so much a traditional part of its sylvan beauty.  I think it would be desirable if the Minister could mix a little sentiment with his hard-headed commercial sense in his programme of forestry and leave a margin for these less commercially useful but perhaps more beautiful trees, for which future generations may thank him if they still manage to survive.  I refer to what are generally known as deciduous trees as distinct from the various kinds of evergreens which are more important commercially.</P>
    <P>I suppose there is no use in crying over spilt milk but I might mention that we could have come, perhaps, more successfully through the recent emergency if we had a more vigorous afforestation policy 20 years ago.  We might have been able to supplement our sugar rations from beet by getting sugar from trees.  I believe that the Swedes derived a certain amount of sugar from their plantations and that they were also able to get a certain amount of fodder for their cattle from the same source.  In fact there seems to be hardly anything you cannot produce from trees.  The great thing is to have the trees, to have them in adequate quantity and covering a sufficiently large area of our soil.</P>

      <NameTxt>Liam Ó Buachalla</NameTxt>
      <P>The debate so far has been distinguished because of the welcome that has been extended to the Bill, with the one exception, that exception being Senator Duffy, and I should like to join with the other Senators in welcoming it.  The main point that seems to have been made by all speakers has been that we ought to agree to conduct some kind of a campaign to make the Irish people tree-minded.  I think that is a suggestion that we can all most heartily endorse.  Not half enough of propaganda has been carried on, not half enough of inquiry, not half enough of investigation, as to the possibilities of afforestation in the country, have been carried out, to my mind, at any rate.</P>
      <P>The discussion was interesting from another aspect and it was that so many speakers were agreed that we ought to go in for a good deal more compulsion in the matter of acquiring land, compelling people to give up their traditional system of stock and flock raising and agriculture and compelling them to go in for afforestation or to disposses them and let the State take over their land and use it for afforestation. I welcome these suggestions, because it seems that before very long there will not be much reason to accuse the Government of being the only people who are dictator-minded in the country.  Now, in the first instance, I should like to say that I am all for afforestation, especially as a social or national amenity.  There is no doubt whatever of the great advantage that would accrue to the country scenically if much more of the country were covered with trees.  Economically, I do not know what the position is, or is likely to be.  I have heard it said here to-night that the uses of timber are increasing.  Certainly, in many countries there is a hunger for timber. That hunger has arisen, I would say, mainly because of the war and because of the emergency through which we have passed, but to what extent there will be a continuing timber-hunger I do not know.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should not like to hazard a guess but one thing that does occur to me as to the number of industries, with which I have been familiar, is the extent to <Col N="1360" /> which the uses of timber have declined. I have seen hundreds in my own time and, I suppose, taking a somewhat longer period, many thousands of craftsmen, such as coopers, driven out of their business because of the introduction of steel drums and steel containers of various kinds.  I see steel furniture coming in for all kinds of purposes, ordinary household furniture, hospital furniture, office furniture and so on.  I see trains now being constructed of steel, aluminium, alloys of various kinds.  I see a tremendous development in the use of materials like asbestos, plastics of many kinds. I see timber being used in most economic fashion by being converted into plywoods, making a very small quantity go a very great distance.  So, you can argue until the cows come home as to whether there is going to be this enormous increase, this enormous demand, this very great and continuous demand for timber in the years to come.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that in comparison with Finland, with Sweden and Wales, for instance, the position is very unsatisfactory.  The only thing I can say about that is that I am not at all satisfied with the amount of information that has been given to us. The population of Wales is small, the country is small also.  There is such a tremendous proportion of the population there concentrated in the manufacturing towns and cities that the amount remaining in the country is very small and, hence, one can understand the alternative use that has been made of land there.  I think it would be a useful exercise on the part of the people when Ireland is being compared with other countries that we might do so with an atlas in front of us.  Those who look at Finland, who look at Sweden, and at the same time remember the many faults that maps contain, will realise that when area is taken into consideration, position and climatic conditions that ultimately there is no basis, no ground for comparison at all, at least, if you are making a comparison you will have to apply so many details that it is hardly worth while making the comparison at all.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1361" /> I am not saying that I am satisfied with the area under timber in Ireland. I am not saying that at all, but I am saying this: that these comparisons with other countries are, on the whole, not reasonable and that, on the whole, they are very misleading.  I do not know to what extent land is available in Ireland suitable for afforestation.  I have tried in a very limited way to get some idea of the possibilities.  I have gone in County Galway, east and west, to see what has been attempted, to see what has been accomplished.  Certainly, the plantation at Derrydonnell near Athenry is a feast.  It is a treat to see.  When one goes through it and sees the type of land in which these trees are flourishing it fills one with hope.  On the other hand, I have gone through Connemara, gone into what would seem to be well sheltered belts and seen there the remains of trees that were planted not so many years ago and one comes away with a feeling, certainly not of hope.  To what extent these plantations in Connemara have failed because of inattention to the plantations after planting I do not know.  I have heard it said that the work was carried out in a very haphazard fashion and that the failures there are no indication at all of the possibilities of the area.  I have heard it said, for instance, that the young trees were left lying on the various quays there for days with their roots exposed to wind and weather and sun. I have heard it said&mdash;I cannot say whether it is true or not&mdash;but it has been mentioned to me that when the trees, in many cases, were being put down that one would not know the roots from the tops.</P>
    <P>To what extent that is true I do not know but I remember reading very carefully the evidence that was given to the Gaeltacht Commission by the representative of one very big saw-milling company in Galway and I was most favourably impressed by it.  This person seemed to have a considerable knowledge of afforestation and he went to great pains to deal with the development of a number of forests&mdash;I use the word &ldquo;forests&rdquo; for lack of a more suitable one, if Senator Duffy does not mind.  He dealt with the development, <Col N="1362" /> to a considerable extent, of the forests and woods at Ballinahinch, Galway. At Ballinahinch several trees were cut down some years ago and I got the impression from their strength that they must have been excellent trees and that there were very thriving plantations there.</P>
    <P>The other day I went up to see another very extensive wood which has lately been purchased by the saw-milling company to which I have referred.  There, again, one is very much impressed with the success of that wood.  Why trees should grow so successfully and so admirably in these areas and not in others is something I do not understand.</P>

      <NameTxt>Liam O Buachalla</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes indeed, there was some very poor land.  That is something I do not understand but I would like to see some kind of authoritative investigation carried out as to the possibilities of these areas. I am uneasy to an extent about some of the reports that we have got regarding the possibilities of mining in certain areas.  I am uneasy as to their accuracy, and equally so, I would like something in the way of an authoritative report relating to the anxiety I feel in regard to the question of afforestation in areas like Connemara.</P>
      <P>Some years ago at a conference of Muintir na Tíre I had occasion to refer to rural industries and among the possible rural industries I had in mind was afforestation.  I mentioned at the time that we have approximately 400,000 holdings in the country&mdash;some of them I grant very small; some larger&mdash;and I suggested then that if farmers could be induced to plant an acre of their holdings with trees it would be a great advantage.  I can visualise an acre of land accommodating 300 to 400 trees and if a farmer for the purpose of providing a dowry for one of the children would consider putting the least productive acre of his land to use of that kind it would be of enormous advantage nationally and domestically.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was impressed by the suggestions made that a campaign ought to be <Col N="1363" /> launched to impress upon people the advisability of going into afforestation, so that we might be able to get farmers in the country to do more than they have been doing in that regard.  I also am aware of the work that is being done in this matter by certain people.  For instance, Deputy Dómhnall Ó Donnchadha has done an enormous amount of work in the matter of afforestation in his school area.  I think if we could enlist the support of the teachers in work of this kind that we would get somewhere within a reasonable time.</P>
    <P>I would also suggest to the Minister that, in whatever afforestation policy he may formulate, he will consider the advisability that trees should not be planted within a certain distance of the roads.  We frequently suffer from severe storms, and the Galway-Dublin road has, on occasions, been very seriously blocked by trees falling over it.  On one occasion because of the fallen trees it was necessary for me to drive a distance of 250 miles before I was able to get home, although the distance between here and Galway is approximately 132 miles.  Motorists complain very often of that trouble, danger and difficulty.  It will not in any way detract from the value of the woodlands if it is insisted upon that they should be kept back a certain distance from the roadside.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned that a grant of £10 per acre is available for the development of plantations on farms. I do not know whether that is in the Bill or not.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, it is provided in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamOBuachalla" hpid="Liam Ó Buachalla Liam Ó Buachalla">
      <NameTxt>Liam Ó Buachalla</NameTxt>
      <P>I had a note before me suggesting that something should be done to investigate the costs of planting and fencing an acre and to make grants accordingly for the farmers.  I presume, however, that the £10 has been carefully calculated and that it is considered adequate to encourage farmers to undertake work of this kind.  Another thing that occurs to me in connection with the idea of a campaign among the people is that we ought to try to show the people the value and the beauty of Irish timbers. <Col N="1364" /> One institution, if I might call it so, has done a great deal of work in that regard and that is the vocational education system.  In these vocational schools throughout the country students are encouraged to use native timbers and very certainly use them to excellent effect.</P>
      <P>In that regard, I think the Department of Education and the Department of Lands might very well consider the advisability of collecting examples of the woodwork from all these schools and putting them on exhibition in every city and town in the country.  That would serve a double purpose.  It would show the great value of these schools and at the same time bring home to the people the wonderful beauty of Irish timber.  I have seen furniture made from sycamore and it was really a treat to look at.  I do not know to what extent walnut is successful in this country but it occurs to me in connection with the reference made to the necessity of seeing that a certain proportion of hard woods is provided.  I have seen walnut cut in County Galway and worked into furniture and it would bear comparison with the finest walnut ever imported.</P>
      <P>I have not anything more to say in regard to this matter.  I agree with the suggestion that we ought to do more and get the country tree-minded.  I would like to join in the request that has been made to the Minister, that he ought to see if it is possible to calculate what area is available, or is likely to be available, for afforestation in order that we may get a clearer picture of what the programme is likely to be.  I can quite see the difficulties that confront the Minister.  I remember asking the people in Connemara, in fact pleading with them, to give up sheep farming and go in for timber. They did not take the request very well from me, and were glad when I left them.  They were very uneasy lest I should come back again.  That is why I say this is a difficult problem. It is something that will require to be examined with the utmost care.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would be glad if, on an occasion like this, the Minister had indicated to us that it was his intention to secure <Col N="1365" /> a minimum of 1,000,000 acres by a certain time.  I think that he would be fully justified in coming before the Oireachtas and saying that, for purely national and social reasons, he wanted money to get that area afforested.  I think that while we might quarrel with the Minister for looking for the money that, after we had heard his case for it, we would give it to him willingly. That, to my mind, is the only defect in the whole matter, but as I say I can quite understand the Minister's difficulty. Perhaps when replying he may give the House some indication of the minimum he considers he should aim at.  Apart from that I wish to join with the other members of the House in the compliments that have been paid to the Minister for the very exhaustive manner in which he treated the Bill. My only regret is that, while I appreciated the explanatory memorandum that was circulated to us, I did not have the advantage of having before me for a few hours a copy of the speech which the Minister delivered this evening in order that I might be able to take in to a greater extent than it was possible for me the salient points that he made.</P>

      <P>We all agree that the Minister made a fine speech this evening in introducing the Bill, but yet this question of afforestation is such a big one he was not able, of course, to cover more than one tenth of the ground.  The Minister rightly stressed the fact that one of the difficulties in this matter is fencing.  In my opinion, it is rather foolish to introduce the Bill at this period.  It aims at more State forests and more State planting.  There is nothing to prevent any of us from getting out our spades and planting all the trees that we wish.  There are plenty of young trees available.</P>

      <P>The Minister is aware that, in my native county, splendid work is being done by the Forestry Department at Ravensdale.  It is a credit to the Department which has been doing its best there for a large number of years.  Senator Duffy and Senator Baxter are anxious that more trees should be planted.  I would <Col N="1366" /> remind both of them that at 10 minutes past 10 o'clock to-night our Minister for Agriculture will be making an appeal over the radio for the production of more food.  In view of that, I think it is foolish at this time to be bringing forward a Bill of this kind. The agricultural community are suffering under great difficulties at the moment.  This country, and the world generally, are looking for more food.  I think that, so far as the farmers are concerned, we have done our part in producing the food, but now we are told that we are deficient because we have not planted more trees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my opinion what we badly need in this country is a course of citizenship in our schools.  The young people of the present day do an awful lot of destruction.  Last year I was travelling in County Galway and found the direction signs at the cross roads interfered with.  I would not have been able to make my way were it not for the fact that I know the country pretty well.  My point is that it was not the children or agriculturists who were guilty of doing that, but I should say the children of professional or semi-professional people.  We had some talk here this evening about sheep-land at 3/3 an acre.  I remember, away back in 1917, going to the Gaelic district that we have at Omeath where some of us were anxious to get replanting done.  I asked an old woman what she would charge for the land for planting purposes.  She said that the times were not so bad, and that she had been bid £3 10s. 0d. apiece for sheep that she bought in the October of the previous year.  She said that she was not going to allow us to put trees on the land where she had the sheep.  Will Senator Duffy tell me what part of a sheep you will get for 3/3?  If you go to any of the good hotels in the city for lunch, and if one were served with a chop, they will charge you 10/-, and I do not think that the restaurant committee here will give any of us very much mutton for 3/3.  In my opinion the Drainage Act will need to be in operation for some years before the Forestry Department can go ahead with a Bill of this kind. No member of the House should expect farmers to give land, even mountainy <Col N="1367" /> land, at 3/3 an acre for planting trees, particularly if that land is providing good feeding for sheep.  Not long ago I saw sheep, bought for 28/- last October, sold at £4 apiece.</P>
    <P>With regard to the £10 an acre grant for planting trees, there are some special areas around the Collon district in my county where I suppose shelter belts covering 500 or 600 acres could be planted.  The trouble is that it would not suit to have the land planted in complete acre plots.  It would be better to have the planting scattered&mdash; near ditches.  Perhaps in that way the people planting would not qualify for the grant.  In my opinion £25 would not be sufficient for the planting of an acre to-day.  I do not think it would be wise to force farmers to do planting at the present time when they have so many other difficulties to contend with. Speaking for myself, I can say that I have been planting trees all my life. In view of the many changes taking place, such, for example, as the materials now used in building of motor cars, I think that we are not likely to require as much timber in the future as in the past.  I want to assure the Minister that even his bitterest opponents, among them myself, welcome the Bill, but we ask him not to proceed with it too quickly.  I am sure he realises what our difficulties are, and that at the present time the production of wheat, beet, potatoes, oats, barley, <Col N="1368" /> bullocks and sheep must occupy the first place, and the growing of trees a secondary place.</P>
