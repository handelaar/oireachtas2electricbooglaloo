      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>Before we proceed with the business to-day, I desire to draw the attention of the Cathaoirleach to a change made in presenting the Clár.  Originally, on Committee Stage, amendments, termed Government amendments, were put down in the name of a Senator.  We notice that in the Clár received to-day there has been a change made in this regard.  Looking up the Standing Orders of the House we find it is provided:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;All motions to be placed on the Order Paper for any day shall be in writing, signed by a Senator, and shall reach the Clerk not later than 11 a.m. on the fourth preceding day. Amendments to such motions, or to Bills, shall be in writing, signed by a Senator, and shall reach the Clerk not later than 11 a.m....&rdquo;</P>
      <P>and so on.  Members on this side of the House are interested to ask for an explanation as to the cause of the change in procedure in this case.</P>

      <P>On the first point, Senator, Government amendments do not come to us in the name of a Senator&mdash;they come from the Departments. The practice adopted to-day was authorised at a meeting of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges&mdash; at its last meeting&mdash;and we put into operation the altered practice as so approved by the Committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>Am I to understand that when members of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges come to a decision on any matter, that that decision is binding without it coming before the House?</P>

      <P>The Chair will understand that we must be very jealous of our rights, and that it is only right that, when a change is made in the procedure of the House, it should be questioned, and that if there is to be any departure we should know exactly why it is being made.  We should be told the reasons for that departure.</P>

      <P>I am ruling on a point of order raised by Senator Hawkins in connection with the amendment to the Referendum (Amendment) Bill. The Government amendment which appears on the Order Paper is not tabled in the name of a Senator.  It is described as a Government amendment, as so it is, and Senator Hawkins is raising the point that formerly such amendments were tabled in the name of a Senator.  I have just pointed out that the matter can be raised again before the Committee on Procedure and Privileges and also, if necessary, in the House.</P>

      <P>On the section, I do not quite approve of the wording of it.  It provides that &ldquo;where a Dáil election in any constituency is adjourned for the purpose of taking a poll,&rdquo; etc., &ldquo;the Returning Officer, if he is of opinion that, owing to stress of weather or transport difficulties,&rdquo; etc. Should not the section begin with the words &ldquo;Where the Returning Officer, if he is of opinion that, owing to stress of weather or transport difficulties&rdquo; and so on, can adjourn the poll?</P>

      <P>It is purely a matter of definition.  The word &ldquo;adjourn&rdquo; is used to mean that there are more candidates than there are persons to be returned.  In fact, it means that a poll is to be taken.  It does not mean that the election is to be postponed, but rather the taking of a poll according to law.</P>

    <Title>Public Business. - Statistics (Amendment) Bill, 1946 &mdash;Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass) Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>The House is no doubt familiar with the provisions of the Statistics Act, 1926.  That Act gave statutory authority for the collection of statistics.  It required persons who were requested to give information of a particular nature to do so, and it imposed upon the officers of statistics an obligation to keep that information secret to the extent of not revealing to any person, who was not an officer of statistics, details of returns made by individuals or separate firms.</P>
      <P>That restriction upon the disclosure of information secured under the Statistics Act has caused administrative inconvenience in certain cases and the purpose of this Bill is to permit of the disclosure of returns to other officers of State Departments specially authorised to receive it and requiring the information for official purposes.</P>
      <P>At the present time, when statistical information is required relating to individual concerns by a Department of the Government, it is necessary to communicate with the firms for the information, even though the firms may have furnished that precise information a short time previously under the Statistics Act to an officer of statistics. A certain amount of irritation has been caused on that account, apart altogether from the administrative inconvenience and difficulty occasioned. It is considered there is no good reason why the information supplied under the Statistics Act should not be made available within the limits indicated in this Bill to other officers of State Departments requiring it for official reasons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="104" /> The proposal in the Bill is that the Minister will have discretion to permit of the disclosure of that information to such officers where he is satisfied it is required for official reasons.  The officers who receive it will be under the same conditions as to secrecy as the officers of statistics are at the present time.</P>
    <P>In regard to this matter, our legislation is somewhat more restrictive than the legislation of other countries.  A change similar to that which we are proposing in this Bill has been made in the corresponding British statute and the Statistics Acts of other countries permit of the disclosure of information of this character to officers of State Departments where required for official purposes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister give an indication of what he means by official purposes?  For example, statistics are collected from individuals for the purpose of making a general picture?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps it would be better if I give an illustration.  If there was a proposition by a private firm to establish a boot factory and it was necessary to consider whether the production of existing factories was sufficient, then the officer dealing with the industrial proposition could obtain that information direct from the statistics branch without having to go to the Boot Manufacturers' Association or individual boot manufacturing firms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir John Keane Sir John Keane">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope to convince the House that this measure is not so simple or so innocent as the Minister in his statement, or the debate in the Dáil, would lead us to suppose.  Examine for a moment the Prinicpal Act. That Act was drawn entirely for the purpose of collecting statistics and arranging from their collection the compilation of statistics.  So important did it appear at that time that this information&mdash;some of it of a highly confidential or, at least, of a personal character&mdash;would not be spread abroad that disclosure on the part of a statistical <Col N="105" /> officer to any other person, official or unofficial, was an offence.</P>
      <P>In connection with that, let us examine how careful the Oireachtas was at that time to ensure the non-disclosure of that information and to ensure that, even by implication, particulars of an individual might not be disclosed in any subsequent publication.  This is important and I ask the House to realise it.  It has not been adverted to by the Minister in his statements in either House, nor has it been raised in the debate.  Section 13 contains a provision under which, before any information rendered statistically might be published in a form through or by which the party supplying the information might be identified, the consent of that party had to be obtained.  I gather that that section was introduced for this purpose.  There might be only one business of any substantial importance doing a certain trade and the returns might reveal information about that firm.  It was considered important to safeguard that firm and no information could be published without the consent of the firm itself.  What has happened now?  Now it is intended under Ministerial Order to divulge to any person specified by the Minister any information rendered by any citizen without his consent.  In fact, Section 13 is repealed.  Does the House realise that?  Is the Minister alive to the gravity of that situation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Not only may information rendered by individuals be disclosed to specified persons, not merely in aggregate form&mdash; which was the form in which it appeared in statistics&mdash;but in particular form.  If I in business am called upon to render particulars of my stocks, my reserves or matters of a highly confidential character, they can be disclosed to other Departments for what they call administrative purposes and not only to other Departments but, if the Minister sees fit, to commissions, to tribunals and, of course, to the members of those commissions or tribunals&mdash;who, in some cases, have no special or stringent responsibility in regard to the information that they obtain.  It is quite likely that a member of a commission might obtain confidential information by this means about competitors in his own business. <Col N="106" /> I do not say that will happen very often, but I say that will be quite possible under this proposal.  It is most dangerous to pass this measure unless a clause is retained making it necessary to obtain the consent of the party before imparting the information to anybody the Minister may specify.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt the members realise the scope covered by the original Act, that almost any matter can be made the subject of a statistical return and that, once the Minister so specifies, it is mandatory on the individual to provide that information.  I should like the Minister, in replying, to say what has been the practice hitherto.  Has it been the practice to specify by Order all information required for statistical purposes? I understand that, during the emergency, quite a lot of information was supplied voluntarily or at least without there being statutory authority or the necessary Order prescribing that information.  The ordinary citizen who gets a form does not pause to consider or wait to investigate whether it has statutory authority or not, so many people have been filling up forms in the belief that they are mandatory, where, if they chose to investigate the matter, they would find they were only voluntary.</P>
    <P>Let me refer to the heads under which information can be obtained by Order and which, under this proposal, may be imparted to anybody the Minister thinks fit.  We find population; vital social and educational matters&mdash;no one minds that very much; local government, employment and unemployment, emigration and immigration; agriculture, sea and inland fisheries, and industry. Industry might be anything&mdash; you might call upon merchants to render particulars of stocks they have or have had over a period of years.</P>
    <P>Commerce and banking are mentioned&mdash;one might call upon the banks to render statistical information in respect to their reserves, even in respect to certain categories of their customers' business.  We find also the headings: Railways, tramways and ancient monuments&mdash;no one minds much about ancient monuments.  The Minister may be alive to the dangers, but he has made no references to them <Col N="107" /> in his statement in either House, and I certainly think this Bill should not pass unless it retains the protection that no information rendered by an individual should be disclosed to anybody outside the statistical branches without his or her consent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrederickSummerfield" hpid="Mr. Summerfield Mr. Summerfield">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Summerfield</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a short Bill and I am sure every member of the House would like to give the Minister any facilities he feels are necessary to cover up any defects that have manifested themselves in the past in relation to any statistics.  Senator Sir John Keane is to be complimented on exposing the danger of the very wide powers now to be conferred on the Minister in this very small and, as the Senator puts it, innocent-looking Bill. In the past few years, we have given the Minister's Department all the information sought by him&mdash;highly confidential information was given in the belief that it would go straight to the Statistics Department, where that all-important element of secrecy would be maintained.  Frankly, I am alarmed at the wide scope of the powers now sought.  The wording of the only paragraph of the Bill which really matters states that this information may, at the behest of the Minister, be given to any committee, commission or tribunal of inquiry set up by the Government.  We have tribunals for all sorts of things and anything that can be called a tribunal does not necessarily command the respect of the very people who are now to be placed at the mercy of that tribunal, if the Minister so wishes.</P>
      <P>The Minister might wisely reconsider the phrasing of this Bill and so word it that he will get the powers which are desirable for administrative purposes yet not leave open in the Bill itself those wider powers.  Otherwise the charge will be levied that it may make available to Jack and Jill confidential information which was given only in strict confidence.  Senator Sir John Keane has stressed in detail what I would wish to say.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill may have the reaction that people will hesitate to give the information desired for the purposes of statistics.  It is said that that information can be extracted legally.  It cannot. <Col N="108" /> Unless the people from whom the information is sought co-operate wholeheartedly, the figures may be entirely misleading.  In regard to the wide application of the Bill, I must express the same degree of criticism as has been voiced by Senator Sir John Keane. It is dangerous as it is and the Minister would be well advised to remove the danger that has already been emphasised.</P>

It may not be quite as innocent as it appears on the surface and I know there are Senators not yet present who would probably feel the same about it.  As Senator Summerfield said, it might tend to undermine the confidence the people have in making statistical returns at present.  If they were to feel that they did not know what the Minister might do with them, they may not be so willing to co-operate. Section 2 (2) opens a very wide door regarding the method by which the Minister may disclose such information.  It seems to be perfectly possible for him to pass on certain valuable tips to the Revenue Commissioners, which might help them in making the collection of income-tax more efficient.  They have their own very effective methods of getting confidential information and it would tend to undermine the happy relations now existing between industry and the Minister, if business men felt the Minister were likely to work hand in glove with the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
      <P>The Minister mentioned in the other House that this Bill makes a similar change in legislation to that recently enacted in the British Parliament.  Is the fact that there is a precedent for it in the British Parliament really a very convincing argument to us?  The people on the other side definitely have gone very much further in the direction of a State-controlled economy than we have and they are definitely going very much further in that direction than we intend to go, in spite of the recent visit of the Dean of Canterbury.  That being so, I do not think it is necessary in accordance with the spirit of our régime that we should copy Britain, in this particular matter at any rate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="109" /> I do not attach any importance whatever to the fact that the British have decided to pass such legislation.  At the same time, I readily admit that it is awkward for the Minister to have certain information in one branch of his Department, given confidentially, and have no access to it for any purpose whatever, that it must be confined exclusively to the knowledge of the statistics officers.  Consequently, as he pointed out, he has to write a second time to certain business men and others asking them to repeat, not confidentially, certain information which they have already given in making their statistical returns.  That is, perhaps, the only point of any substance in connection with this matter. I should be willing to go so far as to suggest that there should be some modification of the original Act which would enable a blank to be included in each statistical return so that there could be a declaration somewhat on these lines, &ldquo;I have no objection to the Minister using the above information for the general purposes of his Department&rdquo;, or, &ldquo;for the general purposes of public administration.&rdquo; That would be signed by the person making the return.  If that were included in the ordinary statistical returns which are being asked for, I think that it would meet 90 per cent. of what the Minister really wants and avoid some of the objection to this particular Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I often think that people who come here to write books to explain Ireland are to be sympathised with.  The Minister belongs to a Party which calls itself a Republican Party and one of his points is that the British have recently passed legislation similar to this.  Then, the British precedent is made little of by the representative of Trinity College.  It is rather difficult to ascertain where exactly we hope to get.  This Bill&mdash;whatever its merits and whatever its defects&mdash;is typical of a particular tendency which we have often noticed here.  It is offered in all good faith by the Minister in order to remedy what he calls, as he has so often done before, administrative inconvenience.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="110" /> That is to say, the Civil Service, in doing its job, and the Minister in doing his job, find it inconvenient that, at a particular moment, they do not know all about my private affairs or, what would be more important, the private affairs of Senator Summerfield or Senator Sir John Keane or of a boot factory.  In order that they should get over that, they propose to pass a very far-reaching, enabling measure which will give the Minister power to get particular information about particular people at any time he likes for a purpose which he deems to be a good purpose. I should like the House to get hold of that.</P>
    <P>The Bill is, of course, offered in complete good faith.  It should be stated that statistics heretofore have been collected from the people for the purpose of providing a general picture and never for the purpose of making a particular statement about a particular individual or firm.  One sees particulars about the brewing or boot industry but one does not get specific information. The specific information given has always been regarded as secret and the officers of the statistics branch have been bound&mdash;and have religiously and meticulously observed the obligation&mdash; not to disclose to anybody&mdash;Minister or other person&mdash;the particular information furnished.  There may be need, and, as the State takes on extra functions, there is no doubt, need for some modification of that; but what has happened here is because administrative inconvenience has been experienced, complete discretion is being given to the Minister.  For example, the Minister may, if he thinks fit, order particular information to be disclosed to all the members of a tribunal.  I do not want to pass criticism of any kind on members of tribunals.  I have nothing but admiration for people who give their service, without remuneration, to these tribunals.  But take the Vocational Organisation Committee, which the Minister has criticised very sharply in this House.  He described their report as a slovenly report and he was critical of it generally.  The commission was drawn by the Government from various classes of the community and various types of people.  Evidence was voluntarily given before it, and on that <Col N="111" /> evidence, together with the most excellent and enlightening statistical returns drawn up by the statistics branch, that commission made certain recommendations. It would be possible, under the present Bill when it becomes an Act, to direct that certain particulars in the possession of the statistics branch be revealed to that commission.</P>
    <P>The answer which will be at once given by the Minister and which would be given by any other Minister&mdash;this is not a political matter; it is a question of what Ministers do once they get into office&mdash;is that he would not give any such instruction unless there was grave reason for it and unless he had the greatest confidence in the commission. In other words, whatever you reveal now on one of these forms is at the mercy of a Minister's discretion. Let us say that every member of this House has absolute and complete confidence in the discretion of the Minister. That may not be so but let us assume that it is.  The Minister passes. This Bill remains as an Act and you are at the mercy of whoever the Minister happens to be.  Some of us might have complete confidence in the discretion of the present Minister.  Some of us&mdash;not necessarily on this side of the House&mdash;might not have the same confidence in the discretion of some of the Minister's colleagues.  That is an axiom.  You are going to be completely dependent on the discretion of a Minister as to whether he will reveal, in consequence of specific information, particulars of a firm which are in the possession of the statistical branch. You come to the point which you meet so frequently in this class of legislation: you must wholly trust the Minister. That is a position which we should avoid if possible.  Whether any modification of this Bill in Committee could achieve that, I am not sure.  I have not studied the Bill from the point of view of putting down amendments. While the Bill is another example of a general tendency, it is also a rather dangerous thing and it might have the effect which Senator Summerfield mentioned of making the people rather chary of giving information.</P>
    <P>The point made by Senator Johnston as to the use of the information for the <Col N="112" /> purposes of the Revenue Commissioners is an obvious one.  I am not much afraid of that.  The Revenue Commissioners have a scheme for doing their own jobs which nobody can improve very much.  I do not think that they need much assistance.  It is in other directions that the matter is important. For example, is the Minister himself an authorised officer in all cases?  When an officer of the Minister's Department gets information about boot factories, to take the example which the Minister gave, what use is it to him if he does not reveal it to the Minister, because it is, eventually, the Minister who must make up his mind as to whether or not he will allow a factory to be established in a particular place?</P>
    <P>That is to say, the Minister, who is a politician in charge of the Department&mdash;being a politician myself, I use the word descriptively and not in a derogatory sense&mdash;gets information about a particular person's business. That may be inevitable in the modern State, where the Government interferes in so many matters, but it is another example of getting away from the general picture and an example of how the State and its officers enter more and more into the life of the individual. Instead of making general regulations with which one must conform, they go to a particular individual, find out all about him and make a decision in a particular case.</P>
    <P>As a general principle, I am against that but I admit that, in the case of this Bill, the Minister is not inspired by unworthy motives.  He is endeavouring to carry out a particular kind of work in which he is interested and he is not particularly concerned as to what principles he infringes when getting that particular job done.  This Bill is, however, very wide.  It goes very much farther than the Minister says, and it is a weapon which Ministers in this Government and succeeding Governments can quietly operate.  It has been our experience that, when Ministers say they want to get power for a specific purpose, they always choose to get wider powers than they require at the moment.  They themselves, or their successors, use those powers in the widest possible way.  This Bill is <Col N="113" /> evidence of a very bad tendency.  In Committee, we may be able to suggest an amendment which would improve it, but I do not share Senator Sir John Keane's optimism that we shall be able to persuade the House to accept such an amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill raises issues of very considerable importance and it is proper that they should not be lightly dismissed by the House.  The case has been very well put, so far.  I hope the Minister will not be too intolerant or impatient of those who want to keep him in rein while he is very anxious to get his point carried.  I find myself in a position half way between the Minister and the extreme represented by Senator Sir John Keane.  Our statistical service is one of the most important in the State.  It is well organised and the work is well done.  Sometimes I am inclined to be critical of the true worth of the returns that are made but Senator Hayes and other Senators have said that they regard the work of the statistical branch as an attempt to give us a picture of the life of the country, generally.  We must all agree that our statistical service will be called upon to a much greater extent in the future than it was in the past to present us with a picture on which we can base policy.  When we get such a picture of the country, we shall have to ask ourselves whether we are satisfied with it or not.  We have to ask what reforms, on the basis of the story presented to us, are necessary in order that life may be improved.  To a certain extent, that is what the Minister is seeking to do in this Bill.  In so far as that is his aim, no member of the House will stand in his way.  The point he makes is a very good illustration and what we have got to do is to set our minds to discovering how this can be brought about and the Minister facilitated without depriving citizens of the protection which they are entitled to expect if they place certain vital information at the disposal of the State with a view to enabling it better to regulate its business and shape its policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with those who say that to place information of any particular business freely and openly at the disposal of a commission or tribunal without consultation with the individual <Col N="114" /> who presented that information is to go too far.  It is one thing to transfer information from one section of the Minister's Department to another or from one Department of State to another Department of State, but it is quite a different thing when a commission, sitting either in private or in public, can have made available to it statistical information which has been passed on in secret to the Minister's Department.  That case must be met by the Minister.  I know that the Minister can quote the end of the section and say that a member of a commission or tribunal who discloses such information will be liable to a fine of £50 or six months' imprisonment.</P>
    <P>I was on a commission not very long ago on which there were 23 members. Senator Ó Buachalla was my colleague on it.  The Minister would need to have another branch of the Service hot on the heels of a commission such as that, with 23 members, if something were disclosed.  The disclosure might not be very important in the view of the members of the commission, but to the individual firm or businessman who presented the information it might be all-important, and it would be very difficult to trace the person who disclosed the information.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister will have to provide some safeguard in regard to the passing on of information where that information comes into the possession of a committee, a commission or a tribunal.  I think it is very probable that, where the information was going to pass from an officer in one Department to an officer in another Department, no member of the Seanad would see any great reason for raising an objection, but if the information is to pass through a group of people, sitting in public, then it is an entirely different matter.  I think that the Minister has a case to make so far as that matter is concerned.  I know there is a very definite objection on the part of a great many people to make disclosures of their business, but there is the other consideration, that State policy and national policy, in so far as it is wise, have to be determined in relation to facts both for to-day and for the future.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="115" /> We all know that those facts are very largely based on figures and on statistical information.  The Minister, of course, is wise in looking at the sort of picture that these figures present when he is framing his future policy, and ought to get what assistance he can in that regard.  I am all for that, but, as I say, it is quite a different matter when some of this information can be made available in a way that I do not think the Minister can control.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Summerfield, if there is a fear on the part of members of the trading community, industrialists or even the banking fraternity that something which they disclose is likely to be made public in a way that they never anticipated, then they are going to hesitate, and the Department may not get the truth, so that in the end its statistics will be not only faulty but quite useless.  I think that the Minister should take that into account.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>I think this debate has served a very useful and, perhaps, interesting purpose.  Notwithstanding the misgivings of Senator Johnston, it has shown that the visit of the Dean of Canterbury has not been without effect in that it has given us a united front in which the landlords, if I may so respectfully refer to Senator Sir John Keane, the industrialists and the intellectuals from our two rival universities are agreed in defence of property.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to know that the rivalry has disappeared.  The interesting part of the debate is, of course, the emphasis which has been laid on the need for preserving the secret doings of property owners. There is not the slightest uneasiness in the minds of Senators when the interests of the private individual, the poor and the unprotected, are at stake. I remember public men in this country, including Ministers, reading documents from public platforms which had been secured for them by the secret service organisation, and nobody in this House <Col N="116" /> protested or said a word about it. Now, when there is a proposal to make use of information secured officially regarding the activities of industrial undertakings, there is uneasiness lest that information should be made use of, except within very narrow limits.</P>
      <P>It is notorious that we have less material available in statistical form than most of the countries that one associates with modern progress.  For instance, if one takes up <i>The Digest</i> one can read in it a list of the private incomes of the film stars in Hollywood. I do not know how that information is obtained, but I assume it is revealed by the revenue authorities in that country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is correct to say that the revenue authorities in America give the amount of income of every important person in the States. Is not that well known to everybody?

      <P>I have no doubt Senator Hayes would be delighted to have it recorded if he was earning £50,000 a year, but the people here who are making £50,000 a year do not want it to be known.  The people who are making substantial incomes out of smuggling and blackmarket activities do not want that information to get through to the statistics branch of Industry and Commerce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know whether there is any need to get excited about this proposal at all.  Personally, I do not see any need for it.  I am rather inclined to think that anybody who takes an interest in social welfare, or in any form of development in this country, would welcome any proposal which comes before the House to enable the Government's statistical department to obtain the fullest material for the purpose of presenting to the public and to this House information which will <Col N="117" /> enable us to judge the efficacy of the legislation we are passing here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>But why not have the facts?  I would prefer to have the truth rather than have people making bad guesses.  But all this is hardly relevant to the discussion.  There can be no serious suggestion that a civil servant who obtains material from a colleague in another Department is going to publish that material simply because he gets it from somebody else.  If an officer in the Department of Industry and Commerce, associated with statistics, gets a set of figures to-morrow in relation to some particular business, he examines the figures and makes use of them for the purpose of his Department. Suppose he is transferred next week to another Department and has reason to use these figures for another purpose, is it suggested that, because he was transferred from one Department to another, he immediately starts to divulge the information committed to his care?  I do not believe a bit of it.  I think that this discussion is being carried on in a most unrealistic manner.  We either trust the integrity of the civil servants who are entrusted with this duty or we do not.  If we do not trust them, let us say so, but this is not the way to meet a problem of that kind.  If we do not trust the civil servants, then we should set up some machinery which will get us a Civil Service organisation that we can trust.</P>

      <P>What is the objection then?  The objection as I see it is that information which is obtained for a particular purpose is going to be divulged if you pass this Bill.  Now, I do not think that is true.  The fact that you authorise, or require, a civil servant to hand over to a colleague certain statistical information which is being supplied to him by a particular firm, or even by a bank, does not suggest that that is something that is going to be abused, or that that person is going to hand out the information to the rivals of the person from whom it was obtained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can understand, in part, another objection that was made by Senator Sir John Keane.  He goes very far in his anxiety lest the reserve funds of the banks should be divulged.  That, in his view, is a most serious matter.  If a civil servant is going to ask the Bank <Col N="119" /> of Ireland what funds it has in reserve, and what amount of money it holds in respect of deposits, where the owners have passed away, then we are to assume that that is a most serious matter.  I think it is in the public interest that that information should be made known.  I can see a Minister&mdash;perhaps not the present Minister for Industry and Commerce&mdash;in charge of statistics, who would request that that information should be made available not merely for himself but for the public.  So far as I am concerned, I support the Bill wholeheartedly.</P>

Is cinnte go bhfuarthas mionlochtaí anseo agus ansúd air, ach ba mhion-lochtaí iad.

      <P>I find myself far more embarrassed by Senator Duffy's defence of this Bill than the criticisms of the Senators who preceded him.  If this were the Bill that Senator Duffy was talking about, I would vote against it myself.  There is nothing in this Bill which alters in any way the existing powers of the Minister for Industry and Commerce to obtain information, and its enactment will not result in any variation in the type or scope of the statistical data now published.</P>
      <P>Senators said that this Bill is not as innocent as it seems.  Let me assure them that it is as innocent as it seems. Any criticism of it that was expressed here seemed to me to be based largely upon a misunderstanding of its terms or apprehension as to possible abuse of the powers given to the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  There is nothing in this Bill which provides or contemplates that information given by individual firms under the authority of a statistics Order will be spread abroad.  That phrase was, I think, used by Senator Sir John Keane.</P>

      <P>Neither does the Bill provide that such information will be placed freely and openly at the disposal of tribunals, as Senator Baxter suggested.  It does not provide that such information will be placed freely at the disposal of public tribunals or commissions sitting in private.  All, in fact, this Bill proposes to do is to widen the class of persons known as officers of statistics.  Senator Hayes asked if the Minister for Industry and Commerce is an officer of statistics.  In fact, it is the Minister who, under the law, collects, compiles, abstracts and publishes information.  He may use for that purpose officers of statistics who are defined in the Statistics Act, 1926, as &ldquo;every officer in the Civil Service and every other person who is for the time being employed in or about the collection, abstraction, compilation or publication of statistics&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>There is nothing in the Act which prevents the disclosure of returns by one officer of statistics to another.  I am proposing that that class of persons who are so described as officers of statistics under the Act of 1926 should be widened to include specified persons who are officers of the public service and who, in the Minister's opinion, require that information for the efficient discharge of their official duties.</P>
      <P>There is no suggestion&mdash;I want to refute any suggestion&mdash;that information available to officers of statistics will be freely available to anybody.  It can be made available under this measure only to persons specified by the Minister in an Order or by a direction given by him in which he names certain persons who are officers of Government Departments, or officers of commissions of inquiry and who, he believes, should have that information for the proper and efficient discharge of their duties.</P>

      <P>Or members.  When Senators talk about tribunals of inquiry, they are forgetting that the Bill refers to commissions and tribunals set up by the Government or under State authority and in all such cases these commissions or tribunals have full powers to require the furnishing to them of information; they have power to send for persons, documents <Col N="123" /> and papers and have them produced before them.  There is, in fact, little being added by this Bill to the powers of commissions or tribunals to obtain information.  There may be some shortening of procedure by which information may be made available to officers or members of a tribunal, but not every commission or tribunal can avail of the statistics service, and information available to the statistics branch can be given to these tribunals only when the Minister is satisfied that it should be given and only when he designates the persons to whom it should be given. No person can publish that information to anyone else.  If any persons do so, they commit an offence and are liable to a fine or imprisonment.</P>
      <P>I have not found that at any time there was difficulty in securing from the firms who furnish the information under the Statistics Act similar information when required by the Department of Industry and Commerce or any other Government Department for another purpose.  Frequently, however, I have got indignant letter from heads of business firms asking me to explain the incompetence of my Department in writing to them in the month of November for information concerning their consumption of coal or electricity when they had already furnished that information to the Department the previous month, ignoring the fact that they had furnished it under a statistics Order and the information thus furnished could not be revealed by officers of statistics to anybody in any other branch of the Department.</P>
      <P>The powers utilised during the emergency to obtain the returns to which Senator Summerfield referred were, in many cases, those conferred by the Emergency Powers Act, and under the various Orders for the rationing of goods or the control of supplies made under that Act.  There was an obligation on persons to give whatever information was required concerning stocks of goods or the disposal of goods.  Ordinarily, the only powers which the Government has, to require the furnishing of information, are those given by the Statistics Act, and the only other means is to request it from the persons who possess it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="124" /> Neither is it correct to say that the Minister can demand from private firms any information he may wish to have.  The information which can be secured under the Statistics Act is set out in the Statistics Orders made by the Minister for Industry and Commerce and placed on the Tables of the Dáil and Seanad.  Senators can inspect them from time to time and see the nature of the information required Information is abstracted from the individual returns and compiled and published in the various official Statistical Reports.  It is not proposed that any information concerning an individual firm should be so published.  The only additional class of persons who will get the information are those who will be specified by the Minister.  The difference is very slight.  The Minister has the power to get that information now under the Statistics Act.  He has the power to utilise, in getting that information, persons who come within the definition of officers of statistics as set out in that Act and we are adding to their number only those whom he may specify, who must be officers of a State Department, or commissions or tribunals set up under State authority who require the information for the purpose of official duties.</P>
    <P>I think there are no grounds whatever for any assumption that these powers will be abused now or at any time in the future.  There is more reason for concern and more justification for querying the necessity for this Bill on the ground that there may be a mistaken belief in the minds of business people or other individuals that the information which they give under the authority of a statistics Order may be used to their disadvantage at some time or in some way.  That is important. That was the consideration which delayed us in enacting in our legislation this modification&mdash;which was made in British legislation, not by the socialist friends of the Dean of Canterbury but in the year 1939 by a very Conservative Government then in office in that country.  We have fully appreciated that this alteration in the class of persons to whom information might be disclosed might create the mistaken idea in the minds of some people that they would be at some disadvantage in <Col N="125" /> giving fully and frankly the information requested from them.  I should like to do what I can to remove any such impression that may have been created by speeches here to-day.  First of all, there is no ground whatever for the belief that the information secured under the Statistics Act will be of value to the Revenue Commissioners. They would regard as milk and water the powers of the statistics branch of the Department of Industry and Commerce for getting information.  They have far more drastic powers under their own code and do not have to resort to the statistics branch for information they require for the purpose of their official duties.</P>
    <P>In this country, there is more difficulty in the handling of statistics than in other countries, as many industrial operations are carried on by single firms only, or by a limited number of firms.  That is true of all small countries, as distinct from the larger States.  When queries are made either in the Department or in public concerning the production of such goods as cement, motor car tyres or beer, it is sometimes difficult to give the information without disclosing particulars concerning the affairs of individual firms, as there may be only one firm or one very large firm and a few small firms, or only two firms.  Any such disclosure would permit of information concerning the production or scope of activities of an individual concern being ascertained.  It is not intended, however, under this Bill that there should be any change whatever in the present system of disclosing information to the public, in the nature of the information to be disclosed to the public or in the powers of the Minister to give more detailed information in official returns.  The additional powers which are being conferred are confined solely to the disclosure of the information to other officers of the Department who require it for official purposes and who are themselves bound by the secrecy provisions of the Statistics Act just as definitely as officers of statistics have been in the past.</P>
    <P>I did not refer to the British Act solely for the purpose of justifying this Bill.  I was anxious, however, to make <Col N="126" /> clear that we are moving here now only as far as most other States have moved long ago.  The British Act as such was not a recent amendment of their Census of Production Act, but was made in 1939, and goes much further, in permitting the disclosure of information concerning individual concerns, than we are proposing to effect here. It is not altogether correct to say that this Bill is being enacted merely to convenience the Civil Service.  It is important for the efficiency of public administration that this Bill should be passed.  It is, I think, also a convenience to business people that they should not have to be requested repeatedly to furnish the same information to the same Department.</P>
    <P>Generally, I think it could be said that there are advantages of many kinds and no disadvantages whatever in the enactment of this measure.  I do not think it has ever been suggested, since the British Act was passed in 1939, that in that country there have been any abuses under that Act, that any private firm, suffered by reason of the powers given to the appropriate authority there, to permit of the disclosure of information concerning their affairs to other Government Departments or Government commissions and tribunals.  I think that any apprehensions which have been voiced here, as to the possible effects of that disclosure upon the interests of individual firms or as to the efficiency of the procedure adopted to keep the information secret, are not soundly based.  The Bill is, in fact, as innocent as it appears to be and I would urge Senators not to regard it in any other light.</P>

      <P>As Senators will have noted, the intention of this Bill is to enable Bord na Móna to provide facilities for the sale of liquor at some of their turf camps.  It is intended to permit the board to sell beer and stout to their workers at such of their camps as are situated at a distance from suitable licensed premises.  Senators are, no doubt, aware that most of the bogs to be developed, under the scheme which was outlined in the White Paper circulated in connection with the Act recently passed, and, indeed, many of the bogs at present developed by the board, are in isolated areas.  It is desirable that the camps should adjoin the bogs in all cases.  It has been found by experience that the lack of facilities for obtaining refreshment and recreational opportunities which are usually available at centres of population imposes a real hardship on men living in those isolated camps.  That position is likely to be intensified as these camps are established in more remote localities.  As Senators can well imagine, community life of itself is irksome to most of the workers and we think that everything should be done to provide for their ordinary needs. Particularly during the harvesting season, their work is very heavy and it is unreasonable to ask men who have done hard work from dawn to dark on a turf bog during the harvest season, to walk four or five miles, or more, for a drink at the end of the day. The provision of these facilities will be a considerable contribution to the contentment of the workers concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to make it clear that the powers which the House is asked to confer on the Minister for Industry and Commerce by this Bill will not be used at random.  I indicated in the <Col N="128" /> Dáil that it will be a condition of the grant of a licence to the board or to an officer of the board to sell drink at a turf camp, that the camp should be situated at a distance from a suitable licensed premises.  If there is a suitable licensed premises within a radius of, say, two miles from the camp, then a licence will not be given.  It is not desired that there should be a conflict with existing private trading interests. There was a suggestion that the sale of drink in the camps should be let by contract, that private trading firms should have the opportunity to obtain that business.  I did not agree and would, in fact, strongly oppose any such suggestion.  I think it is desirable that, if there are canteen facilities provided within the boundaries of the camp, they should be provided by the board through its officers, under conditions which they think it reasonable to impose, and that the element of private trading for private profit should not be introduced.  If the licences for the sale of drink were let out by contract and private firms operating for private profit were engaged in the businss, their concern would be to sell as much as possible and make the business as profitable as possible.  I think it is far better that, if facilities have to be provided, they should be provided by the camp authorities under such restrictions as they think will not conflict with the maintenance of proper conditions in the camp and the general welfare of the workers.</P>
    <P>Arrangements will be made to ensure that the general conditions applying to the licensed trade in the locality, including the hours during which liquor may be supplied, will be observed. These hours will not be exceeded, but may be less than the hours during which licensed premises may open.  It is the intention of the board to confine the facilities at their camps to the sale of beer and not to extend them to the sale of spirits; and, generally, to make provision as limited as, in their opinion, will serve the purpose they have in mind.</P>
    <P>The device which the Bill provides for the issue of licences to the camp superintendent or canteen manager employed by the board effectively <Col N="129" /> secures that there will be no proprietary interest in the licence.  It will be held by the board's officer <i>ex officio</i> so long as he is in charge of the camp or canteen.  If he loses that post for any reason; if he is disemployed, promoted or transferred to some other position in the board's service, then the licence issued to him will be cancelled and another licence will be issued to his successor.  In that way, no proprietary interest whatever will be created. When the bog becomes exhausted and the camp can be closed, the licence can be cancelled, also, without difficulty.</P>
    <P>The procedure adopted in this Bill is based somewhat upon the precedent of the Act passed here to permit of the sale of intoxicating liquor at airports. Under that Act, licences are issued by the Revenue Commissioners on the certificate of the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  That is the device adopted here.  The effect of that device is to change the procedure set out in the Licensing Acts for the issue of licences, but otherwise it is intended that this Bill will form part and parcel of the whole licensing code.  The intention would be that no person, other than those resident in the camp, would ordinarily be served with liquor at the camp canteen, but an exception might be made in the case of officials of the board going to the camp for supervisory purposes or other persons attending at the camp, in the company of officials of the board, for business purposes. Ordinarily, however, sales will be permitted only to residents of the camp&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose we shall be going on business.  I feel sure that the House will agree with the purpose of the Bill&mdash;the provision of limited facilities at camps in isolated areas where a number of workers will be congregated for whom the opportunity of obtaining a drink at the end of the day will make for general contentment. The procedure adopted in the Bill may be open to question but I think that it is the most practicable in all the circumstances. A great deal must be left to the determination of the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  I have <Col N="130" /> used the term &ldquo;suitable licensed premises in the vicinity of the camp&rdquo;.  I want to make clear that I could not avoid inserting the adjective in that sentence.  If facilities suitable for the number of workers resident in the camp are provided by private traders in the vicinity of the camp, a licence will not be given.  If there is a suitable premises within a radius of about two miles, a licence will not be given. The camps at Newbridge or Edenderry would not require wet canteen facilities, because licensed premises in the vicinity of the camps are available. It would be in respect of camps distant from any town, with no licensed premises in the neighbourhood, that licences would be issued.</P>
      <P>If it is agreed that facilities should be provided at those camps, then, I think that the method proposed in the Bill is the most suitable.  It ensures not merely that there will be proper supervision of the conduct of the canteen but that the board will be able to take steps to provide for the operation of the canteens within their camps in a way not detrimental either to the comfort or convenience of workers who do not want to avail of the canteen and in a way which will not affect the general efficiency of the board's operations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The House will generally agree with the principle upon which this Bill is based&mdash;that there should be adequate facilities for men employed in the turf camps in the way of wet canteens.  With that principle in regard to camps situated in isolated areas, I am in agreement. Apart from anything else, where there are adequate facilities, there is less tendency to abuse.  When facilities are adequate, excess is less likely than when people have to adopt hole and corner methods to get what they want. While I entirely agree with that principle and, because I agree with it, will support the Second Reading of the Bill, I am afraid the case made by the Minister was one for a Bill which is not the Bill before us.  The case made by the Minister&mdash;a very proper case&mdash;was in respect of a camp at such a place as Sheean, which we visited on an excursion during the year.  There were <Col N="131" /> no facilities within a reasonable distance of that camp.  My objection to the Bill is in respect of the device utilised to make it operative.  We, on these benches, have frequently said that one of our real anxieties is the manner in which more and more power is being drawn from the courts to the Executive.  This is another example in a small-way of the manner in which the power of the court to stand as arbiter as between the private individual and the all-powerful State is being removed and is being put into the hands&mdash;I do not say this in any offensive way&mdash;of unknown civil servants.  We all appreciate that Ministers cannot personally act in every matter which comes before their Departments.  The function of the court in any democracy is to serve as a weighing-scales and secure that, as between citizen and citizen, there will be fair play and that, as between the State and the citizens, there will be the same fair play.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister could have achieved, as I hope to persuade him on Committee Stage, what he wants in another way, without cutting across the function of the courts.  It is common knowledge that some establishments here have a great many branches.  There are all over the city licensed premises belonging to the same company.  The court recognises that and grants to the managing director of the company concerned the licence, which he holds for the company and appoints himself manager of the several premises.  The same procedure could have been adopted here.  The managing director of Bord na Móna could have been permitted to make application for the licence and to proceed in the same way. I know that the Minister's objection to what I propose to suggest will be that there would be frequent changes.  If that device were adopted, there would not be frequent changes.  It is not a new device.  It is the principle underlying the Intoxicating Liquor Acts. Instead of proceeding as set out in Section 2, it could be provided that the Circuit Court, instead of the Minister, would have to be satisfied as to the necessity of the licence.  The population of Crumlin, for example, is growing day by day.  It is the Circuit Court which <Col N="132" /> must be satisfied that, as a result of that growth of population, there are not sufficient facilities for the sale of intoxicating liquor and that a transfer of a licence from the older part of the city may be permitted.  Why should not the Circuit Court be satisfied by Bord na Móna that there are not adequate facilities in respect of a particular camp?  Why should Bord na Móna be put in a special position?  Why should not Bord na Móna satisfy the court that it would be right and proper that a licence should be given in respect of a camp at Sheean, that licence being given to the managing director of Bord na Móna, who would appoint a manager of the canteen?  In that way, you would not be cutting through the Intoxicating Liquor Acts.  You would be giving local, private traders an opportunity of going into court and making the case that there were already sufficient facilities provided by private enterprise near that camp and that it was not necessary for Bord na Móna to set up a canteen. It would be for the court to stand fairly between the public enterprise of Bord na Móna and the private enterprise of traders and make a decision. In that way, you would give more satisfaction to local private traders than is possible under the Bill as framed by the Minister.</P>
    <P>In Kildare, private traders have spent a great deal of money in recent years in enlarging and extending their premises in order to provide facilities for men coming to the turf camps near them.  It would be only reasonable that these traders should be given the opportunity of saying in open court that they were already providing facilities for the men at the camps.  The objection could not then be raised that they had not got an opportunity of stating their case.  The precedent quoted by the Minister I do not regard as entirely parallel.  An airport is not in the same position as a turf camp. There will not be many airports. Because of the necessity for space, these ports will be miles away from the premises of private traders.  The people to be provided for may be birds of passage.  That is not a correct parallel with the turf camps which have been erected.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated, for the first <Col N="133" /> time, that no spirits would be sold in those camps.  That is not contained in the Bill.  If that had been provided for in the Bill&mdash;Senator O'Dea will agree with me in this&mdash;the licence could have been limited to that of a beer dealer.  The Bill provides that not only beer and stout but also those drinks which go by the description &ldquo;hard&rdquo; should be provided by the canteens of Bord na Móna.  I just want to stress the fact that I am in favour of proper facilities being provided, but I think that the manner in which the Minister is ensuring that does not give a fair chance to the individual who has already an established business of showing that he is providing facilities, and of having his claim in that respect determined by an independent person such as the Circuit Court judge.</P>

      <P>I have some knowledge of this business and I think that the Bill, in its general layout, is quite all right.  What I am anxious to know is what facilities or amenities will be provided for the men in the camps who do not take intoxicating liquor.  It is likely that there will be very many young fellows employed there.  Will facilities be provided for them to get a cup of coffee or a cup of tea with a sandwich?  I should also like to know if a hall will be provided for amusements, so that the men in the camp can have an opportunity of playing cards or other games.  I think it would be a very good idea if that were done.  The Minister has been very fair in not interfering with established businesses, where they exist.  As I have said, I hope that amusement facilities will be provided and also refreshments for those who do not drink beer or stout. It is important that young people should be able to amuse themselves at night.  Otherwise, life in the camp would become very monotonous for them.  If amusements are provided for them, then they may not spend very much of their time in the canteen, and that, of course, would be all to their benefit.</P>

I know that there are many people outside the House who are very <Col N="134" /> uneasy about it for fear the proposal it contains might throw unnecessary temptation in the way of such young people as Senator Honan referred to. I should like to be assured that whatever facilities are provided for those young people will be in a place that is completely separated from what one may call the ordinary wet canteen. There should be a place provided for those who do not wish to take intoxicating drink, a place where they can amuse themselves or, perhaps, take a bottle of lemonade or coffee or tea. Otherwise, there might be the danger for some of those young people who would go into the canteen, not for the purpose of taking drink but for the sake of being in company and for a bit of conviviality.  Steps should be taken to see that there would be no need for them to do that.  I would urge that a place should be set apart for them which would have no connection with the canteen, a place where they can enjoy themselves and, as I have said, get a cup of coffee or a cup of tea.  I was pleased to hear that spirits are not to be sold in this canteen. I hope that my suggestions with regard to the men in the camp, whether they are young or old, who do not take drink, will be carried out and that they will have a separate place in which to enjoy themselves.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Johnston</NameTxt>
      <P>For once in a way I find myself thoroughly in sympathy with the measure proposed by the Minister.  I think that life in these turf camps must be pretty grim, and it is only right that the workers should have every amenity to cheer them in their somewhat lonely occupation.  I think it is quite absurd to pretend that the ordinary individual does not like a drink occasionally.  Most people, I think, are convinced that a reasonable amount of Guinness, or other drink, is good for one.  I think that the method proposed in this Bill is one which not only solves that problem, but, perhaps, gives a headline for an approach to it on a wider basis.  In particular, I welcome the proposal that the element of private profit is, in this case, taken out of the sale of alcoholic drink.  I would like if it were possible to apply the same principle to the sale of intoxicating <Col N="135" /> liquor generally.  However, that would carry me beyond the scope of this Bill.</P>
      <P>I think it is in order to refer to a precedent, in connection with this kind of proposal, which occurred in England. I am not against referring to British precedents when I think they favour a course which I personally approve. During World War No. 1 there was a munition establishment somewhere in the neighbourhood of Carlisle.  The whole operations of that concern were thrown into chaos by reason of the fact that there was excessive drinking going on, which resulted from the fact that there were too many publichouses there which had a vested interest in encouraging excessive drinking.  For the sake of public order and to promote efficient work, the Government of the day had to take control of the drink traffic. It had to do so in the form of establishing its own canteens for the sale of intoxicating drink to the workers.  In that way it did away with all the social abuses associated with excessive drinking there.  I believe to this day these publichouses are still functioning under public control and are doing useful social service.  I wish the same principle could be applied to the sale of intoxicating drink generally.</P>

      <P>There may be a good argument against this Bill, but if there is we have not heard it so far.  I was amazed to find Senator Sweetman, a public representative, as I suppose he is coming from a bog area and finding fault with the Bill.  He suggested that this was wrong with it and that was wrong with it, and that, because certain people had spent a certain amount of money in improving their premises in the County Kildare, therefore no reasonable argument could be put up for providing these canteens.</P>

      <P>If you keep twisting a little more you will soon be around to our point of view, and perhaps that would be good for the country.  The suggestion has been made that, under the provisions of this Bill, private property and vested interests are going to be interfered with.  Anybody who knows anything is well aware that the people who are responsible for the running of these bogs are not going to look for trouble.  As the Minister has pointed out, no canteens will be set up where proper facilities are available locally.  The Minister mentioned a radius of two miles.  To my mind that radius of two miles is somewhat on the generous side.  It is a little bit too far to expect a man to walk after a hard day's work if he wants to have a drink in the evening.  However, the Minister's statement was not too definite, and I take it that, unless adequate provision is made within a radius of two miles, he will allow a canteen to be set up on the bog.  I did not interpret the Minister's statement as indicating that no spirits will be sold in the canteens.  I think some Senators did say that no spirits will be sold there.  I am inclined to think that, if workers on the bog want spirits, they ought to be able to get them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Listening to the speeches made by Senator Johnston and other Senators one would imagine that the men working on the bogs were somewhat different from the people who live in our cities and towns.  I think I know as much about those working on the bogs as most other members of the House.  I can say this, that the general run of people working on the bogs are as well able to take care of themselves as any of the people living in our towns and cities are.  If a reasonable argument can be put up for preventing the men working on turf production from getting any kind of intoxicating liquor which they may <Col N="137" /> desire, then the same argument can be applied to the people in the towns and cities.</P>
    <P>To my mind, until we have a definite drive to bring about a state of prohibition in this country no reasonable argument can be put up for preventing the men on the bogs from getting a drink if they want it.  I would say that probably 49 per cent. of the men on the bogs would want to have a pint or, perhaps, two pints of stout in the evening after their work, but suppose there is someone working on the bog who, because of stomach trouble or other ailment, feels that he should not drink stout&mdash;his doctor may have ordered him not to drink it&mdash;why should he be prevented from having a half of whiskey if he wants it?  There may be 19 out of 20 who would prefer the pint of stout, but a man of the type that I speak of should be able to have his half of whiskey if he finds that it is better for him.</P>
    <P>A good deal can be said in favour of the argument put forward by Senator Miss Pearse that suitable provision should be made for those who do not want to take intoxicating drink.  They should be able to get a cup of coffee or a cup of tea.  I have no doubt that those in charge of the camps will make suitable provision in that regard.  Members of the House who made a tour of the bogs about 12 months ago had an opportunity of seeing for themselves the provision that is made in practically every camp for amusements.  Halls are provided in which concerts are held and in these concerts the workers themselves participate, and their efforts are quite commendable.  I would like to stress this, that the men who are working on the bogs are not the wild men that they are supposed to be.  They are quite well able to look after themselves.</P>
    <P>I think it is quite necessary that the facilities to be provided for workers under this Bill should be provided.  As regards certain camps, where local publichouses were available practically beside the camp, it was nothing unusual to find that men wanted to go to those particular camps rather than to those which were five or six miles away from a publichouse.  I think there is something in the suggestion that if a man has to travel four or five miles for <Col N="138" /> a drink he may feel that he should do himself well, so that instead of taking one or two drinks on one night he may decide that it would be as well if he took enough drink for two or three nights.  In that way abuses could take place.  On the other hand, I believe that, if drink were available in a canteen at the camp and if a man knew that he could get a drink when he felt he wanted one, there would be no danger whatever of abuses taking place.  I think the abuses in such cases would be few and far between.  I think the Bill serves a useful purpose, and that it should have the wholehearted support of the House.  I can quite understand, of course, that people should have doubts as to what may happen in certain circumstances, but if the board is to be responsible not only for the running of the camps but for placing a man in charge of each camp, then I feel sure there will be no reason for complaint.  For these reasons, I think we should give the Bill our wholehearted support.</P>

      <P>Every time he launches into a debate in this House, Senator Quirke reminds me of the man who heard that somebody said something about him, and who waylaid this poor, unfortunate man, jumped out from behind the fence and hammered him for saying that something which, probably, he never said.  That is Senator Quirke's technique; that is the kind of approach he makes in reply to Senator Sweetman's very reasoned and fair examination of the Bill.  There was no necessity for Senator Quirke to get so hot and bothered&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and to pretend there were certain arguments against the Bill. There never were.  Whatever opposition there was to the Bill it came from Senator Miss Pearse, who sits behind Senator Quirke, and she made her case in a calm, reasoned way.  Most of us have been to the bogs and we know what they are like.  We want the work there to continue to progress.  I am quite convinced that you must make the conditions for the men as <Col N="139" /> tolerable as possible.  Senator Sweetman did not oppose this Bill at all. He says it is quite reasonable that these men should have certain facilities provided for them.  He said nothing against the men working in the bogs. I do not know to whom Senator Quirke was replying.  There was nothing said about the men, and the Senator need not try to be their champion when there is nobody talking against them.  The Senator should improve his technique in this respect in the future.</P>
      <P>It is only right that a Bill of this type should be fairly examined. Senator Sweetman made a case which, I think, is quite reasonable.  His suggestion was that it is not the Minister who should have the authority to grant the licence&mdash;that that should be done by the Circuit Court judge. Senator Quirke did not deal with that point at all.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Quirke carefully and deliberately avoided dealing with it.  Nobody objects to Bord na Móna getting a licence to serve intoxicating drinks and nobody suggests they are not competent to supply this service. There would be general agreement that it would be more conscientiously done by them than if it were handed over to private enterprise.  What is objected to is the method by which they are to be given this authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know that there is any comparison between the case made by the Minister with regard to the airports and the case made for these turf camps.  It seems to me that the Bill is so wide you could have these premises anywhere, in Cavan or Mayo, even apart from the bogs operated by Bord na Móna.  I see nothing in the Bill that would prevent me getting a licence for a hut in a bog in Cavan, if I could get around the Minister.  Perhaps some of the lawyers in the House will clear up that point.  I do not see Bord na Móna mentioned anywhere in the Bill, and perhaps the Minister will explain why that is so.  I believe there should be some reference to the bogs operated by <Col N="140" /> Bord na Móna, to whom this authority will be given.</P>
    <P>Senator Sweetman makes the case that where a permit is to be granted for the establishment of a wet canteen, if we may so classify it, the people who have an interest in the sale of intoxicating liquor in the area ought to have an opportunity of going to court and making a case there as to why there should not be an extension of licensing facilities in that district. A number of us in the House have experience of applications for new licences in certain districts and we are aware the clergy of the district have gone into the court and given their views as to why the licence should not be granted.  I have knowledge of such an application before a Circuit Court in my county, and a licence was refused in a very wide district where it could well be argued that there were no facilities.</P>
    <P>The Minister, later on, and perhaps Bord na Móna, may have to meet a kind of criticism that may not be fair because of the procedure that will be adopted in giving this authority to the Minister.  I seriously suggest it would be much sounder from the point of view of the status of Bord na Móna to alter the procedure so that it would be open to anybody and everybody who can see objection to this being done to go to a court and make a protest.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister is justified in taking this step.  I am quite satisfied that some men working in a bog will take a bottle of stout or a pint of beer if they can get it, and some will not.  It does not matter whether the temptation is near or far, if men do not wish to take it they will not be tempted.  But, if men take it and have to go a long distance to get it, they will take more when they go there than if it were close to them.  They will probably stay out at night, will not get proper rest and will not be as efficient next day, and probably next evening they will be off again and their capacity to work will not be nearly so good as if this extra travel were not put upon them.  Then again, they are not a good influence amongst the other workers.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="141" /> Psychologically, this is a much better approach to the whole problem.  These men are isolated and the work can only be done in isolation.  You must make the conditions as tolerable as possible. That would be my defence of the step the Minister is taking, but I cannot make a defence of the methods he is adopting.  I believe that, under the Minister for Justice and through the procedure in the ordinary courts, this authority ought to be given to Bord na Móna and, from every point of view, that will turn out to be the much more satisfactory way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasForan" hpid="Mr. Foran Mr. Foran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Foran</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister in earnest when he says that the people working on the bogs cannot get spirits?  My reason for asking that is that pubs are notorious places for leprechauns and spirits are an aid to seeing them. Where are the profits from these canteens to go?  There is no provision made in the Bill in that respect. I am entirely in favour of the Bill, but, so far as these licensing facilities are concerned, there will be a very definite profit and, when that profit is made, who is to benefit by it?  Is it the consumer or the camp in general?  I would like some information on that point, because I think it is important.</P>
      <P>Reference has been made to the facilities already provided for camp workers and, as one of those who had the pleasure of going around the camps, I must say I was very pleased to see the facilities provided for the enjoyment of the workers and particularly for sports in all these camps.  Judging by what I saw, there is a very high standard of sport, and amusement facilities generally, among these people.  I do not know that the setting-up of a canteen, where these people can get a normal amount of drink, will in any way hamper efficiency in the sports field or in the field of work.  I think it will help in both cases and, consequently, I am in favour of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not in favour of Senator Sweetman's attitude to the Bill.  He seems to be concerned mainly with bringing grist to the lawyers' mills. He complains that the Minister will have power to license these facilities for canteens.  I think he ought to have. <Col N="142" /> I do not think it ought to be within the power of anybody in the neighbourhood of a pub to oppose the setting-up of these facilities in a turf camp, thus putting everybody concerned in providing a facility which is desirable and necessary, to enormous expenditure. I hope the Minister will tell us what he intends to do with regard to the profits which will accrue from the setting-up of these canteens on the bogs.  I believe the workers themselves should derive some benefit from these profits.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HelenaConcannon" hpid="Mrs. Concannon Mrs. Concannon">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Concannon</NameTxt>
      <P>Before Senator Foran rose to speak, I was about to ask the Minister what will be done with the profits.  I would like to make the suggestion that these profits should be earmarked for the benefit of the workers and should be utilised in providing amusements and other advantages for them, such as billiard tables and, perhaps, a library.  I certainly think that Bord na Móna should not be permitted to take any profit out of these canteens; they should not be allowed to keep the money, as would happen in an ordinary licensed business, and I suggest it should be earmarked definitely for the benefit of the workers.</P>
      <P>I am in favour of this Bill and I do not think the Minister has any great need to justify it.  It arises logically from our attitude towards prohibition. We do not believe in prohibition.  We believe in temperance and we believe spirituous liquors are not diabolical things at all.  It is the abuse of them that is the trouble.  If we can train our people to a right use of spirituous drinks, we will be doing a good day's work.  I believe strongly in that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I expect that there was some misunderstanding in supposing that whiskey would not be sold.  Whiskey is a very wholesome drink.  I do not drink it myself, but I believe that good whiskey is a very good thing, in moderation.  I am reminded that when I was a girl there was a man working for my family and he took his whiskey neat.  When someone thought it would be a good thing if he were to mix it with water he said that he would not do so; he had an iron stomach and the water might rust it.  For that reason <Col N="143" /> he drank his whiskey neat.  We gave him good whiskey and he lived to a ripe old age.  I have nothing to say against whiskey.  I think whiskey is a very good thing, if taken in moderation, and if these camps contribute to our taking a right view of intoxicating drinks, I feel they will be playing a good rôle in the education of our country.</P>

      <P>Every fair-minded person will agree with the idea at the back of this Bill, that is, providing the people engaged in the laborious work of turf production with facilities for getting a drink at the end of their day's labour, without having to travel a long journey.  But the method of approach seems to be far more laborious than is necessary.  I do not see why private enterprise should not get an opportunity to cater for the workers in this matter as it is allowed to in the case of other undertakings. For instance, private enterprise looks after various social functions, such as race meetings, dances and other gatherings. If licensed traders were given an opportunity of tendering for these canteens on the bogs, the successful contractor would have to carry out his duties as a publican and obey the provision of the ordinary licensing law. He would be responsible for supplying all kinds of drink, soft and hard, and he would also have the responsibility of providing light luncheons, teas, coffee or bovril for such of his patrons as are of a temperate turn of mind. I think that would be a solution of this matter and it would give the licensed traders an opportunity of competing. Without doubt, the best or the most reputable trader would be selected and the idea at the back of the Minister's mind would be carried into effect without drawing Bord na Móna into the licensed trade.  I thoroughly approve of the idea behind the Bill&mdash;to afford facilities for refreshment to men engaged in this necessary work&mdash;but I think that the method of approach is wrong.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kehoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no intention of opposing this Bill.  I am very pleased with the way in which everybody has received it.  That is very flattering and <Col N="144" /> I should hate to strike a jarring note. I am not interested in the legal jargon as to how the Bill will be put into operation but I should like to say a few words&mdash;they will be very few&mdash;as to the principle behind the Bill.  This is a Bill designed to make it more easy for the turf workers to get refreshments after hours of work and to allow them to get such refreshment in proximity to their place of work.  A two mile limit has been mentioned.  The fact that they would have to walk two miles would not be a bad thing, because, if they over-did matters, they would have sufficient time to walk the effects off.  I question whether enabling them to get liquid refreshment on the premises will make for temperance.  As we are providing facilities for people to get more drink, I should like to plead, with others who spoke on the question, for amenities for those neglected members of the population known as teetotallers. I plead that amenities &ldquo;without overflowing, full&rdquo; be provided for those who do not take drink as well as for those who must have a drink after their day's work, whether it does them any good or not.  The teetotallers should be provided with facilities equal to those provided for consumers of intoxicating drink and they should be provided with a place apart from the canteen.  &ldquo;The means to do ill deeds make ill deeds done.&rdquo;  Young fellows coming into the turf camp from the country should be afforded opportunities of engaging in their particular recreation without being subjected to the temptations of the canteen.  It is a peculiar thing that those men who are described as &ldquo;hard&rdquo; should need a drink after their day's work.  It is quite possible that they do need it but it is also a fact that a teetotaller suffers a very heavy handicap as compared with the man who drinks even moderately. We all know that a teetotaller is never forgiven any lapse; he is supposed to be impeccable.  The other man, who is &ldquo;hard,&rdquo; is forgiven everything and we are told that the poor devil could not help it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I may seem to be a kill joy or &ldquo;pussy-foot&rdquo; but I cannot stomach some of the arguments on this Bill. Nevertheless, I am not to be taken as opposing the Bill.  Far from it.  The <Col N="145" /> freedom of the subject demands every possible mark of respect.  But my gorge rises when I think of all those Bills which have been implemented and added to simply for the purpose of making the task of the &ldquo;hard&rdquo; man easier than it is&mdash;and it is easy enough in all conscience.  Everybody bows the knee to Baal.  I do not want to be butchered to make a topers' holiday or anything like that but I ask the Minister to see that amenities are provided for teetotallers equal to those provided for the others and that they should not be compelled to frequent the canteen where beer or spirits are sold.  Incidentally, the contradistinction between beer and spirits leaves me cold.  I do not see why the frequenters of these canteens should not be permitted, as in the case of Timothy, to take a little wine for their stomachs' sake.</P>
    <P>I join with Senator Miss Pearse and Senator Mrs. Concannon in asking the Minister to make things as pleasant as possible for the teetotallers in those camps, commensurate with the exigencies of the situation, because they will have to contend with many temptation.  Their case is hard enough without being subjected to extra temptation.  Perhaps I spoke a little more strongly than I had intended to, but I hope that my remarks were germane to the issue.</P>

      <P>Listening to previous speakers on the subject of interference with private enterprise and on the method of applying for these licences, I came to the conclusion that they did not realise where these canteens are to be situated.  They had in view, I think, that these camps would be situated adjacent to thickly-populated areas where private enterprise in the intoxicating liquor trade exists.  The bogs I know in which work is proceeding and the bogs which are to be developed are very far removed from areas of this kind.  The bogs where it is proposed to apply for licences are situated in what one might describe as a wilderness.  There should be no danger whatever of interfering with private enterprise, because private enterprise could not exist in those areas.  In the case of one bog where <Col N="146" /> it is proposed to set up a camp, it would, probably, be necessary to go to two or three district justices to get a licence in the ordinary way to open a public house.</P>

      <P>The owners of the few licensed premises within a radius of 20 miles could claim that they were near enough to the bog about to be developed, and they could engage solicitors and counsel to oppose the application for a licence.  The suggestion has been made that we are making facilities available for intemperance. I do not agree any more than I would agree that a man who removed from a town in which there were few public houses to a town in which there were a larger number would be under greater temptation to become a drunkard.  I agree with those speakers who have said that workers who go to those camps are entitled, if they so wish, to have facilities for refreshment. These camps will provide cooking facilities, dining halls and recreation halls, and it is only natural that those men who wish to have a drink in the evening, or at any other time, should have the facilities for obtaining it.  I do not think that that would lead to any greater excess than at present. The only serious opposition, if I may so describe it, to the Bill has been offered on the ground that the legal profession are not given the opportunities they might have if the present system of applying for licences were continued.  I think that the Minister for Industry and Commerce, who is responsible to this House for the functioning of Bord na Móna, is the proper person to grant these licences.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree with Senator Foran or Senator Hawkins that Senator Sweetman's opposition was due to the small loss that would accrue to lawyers because it would be unnecessary to make application for a licence in court.  The amount which lawyers receive on such an application is very small.  There is, probably, more spent on advertising the application than the solicitor gets for supporting or opposing it.  I am against Senator <Col N="147" /> Sweetman's idea.  He is looking at the interest of the local publicans.  The local publicans are getting trade which they never expected, owing to the setting up of those camps.  It must be remembered that no licence can be granted for the sale of intoxicating liquor unless the house was licensed on or before the 1st October, 1902.  Therefore, all those licences were granted before there was any idea of developing those bogs.  Accordingly, these houses have got an influx of custom which they never anticipated.  Even though licences are granted for the sale of beer and porter in the camps, these traders will get a good deal of that custom.</P>
      <P>There is another reason why it should be unnecessary to make application in court.  The work is seasonal and lasts only during certain months.  The licence is, therefore, different from the ordinary licence, which runs from the 10th October to the 10th October the following year.  Application for a licence in the ordinary way is, therefore, entirely unnecessary and it is much better that the Minister should have the power he seeks.  As he says, he will not give a licence unless the camp is situate, at least, two miles from a publichouse.  I am not so sure about going so far as that but that is his intention, and it is, probably, right.  I am very glad that there is no intention to sell whiskey in the camp.  If people are working hard and want a drink, I think that beer or porter provides much better refreshment than whiskey and leads to less drunkenness and fewer rows.  It is rarely that there is a fight when people drink porter or stout. Some people must fight when they drink whiskey and it would be very undesirable if that were to occur in the camps.</P>

I think that the Minister's idea is the right idea&mdash;to keep the people in question from travelling distances and drinking too much.  It has been suggested that the walk home <Col N="148" /> might do them good but they might not be able to walk and, if they cycled, they might constitute a danger to the public.  I like the idea put forward by some Senators that amusements should be provided.</P>
      <P>I would like to see a gymnasium in every town and think it would be a very good thing.  Billiard tables are very good, but a gymnasium would be better, as there would be more scope for a greater quantity of amusement at a particular time.  That would keep the people away a good deal from the drinking establishments that may be set up.

      <P>I think it is true that there is no opposition to the purpose of the Bill, which is to permit of wet canteen facilities at isolated turf camps.  There is some objection to the method of establishing them, but the objections seem to be more theoretical than practical.  It was suggested by Senator Sweetman that it would not be necessary to provide for the issue of licences to the camp managers, that we could arrange to issue them to the managing director of Bord na Móna. That is not excluded by the Bill and might, under certain circumstances, prove to be the most desirable arrangement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The licences will be issued not in respect of persons but in respect of premises, and the Minister must retain discretion as regards the premises. The necessity for retaining that power to grant or refuse a licence is to enable effect to be given to the undertaking that the power will not be utilised so as to interfere unduly with legitimate private trading interests. We could, no doubt, have arranged for the granting of a licence for these turf camps by the district justice.  Personally, I do not see the sense in that. Surely this House is as competent to decide this issue as any other tribunal that could be established?  Under the licensing Act, the district justice is given powers of decision, but there are limiting provisions in those Acts and the House has decided that public policy requires that no new licences <Col N="149" /> should be issued at all, except in certain circumstances, the existence of which is to be decided by the justices. That is not the case here.</P>
    <P>We in our wisdom can decide that it is desirable that, where a number of workers are congregated at isolated camps, there should be wet canteen facilities, and if we decide that we are to have them, why should we not just proceed to arrange accordingly, without going through some procedure in the courts?</P>
    <P>Senator Baxter said I mentioned a number of factors that will apply in regard to the issue of licences that are not set out in the Bill.  That is true, but if we were to attempt to set out everything, the Bill would be a very elaborate measure indeed.  I do not think it is worth while doing that. This is a very small change in the licensing laws.  Senator Sweetman looks at me to convey the suggestion that we are establishing a precedent. I do not think we are.  I regard this as a small change, and think it is unnecessary to include all the elaborate provisions which would determine the manner in which the Minister would use his discretion, with all the safeguards that would have to be inserted, in view of the fact that we are providing for camps, the location and the number of which has not yet been decided.</P>
    <P>Many Senators have spoken as if they did not fully appreciate the problem.  There are, it is true, some existing camps located in towns and for the workers in those camps all the recreational facilities of the towns are open to them.  But there are camps situated miles away from any human residence, much less from any town facilities.  Someone has described a desert as &ldquo;miles of sweet damn-all&rdquo;. That is all a bog is.  If you contemplate &ldquo;miles of sweet damn-all&rdquo; and a turf-camp in the middle of it, you realise the problem of making life tolerable for the bog workers in these camps.  It is unreasonable to require them to march miles to get a drink if they want it.</P>
    <P>This matter of catering for workers in isolated communities or for soldiers in barracks is one upon which mankind <Col N="150" /> has had thousands of years of experience. All that experience suggests that it is wiser to give facilities for obtaining drink at canteens in the camps or barracks, than to require the soldiers or workers to go in groups&mdash; as that is how they will go&mdash;over distances to get that drink elsewhere. In that way they are more likely to take more and if they take too much they are a far greater menace to the public than ever they would be within the confines of the camp or barracks.</P>
    <P>I have said I would not issue a licence in respect of any bog premises if there were available within the vicinity of the camp suitable licensed premises.  I want to emphasise the limitations put upon that word &ldquo;suitable&rdquo;. Senators must think of a camp which will house some 300 or 400 workers, perhaps, at all times, and perhaps up to 700 or 800 in the harvesting season.  The fact that there is one public house of the usual type at the country crossroads in the vicinity of the camp would not, in my opinion, justify the refusal of a licence to the Turf Board.  Such a public house would not ordinarily be able to provide reasonable facilities for the many hundreds of workers seeking them.  If there is a town within a reasonable distance, as there is in regard to many of the existing camps, then I think a licence should not be given.  If there is not such a town or if there are only unsuitable facilities or no facilities, then a licence should be given.</P>
    <P>I think Senators also misunderstood the fact that these camps are residential camps.  Senator Ruane spoke of the advantage of giving the licence to licensed traders, in that they not only provide drink but also light luncheons. I do not think any of the bog workers I saw would eat light luncheons.  These are residential camps and the heavy meals they require are provided already by the board.  The board makes no profit out of the existing canteens but has a substantial loss and is likely to continue to make a loss in the provision of canteen and recreational facilities, as well as board, for the workers. If there is any profit made out of the sale of drink, it will go towards the provision of those general facilities.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="151" /> There is something to be said for providing for the sale of liquor at a portion of the premises which is separate from the place where non-spirituous drink is available.  At these existing camps there are facilities for tea, coffee, milk and minerals, and they will continue to be available at all camps.  I will bring to the notice of the board the suggestion of Senator Miss Pearse and Senator Honan that the sale of drink should take place in a different part of the camp.  However, in many cases the design of the premises would not make a sharper separation practicable.</P>
    <P>I have said it is the intention of the board to confine the canteens to the sale of beer and stout.  I think that is desirable.  There will, of course, be some stock of spirits kept but ordinarily they will not sell them.  Someone said there are three kinds of whiskey and one of them is &ldquo;fighting whiskey&rdquo;.  I think it would not be desirable to encourage the sale of spirits unduly at these turf canteens.  The normal requirements of the workers will be met by stout and beer and most of the country public houses I have encountered in my day have rarely got drinkable spirits in stock.</P>
    <P>Senator Baxter said that, under the provisions of the Bill, I could give a licence to anyone to run a public house in a bog.  Remembering my description of a bog, if he wants to apply for a licence, I might consider giving it to him, on the understanding that there is no one living within five miles, and if anyone does come to live there, his licence will be cancelled.  I do not think there will be many applications under that heading.</P>
    <P>I submit that the Bill is a minor measure designed to meet the obvious need of the Turf Board and that its enactment will greatly facilitate the workers in the matter of recreation and will make for their contentment, which I regard as being desirable.</P>

      <P>I do not think it would <Col N="152" /> be possible.  The Senator will appreciate that we could put in a provision requiring that there be a partition between the portion of the canteen where intoxicating drink is sold and the parts where it is not sold, but then there must also be some obligation to inspect the camps and enforce those conditions.  It is provisions of that kind that I am anxious to avoid.  I think we can leave this to the discretion of the directors of the Turf Board. They will be much more concerned than we are to see that there is no abuse of the facilities as they are primarily concerned with keeping the workers efficient and getting the bogs worked efficiently.  Therefore, we have reason to assume that they will take every possible precaution both in relation to the construction of the premises and the instructions to the managers to see that there is no abuse of the facilities.</P>
