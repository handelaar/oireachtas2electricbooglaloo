    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Johnston</NameTxt>
      <P>In continuing the debate on this Industrial Alcohol Bill, I should like to say that I approach the Bill with mixed feelings. In fact I might say that the Bill is, in many respects, a characteristic product of the Minister's mentality and outlook on life.  I think we must recognise&mdash; at least I consider&mdash;that the Minister has a kind of dual personality, a kind of Jekyll and Hyde combination in his composition.  I would not go so far as to say that he suffers in any degree from that mental disease known as schizophrenia, but I am sure we must all recognise the fact that, even before the invention of D.D.T., there were no flies on the Minister, not one, and it would be, I think, a valuable public service if we could eliminate entirely from the Minister's character the Hyde element and facilitate him in appearing consistently before the nation as the beneficent Dr. Jekyll character that he tends to be more and more as his political maturity develops.  Now, there are certain elements in this Bill which reflect the Dr. Jekyll aspect of the Minister's character, and I thoroughly welcome and approve of those elements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="270" /> I agree that money, to any reasonable amount, is well spent in facilitating industrial research, and I am also of opinion that it is desirable that there should be, side by side with the activities of the Industrial Research Bureau, a pilot firm of the character which this industrial alcohol concern will shortly assume which will be in a position to explore the possibility of producing, on a commercial scale and at an economic cost, the various chemical products which we know from laboratory tests are capable of being produced in the laboratory.</P>
    <P>I think we must recognise that scientific research, and the application of it to agricultural and industrial problems, has performed great service in improving the efficiency of both economic activities and in adding to the number of valuable materials, both agricultural and industrial.  I do not know whether penicillin might be regarded as an illustration in that connection, but it has been a most valuable discovery, the product of the application of scientific investigation to the various problems of life, and not only has it been an important agent of a therapeutic character in dealing with human diseases, but it has had valuable effects also in dealing with animal diseases.  I understand that penicillin is being successfully used in the treatment of mastitis, one of the most serious diseases that afflicts our herds of cows.  In so far as this Bill tends to bring about that kind of result in the agricultural and industrial problems that confront us, and facilitates an increase of our agricultural and industrial output, I welcome it.  I feel it is thoroughly desirable.</P>
    <P>I think it would be in order at this stage to say what I believe should be the principles governing our economic development as a whole, with special reference to the contribution which this Bill will make to that end.  We should endeavour to increase the real income of the nation, while at the same time ensuring its more equitable distribution among the various classes of the community and, recognising that in the main our natural resources are agricultural rather than industrial, we should emphasise agricultural <Col N="271" /> rather than industrial development. But that is not to say that we should entirely exclude industrial development. On the contrary, although I speak mainly from an agricultural point of view, I recognise the desirability of an industrial development which will be in harmony with and closely integrated with our major agricultural interests.  The most direct method of achieving such industrial development is not necessarily the most successful method.  It may be that by putting the emphasis mainly on agricultural development we shall achieve more permanent and successful industrial development than if we concentrate attention excessively and unduly on a limited objective of industrial development.</P>
    <P>There was some comparison yesterday between Denmark and Ireland in another connection.  I would like to compare the two countries in one aspect from the point of view of industrial development.  We hear <i>ad nauseam</i> of the marvellous agricultural achievements of that small continental country, but it is not so widely known that industrially Denmark is a much more advanced and more highly developed country than ours.  The figures illustrating that phenomenon are most revealing and ought to be kept permanently before us.  In Denmark only 35.7 per cent. of the occupied population are engaged in primary, that is mainly agricultural, production; in Éire about 50 per cent. are so occupied.  In Denmark, 27.5 per cent. of the population are engaged in industrial production; in Éire, only 13.1 per cent. are so engaged.  Consequently, Denmark, in spite of or because of the fact that she puts first things first and concentrates on developing her agricultural production, is industrially much more advanced than we are, and in that respect commands our envy and admiration and, I hope, our imitation.</P>
    <P>Industrial development should be based on and closely integrated with our agricultural development and the emphasis should be on agricultural development, not only for its own sake but because of its effects in facilitating <Col N="272" /> the best and most permanent kind of industrial development.  In illustrating that point of view, I should like to develop certain positive aspects of that principle but it would carry me beyond the scope of the present debate, and the present occasion is not a suitable one for such development. On the other hand, in certain negative respects I think there are certain matters which ought to be pointed out. One of them is that industrial development, however desirable in itself, must not take a form which adds to the raw material costs of agricultural production.</P>
    <P>In this connection I would like to examine, quite briefly, the Minister's past record in this matter and, in the course of such examination, I may have occasion to refer to some of the Minister's past sins.  There is a proverb which says that the greater the sinner the greater the saint&mdash;that is, when he becomes a reformed character&mdash;and if I refer to any of the Minister's past sins it will only be with the hope and intention of stimulating him to unheard of achievements in political and economic sainthood during the rest of his political career, which is by no means finished.</P>
    <P>Let us compare some of the outstanding facts of our economic position in the year 1929-30 with the year 1938-39. In those two years, according to official records and statistics, the physical volume of our agricultural output was much the same, though its pattern had been drastically altered in the interval. The money value of agricultural income in 1938-39 was about £12,000,000 less than the money value of agricultural income in 1929-30.  The real national income on the later date was practically the same or very little more than it was in 1929-30.  In other words, in the interval&mdash;an interval in which the Minister was trying his 'prentice hand on our economic salvation&mdash;the principal thing that happened was a transfer of income among various sections of the community, but a failure to increase the total real income of the nation.  In fact, the national economy was going round and round in circles, like a kitten chasing its tail.</P>
    <P>We want to get away from that situation <Col N="273" /> and, if possible, to do whatever we can to facilitate an increase in the real national income, both agricultural and industrial, and its more equitable division among the various classes of the community.</P>
    <P>Coming now to closer quarters with the problem of chemical industries in relation to our general economic situation, I have no doubt the Minister has got phosphorus in the brain, but he seems to have sulphate of ammonia on the brain.  I would much prefer that he would have phosphates on the brain, as I have, and I think other thoughtful students of our present agricultural situation also have.</P>
    <P>If we look at the statistics of the consumption of chemical manures during the last 14 to 20 years&mdash;they are conveniently set out at page 32 of the Majority Report on Post-Emergency Agricultural Policy&mdash;we will find that in 1929-30 there were two fat years of phosphate consumption in Irish agriculture. I should mention that the data related to rock phosphate, which is the raw material used by our own superphosphate producing factories and, in that connection, one should bear in mind that one ton of imported rock phosphate is the means of making about two tons of superphosphates. The other elements in the phosphate position are imports of basic slag and superphosphate.  If you make certain arithmetical calculations, as I did, you will find that, aggregating the total phosphate consumption with reference to these two fat years&mdash;1929-30&mdash;the annual consumption of our agriculture of phosphate amounted in those two years to 268,600 tons.  Then came seven lean years, between 1933 and 1939.  If you average the phosphate consumption of our agriculture in those years you will find that it averaged annually only 163,600 tons; in other words, roughly 100,000 tons a year less than in the two fat years.  Then came the seven absolutely starvation years of the war in which it was almost impossible to get any phosphate manures at all and, in fact, practically no artificial manures of any kind.  Consequently, if you take together these 14 years and make any kind of estimate of phosphate consumption, you must admit <Col N="274" /> that, at a moderate estimate, there is a phosphate deficiency of about 2,000,000 tons spread over the last 14 years, as compared with what would have been the case if the rate of consumption of 1929-30 had been maintained. That being so, I hold that the No. 1 priority need of Irish agriculture is phosphate and still more phosphate. Already we have factories which produce phosphate manures and there is no immediate problem there.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, I am not so sure about the desirability of increasing the dosage of sulphate of ammonia so far as our agriculture is concerned.  It is a manure which can be used in excess and, according to some authorities, is calculated to poison the land rather than add to its permanent fertility.  It also tends to diminish the lime content of it.  One way and another it does not seem to matter quite so much about sulphate of ammonia but it does matter and is of the most vital importance that the phosphate content of our soil should be restored and increased.</P>
    <P>I am not blaming the Minister for that phosphate deficiency of 2,000,000 tons but, nevertheless, he cannot escape some share of responsibility for the fact that Irish agriculture used less phosphate during the last 14 years.  In 1932 the Minister, apparently, was approached by the superphosphate manufacturing interests who were alarmed at the tendency of their output to diminish by reason of considerable imports of superphosphate from abroad, mainly from Belgium.  In deference to those representations, he restricted the import of superphosphate. One immediate effect of that restriction was that the cost of fertilisers generally to the Irish farmer between 1932 and 1933 rose in the ratio of 84.9 to 89.6.  It was a case of hitting agriculture when it was down, a case of sacrificing the interests and welfare of 600,000 agriculture producers to the supposed interests of about 1,000 people occupied in producing superphosphates. From what I know, all these manure factories in Éire form a pretty close combination amongst themselves, if they are not a virtual monopoly.  They are well able to look after themselves financially and they <Col N="275" /> could have taken a knock in 1932-33 much more conveniently than the unfortunate victims of their higher price policy facilitated by the action of the Minister.</P>
    <P>However, what was done then was done and it certainly had the effect of increasing the price of artificial manures, notably phosphates, to the Irish consumer and, to that extent, of encouraging the farmer to use less of these manures than he would otherwise have done.  Therefore, to that extent, the Minister must accept some responsibility for the fact that our phosphate deficiency is what it is, although I do not blame him for the whole 2,000,000 ton phosphate deficiency.  If we now suffer from impoverished pastures and diminished crop yields throughout the country, as we do, it is mainly because of this phosphate deficiency.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephJohnston" hpid="Professor Johnston Professor Johnston">
      <NameTxt>Professor Johnston</NameTxt>
      <P>I am coming very close to the Bill, I hope.  The principal object of sulphate of ammonia is as a source of nitrogen, one of the three essential manures for agricultural production.  We do require nitrogen very badly but we want it from the cheapest possible source and in such a way that it will fit in in the best possible manner with our total national economy, both agricultural and industrial.  Sulphate of ammonia is one convenient source of additional nitrogen but there are other possible sources, some of which ought to be taken into account before we proceed too far with any idea of establishing a sulphate of ammonia factory arising out of the possibilities contained in this Bill.  A great deal of valuable nitrogenous elements run away in improperly maintained manure heaps throughout the country.  There is a farm improvements scheme which ought to be availed of if necessary in <Col N="276" /> order to provide a concrete surround for manure heaps at farmyards and thus prevent the loss of this valuable material.  In that way, we can greatly add to the quality of nitrogen available for Irish agriculture.  In addition to that, if the policy of encouraging the system of short lea farming is adopted and if we go in for a tillage-cum-grass economy, we will have the land regularly ploughed up and equally regularly sown down with grass seeds and clovers.  In that way, we will create a condition in which the nitrogen content of the soil will be maintained and increased.</P>
      <P>Let me emphasise again the need for phosphates.  Unless the phosphate content of the soil is restored, the grass seeds we sow simply will not grow.  If we have the phosphate content right, then by sowing from time to time the correct mixture of grass seeds and clovers we can create a situation in which those plants, especially the clovers, will go on making all the nitrogen we want and leave us needing very little in the way of sulphate of ammonia.</P>
      <P>I suppose the Minister is aware of the elementary bio-chemical fact that every single plant of clover&mdash;and, indeed, all the leguminous plants that grow&mdash;is a nitrogen factory.  I suppose that the clovers planted by our farmers might be regarded as a form of private enterprise directed to the production of nitrogen.  With reference to Section 7 of the Bill, I hope the Minister will have due regard to this very desirable form of private enterprise.  At a moderate estimate there are about 1,000,000 acres of Irish land that require reseeding with a proper mixture of grass seeds and clovers.  I do not know if the Minister is aware that 1 lb. of wild white clover contains 686,400 seeds, every one of these, when it grows, is a nitrogen factory.  So that, so far from wanting only one nitrogen factory in the country, I want at least 686,400,000,000 nitrogen factories&mdash;and I want them to take a form of clovers growing in the mixture along with all the valuable grasses. If we do that, there will be very little need for nitrogen in any other form.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally, even if one admits that, for <Col N="277" /> reasons of national security, it is desirable to maintain factories producing superphosphates and, perhaps, even establish a factory to produce sulphate of ammonia, and even if it turns out that these factories cannot produce and sell their products as cheaply as similar products could be imported, then the additional cost of that element of national security should not be imposed on agriculture. That cost should be met by the taxpayer from public funds, if we must have those factories and if we must pay for national security, let us pay in that form.  The essential thing is that, whatever our experiments in industrial expansion, with a view to producing chemical manures and so on, they must not directly or indirectly add to the cost of agricultural production.  If these safeguards are kept in mind, I see no serious objection to this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir John Keane Sir John Keane">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully accept the principles laid down by the last speaker as a headline for our economic policy, namely, that none of these industrial ventures by their cost should place a burden on agricultural production. That is a sound policy and one that, in a country like ours where almost our entire resources are agricultural in character, is the right one for developing a healthy economic policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was interested in Senator Johnston's attempt to analyse the Minister's mentality.  I have often made that attempt and must confess I have failed. The thing I do realise is that he is a very astute politician.  But when he comes along with a Bill like this, with complete satisfaction on what he proposes and with no attempt to explain or apologise for the past, I must say he is making rather a strain on our innocence and credulity.  He says the objects of this Bill are to examine the potentialities, the possibilities, of establishing a chemical industry. Surely there are other objects also and is not one of them to try to bury the past, to get away from the ghastly failure that has been exposed by this Industrial Alcohol Bill?  There is only one thing worse than that in our national economy, if I may say so&mdash;and this a matter we will deal with some time&mdash;and that is our proposal to make <Col N="278" /> our own steel.  This is an example that will want a lot of explaining in relation to what the Minister suggested yesterday was a fixed and established economic policy, which a lot of us, judging by our speeches, have not yet grasped and understood.</P>
    <P>Here we have an industry established to produce industrial alcohol from potatoes, which did little or nothing in that respect and, ultimately, had to be kept alive through the importation, from Cuba or somewhere else, of molasses as a source of its raw material. The Minister told us, when this Bill was being introduced, that 3/- would be about the highest figure that the alcohol would cost, but we know now that the cost of production was 7/6 a gallon.  In order to camouflage the economics of the whole venture and make it appear on paper to be economic, we force the motor industry to mix&mdash;I think I heard it said adulterate&mdash;this product with imported petrol.  Some explanation is due from the Minister as to the failure of the whole venture.  I was disappointed, as I look on the Minister as a man with great brain and with a mind of a very resourceful character; and I should have thought he would have the courage to come forward and say: &ldquo;We cannot establish a new economy without certain losses and here is an outstanding failure; let us cut our losses, let us realise that the money is gone, and let us make a fresh start and learn from the past&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I suggest that this money is lost.  I suggest&mdash;and the Minister even hints at it in the statements he made in the Dáil&mdash;that it is very likely this new venture will supersede the industrial alcohol production.  If that is so, all the money&mdash;or a large portion of it&mdash;so spent should be written off and not camouflaged in the way that is now being done by this measure.  When I say &ldquo;camouflage&rdquo; I mean this. The Minister is seeking power to give this company the right to make experiments, and, if the experiments prove successful, to make the company the basis of a new chemical industry.  I ask the Minister this question: is this plant for making industrial alcohol of any value technically, as it exists, in <Col N="279" /> relation to the production of sulphate of ammonia?  It is not.  It is about as much use for the production of sulphate of ammonia as, may I say, a gasworks would be for the production of steel. Technical people tell me that there is nothing in this factory which will help towards research as regards sulphate of ammonia.  If that is so, I regard all this money spent on industrial alcohol equipment as wasted.  It has been a ghastly failure.  The alcohol was costing 7/6 per gallon.  The industry is not going to be revived&mdash;at least there is every likelihood that it will not.  This new venture will derive no assets from it, except possibly land.  The main part of the equipment will be of no advantage in the establishment of a chemical industry.</P>
    <P>The Minister justifies his first approach towards a chemical industry on the ground that we must not be left wanting again in the next emergency. I am sufficient of an optimist for the future to hope that there will be no emergency of the kind we have just come through for a very long time. I have a belief in the United Nations Organisation.  I have a hope that we shall not have another world cataclysm so soon as to affect our present economy.  I think we are justified in taking that risk.  I think we are justified in trying to get into line with those optimists who say that world recovery, which will include the recovery of every nation, is based on the increasing interchange of goods on the most favourable terms and the development of international trade.  If that is accepted, we should make what is most suitable to our own resources. I do not preclude a certain limited investigation.  I do preclude the possibility of the chemical industry being in any way suitable.  Perhaps that is an over-statement, but I say that there is very little prospect of the economic establishment of such an industry in this country.</P>
    <P>Let me deal with the question I raised yesterday.  I asked the Minister to define what he meant by &ldquo;entirely economic&rdquo;.  He used that expression in the Dáil on one occasion and I was not quite clear about it.  I could not <Col N="280" /> grasp his definition.  I suggest that an industry is entirely economic when it can produce goods for export; in fact, when it produces goods below the price at least of countries with a standard of living equal to our own.  I do not suggest producing goods for export to a country with a debased currency and a very low standard of living.  I say that we cannot claim any industry as being entirely economic, and I stress the word &ldquo;entirely&rdquo;, which cannot produce goods at a price at which they can be exported to Great Britain, the Scandinavian countries, and countries which enjoy the standard of living that these countries do.  I should like the Minister to say whether he would accept that as an adequate definition of &ldquo;entirely economic&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>At this stage I want to affirm that it is not right to accuse those who criticise our new policy of unpatriotic motives, because that is the line which was taken on recent occasions.  At least one speaker in this House has done that.  Only yesterday, Senator Summerfield impugned the motives of those who criticised our new economy. If those who support our new economy have no better argument than that, they are in a sorry plight.  They should defend their beliefs on convincing ground and not merely impugn the motives of those who do not agree with them.</P>
    <P>As to the suggestion of the Minister for using this company as an experimental ground in connection with a future chemical industry, is it seriously suggested that we cannot get a fully-informed opinion from large established companies, who have spent millions in research, on the prospects of an economic chemical industry in this country? You have only to go to Imperial Chemicals to-morrow&mdash;there are other companies but that is one we all know of&mdash; and say: &ldquo;I should like you to examine and report on the prospects of starting a sulphate of ammonia or other heavy chemical industry in this country.&rdquo; Their report surely would be of infinitely more value than some hotchpotch experiment carried out by this company, whose record up to the present has been deplorable and whose equipment, I suggest, as it at present <Col N="281" /> exists, is quite unsuitable for research into this matter.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated that he has been told and knows that we can make sulphate of ammonia in this country cheaper than we can get it abroad or, was it, cheaper than it was before the war.  He said he had been given figures which satisfied him that we could have an economic production of sulphate of ammonia.  Why, then, have all this research?  If he is satisfied, let him give us the figures and go on.  Do not let him cover it up with the ugly past of this company.</P>
    <P>The Minister assured us that there is no great danger, or no severe financial obligation involved in this venture because the amount of capital that this company can raise is limited.  He has already raised&mdash;and I suggest poured down the drain&mdash;£275,000 of the country's money.  He can only carry on that process to the extent of another £225,000 I think.  That is the total capital which can be raised by law for this purpose.  There is no difficulty in raising it because he can go to the Minister for Finance and get a cheque the next morning or he can raise it from the public, if he likes, on a Government guarantee.  But the Minister has not told us, either in this House or in the Dáil, that there are further resources under the present law within the grasp of this company.  This company can raise debentures and can borrow.  I suppose there is a limit but there is nothing to preclude further substantial borrowing powers on the part of this company without obtaining any Parliamentary sanction so that the safeguard in regard to the limit of capital is not the whole story.  There can be further expenditure without Parliamentary authority, in respect of borrowing or in respect of debentures.</P>
    <P>What is to be done about it?  Of course we have to toe the line.  There is no prospect of preventing this Bill going through.  I did read the other day of a philosopher who said that the greatest form of mental torture was to know that wrong was about to be done and that it was impossible to do anything to prevent it.  Will the Minister believe that I am suffering considerable mental torture?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir John Keane Sir John Keane">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I shall go right back: I made a mistake I know in one instance.  Let me confess what Senator Foran is trying to get out. Senator Foran knows that many members of the House are unaware of my record in the matter of the Electricity Supply Bill.  I will admit that I was mistaken in that instance. I admit it fully but will the Minister admit that he has ever been mistaken in any of his ventures because, I think, if he really searches his heart and his conscience he cannot fail to do so? Will Senator Foran agree to leave this matter alone now?  I have made full confession I was mistaken in that instance but if anybody expects to get through the world and get through political life without making mistakes, I think they are living in a fool's paradise.  I should think that even such a great man as Mr. Churchill has made mistakes in his time.  What is one to do?  I have suggested that the Minister should make a clean breast of the whole thing and say: &ldquo;This money has been lost.  I ask the House now to allow me to start chemical industries.  I shall call in experts, following the precedent of the Electricity Supply Bill, which Senator Foran is so anxious to recall, and then on their judgment I shall come to Parliament and ask for your sanction before going ahead with this scheme.&rdquo; I think that is the right way to do it and not merely try to tack this venture on to a company which I would suggest in its equipment&mdash;I am not prepared to criticise the brains or the knowledge at its command&mdash;is singularly unfitted to carry out the task which it is asked to do.</P>

      <P>May I ask one question?  We are told in the Bill that the principal objects of this company shall include&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(iii)  the manufacture and sale of any substance, all or any portion of which is produced or obtained by chemical process.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am very sensitive to any subject that touches chemistry and that is why I raise this question.  I presume the Minister means what this object implies and I presume the House realises the <Col N="283" /> vastness of that object.  It means that this company will be the most powerful company in the country because chemistry provides the key for so many things that the company can very soon establish itself in a position that would render it capable of controlling many different concerns.  &ldquo;The manufacture and sale of any substance, all or any portion of which is produced or obtained by chemical process&rdquo;.  &ldquo;Any substance&rdquo; could include sugar and bread.  Even sugar manufacture involves a chemical process&mdash;bleaching and so forth.  I know the Minister will leave out sugar and leave out bread, so far as this company is concerned, but, at the same time, there is that possibility, that the object of the company can be extended to include the manufacture of a great many of these things that normally we would not regard as proper materials for a chemical industry.  I do believe that that object will have to be curtailed a little bit.  In so far as this Bill improves our scientific outlook and in so far as it provides a means of centralisation, I think it is very good. I am not quite so pessimistic about the question of research as Senator Sir John Keane, because if you start a company of this magnitude, and you require the information which he has mentioned, you can get any experts you require from all over the world. I am, however, reminded, considering the enormous power this company will have, of the quotation: &ldquo;The glass is too big, take it away, I shall drink out of the bottle.&rdquo;  I am rather afraid that the glass of object (iii) is too big and I would prefer to see smaller power in the possession of the chemical company.</P>

      <P>I do not know what to say in reply to Senator Johnston's analysis of my character but I shall pay him the tribute of saying that while he has been in this House he has run true to type and has shown no signs of the split personality which he attributes to me.  A great deal depends on the attitude of mind with which one approaches the consideration of the economic problems of this country. There are a number of people whose <Col N="284" /> minds just stopped working about 25 years ago.  They decided that the country had gone to the devil and they are determined that everything that has happened since will be interpreted as evidence of that fact.  I do not think it is true that we must depend entirely upon the development of our agriculture for prosperity and that we should, therefore, not undertake any industrial development that might in any circumstance react unfavourably upon agricultural costs.  There are changes taking place in the world, in the distribution of economic power throughout the world, and in the nature of world trade, and we must be, I think, prepared at all times to adjust our economic structure so as to get the best results for our people in these changing circumstances.  I am surprised that Senator Johnston should have thought fit to point his argument by suppressing very relevant facts.  It is a simple matter to rise in the Seanad and say that, between 1930 and 1939, the value of our agricultural production fell by £12,500,000, without any alteration in the volume of production or any alteration in the national income.  Between 1929 and 1938, many things happened besides the advent to office of a Fianna Fáil Government.  I submit that any honest student of economic trends would have come to the conclusion that those other things had a far more potent effect on the value of agricultural output than the change of Government which took place in 1932.  There was a considerable slump in agricultural prices everywhere. In so far as the prices procured by Irish farmers were governed by the prices prevailing in the world markets, the level of prices here was beyond our control.  Between 1929 and 1938, the world prices of butter fell so drastically that export from this country became impossible unless heavily subsidised.  We maintained exports by subsidising them.  A similar situation developed with regard to bacon.  If we are to attribute all the decline in the value of agricultural products in that period to the development of industry here or to other causes within the control of the Government, then we must blame Irish <Col N="285" /> industrial development or Fianna Fáil policy for events that occurred in every quarter of the globe.  I submit that any honest student of the economic history of that period will be forced to agree that the slump in world prices, accentuated in our case by the consequences of the land-annuities dispute with Great Britain, had far more effect on the value of agricultural output than any industrial development that we succeeded in achieving in that period.</P>

      <P>That is agreed.  I hope that Senator Johnston is not developing this mental disease from which he thinks I am suffering.  It is true that we granted protection to the superphosphate industry here.  It is probably also true that the cost of superphosphate produced from our factories during that period was higher than the price at which we could have imported it from some countries, though not from all countries.  I wonder if that is a fair comparison.  We know that the price of superphosphate which could have been purchased abroad during that period was uneconomic by any test.  It was, in fact, sold at less than the cost of production. It was produced in other cases as a by-product of other forms of industry and sold merely at its ex-factory cost, without any additions for overheads or profits.  We could, undoubtedly, have secured temporary advantage during that period of world depression by destroying our own industry and importing superphosphate at a slightly lower price.  Would the gain have been anything more than temporary?  I agree with Senator Sir John Keane that we must not plan our policy entirely on the assumption that we are going to have nothing but wars for an indefinite period, but there was a war and, during that war, the fact that we had superphosphate plants operating here was of considerable importance to our farmers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That, I agree, is a different issue.  There may be a case <Col N="286" /> for ensuring that supplies of superphosphate or nitrogenous fertilisers are available to farmers at less than the production cost or at very low prices, that result being achieved by means of a State subsidy.  That seems to me to be an entirely different issue from the question whether we should produce superphosphate ourselves or import it. Whether we produce it ourselves or import it, we can subsidise the price. I should not at all disagree with the policy of subsidising fertilisers for farmers.  In fact, the Government are doing so at the moment.  The present price of superphosphate fertiliser is heavily subsidised.  In addition to the subsidy, which has kept the price down during the past few years, the guaranteed price for wheat was supplemented by a credit voucher, which will enable the farmers next year to procure a very considerable quantity of fertilisers free of cost.  Those vouchers will be encashable next year.  At all times, the Government has fully appreciated the importance of increasing the use of fertilisers and has shown its willingness to undertake financial responsibility to attain that object by making fertilisers available to the farmers at less than the manufacturing cost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should not like to define &ldquo;economic production&rdquo;.  I do not accept Senator Keane's definition.  His definition was &ldquo;production at a total cost which would permit of exports&rdquo;.  It is possible to develop an export trade by various devices&mdash;low wages, long hours, tax remissions, abolishing social services and other methods of that character which would enable the purely price-standard of efficiency to be achieved.  I should say that, for the great majority of industries, the economic cost of production is the cost at which we can produce here, given efficient plant, proper management and skilled workers.  It may be that the economic cost of production here is higher or lower than the economic cost of production elsewhere.  It is a matter for decision, as an item of policy, whether any particular form of production should be encouraged or discouraged. I think that common sense would support the wisdom of a policy of diversifying production.  Any study <Col N="287" /> of economic history I have been able to undertake seemed to me to prove conclusively that, in periods of world depression or upsets in international trade, the countries which suffered the most serious consequences were those which had, to an unsafe degree, specialised in limited ranges of production and that the countries which had withstood the consequences of international upsets and trade depressions were those in which production was greatly diversified.</P>
    <P>I think that it would be entirely unwise for us to rely for prosperity on the limited forms of agricultural production that are possible in our circumstances.  If we are to raise our standard of living and increase our economic security, we must supplement our agricultural industry by diversified industrial activities.  I believe that is possible.  I believe there is no logical, natural or economic reason why many industries cannot be established as efficiently here as anywhere else.  I do not think that there is any law of nature or of Providence which decrees that British manufactured boots should be cheaper or better than boots manufactured here.  I do not think there is any reason why sulphate of ammonia cannot be produced here as efficiently as in any other country.  One reason that may affect the cost of production adversely here as compared with that in other countries is the cost of electricity.  Electricity costs are a very considerable item in the production of sulphate of ammonia and there are countries which, owing to natural advantages, can produce electricity more cheaply than we can.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, the raw material which is the basis of the industry is gypsum and we have deposits of gypsum as valuable as, if not more valuable than, any that exist in Europe.  There are good reasons, therefore, to think that we could establish that industry successfully. Our pre-war investigation of it seemed to show that such was the case.  It was true, however, that the best estimate we could make indicated that the price to the farmers would be somewhat higher than the price at <Col N="288" /> that time prevailing in this country, but the price at that time prevailing in this country was lower than the price prevailing in other parts of Europe or in Great Britain.  The manufacturers of these chemical goods are linked in cartels and have not shown themselves to be averse from adopting a policy of cutting the price here and there to prevent competition developing.</P>
    <P>Senator Sir John Keane says it is not necessary to have an investigation into the possibility of these chemical industries, that Imperial Chemicals will give sound advice if we ask for it.  That is a very naïve suggestion.  There are, no doubt, manufacturers at present engaged in supplying existing markets in this country or elsewhere who will voluntarily advise other people to go into competition with them, but there are not very many of them, and I doubt very much whether Imperial Chemicals will be so completely disinterested as to give us reliable advice on the possibility of our competing with them in the production of these goods for this market.</P>

      <P>Full mechanisation is not the phrase I would use.  There was one important industry established here&mdash;the manufacture of glass bottles. The company which established that industry decided to purchase the largest machine in the world for the manufacture of glass bottles.  They purchased and operated here an enormous machine which would turn out glass bottles at enormous speed and in enormous quantities.  The company went bankrupt.  Another company purchased the concern, scrapped that <Col N="289" /> enormous machine and substituted smaller machines and has operated very successfully ever since.  We can pursue the ideal of increased mechanisation to an uneconomic degree.  That is a matter for consideration in relation to the practical circumstances of the market and the technical skill available and all other relevant considerations.</P>

      <P>I said 200,000 tons; I should have said £200,000 in value. These are rather wide questions to be discussing on this Bill.  It may prove to be the case that this company will ultimately be entrusted with the manufacture of sulphate of ammonia, but, as I explained in the Dáil, it cannot do so until fresh legislation is introduced. Deliberately, we have so framed the Bill as merely to alter the powers of the company without altering the financial structure, and if the company is licensed to engage in the manufacture of sulphate of ammonia, the financial provisions of the main Act will have to be amended, and, on the amending Bill, the Dáil and Seanad can express their views fully upon the wisdom of embarking on the venture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator O'Donovan contemplates the possibility of this company engaging in the manufacture of atom bombs.  I think I have read somewhere that it takes £500,000,000 to manufacture an atom bomb and this company has only £500,000, so that it will not manufacture even the smallest size atom bomb <Col N="290" /> without fresh legislation.  Senator Sir John Keane says I am an astute politician.  I do not recognise myself as such.  The mere fact that he has lost every economic argument he started in this House does not prove other people to be very astute.  It merely proves that he is starting on a wrong basis and with the wrong facts. He is equally wrong in assuming that the Industrial Alcohol Company was, as he described it, a ghastly failure.</P>
    <P>I think he has lost sight of the purpose for which the manufacture of industrial alcohol was initiated.  It was not contemplated at any time that we could produce industrial alcohol at a price corresponding to that of imported motor fuels.  In pursuance of the agricultural policy of the Government which was designed to ensure so far as practicable a guaranteed price for agricultural products, it was considered desirable to establish an organisation which could purchase potatoes offered to it at a price announced in advance.  We could see no way of preventing the disastrous slump in potato prices which occurred in the years in which the decision to establish the manufacture of industrial alcohol was taken by a system of price guarantees.  It was clearly impracticable to guarantee a price for potatoes unless we could guarantee a market for potatoes and we could not guarantee a market for potatoes unless we had an organisation which was prepared to purchase them.</P>
    <P>It was to create such an organisation that the Industrial Alcohol Company was established, authorised to erect distilleries and to purchase potatoes for use as raw material in these distilleries in the production of industrial alcohol.  That was the primary purpose.  The production of industrial alcohol was also considered a desirable addition to our security in the event of an interruption in the supply of motor fuel from abroad, but that was a very secondary consideration.  The industrial alcohol distilleries came into production in 1938 on a small scale.  By that time potato prices were already beginning to improve, but I think that very few people familiar with the history of <Col N="291" /> that time will deny that it was an immense benefit to the producers of potatoes to have that assurance of a minimum price which the possibility of selling their potatoes to the Industrial Alcohol Company constituted.</P>
    <P>In fact, the price fixed for industrial alcohol in the first and only pre-war year of its operation was the price which we had estimated when the Bill was before the Dáil&mdash;a price of 3/- per gallon.  That was the price fixed and at that price the company realised a profit.  The present price is 7/6 per gallon, but that has no relation whatever to the circumstances that existed in the pre-war years, because at present it is quite obvious that it would be undesirable to instruct the company actively to endeavour to ensure that potatoes would be offered to it.  The company will take potatoes where there are local surpluses, but in fact in very few of the pre-war years had we a surplus of potatoes, and in these years the Industrial Alcohol Company did not operate at all or operated only for very short campaigns in one or two distilleries, and in circumstances which made the cost of production per gallon extraordinarily high.  We fixed a price for industrial alcohol sold to petrol distributors which recovered these costs of production and avoided a loss to the company, but the experience of the war years is certainly no guide at all as to the costs which might be realised in circumstances where normal, regular supplies of materials can be procured and continuous production maintained over a very long season.</P>
    <P>In this year, the company has contracted for the growing of sugar beet in certain parts of Donegal and some other areas where beet was never grown before and where, in fact, at one time it was considered that beet would not grow, and intend to experiment with the use of beet for the production of industrial alcohol.</P>
    <P>They have also been importing molasses for distillation here.  The advantage of importing molasses is that it permits of continuity of production over the whole year, or for the greater part of the year, and even <Col N="292" /> though there may not be any obvious national advantage in the utilisation of imported molasses for the production of industrial alcohol, it does permit of the more economical operation of these distilleries.  In any event, whatever criticism is to be offered to that scheme should be directed against the Government and not against the company. The company was set up to establish these distilleries and to operate them, and it has done its job quite successfully, both from the technical and commercial point of view.  Senators could urge, and some Senators have urged, that it was a bad decision to take.  They might even urge now that the whole development should be written off and the enterprise stopped, but while they might do that they should not, at the same time, attribute the high cost of alcohol, or the decision to continue the production of alcohol, to the company, or criticise the technical staff of the company or its commercial administration. The company has a very competent technical staff, and the fact that the technical officers of the company are employed at present by it on this distillation process does not mean that they have not had experience of other chemical processes.  I certainly would not like it to be thought that if the company is going to consider the possibility of engaging in other forms of chemical manufacture that it would not procure other expert advice if that were considered advisable.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Baxter that there should be links between the company and the universities.  These links exist at the present time through a member of the board.  There were other links that were severed and these may have to be reformed, but there certainly will be no disagreement on the desirability of keeping the operations of the company in touch with the universities.  There is no possibility that the existing alcohol distilleries will be used in any way for the manufacture of sulphate of ammonia.  I heard it suggested that they could be utilised for that purpose.  As far as I know, the production of sulphate of ammonia does not require any distillation process.  It would necessitate the erection of an entirely different type of plant, but it is possible that <Col N="293" /> the distilleries may be used for the production of some other chemical products.  During the war, when supplies of certain commodities were difficult to procure, this company produced ether for the hospitals and formaldehyde for disinfecting purposes. It also produced, as I mentioned yesterday, undenatured spirit, an industrial raw material, and used also in hospitals and laboratories.  At Cooley it is setting up a new plant for the production of undenatured spirit, a pure alcohol, which is used in many industrial processes&mdash;from the production of perfumes to the production of gin, and which is also used as a preservative in chemical work.</P>
    <P>It may be that these distilleries can be utilised for other forms of manufacture, but that is a matter for decision by the company.  I would not agree that it is desirable that the company should discontinue the production of industrial alcohol in the present circumstances.  We still need all the motor fuel that we can procure.  I should think that in any circumstances there should be no question of discontinuing the operation of these distilleries while motor fuel is rationed. At any time we can decide, if we consider it desirable to do so, to suspend the operations of the distilleries, but that is a separate issue entirely from the one raised by this Bill, which is whether this company should be utilised for the exploration of the commercial possibilities of different forms of chemical manufacture, and should engage in their manufacture.  If there is a decision to that effect, I think Senator Fearon need not fear that this company will grow into the powerful economic influence which he anticipated.  First of all, I want it to be quite clear that there is no question of giving this company at any time monopoly rights in any form of industrial production. Ordinarily, it will not engage in any form of chemical manufacture in which private enterprise is engaged.  Even if there should be some limited form of production by private enterprise not sufficient in our view to justify the withholding of a licence from the company, it will still not have monopoly rights.  In fact, it is far more likely <Col N="294" /> that this company will be given the task of producing by chemical processes goods which are not likely to attract private enterprise because their production here will not be entirely economical or not profitable, or would involve such heavy capital expenditure that private concerns are not likely to engage in it.</P>
    <P>I do not think there was any other point raised in the course of the debate that it is necessary for me to deal with. I want to assure the Seanad that there is no attempt in this Bill to put anything over on it as some Senators seemed to me to suggest.  I explained that the Government found itself at the end of the war, first of all, with the factory at Parkgate Street, operated by the Department of Defence, on the manufacture of certain chemicals.  It found itself with a number of investigations proceeding under the auspices of the Emergency Scientific Research Bureau, some of which appeared at the stage that there were commercial possibilities likely to flow from them, and so had these unfinished pre-war undertakings still on hands such as the completion of the investigations into sulphate of ammonia.  It decided that it required some organisation fully equipped with technical knowledge and the necessary financial resources to investigate these commercial possibilities and to carry on the examinations which had been in progress.  Instead of setting up a new organisation for the purpose, it decided to utilise this existing organisation which appeared to be quite suitable, having regard to the personnel of the board of directors and of the technical staff it employed. That was the sole reason why we proceeded on the basis of altering the powers of the Industrial Alcohol Company. It appeared to us to be the most economical and the most satisfactory method of doing a job which would have to be done in any event.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a Bill which, I hope, the Seanad will agree to pass through all its stages.  It is designed to implement an agreement with the British Government which has already been the subject of legislation passed by the British Parliament.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think Senators are familiar with the purpose of the Bill.  At various times during previous years we have approached the British authorities with a view to securing an arrangement for the payment of unemployment insurance benefit in respect of contributions paid in one country to the workers concerned when unemployed and resident in the other country.  Arising out of the most recent approach upon that question to the British authorities, there emerged a suggestion from them that we should make an arrangement covering persons ordinarily resident here who had served in the British forces during the war.  The British demobilisation scheme, like our own, involved placing demobilised soldiers in full benefit in their unemployment insurance fund, but their law, like our own, prohibited the payment of unemployment insurance benefit to persons resident outside their territory.  We agreed to assist them in carrying through the arrangement for the benefit of these men.  The arrangement is briefly this, <Col N="297" /> that we will pay, through our Exchange, to persons qualified to receive British unemployment insurance benefit because of service with the British forces, the equivalent amount of benefit which they would receive if resident in Great Britain and the British will make good the cost to us. That arrangement will be of immediate benefit to some unknown number of men who served in the British forces during the war, who returned to this country and who are unemployed here.</P>
    <P>It will be understood that the normal machinery for unemployment insurance in this country will operate; the same tests of eligibility for benefit will be applied by the same officers, with the same right of appeal to the courts of referees or, in certain circumstances, to the umpire.  The possibility of a wider and more permanent arrangement covering civilian workers was raised and it is contemplated that discussions on an arrangement of that character will be begun in the near future.  The British Government recently passed the National Insurance Act, which empowers them to enter into reciprocal arrangements of that character.  The relevant part of that Act will not be brought into force until 1948, but, prior to its coming into force in Great Britain, it is hoped discussions will reveal the possibility of a permanent reciprocal arrangement which we would welcome.  If such arrangement could be made, we shall be prepared to implement it by legislation here.</P>
    <P>I mentioned that the British demobilisation scheme was similar to our own and their law prohibiting the payment of benefit to persons resident outside their territory was similar to the law enforced here.  Soldiers serving in our forces during the war were also placed in the unemployment insurance fund. Those of them permanently resident in Northern Ireland were not entitled to draw benefit because they were resident outside our territory.  Instead of making a reciprocal arrangement for the payment of benefit to those ex-soldiers of the Irish forces, similar to that which applied to ex-soldiers of the British forces, we have decided to pay them benefit.  The number of such <Col N="298" /> men unemployed at present is so small that a formal arrangement was not considered necessary.  As a matter of fact, not more than one dozen people have claimed benefit on the grounds that they were entitled to benefit from our fund but were debarred on the one point of residence outside our territory.</P>
    <P>We are making in this Bill the necessary provisions to entitle us to continue to pay benefit to these men even though they are resident outside our territory.  Certain consequential arrangements are necessary to make sure that the right to benefit is not made inoperative by reason of the fact that no contributions were paid into the fund during the period since these men were demobilised. A man is not entitled to benefit even though he has contributions to credit unless he has had a certain period of employment in each year.  We are getting over that by the introduction of certain provisions.  Men who served in the British forces and who came back here and are unemployed will be able to get benefit through our employment exchanges at the rates applicable in Great Britain and at the expense of the British Unemployment Insurance Fund.  Men who served in our forces and who are resident outside our territory and unemployed will be able to get benefit from our fund paid direct by our unemployment insurance authorities to them as long as they are unemployed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The same applies to women&mdash;man embraces woman in this regard.  There is one other thing I might mention.  The British unemployment insurance benefit scheme does not contemplate the payment of additional benefit except in respect of a wife or an adult dependent and one child because under the British children's allowances scheme the children's allowances are paid in respect of children in excess of one and their scheme of administration is different from ours. Our children's allowances scheme provides for the payment of children's allowances in respect of children in excess of two and these are payable irrespective of the circumstances of the <Col N="299" /> family; even if the husband is unemployed and is drawing unemployment benefit, the allowances continue to be payable just as they were when he was in employment.  In order to meet that difference in the provisions of both Acts it is provided here that additional benefit will be payable out of the British fund to these persons claiming under this scheme in respect only of an adult dependent and two dependent children.  They will not, however, be prevented from drawing the children's allowances here under our children's allowances scheme because they are in receipt of special unemployment insurance benefit, as they would have been if they had been resident in Great Britain.  That makes some slight difference in the amount of money which a man with a fairly large family would draw from the British fund while resident here as compared with what he would draw if he were resident in Great Britain but it was the simplest arrangement for meeting the difficulty arising out of the divergence of the development of social services there as compared with this country.</P>

      <P>I am in entire agreement with the Bill and am glad an arrangement has been come to with regard to these people.  The Bill, and the arrangement upon which it is based, is an example, in spite of political separation, of how interlocked we are in a variety of ways with Great Britain.  I am glad the arrangement has been made and I share the Minister's hope&mdash;and I wish the Minister success in any effort that is made&mdash;to extend it to industrial workers as distinct from persons who served in the British armed forces, whether men or women.  That has been going on for a very long time and never has been brought to success by either Government here.  I hope that this Bill, the reception this Bill gets, and the way this Bill works, will enable the Minister for Industry and Commerce to come to an agreement with regard to the great many Irish people who went over there to work and who come back here from time to time.  If such an arrangement were made, it would be a great advance for all the people concerned <Col N="300" /> and, without any more ado, I welcome the Bill.  I approve of it and I hope we will pass it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>The valuable aspect of this Bill is the fact that, for the first time in 23 years, it has broken down a barrier which has prevented any arrangement being made to provide payment of benefit where people become unemployed outside the territory in respect of which their unemployment contributions have been paid.  This is a matter in which a number of people in this country have been very interested over all that period.  Personally, I contended that the British were, in fact, obliged to enter into an arrangement of this kind because of the fact that they had ratified the Washington Convention on Unemployment and I also was keen that that would be applied because of its repercussions on the people from this part of the country who would be unemployed in Northern Ireland.  The fact that this scheme has been worked out between the two Governments lends hope, I think, to the desire expressed by the Minister and by Senator Hayes that it will be applied on a much more extensive scale. This may be regarded, I think, merely, as the corner-stone in the arrangements which will eventually have to be made if justice is to be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The House will remember that the matter was raised here about a year ago.  This time last year we had a discussion on the subject.  At that time some attempt was made to calculate the amount of money which had been accumulated in Great Britain in respect of employers' and workers' contributions proper to the citizens of this country who, in the normal way, would return here to live if they ceased being employed in Great Britain.  The sum was very substantial and I think the arrangement which is ratified in the Bill offers a hope that it will be extended so that the ordinary Irish worker in Great Britain, working in a factory or in the fields, or anywhere else, will become entitled to that on his return.  The hardship such a worker now suffers is very great.  He is paying the contributions in Great Britain.  His employer pays contributions on his behalf.  He has nothing to <Col N="301" /> his credit when he comes back here. He is unemployed.  He cannot get work or benefit although in fact there is a substantial sum lying to his credit in the unemployment fund in Britain.</P>
    <P>Therefore, the House would be justified in giving the Minister any facilities he may need in getting this Bill through all stages here as rapidly as possible so that the persons concerned may become entitled to benefit at the earliest possible moment.</P>
    <P>I think Senators will observe that the draftsmanship of this Bill is obscure in many respects, except to an expert on unemployment insurance.  It will be difficult for the ordinary reader to say how the Bill will be applied, who is entitled to benefit and the rate of benefit that will be paid.  In the Dáil the Minister indicated that it was intended to prepare some pamphlets or literature explaining the provisions of the Bill.  It is very necessary that that should be done at the earliest possible moment because, it is not only that it is difficult to say who is entitled to benefit, but it is very difficult to say, from reading the Bill, under what conditions the benefits are payable.  The Minister's speech, of course, makes clear enough what is going to be done but his speech will not get wide publicity&mdash;it is not nearly as important as some of the things that get into the newspapers&mdash;and the ordinary person outside will have very little knowledge as to his rights under this Bill.  I would urge that some steps should be taken the moment the Bill is passed to make known to the public at large who are entitled to benefit and, roughly, the rates of benefit to which they are entitled and the circumstances under which they are provided.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SamKyle" hpid="Mr. Kyle Mr. Kyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyle</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Trade Union Congress I want to say how much we welcome this Bill and to congratulate the Minister on the success of his efforts to bring about this reciprocal arrangement, and particularly on his statement that discussions are to take place with a view to the extension of this reciprocal arrangement.  The only point I want to make to the Minister is that when these discussions are taking place we would be indebted to him if he would bring in the question of workmen's <Col N="302" /> compensation and the treatment of Eire nationals in regard to workmen's compensation.  There have been many instances of men in employment in Britain meeting with an accident and coming back to Eire to recuperate and, as soon as they set foot on our soil, their workmen's compensation ceases. I know there is difficulty about this because of the fact that in Britain they have taken in workmen's compensation under their national insurance scheme. We have not done that up to now.  That will probably cause a good deal of difficulty. I have spoken to people about this very important question of the treatment by insurance companies of men who have met with accidents and I am assured that the insurance companies are desirous of being in a position to pay compensation to Eire nationals who have met with accidents in Britain and have come back here to live or to recuperate, in some cases, to die.  I would be very much obliged, and the trade union movement would be very much obliged to the Minister if, when these discussions take place, he would bear that particular point in mind.</P>

There is no doubt that there has been a tremendous amount of dissatisfaction about the state of affairs that has existed.  The co-operation which has made this Bill possible is a happy augury for the future.  We are in close proximity to our neighbour, whether we like it or not, and anything that affects the people who move from one country to the other is of vital importance to us all.  This is a splendid piece of work and I am with those who hope it will become law as quickly as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the point raised by Senator Duffy, I mentioned in the Dáil the intention of publishing a leaflet explaining the rates of benefit which will be operative under this scheme.  In all other respects the administration of the scheme will be identical with the administration of our own unemployment insurance scheme.  The claimant must fulfil the same conditions and go <Col N="303" /> through the same procedure.  The only change is that he will be claiming upon the British fund and will be paid at the British rates.</P>
      <P>I hope that the discussions which are about to take place will lead to a reciprocal arrangement covering industrial workers.  However, it would be foolish to shut our eyes to the fact that there are some very real difficulties.  We will enhance the prospects of securing a permanent arrangement relating to ordinary civilian workers, if we demonstrate that we administer this scheme scrupulously and with full regard to the interests of the British Unemployment Insurance Fund as well as to the interests of the person claiming here.  If there should appear to be any disposition to pay out British money to Irish claimants with less care or less scrutiny of the justification of claims than we would make in the case of payments from our own fund, then clearly we would prejudice the prospects of a wider and more permanent arrangement.</P>
      <P>I am very interested in the point raised by Senator Kyle.  It is desirable that, if possible, there should be a similar arrangement in regard to payment of benefit in respect of temporary disablement under the workmen's compensation scheme. Again, let us appreciate that there are real practical difficulties.  There is the practical difficulty of affording satisfactory evidence of continuing disablement. As everyone concerned with the administration of workmen's compensation knows, that is a matter of very considerable difficulty.  In fact, the successful efforts of many workers to claim continuing disablement after they have recovered from the injury has resulted in a very steady and substantial increase in the cost of workmen's compensation insurance in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The weak spot in any workmen's compensation scheme is the difficulty of preventing persons continuing to draw benefit after their moral claim to it has expired.  Clearly that difficulty is considerably greater if the person is in another jurisdiction than if he is <Col N="304" /> resident in the territory of the State. The whole trend of thought is in favour of having reciprocal arrangements of that nature between countries where there is a regular movement for workers to employment. We must recognise that far more Irish people go for employment in Great Britain than English people come here.  Consequently, any arrangements involving payment in respect of that employment in our territory will be more costly to the British authorities than to ourselves.  Therefore, it will be necessary to satisfy them that arrangements can be made to keep that cost down to a proper minimum and particularly that there will be no lax administration on this side which might increase the cost to them.  However, these matters will be discussed in relation to unemployment insurance during the present year and in relation to other aspects of social insurance schemes when the new Act is in force in Great Britain and the law here has been changed to empower the Government to enter into an arrangement of that kind.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a matter for consideration.  The unemployment benefits are payable out of the Unemployment Insurance Fund, which has been built up out of the contributions by work-people and employers.  The British benefits are in many respects higher, but their contributions are also higher, particularly in the case of women and juveniles.  It is a matter which can be considered, so long as it is appreciated that increased benefits out of our fund, having regard to the general incidence of unemployment here, would necessitate a substantial increase in contributions as well.</P>

He may not be qualified under the scheme at all, or he may have exhausted his current benefits in Great Britain before returning here.

Maidir leis an roinn tráchtála de shaghas (a), bíonn an cúrsa críochnaithe, gach bliain, ag tuairim is 1,200 de na 2,000 a bhíos ag freastal ar 40 láithreán.  Einne a bhfuil suim aige i gCeard-Oideachas, ni féidir leis a bheith sásta leis na figiúirí sin a bhaineas leis an roinn tionnscalach. Idir Scoileanna Gairm-Oideachais agus Scoileanna atá leath-ghairm-oideachasach, ní hullmhaítear go bliantúil ach ó 250 go 300 den aos óg le haghaidh a bhfostuithe i dtionnscail&mdash;uimhir atá fíor-bheag do thír ina bhfuil 3,000,000 duine.</P>

Mórán den teagasc a níthear, ní teagasc teicniciúil é.  Sna cúrsaí tionscnaimh go háirithe, bíonn bun-oideachas ag teastáil, agus laghdaíonn an riachtanas sin éifeacht na hoibre tríd is tríd.  Níl an dlúthbhaint chóir idir na ceard-scoileanna agus an tionscal agus níl siad ag coimhlíonadh a bpríomh-chuspóra, eadhon, tréineáil speisialta a thabhairt dóibh siúd atá fostaithe cheana.</P>

    <P>Is é sin an chaoi a raibh an scéal sul ar ritheadh an tAcht Gairm-Oideachais, 1930.

Na Coistí Gairm-Oideachais a ndearnadh soláthar lena n-aghaidh san Acht, tháinig siad i bhfeidhm i bhFóghmhar 1930, ach d'fhan an córas oideachais gan atharú go dtí Seisiún 1931-32.  Mar sin de, is le cúig cinn déag de sheisiúin iomlána atá an córas ba chuspóir don Acht i bhfeidhm.  Ar feadh na naoi seisiún tosaigh&mdash;go dtí deireadh Lúnasa, 1940&mdash;chuaigh an obair chun cinn gan aon chur-isteach neamhghnáthach.  Ach, maidir leis na trí seisiúin tosaigh, féadfaí a rá gur beag nár sheisiúin trialacha iad, agus nach raibh i bhfeidhm lena linn ach cúrsaí áirithe a bhí curtha ar bun dá dtriail ag na Coistí Gairm-Oídeachais, faoi stiúradh agus faoi threoir na Roinne.  Ar feadh na dtrí seisiún tar a n-éis sin (1934-37) rinneadh comhdhlúthú i gcoitinne ar fhormhór na scéimeanna ar éirigh leo, agus leanadh de na trialacha sna ceantair tuaithe go mór-mhór.</P>
    <P>Sna trí seisiúin deiridh (1937-40) bhí forás buan i ngach ceantar, ach bhí aire faoi leith dhá tabhairt do ghairm-oideachais na gceantar tuaithe.  Is é seisiún na hEigeandála (1940-46) tháinig siad-san ansin, agus b'é príomh iarracht na tréimhse sin an obair a choinneáil ar cois chomh hiomlán agus bhí sí roimh sin.  An riachtanas a bhí le spáráil airgid agus na deacrachta eile a bhain leis an Eigeandáil, ní hé amháin gur choisc siad forás na scéimeanna, ach chuir siad isteach, a bheag nó a mhór, ar obair gach scoile agus gach ranga dá raibh ann, agus ní mór cuimhniú go maith ar an taobh sin den scéal nuair a beifear ag meas an dul-chun-cinn atá déanta ó ritheadh an tAcht Gairm-Oideachais, 1930.</P>
    <P>Foirgnimh Scol: Tháimig atharú mór <Col N="310" /> de bharr Acht Gairm-Oideachais 1930; ach níl aon ghné den atharú sin chomh so-fheicseanach leis na scoil-tithe oiriúnacha fá n-a ndeagh-chóir a cuireadh ar fáil in ionaid chomhgaracha ar fud na tíre.  Má cuirtear na ceithre Contae-Bhuirgí agus Buirg Dhún Laoghaire san áireamh, tá 187 scoil den tsaghas sin ann fá láthair, agus is foirgnimh nua ar fad 115 díobh sin agus 13 díomh is sean-fhoirgnimh iad ar cuireadh páirteanna móra nua leo.</P>
    <P>Céad agus sé cinn de na foirgnimh lán-nua sin agus sé cinn de na foirgnimh a fairsingíodh, tá siad i gceantair na gCoistí Contae.  Tá sé de dheagh-thoradh ar sholáthar na bhfoirgneamh sin go bhfuil fáil anois ag roinnt mhór de na daoine ar oideachas leanúnach a cuireadh in oiriúint do gach riachtanas dá mbaineann leis an gceanntar ina bhfuil comhnaí orthu. Faoi na forála airgeadais atá sa mBille seo, táthar ag brath tuirim is 100 eíle scol-fhoirgneamh a dhéanamh, agus nuair a bheas siad san curtha ar fáil, is beag nach mbeidh gairm-oideachais i bhfoigseacht chúig míle do gach duine dá bhfuil sa tír.</P>
    <P>Cúrsaí Lae: Nuair a tháinig Seisiún 1935-36, bhí na saghsanna seo a leanas de chúrsaí lae dhá n-oibriú go coitianta:&mdash;(a) Cúrsa Coiteann Oiliúnach (Buachaillí agus Cailíní); (b) Ceard-Chúrsa Sóisearach (Buachaillí); (c) Cúrsa Sóisearach i dTíos (Cailíní); (d) Cúrsa Sóisearach i dTráchtáil (Buachaillí agus Cailíní); (e) Cúrsa Sóisearach Tuaithe (Buachaillí).  Na ceithre cúrsaí tosaigh, nó cuid díobh, bhí siad i bhfeidhm sna Contae-Bhuirgí agus sna Baile-Cheanntair mhóra.  Sna ceanntair tuaithe, ní raibh bunaithe ach Cúrsaí Sóisearacha i dTíos do Chailíni agus Cúrsaí Sóisearacha Tuaithe do Bhuachaillí.</P>
    <P>Furmhór na scol ina bhfuil na cúrsaí seo i bhfeidhm, tá siad ina láithreáin áitiúla oideachais do pháistí a mbíonn an bhun-scoil fághta acu agus iad os cionn 14 mblian d'aois. Níthear freastal maith ar scoileanna na mbaile-cheanntar mór.  Tá obair fhónta oideasach dhá déanamh ag na scoileanna sin, agus cuireann siad tréineáil luachmhar ar fáil don aos óg a bhíos ag súil le fostú ar ball.</P>
    <P>Tá sé ag teacht ina nós sna ceantair seo go dtéann páistí cheithre mblian <Col N="311" /> déag chun na Gairm-Scoile sul a dtosnaíonn siad ag obair sa mbaile nó lasmuigh den bhaile, agus fágann sin go bhfuil cuid de na scoileanna chomh líonta, cheana, agus is féidir dóibh bheith.  Go páirteach, tá an nós sin ag fás toisc na tuismitheoir a bheith ag tuigsint, do réir a chéile, cad is fiú an t-oideachas seo; ach, go mór-mhór, tá sé ag fás toisc go bhfuil méadú buan ag teacht ar an líon fostaitheoir a bhíos ag iarraidh oibrithe d'fháil ó na scoileanna gairm-oideachais.  Is fíor, áfach, gur deacair freastal iomlán d'fháil i gcuid de na scoileanna tuaithe. Caitear cuid de na páistí a ligean dá bhfostú toisc a dtuarastal a bheith ag teastáil go géar ó na teaghlaigh ar díobh iad; agus caitear cuid eile a chur ag obair sa mbaile, i séasúir áirithe, toisc nach mbíonn cúnamh eile le fáil in obair na bhfeirm.</P>
    <P>Ach, dá ainneoin sin, is deimhin go mbeadh an freastal i bhfad ní ba bhuaine, dá dtuigeadh na daoine a riachtanaí atá sé a thuilleadh oideachais a thabhairt don aos óg sul a gcuirtear ag saothrú a mbeatha iad sa mbaile, nó as an mbaile.  Is áthas liom, áfach, a bheith i ndon a rá go bhfuil feabhas ag teacht ar an scéal le dó nó trí de bhlianta.</P>
    <P>Haithníodh, do réir a chéile, ar an obair gurb iad na Cúrsaí Leanúnacha lán-aimsire ab fhearr toradh, agus, i Meitheamh, 1942, chuir an Roinn amach Meamram V. 40, ina bhfuil cur-síos ar na cuspóirí agus ar na modha oibre is cóir a bheith ag Oideachas Leanúnach.</P>
    <P>Scoileanna Tuaithe: Sna buirgí agus ina lán de na baile-cheantair mhóra, bhí scoileanna tar éis a bheith ag obair ar feadh roinnt bhlian, agus bhí cúrsaí lae acu a bhí cosúil leis na cúrsaí lae atá ann fá láthair, ach go raibh siad ar scála i bhfad ní ba lú.  Chuir Acht 1930 i gcumas na scol sin cuid mhaith fair-singe agus feabhsuithe a dhéanamh ar na háiseanna bhí acu cheana, agus tharla, dá bharr san, gurb iad na baile-cheanntair is tréine a bhí ag éileamh cúnta ar na Coistí Contae sna chéad bhlianta a bhí an tAcht i bhfeidhm. San am chéanna, ní dearnadh ach fíorbheagán chun áiseanna Gairm-Oideachais a chur ar fáil sna ceantair tuaithe.  Tar éis bhliain a 1935 a tosnaíodh <Col N="312" /> i gceart ar thithe scoile a dhéanamh agus ar chúrsaí leanúnacha lán-aimsire d'éagrú sna ceantair sin.  Ar dtús, níor cuireadh mórán dalta chun na scol seo, óir ní ró-thapaidh tháinig léargas chun muinntir na tuaithe ar an sochar d'fhéadfadh a gclann a bhaint as na cúrsaí nua.</P>
    <P>Do réir a chéile, áfach, bhítheas ag aithneachtáil an tsochair sin ar dheaobair na scol, agus féadfaí a rá, i Seisiún a 1939-40, go raibh an Ghairm-Scoile Tuaithe tar éis ionad buan di féin a bhaint amach i gcóras Ghairm-Oideachas na tíre.</P>
    <P>Tá 98 den tsaghas sin scoile ann fá láthair, agus tá garradhanta lena n-ais ag 90 díobh sin.  Caitear níos mó ná leath an scol-ama le hábhair a bhfuil dlúth-bhaint acu le hobair ar an talamh agus i dtithe na tuaithe.</P>
    <P>I dteannta na n-ábhar coitoanta, tugtar teagasc do na buachaillí ar Eolaíocht Tuaithe, ar Obair Adhmaid, ar Líníocht agus ar Mhatamaitic Cheardúil, agus tugtar teagasc do na cailíní ar Chócaireacht, ar Obair Snáthaide, ar Níochán, ar Bhainisteoireacht Tí agus ar Eolaíocht Tís.</P>
    <P>Sa gcúrsa ar Eolaíocht Tuaithe, féachtar do gach ceann de na prionsabail is mó tábhacht sa bhFeirmeoireacht; sa gcúrsa ar Eolaíocht Tís tugtar aire do gach bun-eolas a theastódh ó chailín chun an tuigsint cheart a bheith aici ar obair mná ina teach féin.</P>
    <P>Ní foláir, áfach, a rá nach féidir breithiúnas fíor a dhéanamh ar oibriú an Ghairm-Oideachais sa tuaith, agus gan féachaint ach ar aon scoil amháin díobh siúd.  Ní hionann agus brainsí eile oideachais, is riachtanach a thuigsint, sa gcás so, nach í an scoil atá ina haonad ach an ceanntar maguairt ar feadh sé ná seacht de mhílte; agus is riachtanach a thuigsint gur le haghaidh na ndaoine go léir atá an scoil ann agus nach amháin le haghaidh an aosa óig a bhíos tar éis an bhun-scoil d'fhágaint.</P>
    <P>Go coitianta, bíonn ceithre múinteoirí lán-aimsire ann&mdash;múinteoir in Obair Láimhe, múinteoir i dTíos, múinteóir a theagascas Gaeilgé maraon le hábhair eile, agus múinteoir a bhfuil céim aige in Eolaíocht Talmhaíochta agus a bhíos, de ghnáth, i gceannas na <Col N="313" /> scoile.  Bíonn an ceathrar páirteach in obair na Lá-Scoile agus, ina theannta san, bíonn ranganna tráthnóna acu sa scoil féin agus i láithreáin eile sa scoilcheantar. Sa gcaoi sin, tugtar riar d'ocht láithreáin fá seach, agus tugtar Gairm-Oideachas i gcomhghar daoine fásta atá ina gcomhnaí ro-fhada ón lár-scoil chun dul chun na ranganna a bhíos ansin.</P>
    <P>Chun treoir a thabhairt do mhúinteoirí Eolaíochta Tuaithe, chuir an Roinn amach Meamram, i mbliain a 1944.  Cuireadh sa Meamram san an t-eolas a bhí faighte, cheana, de thoradh na hoibre agus, ina theannta san, bhí treoracha agus cláir oibre ann maidir le cúrsaí na chéad bhliana agus an dara bliain, agus maidir leis an gcaoi cheart chun scol-gharrdha a leagan amach.</P>
    <P>Na ranganna tráthnóna in Eolaíocht Talmhaíochta a cuireadh ar bun sna blianta seo caite, tá sé cruthaíthe acu gur mhaith abfhiú iad a thionnscnamh sna Gairm-Scoileanna Tuaithe.</P>
    <P>Tagann feirmeoirí agus a gcuid oibrí chun na gcoimhthionól so, agus níthear caint agus díospóireachta ar phríomhphrionsabail na heolaíochta a bhaineas le feirmeoireacht.  Saghas fónta oideachais do dhaoine fásta is ea é seo, agus féadfaí a úsáid ar shlite a rachadh chun sochair do gach dream de mhuintir na tuaithe.</P>
    <P>Ceard-Oideachas: I gcóras an Cheard-Oideachais, freisin, rinneadh atharuithe chomh fónta leis na nithe atá luaite agam.  Tar éis 1930, thosnaigh na Coistí Gairm-Oideachais ar shaothar na scol a thabhairt ní ba dlúithe in oiriúint do riachtanais thionnscalacha a gceantar, agus thosnaigh siad ag fairsingiú an teagaisc a tugtar do lucht ceard agus do lucht obair speisealta i monarchain.  Chuir na Ceard-Scoileanna chun ranganna speisealta a chur ar fáil a thabharfadh tréineáil d'oibrithe a bhí fostaithe, nó a bhféadfaí a bhfostú, san iomad tionnscal nua a bunaíodh sa tír seo le blianta gairide anuas.  Tháinig a leithéidí sin de ranganna le chéile sna Gairm-Scoileanna nó sna monarchain féin. Imeasc na gceard agus na dtionnscal a bhfuil na ranganna ag dul chun sochair dóibh tá Déantóireacht Aliminium, Déantóireacht Bróg, Déantóireacht <Col N="314" /> Cnaipí, Criadóireacht, Obair Bhiatais, Súdaireacht, Déantóireacht Miotal-Shreang, agus Tionnscail na hOlla.  De bharr na rang san tháinig feabhas ar lámh-thoradh na n-oibrí a bhí oilte cheana féin agus, ina theannta sin, is iomdha monarcha bhí i ndon tosnú go luath ar tháirgeadh, toisc a cuid oibrí a bheith tréineáilte roimh ré ag na Coistí Gairm-Oideachais.</P>
    <P>Maraon leis na scéimeanna sealadacha so, cuireadh ar bun scéimeanna eile chun tréineáil bhliantúil a thabhairt d'oibríthe nó do phrintísigh. Furmhór na scéim seo, tá siad i bhfeidhm sna Scoileanna Gairm-Oideachais atá faoi stiúradh ag Coiste Gairm-Oideachais Chathair Bhaile Átha Cliath, agus baineann siad lena leithéidí seo de chearda&mdash;Déantóireacht Bróg, Saoirseacht Brící, Obair Adhmaid agus Siúinéireacht, Cócaireacht Tithe Ósta, Oibriú Gléas Cinema, Trealmhaireacht Leictreach, Péinteáil agus Maisiú, Dóibóireacht, Obair Luaidhe, Clódóireacht, Táilliúireacht agus Déantóireacht Uaireadóir.  Scéimeanna an-suimiúla is ea an scéim chun tréineáil a thabhairt do phrintísigh i Monarchain Bhiatais, an scéim do phrintísigh an Bhord Soláthair Leictreachais agus an scéim a ceapadh le gairid do phrintísigh Chumann na Mótor-Thrádalaithe Éireannach.  Is den ghrúpa seo, freisin, Meicneoirí an Aer-Fhórsa, agus toghtar triocha díobh sin, gach bliain, as buachaillí a chríochnuigh dhá bhliain de Cheard-Chúrsa Sóisearach sna Scoileanna Gairm-Oideachais. Maidir le printísigh Chóras Iompair Éireann, tá scéim leathan tréineála dhá tabhairt chun foirfeachta ag Roinn na bhFoireann den Chóras agus ag na húdaráis scol i gcomhar le chéile.  Nuair a bheas an scéim seo dhá hoibriú ina hiomláine, béidh suas le 500 printíseach faoi n-a réir i gCathair Bhaile Átha Cliath féin. Táthar tar éis buan-scéimeanna a leagan amach chun tréineáil a thabhairt do phrintísigh le Déantóireacht Troscáin, le Gruaig-dheisiú, agus le Péinteáil agus Maisiú, i gCathair Bhaile Átha Cliath, agus tá na scéimeanna seo faoi rialacháin na gCoiste a bunaíodh faoi Acht Printíseachta 1931.</P>
    <P>Do réir mar chuaigh an cheardtréineáil i bhfeabhas, d'éirigh sé <Col N="315" /> riachtanach caighdeáin áirithe cháilíochta a cheapadh mar mhaithe leis na fostoírí agus leis na hoibríthe in éineacht; agus, ar an ábhar san, chuir an Roinn ar bun córas nua scrúdúchán i gcóir teastas, i mbliain a 1936.  Tá na teastais seo roinnte ina ndá shaghas&mdash; teastais cheardaíochta agus teastais tráchtála&mdash;agus tá a n-iarrthóirí ag dul go buan a líonmhaireacht ó rinneadh an córas nua scrúdúchán a thionnscnamh.</P>
    <P>Tréineáil Múinteoir.  O thaínig an méadú mór ar áiseanna gairm-oideachais de thoradh Achta 1930, ba riachtanach foirne líonmhar múinteoir a thréineáil, agus is ba mhian leis an Roinn go mbeadh na múinteoirí sin chomh dea-cháilithe agus b'fhéidir. Fuarthas roinnt áirithe ó na hIolscoileanna, ach is í an Roinn féin a thréineáil a bhfurmhór mór, agus rinneadh sin trí ghearr-chúrsaí de dhian-tréineáil nó trí chúrsaí eile a mhair dó nó trí de bhlianta.</P>
    <P>Sa tréimhse 1930-45, cuireadh 500 le líon na múinteoir lán-aimsire&mdash;tuairim is 250 do Thíos, tuairim is 100 d'obair adhmaid, tuairim is 100 d'Eolaíocht Tuaithe agus tuairim is 50 d'Obair Mhiotail.  Ba riachtanach líon na Múinteoirí Tís a bheith mór, toisc go gcaitheann ban-mhúinteoirí éirí as an obair nuair a phósas siad.  I Seisiún 1932-33 bhí 649 de na múinteoirí lánaimsire fostaithe; i Seisiún 1944-45 bhí 988 díobh ann.  Ina theannta san, bhí 766 múinteoirí páirt-aimsire ag obair. Gach bliain, bíonn ath-chúrsaí áirithe ann faoi stiúradh na Roinne, chun go mbeidh caoi ag na múinteóirí a bheith ar chomh-chéim le dul-chun-cinn na n-ábhar a bhíos dá dteagasc aca.</P>
    <P>An Ghaeilge: O thosach na hoibre anuas, níor ligeadh faillí in aithbheochaint na Gaeilge ná i nGaelú na Scol i gcoitinne.  I gcompráid le scoileanna na mBrainsí eile oideachais, chaitheadh an obair a bheith pas mall sna scoileanna seo toisc easba ceard-mhúinteoir a bhí cáilithe chun teagasc trí Ghaeilge. Mar sin de, tosnaíodh go luath ar chúrsaí samhraidh i nGaeilge d'eagrú do ghairm-mhúinteoirí agus, i mbliain a 1932, tionnscnadh an scrúdúchan le haghaidh an Cheard-Teastais Ghaeilge. Faoi na Scéimeanna Gairm-Oideachais, is é sin an cháilíocht a chaitheadh a bheith ag múinteoirí abhar eile seachas <Col N="316" /> an Ghaeilge, agus is riachtanach anois é a bheith ag na gairm-mhúinteoirí lánaimsire go léir, beagnach.</P>
    <P>Maidir le teagasc na Gaeilge féin, níor mheas an Roinn go raibh dul-chun-cinn sáthach maith dhá dhéanamh sna Scéimeanna Gairm-Oideachais, agus tionnscnadh cúrsaí speisealta chun múinteoirí a thréineáil sna modha teagaisc is fearr, agus chun a dtréineáil i saghasanna eile oibre a measadh bheith riachtanach chun labhairt na teangan a chur ar aghaidh mar ba cheart.  Ar fud na tíre fá láthair, tá na múinteoirí seo ag cur spioraid nua sna ranganna Gaeilge.  Gach bliain, tugtar scoláireachtaí do 600 dalta, nó mar sin, chun a chur ina gcumas a bheith ag freastal, ar feadh míosa, ar Chúrsaí speisealta sa nGaeltacht.</P>
    <P>Airgeadas an Gairm-Oideachais: Is é is príomh-chuspóir do Bhille seo oiread de bhreis-chístí a sholáthar do Choistí Gairm-Oideachais agus a chuirfeas ina gcumas coimhlíonadh a dhéanamh ar na feidhmeanna atá leagtha amach do gach Coiste in Acht 1930, viz:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(A)  córas oiriúnach d'oideachas leanúnach a bhunú agus a bhuanú do réir an Achta ina gceantar féin, agus soláthar a dhéanamh chun a leithéid sin de chóras a thabhairt i bhforás, diaidh ar ndiaidh;</P>
    <P>(B)  soláthar, nó soláthar-i-gcabhair, a dhéanamh ina gceantar féin, do réir Acht an Ghairm-Oideachais.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Mar sin de, ba mhaith liom anois achoimre a thabhairt de na forála airgeadais atá in Acht 1930.  Do réir an Achta sin, d'fhéadfadh Coistí Gairm-Oideachais suas go dtí 6p. sa £1 de shintiúis d'fháil as na rátaí áitiúla sna ceithre Contae-Bhuirgí agus sna seacht mBaile-Cheantair atá sceidealta san Acht, agus féadfaí suas go dtí 4p. sa £1 d'fháil i gcás na gCoistí Contae.  Bhí deontais ón Stát iníoctha, freisin, agus socraíodh ar ball gurbh é a bheadh iontu sin ná (1) bundeontas a rialófaí do réir an mhéid Stát-Chúnta a bhí dhá fháil ag an gCoiste roimh 1930, agus (2) breis-deontas a bheadh do réir an mhéid ráta a fuarthas de bhreis ar minimum áirithe.  (3p. an minimum ba ghnáthach a bheith sna cathracha agus sna mór-bailte, agus 1¾p. sna Contaethe.) <Col N="317" /> £1 os comhair gach £1 de ráta áitiúil is ea an breis-deontas sna Contaethe agus i gCathair Bhaile Cliath; £4 os comhair an £1 atá sna baile-cheantair sceidealta, agus £2 os comhair an £1 i nDún Laoghaire.  Níor bhfhéidir, áfach, an síntiús áitiúil a mhéadú ach do réir ¼p. gach bliain agus, ar an ábhar sin, ní raibh an 4p. de shíntíús  le fáil ag na Coistí Contae go dtí an bhliain airgeadais ar thús di an lú Aibreán, 1940; agus ní raibh an 6p. de shíntiús áitiúil le fáil sna cathracha agus sna mór-bhailte go dtí an bhliain airgeadais ar thús dí an lú Aibreán, 1942.</P>
    <P>Ní raibh na maxima sroichte ach i gceithre contaethe agus i gceithre baile-cheantair ar na dátaí atá luaite agam.</P>
    <P>I mbliain a 1944, bhí Bille (Leasúcháin) Gairm-Oideachais againn, agus baineadh feidhm as chun 1p. sa £1 de bhreis ráta d'fháil do na Coistí a raibh an maximum sroichte acu agus ar theastaigh níos mó uathu mar gheall ar an méadú caiteachais a tharla ann de bharr na hEigeandála&mdash;go háirithe sa méid a bhain leis an mBónas Costas Maireachtana agus leis an mBónas Eigeandála.</P>
    <P>Fá láthair, tá na maxima sroichte ag 12 de na 27 gCoisti Contae agus ag 5 den 11 Choiste Baile-Cheantair; agus, lasmuigh de Chathair Bhaile Átha Cliath, is beag nach bhfuil deireadh foráis curtha i gcrich ag na Baile-Cheantair, do réir an scála atá anois ann.  Ach tá a lán le déanamh sna Contaetha, beagnach go léir, sula bhféadtar a rá go bhfuil áiseanna Gairm-Oideachais curtha ar fáil do thromlach mhór na ndaoine.  Mar adúirt mé cheana, tá tuairim is céad scol-fhoirgneamh nua le déanamh go fóill.  Ní bheidh ina bhfurmhór san ach ó 2 go dtí 4 seomraí agus bhéaraidh siad Gairm-Oideachas isteach i gceantair nach raibh a leithéid iontu cheana, cé is moite de ghearr-chúrsaí anois agus arís.  Deacrachta aimsir an chogaidh, níor lig siad don Ghairm-Oideachas dul ar aghaidh i mBaile Átha Cliath sa chaoi ina mbeadh sé ar chomh-chéim le mear-fhás na cathrach ó thaobh achair agus ó thaobh deonra; agus caifear, ar a laghad, cúig nó sé cinn nua de scoileanna réigiúnacha a dhéanamh in aghaidh an éilimh atá ar <Col N="318" /> chúrsaí deontacht Gairm-Oideachais ar fud na cathrach.</P>
    <P>Pé scéal é, tá dian-aire dhá tabhairt do na riachtanais seo ag Coiste Gairm-Oideachais na Cathrach, agus táthar ag ullmhú chun na háiseanna atá ag teastáil a sholáthar chomh luath agus bheas fáil ar ábhair foirgneamh agus ar threalamh scol.</P>
    <P>Tá tuille airgid ag teastáil anois; meastar go mbeidh 2d. sa bpunt sa mbreis ag teastáil agus tá beartaithe in alt a dó den Bhille seo gan ach ½d. sa bpunt de mhéadú a leagan in aghaidh na bliana agus go dtosnófar sa mbliain 1947-48.</P>
    <P>Is céard atá beartaithe in alt a trí ná bearna a bhí i seirbhís inphinsin oide de chuid Choiste Chathair Luimnigh a dhúnadh.  Idir 1919 agus 1923 a tharla an bhearna sin agus seo mar a thárla: Le linn réim an tSasanaigh do shocraigh an Coiste a bhí ann san am&mdash; Coiste Ceard-Oideachais Luimnigh&mdash; nach mbeadh aon bhaint acu feasta leis an Department of Agriculture and Technical Instruction, ach go bhfeidhmeodh siad fá Dháil Éireann.  Cuireadh an socrú sin i bhfeidhm agus lean siad orthu ag obair go ceann bliana nó mar sin agus níor tosnaíodh arís go dtí 1923. Lean an t-oide atá i gceist ag obair fán gCoiste le linn dóibh a bheith ag feidhmiú fán Dáil agus fostaíodh arís é nuair a thosaigh an Coiste arís.</P>
    <P>An rud atá beartaithe in alt a ceathair freisin is de dheascaibh an tsocruithe a rinne Coisde Luimnigh&mdash; feidhmiú fá scáth na Dála sa mbliain 1919&mdash;a tharla sé.  Do dhiúltaigh an chuid is mó den fhoirinn leanach i seirbhís an Choiste tar éis an athruithe seo agus do tugadh uas-phinsin nó uas-aiscí dóibh fá Alt 8 den Local Government Act, 1919.  (Rinneadh socrú fán Acht Cúitimh Oifigeacha Aitiúla (Tréimhse Chogaidh), 1924, i gcóir na n-íocaíocht sin as Cistí an Stáit).  D'éirigh leis an gCoiste oidí eile d'fháil le leanacht den obair fá scáth na Dála agus ar na hoidí sin bhí oide Adhmadóireachta a thug suas a cheart chun pinsin a fháil fá Acht 1919 i ngeall ar gur éirigh sé as an bpost a bhí aige fá Choiste Cheard-Oideachais eile (.i.

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I have often thought of suggesting that we are getting into a wrong practice with regard to the Second Reading of Bills.  A practice has grown up of reading very informative and interesting statements and of explaining on the Second Stage of a Bill everything that is in each section. I think that it would be much better if, for example, this evening, the Minister were to tell us, either in Irish or English, what he thinks has been accomplished for vocational education under the Act of 1930 and subsequent amendments and what his doubts are, because, as an intelligent man, he must have doubts about certain things in any scheme, instead of treating us to this cold, detailed account of the whole business.  There is also growing up another practice under which the Irish language is used more about education than any other subject.  It seems to me that the very reverse should be the case.  In education, we are endeavouring to do something extremely difficult and we should explain it to the parents of the children who do not understand the Irish language. For myself, I think I use Irish, in the ordinary way, as much as any member of the House every day of my life, but, with your permission, A Chathaoirligh, I shall deal with this Bill in English, though there is one part of my case for which Irish would be peculiarly suitable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We could have an interesting discussion on Second Stage&mdash;we are free to discuss on that stage vocational education generally&mdash;on the question of vocational or technical education. As the Minister recognises, we should make absolutely certain that vocational education is vocational, that it deals with the crafts of the cities and towns and the crafts and mode of life of the country, and that it does not bring to country pupils what is called a white-collar bias.  I recognise that a very distinct effort has been made to avoid that danger.  Vocational education should be so arranged that it <Col N="321" /> could be availed of by adults, that it would excite in adults an interest in and desire for more education, because any educational system which does not send the pupils out at the end of the educational course of childhood with a desire to learn more has been a failure.  Our vocational scheme &mdash;whatever we call it&mdash;should make as much effort as it can to cope with adults who want to get more education.</P>
    <P>The other condition which, as a teacher in technical schools a long time ago, I saw myself and about which I hear a great deal at present, is that pupils who attend vocational schools should have a sufficiently sound general education to benefit by the specialised education they get in these schools. If I am to believe what I hear, from experienced and very highly skilled teachers, that is very often not the case, particularly in the City of Dublin. Perhaps at this moment there may be special circumstances connected with the recent teachers' strike, but very often the pupils who present themselves, particularly when there has been a gap between the time they leave school and the time they enter the vocational school, are not sufficiently skilled either in Irish or English to benefit by that education&mdash;for example, to take notes.  On that point, the vocational teacher who purports to teach cookery, domestic science or any other subject of a specialised nature should not be expected to do the work of a primary teacher by correcting the notes which the pupils take from the point of view of spelling and general set-out.</P>
    <P>Before I come to the point which I rose to mention, I should like to hear from the Minister what are the special courses in Irish to which he alludes. I know that special courses in Irish are given in the summer, but I am not quite clear what precisely they are about.  I know that university graduates of considerable merit from the three colleges have in some cases presented themselves for these courses, but I do not quite understand what the courses are, and I should like to express a very grave doubt that vocational teachers working under local bodies, the employees of a local body or of the Government, can do anything <Col N="322" /> to revive the spirit which once permeated the Irish-Ireland movement. I very seriously doubt it.  I do not know whether any number of summer courses or any amount of push will do what the Minister said: Tá na múinteóiri seo ag cur spiorad nua ins na ranganna Gaeilge.  I wonder are they. I wonder can they.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that our whole movement&mdash;and, Heaven knows, I had, and have yet, a passionate interest in it&mdash; has failed if nobody can be got to do anything, unless he is pushed by either a servant of the Government or a servant of a local authority.  If that is the case, it has failed, and we ought to look our failure straight in the face before it is too late and before we reach a point when we will not have time to take any other steps, save the steps&mdash;perhaps the wrong steps&mdash;we are taking now.  I have some difficulty in understanding what it is proposed to teach the university graduate who has done a first-class course in Irish in Dublin, Cork or Galway and who has done, as I think every teacher of Irish ought to have done, another language&mdash;English, French, German or Latin&mdash;and who has reached that standard of education.</P>
    <P>I do not know what vague form of Gaelachas&mdash;if that is the word&mdash;can be instilled into these people to make them any better than the university leaves them.  It is not entirely a matter of teaching and not entirely a matter of spirit.  You cannot take a person of 22 years of age and teach him some kind of new spirit.  Everybody knows that.</P>
    <P>I particularly wish now to make some comments on a certain matter.  I do so with very great reluctance.  I have considered the matter very carefully. I considered if before, and on one occasion a motion was put down here by a Senator who is not now a member of the House dealing with a related matter.  It was not proceeded with.  It seems to me to be a matter which, from the point of view of Irish and the good of the Irish language, has gone so far that it must be publicly alluded to.  I refer to the methods adopted by a particular inspector, the chief inspector of the <Col N="323" /> vocational schools.  Inspection of schools should be quiet and should be helpful; it should not be hectoring and should not be embarrassing.  I think that will be agreed.  It is accepted by the Minister and by the whole of us in relation to every such scheme everywhere that an inspector of schools should be a more skilled and learned person than the teacher, that he should act accordingly and should be an example to the pupils of good manners and good behaviour.  Authority of any kind confers rights but it also carries duties, and, as the Minister knows&mdash;I am not attacking the Minister in any sense; I think his attitude in the matter is quite sound&mdash;the higher the authority one has, the less obtrusive that authority needs to be.</P>
    <P>The attitude of the Department of Education towards inspection has sometimes been questioned.  They were put to the test recently and my information is that they came through that test extremely well.  I want to give the Minister credit for that. When the national teachers' strike concluded, certain matters were there to be disposed of, and I understand that the attitude of the Department with regard to inspection was peculiarly helpful and very sound. Certain general inspections were postponed and generally everything possible was done to make the reentry of the teachers into their work smooth and easy and in no way humiliating.  That having been done, and that being the view of the Minister and his principal officials, it is all the more grave and all the more serious that a certain line should be taken, particularly in Dublin city, by the chief inspector of these vocational schools which does very grave harm to the cause of the Irish language.  The man is supposed to be an enthusiast for the Irish language and supposed to be in earnest and that makes it all the worse, because, most emphatically, he is not doing good.</P>
    <P>Let me give a few examples.  The chief inspector of vocational schools goes into a teacher's class with his hat on.  After a while, he removes it, but <Col N="324" /> he goes in with his hat on to inspect the teacher, to mark the roll.  What are the pupils to feel, if he talks Irish, but that the Irish language is something associated with boorishness and bad manners?  That is my particular grievance in this case, but let me give a few more examples.  I know a distinguished graduate of the National University&mdash;I think Senator Mrs. Concannon knows her well&mdash;who was made to stand for three-quarters of an hour after she had lectured for two hours in the presence of this gentleman.  It is not because she is a graduate that I object.  It should not be done to any woman or to any man, either, and I think the Minister must take notice of that kind of conduct.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>May I say that if Senator Hayes or any other Senator wants information about the conduct of any official of the Department of Education, he can communicate with me?  If he is not satisfied with that and if he intends to raise the matter publicly because he considers the matter of gravity, one would imagine that, in fairness to the officer who is being charged in this very public way and in fairness to me who am responsible for the officer, the opportunity ought to be given in advance of knowing the nature of these charges.  Senator Hayes has gone even further than referring to particular incidents in <Col N="325" /> Dublin; he has gone back upon the record of the officer before he took up his present position.  May I inquire where is the Senator's diatribe to stop?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am going to deal with inspection of a particular character in vocational schools in this city because I have come to the conclusion, as a responsible person, that no other course is open to me in dealing with this matter.  I have a right to deal with it and I intend, subject to your authority, Sir, to exercise that right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me give another example.  A teacher who does not know Irish very well, and there are plenty of teachers in vocational schools who are very competent and do not know Irish well, has to stand before her class and be talked to in Irish to her own embarrassment and to the embarrassment of her pupils by this particular inspector. Now, similarly, for example&mdash;I have mentioned this particular instance to the Minister in conversation&mdash;an inspector goes into a class and talks to the class and then he talks to the teacher.  The pupils know Irish and can hear what he says to the teacher in Irish.  He uses a phrase such as this, for example: &ldquo;Mar sin do theip ort&rdquo;&mdash;so you failed.  Nothing should be done to a teacher in front of her class, or indeed anywhere else, which, by any process, will reduce the teacher's prestige.  We are all agreed upon that.  I am sure the Minister agrees with it, too.  This particular kind of thing is especially bad with regard to Irish.  I have a particular objection to it because it associates the people who normally speak Irish with bad manners, and whatever defects our country people may have, whether they be Irish-speaking or English-speaking, it can certainly be said of them that they are extremely good-mannered.  I have seen that myself for years in the Irish-speaking districts of the County Waterford.  I have seen it in Donegal and in Connemara and this year in both Kerry and Cork.  There is nothing farther from the ordinary person who speaks the Irish language than any form of ignorance or boorishness of this nature, and for that reason it is particularly objectionable that the <Col N="326" /> Irish language should be associated with it.  I would like in the most public way to put on record as a person in favour of the Irish language my very firm objection to that kind of conduct.</P>
    <P>In the beginning of his History of Ireland, Edmund Curtis says this:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The traditions of the Irish people are the oldest of any race in Europe north and west of the Alps, and they themselves are the longest settled on their own soil&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>We have a long tradition in this country and a noble tradition, and we must do our very best to maintain it.  We must, particularly, associate anything connected with the Irish language with a thing which we find so plentiful in the country, whatever else may be lacking, and that is good manners.</P>
    <P>I suggest that we ought not to endeavour to push the Irish language in technical schools by methods which are bound to put the pupils against you, because as I have frequently remarked here before, Parliaments and Governments are very limited in authority when all is said and done. There are things which no Parliament and no Minister can do, and if the pupils in the vocational schools do not like Irish, the Minister cannot make them like it, and most emphatically no scheme of pushing, dragging and pressing, and no scheme by hectoring, bullying or embarrassing is going to make the situation in the schools what the Minister wants to have it, or what I would like to have it.  For that reason I would like that something should be done to see that teachers should be treated as they ought to be treated and as they are treated, for example, in the secondary and in most of the primary schools, and that the Irish language should not be associated in the vocational schools with any method which can be criticised on the ground that it is an un-Irish method and an unmannerly method.</P>

Chuír an tAire in iúl dúinn gur thuig sé an cheist go maith agus go ndéanfadh sé beart dá réir nuair a gheobhadh sé an deis air.  Tá a gheallúint comhlíonta go maith aige mar, idir na deontais speisialta atá sé tar éis a cheadú do choiste áirithe agus an bhreis ioncaim a bheas le fáil de thoradh an Bhille seo, beifear i ndon cur go mór leis an tseirbhís ghairm-oideachais feasta.</P>
      <P>Is fiú an t-airgead a chaitheamh ar an obair.  Is fiú airgead breise a chatheamh ar gach brainse oideachais. Ach is fiú a lán a chaitheamh ar ghairm-oideachais mar, taobh amuigh dá thairbhe mhór mar oideachas ann féin, is folas go mbrathann meadú ar an ioncam náisiúnta ar oiliúint, ar mheabhair, ar stuaim agus ar dhílseacht oibrithe na tíre.  Is do réir a n-éifeacht siadsan a bheas an t-ioncam ann le breis chabhrach a thabhairt do na brainsí eile oideachais agus léinn agus fós is ar a n-éifeacht siúd a bhrathas sé cé acu is féidir leanacht ar chaighdeán maireachtála an phobail i gcoiteanta a mhéadú.</P>

    <P>Tá aon phointe amháin eile ar mian liom tagairt di, agus sílim go n-aontófar liom, agus pointe tábhachtach í.  Is iomdha cineál seirbhíseach poiblí atá againn ach ní mheastím go bhfuil aon dream ann is fearr a thugas seirbhís don tír ná na Príomh-Oifigigh Ghairm-Oideachais. Níl aon dream, ar m-eolas sa go háirithe, is lú a smaoiníos orthu féin ná is lú a spárálan iad féin ina gcuid oibre ná na príomh-oifigigh céanna.  Duine ar bith a scrúdós airgeadas na gCoistí, ní fhéadfaidh sé gan iongnadh a bheith air faoin a laghad don ioncam agus a caitear ar riarachán. Tá moladh mór ag dul do na príomh-oifigigh dá bharr sin; tá moladh ag dul dóibh a fheabhas agus a éiríos a bheith tíobhasach sa riarachán ionas go mbeidh an oiread agus is féidir ann le caitheamh ar theagasc.</P>
    <P>Ach sílim go bhfuil sé in am&mdash;nó b'fhéidir tamall maith thar am&mdash;go ndéanfar athbhreithniú ar scálaí a gcuid tuarastail.  Níl fúm comórtas a dhéanamh idir tuarastail oifigeach éagsúla.  Ní bheadh sé ceart ar an ócáid seo go háirithe.  Ach molaim go láidir don Aire obair agus mortabháil phríomh-oifigeach Contae na Gaillimhe agus phríomh-oifigeach Chontae Mhuigheo mar shomplaí a scrúdú.  I gcomhréir leis an méid airgid atá le caitheamh go bliantúil acu, i gcomhréir le fairsinge a gcuid scéimeanna, líonmhare a gcuid scoltachta agus ranganna, níl cothrom na féinne á fháil acu.  Cuimhnítear go bhfuil limistéir mhóra Gaeltachta agus Galltachta faoi n-a gcúram chomh maith, agus tuigfear go réidh chomh trom agus tá cúram orthu.  Ba mhaith liom, agus iarraim go díoghraiseach ar an Aire, <Col N="330" /> geallúint a thabhairt dúinn go scrúdódh sé an pointe seo.  Má níonn sé sin, níl aon aimhreas orm faoi chéard a dhéanfas sé.  Tá tagairt déanta cheana do alt a cúig den Bhille agus don &ldquo;canvass&rdquo; atá déanta ag aicme áirithe ina thaobh.  Tá súil agam nach n-athróidh an Seanad an t-alt seo.  Tá sé riachtanach.  Ba chóir go mbeadh caighdeán an oideachais agus caighdeán an teagaisc agus caighdeán an riaracháin chomh hárd agus is féidir. Cuideoidh an t-alt seo leis an méid sin a chur in áirithe.  Oifigeach, múinteoir nó seirbhíseach a níos a cuid oibre go maith, níl aon ghá imní a bheith air. Is tábhachtaí leas na ndaoine a bheith i n-áirithe ná cosaint a thabhairt d'aon oifigeach nó seirbhíseach mí éifeachtach nó mí-fheiliúnach, is cuma cé hé.  Ach is dócha go mbeidh tuilleamh faoin gceist seo ar ball.</P>
    <P>Is maith liom an Bille agus is maith liom an tuairisc atá tugtha inniu dhúinn ag an Aire ar an obair atá déanta agus ar an méid atá beartaithe aige.  Bíodh a fhios aige go bhfuil obair déanta aige agus go bhfuil obair beartaithe nach bhfhéadfaí é a mholadh sáthach árd chóiche dá bhárr.</P>
    <P>Is iongnadh liom nach raibh aon tagairt go dtí seo do alt a 5 sa mBille. B'fhéidir go bhfuil sé ro-luath, ach ba mhaith liom a chomhairliú don tSeanad a bheith daingean agus láidir ar alt a 5 fhágáil sa mBille agus gan é athrú. Caithfimid cuimhniú ar leas na ndaoine óg atá sna scoltacha.  Caithfimid cuimhniú ar leas na ceardaíochta sa tir, mar adéarfá in aon fhocal amhain, caithfimid cuimhniú ar leas na tíre fré chéile.  Gan an t-alt a bheith mar atá sé, is furasta a thuigsint go bhféadfaí obair na scoltacha a mhilleadh de bharr daoine a cheapadh chun dul i mbun oibre agus gan iad a bheith feiliúnach don obair, beag ná mór. B'fhéidir nach ceart a thuille do rá anois; b'fhéidir gur fearr é fhágáil go dtí an Tríú Céim, ach mholfainn go ndéanfadh lucht an tSeanaid staidéar ar an méid adúras agus ar bhrí an ailt sin agus ar bhrí an ailt sa Príomh-Acht agus go ndéanfadh siad d'intinn seasamh leis an Aire agus an córas sin oideachais atá i gceist aige a fhágáil sa mBille.</P>
    <P>An méid adúradh anseo anocht, ní dóigh liom gur ceart domsa aon rud a <Col N="331" /> rá faoi.  Ní doigh liom gur ceart mórán do rá faoi.  Is ceist í nach ceart aon run a rá fuithí ach amháin go bhfeicthear dom go bhfuil sé in am, b'bhéidir, príbhléidí Seanadóra a scrúdú féachaint an ceart go mbeadh údarás, go mbeadh saoirse acu éirí suas sa Seanad agus daoine a ionsaí nach bhfuil i láthair agus nach bhfuil an deis acu iad féin a chosaint ná freagra a thabhairt ar na nithe a cuirtear ina leith.  Feicthear dom nach dtaithníonn an priomhchigire atá i gceist leis an Seanadóir O hAodha.  Is cosúil gurb shin é tús agus deireadh an sceil.  An fear atá i gceist is duine sár-oilte é, múinteoir tréineálta, fear a fuair an-chuid duaiseanna as a chuid léinn.  Ba mhac léinn é i gColáiste na hOllscoile i mBaile Atha Cliath agus fear é a bhain a chuid scrúdú amach gach uair a sheas sé iad. In Éirinn is maith linn lucht léinn a chur i gcéin ó Ollscoil na hÉireann.  Is maith linn am ar bith is féidir linn ár gcuid mac léinn a chur i gcéin ar mhaithe leis an eolas.  An fear seo, chuaigh sé i gcéin agus chuaigh sé isteach in ollscoil agus bhain sé ardchéim amach san ollscoil sin i gcéin. Shílfeá ón tagairt a rinne dó tráthnóna go mba duine gan intleacht é.  Sin rud nach gcreidim, go háirithe ar an mbealach tugadh faoi tráthnóna.</P>
    <P>Mar gheall ar scéal na Gaeilge sna scoltacha gairm-oideachais, is fíor, agus caithfimid a admháil, nach mbíonn na múinteoirí sna scoltacha sin sáthach oilte ar obair a dhéanamh i nGaeilge. An Seanadóir Ó hAodha tráthnóna, bhí sé ag caint i dtaobh cigire ag dul isteach ag caint i nGaeilge le múinteoir agus gur thuig an rang céard a bhí ar bun, ach an Seanadóir céanna, dúirt sé nach bhfuil Gaeilge ag na daoine óga.  Ní thuig leis an dá thráigh a fhreastal.  Tá Gaeilge acu nó níl Gaeilge acu.  Le feidhm a bhaint as a lán cúrsaí i nGaeilge, caithfimid cúrsaí practiciúla&mdash;an modh díreach&mdash; a chur ar bun má tá eolas réasúnta ar an múinteoir ar an nGaeilge agus fios a cheirde aige mar mhuinteoir.  Is fíor nach bhfuil dóthain daoine sna scoltacha ceard-oideachas oilte ar an nGaeilge go dtí le gairid agus aontaím gur theastaigh go géar go gcuirfí in iúl do na múinteoirí go raibh dualgas orthu cleachtadh a dhéanamh ar an <Col N="332" /> nGaeilge ina cuid teagasc.  Ba díchéillí an rud é go mbeadh na daoine óga sna bun-scoltacha agus sna meánscoltacha ag fáil a gcuid teagaisc trí Ghaeilge agus sna scoltacha practiciúla go bhfágfaí an Ghaeilge ar leataobh.  Is é an rud ba mhaith liom a déanfaí agus is é an rud ba cheart don tSeanad a iarraidh ar an Aire, gan a bheith sásta go dtí go mbeidh sár-Ghaeilge sna scoltacha sin.  Ní ceist í ar chor ar bith lámh láidir a choimeád ar na daoine. Caithidh duine ar bith a dhéanfas scrúdú ar an cheist gur ró-bhog atá an tAire agus a chuid oifigeach in áit a bheith ró-dhian.</P>
    <P>Ach, tá scéim molta aige leis na daoine a mhealladh chun spéis a chur i múinteoireacht i nGaeilge agus go dtí go bhfeicimid é á triáil go ceann cupla bliain, beimid foighdeach leis.</P>
    <P>Maidir le tréineáil múinteora, is fíor é go bhfaghann a lán acu tréineál mhaith san ollscoil; ach, mar mhúin teoir san Oll-Scoil, ní miste dhom a admháil go dteastaíonn breis tréineála ó na céimithe óga sul a rachaidh siad isteach sna ceard-scoltacha.  Is obair speisialta í agus teastaíonn eolas speisialta uathu ar nósanna múinteoireachta. Ní doigh liom go bhfuil san ollscoil againn na gléasanna ná na goiris leis an tréineáil speisialta a thabhairt dóibh agus ar an ábhar sin tá an Roinn Oideachais le moladh faoi chomh tuigseanach agus atá siad ar na riachtanais sin, cúrsaí a chur ar bun ar an mbealach a cuireadh ar bun iad go dtí seo.</P>
    <P>Tóg an cás speisialta a luaigh an Seanadóir O hAodha: duine a bhí ag múineadh na Gaeilge.  Déanann siad cúrsa maith Gaeilge san ollscoil agus cúrsa maith ar theanga eile b'fhéidir, ach caithfimid cuimhniú ar na múinteoirí a theigheas amach sna ceard-scoltacha agus ranganna ar fud na tíre, go dteastaíonn, ní amháin eolas maith ar an nGaeilge uathu, ach eolas ar mhúinteoireacht na Gaeilge agus go dteastaíonn eolas an-mhaith uathu ar a lán nithe eile seachas an Ghaeilge agus múinteoireacht i nGaeilge, má tá rath ar bith le bheith ar an obair seo, sé sin, seanchas áitiúil, log-ainmneacha, na sean-tionscail, agus na mílte rudaí eile nach féidir an teagasc a fháil orthu sna cúrsaí mar atá siad ceapaithe san <Col N="333" /> ollscoil.  Tá argóint i bhfabhar na tréineála seo.  Go neartaí Dia lámh an Aire san obair atá sé a dhéanamh.</P>
    <P>Tá an-áthas orm gur thóg an tAire an oiread ama agus a thóg sé tráthnóna agus an cuntas a thabhairt dúinn ar imeachta an ghairm-oideachais ó cuireadh i bhfeidhm, i 1931, é.  Tá súil agam go bhfuighidh an ráiteas sin atá tugtha aige an oiread poiblíochta agus a dhlíos sí.  Dá dtuigfeadh duine fiú leath an méid atá nochtaithe aige tráthnóna i dtaobh cúrsaí gairm-oideachais, bheadh duine i bhfad níos moltaí ar an obair agus deanfaí i bhfad níos mó le cuidiú agus a déantaí go dtí seo.</P>

      <P>Is Bille é seo chun leasú a dhéanamh ar an gcóras atá ann fé láthair chun go leathnófaí an obair níos mó.  Ní dócha go mbeidh aon mhalairt tuairim fén rud san insan Seanad le linn dúinn a bheith ag breathnú an scéil.  Maidir liom fhéin agus mo chuid eolais ar an ngné sin oideachais, tá ceist nó dhó ba mhaith liom a phlé.  Im thuairimse, tá dá ghné don chóras oideachais sin ann.  Ní hionann an sórt scoileanna agus ní dóigh liom gur ionann an sórt oideachais ba chóir a bheith ins na cathracha agus na bailte móra mar a bhfuil tionscail agus ceardanna teicniúla ar siúl agus na scoileanna d'oirfeadh fén dtuaith.  Ní hé an saghas céanna atá riachtanach insan dá áit.  Ba mhaith liom go mbeadh an tuigsint sin ag an Aire, nach ionann cúrsaí saoil agus eile ins na cathracha móra mar Baile Átha Cliath, Luimneach agus Gaillimh, agus an rud a oirfeadh i bparáistí tuaithe atá i bhfad amach ó aon áit ina bhfuil gnó tionscail nó saothar teicniúil.</P>
      <P>Ní soiléir dom go bhfuil an idirdhealú in aigne na hAireachta i dtaobh na nithe sin.  Ba mhaith an ní go mbeadh.  Is é an tuigsint atá agamsa maidir leis an scéal fén dtuaith gur mó go mór ba cheart gur cuid an t-oideachas sin atá i gceist de gnáth-shaol sóisialta agus cultúrtha na ndaoine fén dtuaith.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Cúpla bliain ó shoin thugas léacht os comhair Comhdháil Ghairm-Oideachais i gCill Orglan agus thugas iarracht ar an idirdhealú sin a dhéanamh.  Ins na scoileanna gairm-oideachais ins na <Col N="334" /> paróistí fén dtuaithe ba cheart go mbeadh oiliúnt aigeanta agus cultúrtha le fáil ag na daoine chomh maith le heolas ar ghnóthaí tis, gairdinéireachta, siúinéireachta agus mar sin&mdash;leis an saol atá dá chaitheamh acu ins na tithe, ar an dtinteán agus na dteagmháil sóisialta le chéile; agus chomh maith le sin, ar a ngnó lasmuich de na tithe, ins na páirceanna agus a gcuid gnótha gairme.  Ar an slí sin, bheadh gléas acu chun oideachas agus oiliúint d'fháil, a mhúineadh dóibh gur saol chomh maith, chomh hoilte, chomh taithneamach saol na tuaithe le haon tsaol i mBaile Atha Cliath imeasc na soilse agus na pictúirí.  Ba mhaith liom go mbeadh an t-idirdhealú agus an polasaí sin in aigne na Roinne maidir leis an oideachas fén dtuaith.  Ba chóir go mbeadh insan oideachas leanúnach sin atá i gceist againn cuid éigin de na gnéithe oideachais a soláthraítear do ghnáth leis na scoileanna do chuir Grundtvig ar bun i dtír eile agus go raibbh tionchur chomh bunúsach buan san acu ar shaol na ndaoine insan dtír sin.</P>
    <P>Maidir leis an méid adúirt an Seanadóir O hAodha faoi dhea bhéasa, múineadh agus iompar agus na tréithe sin, nár chóir go mbeadh sé mar pholasaí ag an Roinn Oideachais i gcóir tuaithe na hÉireann i láthair na práinne atá ann chun an dream dúchais do choinneáil ins na háiteanna san; go mbeadh teagasc le fáil acu gurb é a thiocfadh de iad do bheith mórálach as a dtuaith agus as saol na tuaithe go gcreidfidís gur daoine iad atá go maith as maidir le beatha, atá go hoilte maidir le heolas, go huasal maidir le hiompair agus tuigsint dualgaisí cathardha agus atá in aon áit eile in Éirinn.</P>
    <P>Is é an tubaist atá fén dtuaith go dtuigtear dóibh gur saol gan tábhacht é, saol gan buaine, saol go dtuigeann na daoine óga ina thaobh gur rud é gur ceart dóibh teitheadh uaidh a luaithe is féidir leo.  Ba cheart gur cuid de ghnó na scol leanúnach na daoine idir 14 agus 20 a thabhairt isteach agus treoir agus tuigsint a chur ina gceann nach ceart iad na tuairimí sin atá acu faoi shaol na tuaithe.</P>
    <P>Maidir le leathnú na scoileanna, is maith an rud é a thuigsint ón Aire go dtiocfaidh an tráth nuair ná beidh níos mó ná cúig míle le taisteail ag éinne <Col N="335" /> chun buntáiste na scoileanna do bheith aige.  Sin mar is cóir.  Ba chóir go mbeadh scoil mhaith ar fáil chun an oideachais sin do dhéanamh chomh coitianta le bun-oideachas ar fud na tíre.  Is leanúint ar bhun-oideachas é.</P>
    <P>Is cuimhin liom go mbíodh ceisteanna dá bplé ag cruinnithe na gcomhairlí contae ar cheisteanna gairm-oideachais, chun an t-airgead do sholáthar dóibh. Ní fheicim go mba cheart don scéim ghairm-oideachais a bheith ag braith ar rátaí logánta.  Ní thuigim agus níor thuigeas ríamh cén fáth ná fuil an saghas oideachais san ag fáil lánchúnamh an Stáit ar nós an bhunoideachais. Ní thuigim cén chúis go gcuirfí ar chomhairlí contae agus comhairlí buirge go mbeadh orthu airgead do sholáthar don tsaghas san oideachais, seachas aon tsórt eile oideachais don ghnáth-phobal.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom iúl an Aire do dhíriú ar an sráidbhaile is dúchas dom dom fhéin, Daingean Uí Chúise.  Níl aon cheard-scoil chéart insan cheantar ná laistigh de 30 míle den áit.  Go dtí go mbeidh ceard-scoil ansan agus oideachas leanúna ar fáil ansan, sin 40 míle de Chiarraidhe gan sonamh an oideachas sin acu.  Tá stair ag baint leis an scéal sin.  Deich mbliana ó shoin, le fonn chun an t-oideachas san d'fháil, do bhailigh muintir an Daingin airgead agus do cheannaíodar páirc agus do bhronnadar an pháirc sin ar Choiste Ceard-Oideachais Chiarraidhe mar ionad i gcóir na scoile a cheapadar a bhí le fáil acu.  Níor cuireadh an scoil ar bun ó shoin dóibh agus ní fios domsa fáth na moille. Níl aon scoil i gCathair Saidhbhín ach an oiread agus tá na háiteanna san chomh tábhachtach leis na bailte eile.</P>
    <P>I dtaobh na Gaeilge in sna scoileanna ceard-oideachais nó gairm-oideachais, bíodh go bhfuil daoine ag caint ar bheith ag brú Gaeilge ar dhaoine agus ag lot aigne na ndaoine le hiomad tiomána is baol liom nach mar sin atá.  Is é an locht atá agamsa na fuil go leor feidhme dá bhaint as an nGaeilge ins na scoileanna céanna.</P>

Tugann an Aireacht aire gur Gaeilgeoirí iad san a théann ann de thoradh scoláireachtaí. An fíor ná baintear puinn feidhme as an eolas san i ngnáth obair an Choláiste?  Do réir mar is clos domsa, taobh amuigh den na ranganna Gaeilge fé leith ní bhíonn puinn eile úsáide á déanamh den teangain.  Múintear go fíor an Ghaeilge go maith in sna ranganna Gaeilge ann.  Ach bheadh níos mó ná sin ag teastáil uainn.  Ba chóir go mbeadh an Ghaeilge mar theangain tinteáin in san áit, go mbeadh atmosféir na Gaeilge ar fud an tí.

      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like, in the first place, to make it clear that the remarks of Senator Hayes do not apply generally to inspectors of Irish or other subjects employed by the Department.  I know an inspector of Irish whose manners are gentle and inoffensive, a man who would not be capable of offending a child.  There is a saying in reference to certain classes of people: &ldquo;They became more Irish than the Irish themselves.&rdquo;  Courtesy is the hallmark of the vocational education system, and no matter from what other service officers are transferred they soon acquire the tone of our own system and, generally speaking, a very high degree of courtesy will be found among the inspectors.  If the inspector does not bring a sense of courtesy with him, he very soon acquires it, because he comes into an atmosphere where it is expected and the position is that in a very short time the attitude of an inspector would not be capable of offending any person.  As regards the particular inspector mentioned by Senator Hayes, I venture to suggest that any little faults that may be present in that individual are, perhaps, due rather to an excessive enthusiasm on his part than to anything else.  Possibly he is comparatively new to the system and any faults that he may possess&mdash;I am not going to say whether there are faults or not&mdash;he certainly will lose in a short time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish, in the first place, to speak as a person who has had, perhaps, more than the average experience of vocational education.  I want to speak of various issues that are presented by this Bill.  I want to refer to a particular section of the Bill to which my colleagues generally take very strong exception.  It is the <Col N="338" /> section which was objected to very much by the body representing all the vocational education committees in Eire.  They took strong exception to it. I refer to Section 5, to which there is very general opposition.</P>
    <P>In order that the House may understand the nature of the objection, I would like to read out Section 99 (3) of the Vocational Education Act, 1930, the Principal Act:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Every officer transferred by this section shall not, in the service of the vocational education committee to which he is so transferred, receive less remuneration or, subject to the provisions of this section, be subject to less beneficial conditions of service than the remuneration to which he was entitled and the conditions of service to which he was subject in the service from which he is so transferred.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was the charter of security, as it were, for officers who held office in 1930, on the date of the passing of the Principal Act.  Fourteen years elapsed and then there was the Vocational Education (Amendment) Act of 1944.  That Act contains objectionable sections.  For instance, in Section 6 it is set out:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Minister may declare any specified age to be the age limit for all offices or for such offices as belong to a specified class, description, or grade or for one or more specified offices.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That section introduces something which did not exist prior to 1930.  I will now pass on to Sections 7 and 8 of the 1944 Act.  Under these sections the Minister took power to suspend an officer or to dismiss that officer without any reference to the committee by whom the officer was employed.  The serious part of that power is that it would deprive the officer of any protection that the courts are in a position to give him in the event of his not being satisfied that he is being treated justly.  That is a new and a very serious provision which deprives officers of their constitutional rights to have recourse in case of need to the courts of the land.</P>
    <P>It may be argued that that is not the case, but our advice is that such is <Col N="339" /> the position.  An officer who feels aggrieved might like to take his case further and he might be met at once by the judge saying that he was sorry but the Minister seemed to have the powers that were given him by the Oireachtas and nothing further could be done about it.  I would like to remind the House that Sections 6, 7 and 8 of the 1944 Act were very strongly objected to in this House and also in the Dáil.  In fact, they were carried only by one vote in this House.  There was a Senator absent whom, in the normal course, one would expect to be present.  It was rather a lucky thing for the Minister that that Senator was absent.  If he were here the voting would have been equal.  That shows that the arguments put forward on that occasion apparently satisfied Senators generally, even several members of the Minister's Party, that these were extraordinary sections and they should not be allowed to pass without very serious consideration.</P>
    <P>What was the position that developed? Officers rested for a further two years in the belief that the guarantee given by Section 99 (3) was still good and they very soon saw for themselves something that the Minister was advised about afterwards, namely, that there was a very obvious discordance between the sections inserted in the 1944 Act and the charter of security given to officers by Section 99 (3) of the Principal Act. The Minister was advised that he could not act on these sections until something was done.  I suggest that the straightforward way would have been to ask for the repeal of Section 99 (3) of the Principal Act. That was not done and now these Sections 6, 7 and 8 are being brought in to take away everything that is valuable in that charter.  We are then told that that is the fair and honourable thing to do.  Had the officers any suspicion that that section would not be honoured, many of them, to my knowledge, would have long since left the service and taken up other occupations.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to the earlier history of this vocational system. <Col N="340" /> There were two Acts, one in 1889 and the other in 1899.  Soon afterwards the system was put into operation. The conditions then, politically and otherwise, were very much different from what they are to-day.  Sir Horace Plunkett was put in charge of the old Department of Agriculture and Technical Education and, probably with the very best intentions, he brought over a number of English and Scottish people and other foreigners to administer the new system.  The people who went into the system at that time found themselves endeavouring to put into operation something that seemed to have a very foreign tinge.  It was something that involved a very considerable increase in the cost of local services.  It involved a levy of ld. or 2d. in the £ and, generally speaking, having regard to the political situation and the personnel of the Department and the increased local charges, the people who were enticed into the system found they had a very difficult card to play.</P>
    <P>The system largely was of an itinerant type.  There were no transport conveniences and it was uncomfortable work in which to be engaged. In addition to that, Sir Horace Plunkett, in his wisdom, issued a book called <i>Ireland in the New Century.</i> Most of the book was all right, but there were some chapters that were of an explosive nature.  I remember very distinctly the furore created by that book.  It left the task of those engaged in trying to give the scheme some sort of stability a very difficult one indeed.  These difficulties were surmounted in the course of time. Some of the foreign officials, who were very much out of sympathy with the people generally, left after a time and the system gradually took on a more Irish tinge.  It acquired a certain degree of stability.</P>
    <P>Prior to 1919 the officers engaged in the service had absolutely no security of tenure.  They were reappointed annually.  They had no pension rights. The local rate was on a purely voluntary basis and it was discontinued by several local authorities. There was the threat of disturbance to vested interests, to certain schools and <Col N="341" /> types of education, and all these things created problems of a very difficult nature.  A lot of the people engaged in the system found that there appeared to be no prospects.  They were obliged to defer marriage; they could undertake no responsibilities. They had no security until the 1919 Act gave them some degree of security.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the officers who were the pioneers of the system are entitled to some consideration.  It is not fair that the Minister should introduce new conditions to the provisions that these officers thought would continue and which did, in fact, continue for 16 years, if we take it up to the present day.  It is not fair for the Minister to introduce an element of insecurity. These older officers might have been allowed to peter out their time without the introduction of this discordant element.  I suggest that even at the eleventh hour it would be desirable, in the interests of the scheme as a whole, to modify these sections.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister and the House to understand that I am not putting a case forward for the retention of any person who is in the slightest degree inefficient.  If a person is reasonably able to carry on, he should be allowed to do so.  I make a special appeal for the older people who held office prior to 1930.  If the Minister will only go back to 1919 he will limit the operation of the concession very considerably; in fact, he will reduce it almost to infinitesimal proportions.</P>
    <P>If he does that, he will be doing something which will help very much to get the good-will of the people in this further development of vocational education which is made possible by the financial provisions of this Bill.  I hope that the Minister will sympathetically consider the suggestions I have made regarding Section 5 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>I notice that the Bill makes provision for certain officers who are in the employment of the Limerick Vocational Committee and also a particular individual mentioned in the Bill.  The Bill seeks to give pensionable status to the officers concerned.  I fully approve of everything proposed by the Minister in that direction.  The only comment I <Col N="342" /> have to make about that is this: Has the Minister satisfied himself that there are no other cases which should have been brought into this Bill?  If he has so satisfied himself, perhaps he would explain why it is that there is a sort of differentiation, apparently, being made.  I understand that a Bill to deal with superannuation will be forthcoming and one would imagine that, if the cases were parallel, they would all be dealt with in the Superannuation Bill.  If they are not so parallel, I suppose the Minister will explain the differentiation, if there is a differentiation made.  Representations have been made to me that, in the case of certain officers transferred to the Civil Service about that time, their interest may suffer unless some special provision is made.  No doubt the Minister has already considered that matter.</P>
    <P>The next aspect of the Bill I should like to deal with is the question of finance.  In a way, I suppose, that is really the important part of the Bill. Before I come to that, however, I have a note here to which I should like to refer.  I should like Senators to remember that the insertion of these clauses in the Bill involves very serious issues.  For example, they involve issues such as the validity of contracts, the right of appeal of officers to the courts, the question of local and central control, and the administrative authority of the committees.  Here is a very important point that I should like the Minister to take into account, namely, the orientation of the minds of the local officers towards the body which they consider is their employer. If they feel that, after all, the Minister is the employer and that he can dismiss or suspend them without reference to the committees, then the natural thing for the officers to do is simply ignore the committees and to say: &ldquo;After all, the Minister is the real employer, whatever theory there may be about the subject otherwise&rdquo;, and they will simply act accordingly.  That is going to introduce something which will not be to the advantage of the scheme.</P>
    <P>Then there is also the validity of the mechanical method of fixing the retiring age.  In the debate in the Dáil I saw that some Deputy mentioned that <Col N="343" /> the age limit for judges was extended lately to 72 years, instead of 70 as before.  That is something to go upon. I would say that very often people at 25 years of age should be retired as unsuitable, just as people of 90 years of age, or somewhere between, might also be retired.  It is not any genuine criterion whatever.  It is a purely ignorant, stupid, mechanical rule. Instead of dealing with the matter in an intelligent way, you have simply a mechanical guillotine sort of thing which operates indiscriminately and certainly will have the effect of inflicting very much increased liabilities on the nation generally.</P>
    <P>In the case of the Beveridge social security scheme in England, I see there are certain conditions proposed for actually inducing people to work until a very advanced age.  Here we have this simply introduced because it is considered to be a good average working sort of rule.  It saves the Minister the trouble of getting inspectors to exercise their own judgment. In the 1930 Act there was a provision which was quite ample for the Minister if he wanted to do anything.  If he wanted to do any of the things he wishes to do under this, he had only to tell the committee that he was not satisfied with a particular officer's work and that he proposed to send down some officer to investigate the matter.  Full powers were given to him in that way.  He might not even have to resort to that particular method, because it is generally accepted that the inspector is the judge of a person's work.  Therefore, if an inspector reports to a committee that such-and-such a person's work is not efficient, no committee will run the risk of a surcharge by retaining that officer. I know the answer the Minister will make; that it is easier to get the guillotine to chop the person's head off. He saves himself all the trouble and annoyance that, perhaps, might arise through representations being made in a particular case.</P>
    <P>I want to refer now to the question of finance in the Bill.  In the first place, I call attention to the fact that the Act of 1944 increased the rate limit.  I intend to deal mainly with the county <Col N="344" /> schemes.  I am fairly well acquainted with the urban schemes, but I am more familiar with those dealing with the counties.  My remarks, therefore, will be more applicable to the county schemes.  The 1944 Act raised the maximum rate from 4d. to 5d.  There was also provision for an extra penny in the event of Part V of the Act being adopted.  Therefore, you had a total rate of 6d.  The present Bill raises the rate to 7d., with provision also for the extra penny, which means 8d. in the £. In the case of county schemes, there is also a rate for agricultural education, partly for agriculture itself and partly, if you like, for agricultural instruction.  The two together, therefore, form a fairly formidable sum and a very high proportion of the total rate for all services.</P>
    <P>I could not consistently object to such a rate.  My natural feeling would be actually to ask the Minister to increase it.  I know the difficulty of carrying on and the difficulties which have been imposed on committees because of this emergency bonus and the fact that the central funds do not, as in the old days, relieve committees in cases where the cost-of-living bonus increases.  There is only relief to a very small extent for increases in the cost-of-living bonus because, through some extraordinary arrangement made by the Department of Finance at the time, credit is only given to some committees for officers who were in employment in the standard year. Other officers may have the cost-of-living bonus increased, but there is no relief from the central funds. Therefore, committees find themselves in the position of having to provide £2,000 or £3,000 extra without any visible way of securing the necessary money.</P>
    <P>My recommendation to the Minister is that he ought to see that a substantial increase is given to the county committee from central funds.  I see that the Minister stated in the Dáil that the proportion was roughly one and a half to one.  A lot depends on how that one and a half to one is calculated.  I take the last report of the Department of Education and I find that my figure for a county <Col N="345" /> scheme is 1.2.  But even that has to be analysed to see what it means exactly.  Under No. 113 of the Statutory Rules and Orders the Minister promises to give £1 from central funds for every £1 given from the local rates in the case of county schemes.  But, in the case of urban schemes, he says he will give £4 for every £1 raised.  That applies to big places like Cork, Limerick and Waterford, but it does not apply to Dublin City or Dun Laoghaire.  In Dun Laoghaire, the ratio is two to one.  I believe that Dun Laoghaire had a very serious complaint under that head.</P>
    <P>Here is how the arrangement works. It was intended to help small towns. The total local rate was comparatively small and the central funds gave £4 for every £1 raised.  In a short time it was found that, instead of that being applied in aid of instruction, it could be applied to capital expenditure. Some towns did not actually need it, but others did.  Then an urban district can levy a certain rate in aid and it will get four times that amount.  There is nothing to prevent that urban district using portion of that for the repayment of a loan to erect buildings.  You can easily understand, therefore, why you have such palatial buildings put up in all the big cities, such as Dublin, Limerick, Cork and so on.  But, when we unfortunate people operating a county scheme ask for a couple of thousand pounds, the House would be astonished to hear the torture and torment we have to suffer before it is sanctioned.  Anyone who has any experience of a county scheme knows that you get letters telling you not to do this and not to do that.  We have a county council willing to give money, but letters come down every day saying: &ldquo;Do not ask that county council for money because they have sewerage and other schemes to look after.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Why is that?  I am not blaming the Minister or his Department in this case.  I know they are perfectly innocent, but there are two other Departments concerned and that is where the trouble comes in.  We have Finance. Naturally they adopt the attitude of the watchdog.  They are bound to do <Col N="346" /> so.  Then we have Local Government. Local Government says: &ldquo;If the county council gives a loan or gives a grant under Section 51, there will be a slight increase in the rates.  Though on the average, the increase is extremely small because the rate is a county-at-large one, it is our job to look after that and to see that there is no increase in the rates&rdquo;.  On the other hand, Finance says: &ldquo;It is our job to see that there is no increase in the grants from the Central Fund&rdquo;.  The people in the front trenches, those in the Department of Education, are liable to be shot up from behind if they encourage the local people to go on.  I feel that this system should be abolished.  I hold, and I have held for years, that the straightforward approach to this matter is to put all these building grants on the Estimates each year.  The details of them will then be circulated with the Estimates and the members of the Oireachtas will have an opportunity of deciding who is to get building grants and who is not. The grants will be made public.  I am not blaming any individual officers for the present difficulties.  It is the system I am blaming.  I should like that to be clearly understood.</P>
    <P>I should like to deal rapidly with a few other aspects of this question that call for discussion.  The rural school is a very difficult problem, and the Minister has dealt with it fairly correctly. One of the great difficulties is that at present, it is catering largely for what is called the surplus population, that is, young people who are not going to live on the land.  I think myself that is a perfectly legitimate type of work because if they are not catered for in these schools they will be catered for in some other schools but the fact is that very largely we are not getting the farmer's son who is actually going to work the land.  That involves the consideration of how you are going to deal with that question&mdash;a very difficult problem.  We all started with great enthusiasm.  We heard of this rural science, which has a mysterious sort of name, but we were very soon informed that it does not mean what it appears to mean, that it means ordinary science with a slight bias.  We soon found that if we were to utilise the services <Col N="347" /> of a teacher with the degree of Bachelor of Agriculture we might be doing a very dangerous thing.  It might come to the knowledge of the Department of Agriculture that instruction was being given by a person who was not in their service and there would be trouble at headquarters or elsewhere.  Therefore a person who had his degree found himself becoming atrophied as years went on and became merely an academic person.  None of the facilities which the Department has was given to him.  He was dried up, and he became an academic person of very little use.  That was because of some want of co-operation between the two Departments which is again reflected in the want of co-operation between the vocational education committee and the county committee of agriculture.  I say there must be some plan to co-ordinate these services properly and I put forward this suggestion as a way of solving not alone that particular difficulty but of solving other difficulties associated with finance. I consider that there is a lot to be said for the type of school which, in the English Education Act discussions, has been described as the multilateral school.  My attention has been drawn by parish priests and others to the fact that young people are passing the doors of technical schools and traveling six and eight miles away to other schools, whereas they could have gone into the technical schools if they were given the same type of instruction as is given in these other schools.  I think the suggestion about a room attached to a national school is quite unworkable, and anyone who considers the matter for a few minutes will agree that it is unworkable.</P>
    <P>The only way you can deal with the problem really is by means of a central school of some type.  If that central school is regarded as a secondary school, then a lot of the problems regarding overhead expenses associated with the small rural schools would be solved and these young people, instead of travelling into towns to attend some school connected with secondary education, would be able to attend and get similar instruction in some local school.  I am speaking now of the <Col N="348" /> secondary section, for technical education is merely a specialised form of secondary education.  The word &ldquo;secondary&rdquo; connotes something which is supplementary to primary education but that is not the full connotation. It connotes, as a rule, a school which undertakes the work of preparing people for professions. Technical education is also a secondary form of education but it is considered to be more highly specialised than other forms of secondary education.  I can see no earthly reason why the two types of school should not work in with each other.  Theoretically, we have the Minister in charge of three types of education&mdash;primary, vocational and secondary.  Why that fact is not reflected in the organisation of the schools it is difficult to say.  If it were, you would have a very substantial attendance at these schools and you could deal with the different branches according to the requirements of the people.</P>
    <P>With regard to agriculture, I am satisfied that only if Part V is put into operation in the rural areas will you get the boy who is going to work on the farm to attend.  The young fellow who is actually going to work on the farm should be required to attend under the provisions of Part V only for a limited portion of the year.  It would roughly be about 180 hours in the year.  Then there would be some justification for teaching him subjects like rural science and other subjects which are useful from the standpoint of the farm.  Consideration of this system would involve also consideration of the system of secondary education, university education and higher technological education.  We have in this country a university which does give recognition to a few technical schools but, since the old College of Science was absorbed in the National University, there is no reason why some general recognition should not be given.  If it is not possible to achieve that, there should be some effort to restore the old College of Science because the advantage, from the standpoint of the technical schools, would be that young people would not be obliged to take the <Col N="349" /> matriculation certificate before going on to higher studies.  Of course, the Youth Unemployment Commission is considering the question of the raising of the school leaving age and it may deal with a good many other important questions.  I have no doubt that when their recommendations are available, the Minister will feel it necessary to come back with an amending Bill&mdash;a further amending Bill.</P>
    <P>As regards Irish, there has been some discussion about it and I am not going to enter too minutely into the question.  The only thing I do say is that if you want to restore Irish as a living language, I am afraid there will have to be some change in the methods at present adopted, not alone in the technical schools but also in primary and other schools.  I think the first aim should be to restore it on a living basis.  To my mind, too much attention is being given to grammar and to relatively unimportant matters whereas if it were only a question of acquiring a knowledge of the spoken language in the primary stages for the present, until the language becomes more generally used, the problem would be more easily solved and the work of the teachers would be less difficult.</P>
    <P>Here is an aspect of the whole system which is important in many ways.  I refer to the question of promotion in the service.  The most extraordinarily curious things happen in this connection from time to time.  People who, to our knowledge, are highly qualified from every standpoint find themselves not in the running when some of the bigger posts are available. Although the person concerned is a particular personal friend of mine, I shall not hesitate to quote his case as an example.  In the City of Dublin Technical Schools, a man who was a primary teacher all his life found himself promoted, over the heads of other people who had spent their lives at technical education, to the chief post in the gift of the Government.  Surely that is unfair.  Surely there should be a system similar to that which obtains in the banks, in the Church and other services if you are to have a loyal and contented staff.  There is a great <Col N="350" /> amount of discontent in that connection and I draw the Minister's attention to the matter.  I have dealt briefly with rural science and I think I suggested the desirability of co-operation between the different educational branches in that regard.</P>
    <P>Let me talk about the Minister himself. We should like to see him more frequently amongst us than is the case at present.  He must know the difficulties with which we have to contend. If we could come amongst us more frequently, with the prestige associated with his office, the people who snipe at us from the rear would, probably, be more careful in their methods.  I know that the Minister has many details of administration to deal with but, at the same time, it is important that he should encourage the staff by going amongst them.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I want to refer to an issue which concerns my own committee particularly.  I ask the goodwill of the House in listening to the case I have to put forward.  Section 97 of the Vocational Education Act of 1930 provided that the assets and liabilities of committees which were being abolished would be taken over by the new committees.  Under that section, one committee&mdash;and one committee only&mdash;was affected, to the extent of about £2,300.  That happened to be the County Tipperary Vocational Education Committee.  The corporation got involved in a law case which entailed considerable expense.  I do not think that the Minister has got the proper hang of this matter.  It will crop up year after year until there is some settlement and I suggest that an effort should now be made to settle this case.  I mentioned that we had a foreign element in the Department at one time which was out of sympathy with the people generally.  Two of these individuals were mixed up with this particular case.  The vocational education committee would have had ample funds at their disposal but for the action of one of these two individuals who practically coerced the Clonmel Technical Instruction Committee into spending £2,000 or £3,000 which they had earned through the operation of a scheme worked on behalf of the British pensions body at <Col N="351" /> that time.  A very considerable sum of money was available to the credit of the committee and, during the period that that law case was in progress, this individual visited the committee and told them to go ahead and spend this money because, if they did not, it would be taken from them at the end of the law case and applied in another direction.  That is a matter in which the Minister or his Department were not mixed up.  Another individual whose name I shall not mention figured in an inquiry which lasted for a considerable time and involved considerable expense to the ratepayers of Limerick City.  That individual was working in co-operation with the other two.  Here we have an innocent body bearing this burden.  It is only a matter of a couple of thousand pounds and I am told that the Minister has power to deal with it under ordinary legislation.  Why does he not do so? It would only require an administrative act such as he does day after day. I ask him to consider this matter seriously. I hope that he will also bear in mind what I suggested about Section 5.  There are only a small number of persons involved and he would be doing a great deal to secure the goodwill of everybody connected with the system if he were to adopt my suggestion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot pretend to have any enthusiasm for this measure. What is the origin of it?  Has there been any demand from local authorities for this power to levy extra money off the rates for the furtherance of vocational education?  As a member of a local authority, I have no hesitation in saying that I should be very reluctant to urge my colleagues on that authority to levy an extra farthing for this service.  When the original Act was being passed, all of us were parties to it.  What we did, we did in good faith and with considerable enthusiasm. But times have changed since then. We started with the minimum expenditure and we reached our maximum. Now we are to have power to increase the levy.  So far as many local authorities are concerned, they are asking themselves whether or not they are getting value for their money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="352" /> The vocational committee of which I have been a member on and off for more than 20 years entered with enthusiasm on the scheme, but there is no enthusiasm left.  We are quite convinced that the plan was an error of judgment.  I distinguish between the large urban areas and the rural districts, with the conditions of which I am acquainted.  Under this Bill, the ratepayers are to be empowered to increase their contribution to 8½d. in the £.  What are we going to do with this money?  I should like the Minister to contemplate the picture in his own Mayo or in my Cavan or in somebody else's Leitrim.  Presumably, if we are going to increase the rate, we are going to have more schools and more teachers.  We are going to have more and more schools and more and more teachers for fewer and fewer pupils.</P>
    <P>That is a fact which is not being faced by the Minister or by anybody else, so far as I can see.  It is the gravest problem there is.  The Minister cannot pretend not to be properly informed about conditions in rural Ireland and, to me, this is going to be a colossal waste.  All our counties, which are, in the main, rural, are, if this plan is persisted in, to saddle themselves with considerable expenditure for the building of new schools and the provision of a number of teachers, and, after a while, long before the time has come for these teachers to retire, we will have our people saddled with teachers and with salaries and no pupils to go to the schools we have built.  I can see it all over my county and it is much worse in other counties. I go further and say that, in the judgment of my colleagues on our vocational education committee, we were doing much better work from the point of view of vocational education when we had no technical schools at all, but when we had itinerant teachers, when we had the domestic science teacher and the woodwork teacher packing up their trucks with their equipment and going to one parish and another for a period of three or six months, one year after another, than is being done now. We were giving much more effective training to a far greater number of people than is the case to-day and I am really convinced that it was an error of judgment to have faced the <Col N="353" /> job of putting up, as some Senator said about the cities, relatively palatial buildings in towns and small villages, to the utter neglect of the rural districts.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Reilly, who no doubt has considerable experience of vocational education, seemed to regard the suggestion&mdash;I do not know whether it was made by Senator Ó Siochfhradha or some other Senator&mdash;that an additional room in the national schools would have met the case as impossible. Whether that suggestion was made to-day or not, I made it on a previous occasion here and, with all respect to Senator O'Reilly's view, I am quite convinced that, in the rural interest, it would be a thousand times better to build a decent room on to the national schools and have the classes there than to do as we have done&mdash;to neglect vast areas of the rural districts and build a school here and there in the large towns.</P>
    <P>What has happened?  Sometimes I come to the city by bus and I see children coming down the byways, from the scattered rural communities, into the bus and into the towns.  Travelling on a bus one morning, I tried to find out what these children were going to do, and all that one could be convinced of is that none of us knew what we thought our children ought to be taught to do.  If you get into conversation with the children and try to find out what they are doing and why they are doing it, you find they have no idea and that their parents have no idea, and that they are getting no direction from anybody.  We are providing teachers in schools, but what we are doing has no relation to our national needs at all.  I wish we would concentrate far more on training the young people in the rural districts to equip themselves better for the life we want them to lead in the rural districts.  But we are not doing that.  We are doing something else.</P>
    <P>Children come into domestic science classes in the rural schools.  Senator Hayes raised this point and his <i>bona fides</i> cannot be questioned.  I do not know whether the Minister would attempt to question mine or not, but Senator Ó Siochfhradha will recollect that, long before the Minister <Col N="354" /> darkened the portals of this House, we were trying to do something on a commission together with regard to the future of the Irish language.  We were much more enthusiastic and optimistic then than we are now, and we made recommendations.  Whether we did not understand our people as well as we understand them now, whether we made a complete miscalculation as to the cynicism which later years would bring arising out of our history, I do not know, but we have clear evidence that we have to make a fresh approach to this problem.  Children are going into the domestic science classes all over the country and what are they going into these classes for?  I heard a story of an inspector who went in to a teacher of domestic science and asked her what she was doing.  She told him she was teaching the children Irish through cookery.  That is the sort of thing we are trying to do.</P>
    <P>But let us follow that a little further.  When they get a smattering of cookery&mdash;because a good deal of the time is taken up in trying to impart knowledge in a language for which they are very well equipped&mdash; as soon as they get a little equipment in the subject, they are cleared out of the country.  I am raising these issues because I think they constitute the real problem.  We are humbugging ourselves and possibly humbugging ourselves more through our plan of education than through any other service.  Senator Ó Siochfhradha and Senator Ó Buachalla made speeches this evening and from what I could gather it seems to me that what we are really doing is blinding ourselves to the facts.  If there are young people to-day who have not got the spirit we had through the country 25 or 30 years ago, we are not going to change that situation by trying to stuff something down their throats when they have their teeth shut and we are not going to hammer it into their skulls with batons or anything else.  It is necessary to reason with them and to understand the psychology which produces that problem for you.</P>
    <P>That is what a great many of us are not doing and we will not solve the <Col N="355" /> problem in that way.  The longer that problem remains unsolved, the nearer will the Irish language be to its death, and the people who will have gone farthest on the road to kill it are the people who are so blinded as not to realise that, if we have not got the courage to examine the problem as it is to-day, we will not be able to pass on the heritage of the language to the children of the future.  Our whole scheme of vocational education, very well-intentioned indeed&mdash;there is no question about that&mdash;is not showing to-day that evidence of reason in the plan for the future and in the working out of that plan, which the necessities of the situation to-day demand.</P>
    <P>Senator Ó Siochfhradha asked why this should be a charge on the rates rather than on the Central Fund.  If the Minister has a plan for education to which many local authorities, when they subscribe at all, do so with reluctance, a plan which he thinks is the best plan, he will have to go much further in providing the cash for the carrying out of the plan than he has gone up to the present.  There may be a few local authorities who would be prepared to embark on a scheme of spending more money on vocational education.  I do not think they are justified and I do not think the expenditure will be justified.  As Senator Hayes has said with regard to the problem of the Irish language, our vocational scheme at this moment requires re-examination in the light of our experience, an examination which apparently the Minister does not think necessary but which a great many of us are convinced is essential if vocational education is to be made as effective and as valuable as it ought to be for the money spent on it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Patrick O'Reilly Mr. Patrick O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Patrick O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>On other measures that have come before the House, it has happened that I spoke after Senator Baxter and did not always agree with him.  I hope he will not think that it is becoming a practice with me to get up and disagree with him.  I agree with some of the things that he said, and that this Bill will make it possible for local <Col N="356" /> authorities to levy an extra rate for the services that it is intended to provide. I am not going to suggest that that service will not be a good service. We are all aware, however, of the tendency in legislation to place greater burdens on the local authorities. I hope that at some time a limit will be reached in that regard.</P>
      <P>I do not mean to suggest that the money expended on vocational education is not well spent, because I think it is.  Of course, while power is being taken to place this extra burden on the local authorities, we must remember that, so far as the rural areas are concerned, three-fifths of the rate on agricultural holdings under £20 valuation is being indemnified under the Budget.  Due to that fact, I suppose it may be said that we in the rural areas are satisfied in a relative way in seeing a measure like this introduced.  We can see that a large portion of the money to be raised will be borne by the taxpayer.  I should imagine that in the County of Leitrim, which I come from, 75 per cent. of the total poor rate valuation would be under £20, so that three-fifths of the rate on that total valuation will be paid by the taxpayer. We should be broad enough, however, to see that a hardship is going to be placed on the shoulders of people who are not the owners of property other than agricultural land, on people living in towns and on the owners of house property in rural areas.  They, in my opinion, will suffer a hardship.  The county councils, in view of the fact that the taxpayer is going to pay a substantial amount of the rate levied, will not, I imagine, be too critical in the matter of raising the rate, with the result that a hardship will be placed on the dwellers in villages and on the occupiers of property other than agricultural land. That is a tendency that should be kept in mind by the responsible authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I support this Bill because I see in it the possibility of giving a better educational service to the poor.  It is my opinion that it is only through the schemes provided by vocational education committees the children of small farmers and of workers in small towns can get a post-primary education. <Col N="357" /> In the County of Leitrim we have one boarding-school for girls, and one or two small secondary schools, with, probably, very small attendances. That county has a length of about 80 miles.  Therefore, as I say, it is only through these schemes that the children of the classes I speak of can hope to get a post-primary education. Those people are not rich enough to send their children to secondary schools or to the universities.  It is only the well-off parents who can afford to do that.  There may be a few children lucky enough to win scholarships to enable them to go to a secondary school and later to the university. For that reason I strongly support the measure.</P>
    <P>I would like to see these vocational schools built in villages, but not, as has been suggested, as an addition to the primary schools.  The vocational school should be a separate building so that it will have a cultural value in the community&mdash;that is provided it is properly developed and properly run.  Such a school can become a centre of culture, apart altogether from the value of the education imparted to the pupils attending it.  I suggest that these vocational schools should be run on pretty broad lines.  They should be available for lectures and for drama societies.  I do not mean now the production of drama for the sake of making money, but rather with a view to cultivating dramatic talent in the rural areas.</P>
    <P>It may be asked whether the children who attend these vocational schools are likely to get jobs as a result of the education they receive in them. Even if the vocational schools do not succeed in getting jobs for the pupils they can still be of value.  I am a member of the vocational education committee in my county, and I hold that these vocational schemes have been a success.  The pupils who attend them get a high standard of education. It is unfortunate that more children do not attend the classes. After all, we are at the beginning of this system, and I suppose it may be said that you have to educate people to the point of seeing that they should be educated.  It may be suggested that some of these vocational schools have <Col N="358" /> not been built in the most suitable centres.  Some of them have had to be closed up, due I suppose to the poor attendance at the classes.  That did not happen in my county, but even though they have had to be closed I hold that they have been a success and that, ultimately, they will be reopened. In regard to educational matters, there is now, I suggest, a better outlook on the part of people residing in the rural areas.</P>
    <P>With regard to the subjects taught in the vocational schools, I hold that rural science is a subject that should be taught to all the boys, and domestic economy to all the girls, as well, of course, as Irish, English and the general subjects that comprise the higher standards of education.  I think that after two or three years, when the children had got a good education in general school subjects, at least a selected few should be taught commercial subjects.  Due to the limited scope there is for those who get a training in commercial subjects there is not much point perhaps in giving pupils a training in those subjects at the present time, especially in many of the rural areas and in some of the smaller towns.</P>
    <P>I think there should be more scope in the matter of domestic science and rural science.  By teaching the boys rural science, we will give them a better agricultural education; by teaching the girls domestic science we will leave them in a better position to face the future.  I might say that 99 per cent. of the women have to apply that knowledge, no matter what they may do in later life or where they may go, and for that reason domestic science should be taught.  Commercial subjects should not be pushed.</P>
    <P>The schools should be situated conveniently, having regard to the statistics relating to children leaving the primary schools.  If the schemes develop to a point when those schools would be rather crowded, the tendency should be to move out from that centre some three or four miles and have a one-room or two-room school. In that way you would broaden the service and you would have more <Col N="359" /> schools.  If that were to be followed up properly, you would, over a period, have a school within easy reach of all the children leaving the primary schools.</P>
    <P>I take it this will be the last time that provision will be made to make it possible for the local authorities to provide more money.  I can see that in many counties that have a low total poor law valuation the amount of money that will be raised by the county councils will not give the revenue to vocational committees that would be required if they go on the lines I have indicated.  I hope this is the last time provision will be made for the raising of the levy by the rating authority.  I take it that when committees require extra money to develop their schemes, once the schemes justify their existence, that the moneys required will be given by the Minister by way of grant rather than from any other source.  In doing that, I do not think the Minister should be a bit worried by the rather critical leading articles one might read in the newspapers about the value derived from the money expended on vocational education.  I do not think the Minister should be annoyed about that.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied the money will be well spent.  I always consider that money spent on education is well spent, unless there is improper supervision or mismanagement. I know that will not apply to the administration of these schemes by vocational committees.  It is because of that I support this measure.  I hope the scheme will take the lines I have indicated.  I feel it will, and I feel that as it develops we will have a better standard of educational facilities available for people in areas where they have no other chance of developing their mentalities. Whether or not they stay at home, the education will be useful to them.  We would like to see our young people staying at home, but even if they go to a foreign country they will have a higher standard of education to help them.  It is unfortunate that we have to export from our poorer areas, from the West generally, people who <Col N="360" /> will be merely hewers of wood and drawers of water in other lands.  The scheme should not be organised to provide a post-primary education for people who have to leave the country, but rather should it be organised in the hope of giving better educational facilities to the people who are to remain at home.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanRuane" hpid="Mr. Seán Ruane Mr. Seán Ruane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Seán Ruane</NameTxt>
      <P>As one who, for a number of years, was closely associated with the vocational education committee of my own county, I have, naturally, a particular interest in this Bill.  I was delighted to hear several Senators stressing the need of extending the benefits of vocational education to rural areas.  When the erection of new schools in several centres in my native county was discussed ten or 12 years ago, I advocated instead an extension of the system of vocational education to different areas, isolated areas, and I suggested at that time that the national schools should be used for the purpose.  My idea was that the building of a permanent structure should be the last thing the committee would consider and it should be considered by them only when the idea of vocational education had sunk properly into their minds and the minds of the people and when there was no danger of the schools being rendered useless subsequently through lack of support or because of poor attendance on the part of the people in the area in which schools were erected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My experience is that the people who have benefited by vocational training, who have got vocational training in the real sense, are those who attended schools established in extemporised buildings in different parts of the county.  I know several boys who attended carpentry classes and to-day they are capable of putting up substantial buildings that would compare favourably with the work of any skilled artisan.  That class of education should be extended.  While excellent work is being done in the schools in my county, I am at times in doubt whether the pupils are really being taught according to the ideal vocational system.  I know that excellent education is being given.  The young people are trained in shorthand, <Col N="361" /> typewriting and accountancy, but unfortunately, when they have finished their courses, there are no positions available in the county or country.  The young people are really trained for export.  Of course, it is a very good thing, if they have to emigrate, that they possess knowledge that will be of benefit to them in the country to which they go.</P>
    <P>I should like to pay a compliment to the instruction given in some of those schools and to the originality or foresight of the teachers employed there. As the emergency developed, the shortage of kerosene or paraffin oil was felt very much throughout the country, in no place more than in the rural areas, where they have no other form of lighting. Prior to the emergency, a teacher in one of the schools in County Mayo had the foresight to give instruction to his class on the principles of the wind-charger. If you pass along the roads that radiate from that particular centre to-day you can see the pylons erected and the people in that area had excellent light at a time when their less fortunate neighbours, who had not the benefit of such instruction, had not even candle-light.</P>
    <P>Instruction of that type should be extended and I see no reason why, in vocational schools in certain areas, instruction should not be given in the construction of hydro-electric installations. There are many districts, not alone in my native county but in several parts of the country, where there are perennial waterfalls and these could be utilised with proper instruction. It would be quite a simple matter and it would be a great benefit to the people if their youngsters could be so instructed.</P>
    <P>If the system of vocational education in my county has been successful in one way more than in another, it has been in the desire created among the adult section of the population for a better knowledge of the science of agriculture. Some years ago the secretary of the Mayo County Council found it necessary to circularise the teachers in the primary schools that if more pupils did not compete for the two agricultural scholarships offered every year it would be necessary to withdraw them. <Col N="362" /> Out of ten scholarships from primary to secondary schools offered, two were allocated to agriculture and I regret to say that there was no competition for them.  Because of that lack of competition, the county council thought it necessary to threaten to withdraw them.</P>
    <P>Latterly, lectures have been arranged under the auspices of the local vocational education committee.  An excellent lecture was delivered last Thursday night in my home town on lea farming.  Over 50 farmers attended that lecture, some of them having travelled five or six miles on a dark night.  From the questions they put to the lecturer afterwards and the discussion which they entered into with him they showed that they had profited by his visit.  Lectures of that type should be delivered more frequently, and vocational committees should arrange for them in areas which are not blessed with those beautiful schools which have sprung up in several districts. In that way the benefits of the system would be brought home to the people.  While I have nothing but praise for my colleagues on the local committee for the interest they manifested in the development of this system of education, I must say that many of them were more interested in the erection of new buildings in their own areas than in having the benefits spread over the country.</P>
    <P>Conditions have undergone a considerable change in the West during the last six or eight years and the change has not been for the better. Many years ago girls who had to emigrate to America always went there with the intention of returning some day and settling down at home. I know hundreds of such girls who came back after ten or 15 years in America and became farmers' or artisans' wives, reared good families and in that way contributed very much to the prosperity and happiness of their districts.  Latterly, that has entirely changed.  During the war years, several thousand girls emigrated to England because of the wages paid there.  I am not speaking from my own observation alone, but from the views expressed by many in a position to study this matter, when I say <Col N="363" /> that the question of becoming mothers, wives or housekeepers seems entirely absent from the minds of these girls.</P>
    <P>I hold that anything that could be done to restore the domestic outlook to the young women of our country is very necessary and that any money spent in such a restoration would be wisely spent.  For that reason, I do not see why there should be any objection to holding classes in cookery and laundry and other domestic subjects in the national schools throughout the country.  I know that the managers would be only too delighted to place the schools at the disposal of the vocational committees.  In that way the benefits of this system would be brought into the isolated areas and, eventually, when permanent structures are erected, there will be no possibility of their being ever used for any other purpose but the purpose for which they are intended, namely, education on a vocational basis.</P>
    <P>I was sorry to hear that the relationship between the inspectorate and the teachers in the Dublin area is not as happy as I know it is in my own county and, generally speaking, throughout the province.  The central executive officer in Mayo and the teachers engaged in the different schools, as well as the part-time teachers who go out to the places where classes are held, have nothing but praise for the inspectors and they always welcome their visits.  The inspectors go there not so much to find fault as to give the benefit of their experience to the schools which they visit.  Their visits are always looked forward to.  I hold that that should be the case everywhere.  When a person has a diplomatic way of suggesting a correction of faults without being offensive either to the teachers, the officials or pupils he is bound to be successful and helpful.</P>
    <P>I trust that this Bill will bring the benefits of vocational training into areas that have not yet had the opportunity of enjoying them.  I am satisfied that if use was made of existing buildings and if the number of teachers in carpentry, metal work and farrier work is increased, there will be no lack <Col N="364" /> of attendance or of support in any particular area to which these teachers would be allocated.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe that the necessity for this Bill has been brought about by increased knowledge of the good work carried out in vocational and technical schools throughout the country.  That knowledge is shared by the working people and by the employers. I am glad to say that the old hostility of trade union organisations to technical and vocational training has departed and has been replaced by co-operation and assistance in the furthering of that training. While vocational education has been availed of to a greater extent by our people generally, there is one section that I am afraid is lacking in its support, and that is the section which needs that training most, namely, the young boys and girls of the working classes who are compelled by economic necessity to leave school at 14 years. These young people have to be put to work by their parents in some cases owing to the wages which they are able to bring in.  I have often thought it would be a good national investment if some allowance were given to parents for the attendance of their children at vocational or technical schools so that their children would be able to avail of vocational education.</P>
      <P>Senator Baxter criticised vocational training through the medium of Irish. He mentioned cookery in particular and said that that was a hindrance rather than a help to the advancement of the language.  I do not agree with that statement because this instruction is given to young persons of 15 or 16 years of age who have received a sound knowledge of the Irish language in the national schools and are quite capable of fully appreciating instruction through the medium of Irish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamOCallaghan" hpid="Mr. O'Callaghan Mr. O'Callaghan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Callaghan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was glad to hear Senator Baxter in his usual critical mood.  I am sorry if conditions such as he described as existing in County Cavan exist in other counties.  He said that there were big buildings, many teachers and few pupils.  If that is the position in Cavan and other counties, surely the system of vocational education <Col N="365" /> has to be inquired into very fully. He was very critical as to whether we are getting good value for the money spent on vocational education or not. No other speaker, as far as I could see, agreed with him and certainly, as far as I know vocational education in County Cork, it would not be just or fair to describe it in the terms which Senator Baxter used.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Reilly made the point that there was not as much co-ordination between agricultural education and vocational education as there should be. I agree thoroughly with him in that.  I do not know who is to blame, whether it is the local bodies or not.  In County Cork there are vocational committees and committees of agriculture and there is no co-ordination of any kind between them, and I think it is a pity that there is not.  The vocational schools might be very convenient places for showing films illustrating up-to-date processes by which agriculture is carried on. They could be employed usefully in other ways, for agricultural lectures, forestry lectures and all kinds of lectures in connection with the agricultural industry.  But, at present, as far as I know, there is not that co-ordination which Senator O'Reilly suggests there should be.  If the Minister could do anything to establish co-ordination it would be a step in the right direction.</P>
      <P>Senator Ruane made a point about instruction in the development of hydro-electric schemes.  There is a vocational teacher in County Cork who, it is safe to say, is one of the greatest experts in the world on hydro-electric development.  He has initiated many small schemes which are a credit to him and to the vocational education system.  He has also established windmill electric schemes which are also very successful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many such schemes have been established in various parts of the country and they are not carried out on a proper basis.  Such a man as I have in mind, who knows his job thoroughly, could be used for much larger schemes than he is engaged on at the moment. He is confined to County Cork and he should be doing work all over the country.  His knowledge and skill should be utilised to the greatest extent <Col N="366" /> possible in developing small electric schemes.  There are many mountain streams which could be harnessed to supply light locally at very small cost.  The person I have in mind could give instruction and advice in connection with such matters.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Reilly suggested that instruction in rural science for boys and domestic science for girls should be carried to the farthest limits.  I agree absolutely with that.  Domestic science for girls is very important. The vocational schools could be used to a much greater extent in connection with the teaching of agriculture than they are at the moment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>One advantage that the Minister for Education has in dealing with vocational education is that, no matter what criticisms may be made of the Department of which he is for the time being the head, he can at least distribute them because the vocational schemes are under the control of local authorities, the representatives of the people on the local councils.  We must judge the success of the schemes by the material that we see on these committees, by the interest the members take in the schemes, the activity they display and the length to which they will go to scrutinise and investigate matters and not be put off with some easy answer if they feel that they are not getting the value they should get or that their conception of what ought to be done is not being carried out or the results they had expected are not being achieved.  If one is to be a successful member of a vocational education committee or any other cultural body, one must have some enthusiasm. If one starts off with the idea that we have failed, that we started off wrong and that the only question is how far we shall go in the direction of failure, if one gets into that rather discouraged frame of mind, it is difficult to see how one can lend any enthusiasm where enthusiasm is so necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If those responsible for the administration of local schemes are not themselves enthusiastic, they can scarcely communicate enthusiasm to their staffs.  They cannot expect that others who are working with them or the parents and the public generally <Col N="367" /> will feel that vocational education is worth while.  If we cannot get our local representatives to value it, we cannot expect the public to value it.</P>
    <P>I think Senator O'Reilly of Leitrim was correct in saying that although the scheme has been some 16 years in operation, under the Vocational Education Act of 1930, it still is only in its infancy.  It is only now, for example, that the ideas to which Senator Ruane and others have referred are permeating the country, that the rural school can be made a genuine centre for revitalising country life, for bringing country people together, for enabling them to meet socially and culturally as well as to discuss problems connected with their daily avocations.  To have a practical education provided at the nearest centre for their boys and girls will certainly not be a disadvantage to them and will probably be a considerable help, even from the narrow point of view of finding employment.</P>
    <P>I should be glad if those who represent rural areas and out-of-the-way districts, that have been frequently referred to, would take more interest in these schemes, would visit the schools, if they are members of the committees, would try to be helpful. County Leitrim, although it is the poorest county we have to deal with, although its rating powers are extremely small, is an example of one of those schemes where you cannot have a very successful scheme without substantial Government aid.  But I am glad to say that County Leitrim is deserving of that aid.  They have a very good scheme.  They have a number of schools, a number of teachers, and they are working pretty satisfactorily.  If Senator O'Reilly is an example of the members of the Leitrim committee and if they think the same way as he does about the problems of vocational education, I would say there is every hope indeed that vocational education in that county will go ahead, even though it is a poor county and what can be raised from the rates is limited.</P>
    <P>There is no such excuse in other areas.  Most of the other counties, with <Col N="368" /> the exception of the poorer congested areas, have ample rating facilities and have not reached their maximum at all under their present rating powers.  One would imagine, listening to Senator Baxter, that one can get things done in education without spending any money.  Perhaps one could, if, as I have said, you have teachers with personality, teachers with enthusiasm and if you have committees behind these teachers who have similar enthusiasm and who want to be helpful and constructive and to get results.  No doubt you will get a great many more results in that way.  But if you are niggardly, if you think about every halfpenny you are going to spend, what the small farmers are going to say about the extra halfpenny that it is proposed to raise&mdash;if you can think of nothing else in connection with vocational education development but the reaction on particular elements of the rural community of having to pay another halfpenny, then you are not creating the necessary atmosphere for proper educational development.  You must create the atmosphere.  If you are spending all this money and if you think that too much is being spent, that there should be more value for it, why not go and explain to the people that the facilities are there and ask them to take more advantage of these facilities?  Some Senators may think that a sufficient number of centres are not being organised in rural areas to cover the rural population, but I have given figures elsewhere to show that it is the rural population mainly who are benefiting; it is the rural children who cycle five or six miles, and perhaps more, into vocational schools or the class centres.  If in Cavan or any other county the committee would address itself to developing these schemes with moderate expenditure&mdash;we are not asking them to be wasteful&mdash;the provisions of this Bill are entirely permissive. There is no compulsion.  No local committee is asked to raise a rate if it does not wish to do so.  The local forum is there.</P>
    <P>Why should those who are charged with the development of education think that the expenditure on vocational education is all waste&mdash;I hope many of them do not&mdash;and that they <Col N="369" /> are not getting anywhere with it?  If that is the position&mdash;I do not believe it is&mdash;matters would be very serious.  I think what is wrong is that you have not the local direction that is necessary and the local outlook that will bring the best results.  The Minister for Agriculture is the authority for agricultural education and whatever we may do in our vocational school must have regard to that fact.  That is the position.  We have circularised our committees and explained to them that there is a method of liaison by which the Departments can work each within its own sphere. I do not think there is the slightest danger of the Department of Agriculture interfering with the normal work of the local vocational school or in any development which the committee proposes to give better facilities to rural schools.  We cannot have schools in every parish unfortunately and, owing to the great fall in our rural population, we cannot avoid saying that it is not in every district that you can have a successful permanent centre.  But let us have permanent centres where it is possible to have a sufficient enrolment to make it worth while to have a reasonable school staff and to give them reasonably full employment.  Such a centre in addition to giving that regular employment as a permanent matter, will also be a centre for the usual itinerant courses which are held towards the end of the school session, after Easter generally, and through which all the surrounding areas can be in turn covered.  I think, as I said in my opening statement, the whole district round about the school is covered by the teaching staff and feels the influence of the school.</P>
    <P>We shall probably hear more about Section 5 so I need only say at this stage that the intention of the 1944 Act, in connection with Sections 6, 7 and 8 was quite clear, that they should apply to transferred officers.  A doubt has been expressed as to whether that is done in sufficiently specific terms, whether it is sufficiently clear and the purpose of Section 5 is to make the intentions of the 1944 Act in that respect quite clear and put them beyond any doubt.  I do <Col N="370" /> not think I need go into the whole question again.  If it is pursued further on the Committee Stage we can deal with it then.</P>
    <P>As far as I know, there is no other person in the position of Mr. Flynn, whose case is dealt with in the Bill. It would not have been possible to deal with that case under the local government superannuation amendment legislation because Mr. Flynn is not a local officer at the present time.  That legislation will apply only to those who are in the service so that it was necessary to deal with his case specially.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Reilly of Tipperary is not correct in suggesting&mdash;perhaps he did not make himself sufficiently clear but he certainly gave that impression&mdash; that a national teacher had been brought in and put over the senior officers and headmasters working in Dublin City under the Dublin City Vocational Education Committee, when the post of chief executive officer was being filled.  The point was that the person in question, of course, had already been in the service for a period.  In order to be eligible for one of these posts, when they are advertised, one of the conditions generally is that candidates must have five years' service.  In the case of a chief executive officership, candidates would be expected to have five years' service as headmasters.  This candidate, of course, had that and in addition he had been responsible for the administration of Comhairle Leas Oige&mdash;the scheme for juvenile training in the City of Dublin. In any case, I want to make it quite clear that it was not a case that he came in as a national teacher and was selected in preference to others who were longer in the service.  He fulfilled the necessary conditions in regard to experience in the vocational education service.</P>
    <P>I do not think I can promise Senator O'Reilly of Leitrim that this will be the last occasion on which we shall have to amend the vocational education code because I do not know what the exact terms of the recommendations, which I expect we may receive from the Commission on Youth Unemployment, may be in regard to the school-leaving age.  I have reason to believe <Col N="371" /> that a recommendation will be made that the school-leaving age should be raised but until we see the exact terms in which that recommendation is made, and the arguments supporting it, it would be difficult to say what the repercussions upon vocational education would be.  I take it that, in the city at any rate, there is no doubt that greatly increased accommodation will be necessary.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I ask my friends in Dublin who are interested in vocational education&mdash;particularly, the members of the committee who are alive to the needs of the city&mdash;to do what they can to push forward the completion of the new schools.  Even with these new schools, we shall be able to reach only a small proportion&mdash; not even one-third, I should say&mdash;of the young people for whom it would be necessary to find place if compulsory education were in force from 14 years to 16 years.  We should, probably, be able to find room for 2,000 in the five new regional schools but, so far as my recollection serves, we should require accommodation for about 7,000 if we were to meet the demand of those who would be affected if the school-leaving age were to be raised to 16 and if the young people concerned were to be accommodated in vocational or technical schools.</P>

    <P>If Galway Vocational Education Committee put up a scheme for training workers in weaving or other trades which have a particular affiliation with the Gaeltacht areas or with rural areas&mdash;the same applies to other counties; it is not a thing we need confine to the Gaeltacht&mdash;I should be very glad to examine it with a view to seeing what co-operation we might be able to give in forwarding it.  I should like very much to see more training courses held under the auspices of <Col N="372" /> local committees throughout the country.  There is no reason whatever why the county committees should not organise their own training courses and have them at their own centres, with those students who have shown a special aptitude, or those workers who would benefit, in attendance.</P>

      <P>Lest the parents of the country might not understand the reasons for the policy that is being followed regarding the Irish language in educational matters.  I presume what he meant was that I should address the Seanad in English.  Since I have become Minister for Education, I have spoken in Irish so far as possible. I think that it would be very incongruous if I were to ask others to do what they could for the revival of Irish and, in my own official capacity, when speaking, for instance, on this Bill, should fail to avail of the opportunity to give good example.  Senator Hayes would be rather surprised if I were to fail to do that.  If it were possible to provide every Senator who could not follow my remarks in Irish with a translation in English, I should be glad to do so.  It has not been possible, so far, to do that, but I think most of the Senators understood what I was saying.  I think it would be rather an assumption of failure in this 25th year after the signing of the Treaty, about which we heard so much, and the setting up of an Irish Government, to have to take this line regarding the Irish language.  The difference between us seems to me to be that we take the Irish language for granted and, if one knows Irish, we see no reason why Irish should not be spoken.  If people do not know Irish, that is a different matter.  People who know Irish, who are in positions of responsibility, who advocate a certain policy with regard to the revival of the language and are doing certain things in their official capacity to advance that policy should be expected to give good example.  Senator Hayes and his friends seem to have a complex <Col N="373" /> that somebody is forcing Irish down the throats of the people.  He contradicted himself, in fact, when he pointed out that, in the primary and secondary branches, consideration was being shown to teachers where there are special difficulties, as at the present time.  On other occasions, he might have another tune.  Why should it be charged against the inspectors that they are an unreasonable body of men? The Minister himself is, apparently, a reasonable person, but the inspectors, who are responsible to him, are unreasonable and are flouting the official regulations&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>This thing has been coming up from the same source for many years&mdash;this suggestion that Irish is being forced on people who do not want it.  In what way can that happen? It can happen only through the inspectors deliberately disobeying orders or refusing to carry out the written and other instructions they are getting to adhere to the policy of the Department. That is the only way in which that could happen.  Senator Hayes raised a question with regard to the chief inspector of vocational education.  He took advantage of his position&mdash;I was rather surprised at Senator Hayes having regard to the responsible office he held in this State&mdash;to make an attack on an important officer in the educational service who is not in a position to meet the attack or to defend himself. Senator Hayes must have known that I was not fully acquainted with the evidence upon which his statements were made. When he and his colleagues make such statements here, they fail to give any evidence.  It generally boils down to &ldquo;somebody told me&rdquo;.  In conversation with Senator Hayes, it is true that he mentioned one of these matters.  He did not suggest&mdash;if I am wrong, he will correct me&mdash;that he had personal knowledge of it.  He said he had heard a conversation between girls who were students at a certain institution <Col N="374" /> in which they made the statement that the inspector had said a certain thing of the teacher.  If Senator Hayes had any confidence in my judgment or my sense of responsibility, he might, perhaps, have left the matter there and assumed that I would, if I considered it necessary, take further action regarding it.  The Senator was not satisfied with that.  He came along and added other instances this evening, having given me no notice whatever of the matter.  He has made a public attack on an official who cannot explain what actually happened.  Nor am I in a position to do so.  Surely Senator Hayes, as an educationist and a responsible public man, ought to know, after so many years' experience, that one cannot make serious charges of that kind in public on mere hearsay. As suggested by one of the Senators on my left, the authorities responsible should have been given the opportunity of showing whether or not they would follow up the matter if they considered it serious.</P>

When you feel you can attack a public official in that manner and get away with it, so why spare him, when you are attacking him, why not do as much damage as possible, knowing that you are likely to get away with it and that the official cannot reply here and now in an effective way&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;the rest of us are to follow.  Thank God, we have not got those ideas about Irish.  We believe <Col N="376" /> that Irish can be revived, but we certainly do not believe it can be revived by people who have no belief in it themselves, who have no heart in it and who cannot inspire the young people of the country to believe that this is a task to which we ought to bend our energies very seriously and to which we ought to devote a great deal of our attention.  Had the Senator examined the position or given any attention to it, had he, for example, gone down to the neighbouring county of Meath and asked himself what development had taken place there under the vocational education scheme, he would have found that there was an extraordinary development in the number of classes there.  Not since the Treaty, which the Senator was celebrating recently, was signed, was there such enthusiasm or such widespread interest in the Irish language as there is at present in County Meath and it is not the only county.  There are other counties.  It is too much that I should have to come here and listen to people who have really no knowledge of vocational education, of what is going on in the country and who do not take the trouble to acquaint themselves with the most elementary facts before getting up here and making charges of this nature.</P>
      <P>Apparently, according to Senator Hayes, it would be the greatest treason that anybody should suggest that a university graduate should receive any further training before, having completed his degree, he goes out to teach in a vocational school.  There is such an award in the university, of the staff of which Senator Hayes is at present a member, called the Higher Diploma in Education.  That diploma is awarded on the practical work and the written work of students who have completed their primary degrees and who want to continue for a further period in order to equip themselves for careers as teachers.  We had the old system of Gaelic League classes and the classes under the vocational education schemes 20 and 25 years ago.  They were very suitable at that time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now we have the position that our young people who have been attending primary schools or, perhaps, in certain <Col N="377" /> cases, secondary schools, and who subsequently attend vocational education schools are much better equipped in regard to Irish than their predecessors 25 years ago.</P>
    <P>We cannot, therefore, assume that the young teachers who are to handle that material, either in day or night classes, do not require further equipment, and it was with a view to giving these teachers the necessary training in teaching methods, the necessary further education to enable them to deal with the problem in a way in which it has not been dealt with so far in our vocational schemes, that these courses were held.  A certain number of university graduates attended them and the university graduates, even those who are seeking to enter responsible posts in the Civil Service, have not always got that oral knowledge of Irish that one would expect.  I am not finding any fault with them.  I simply say that is the position.</P>
    <P>If they are to go into vocational schools, even if they are university graduates, and if they are expected to teach at least some portion of the work through Irish, if they are expected to do their share, if they are teachers of Irish, in teaching the language as a living language, it is necessary that they should have a new outlook in regard to it, that they should be so equipped that they will stir up the enthusiasm of the people whom they are teaching, and that they will provide centres so far as is possible where the Irish language will be spoken, where it will be debated and where it will be treated as a mode of intercourse for serious discussion.  It was to prepare these teacher candidates for work of that nature and to give them the necessary foundation that these courses were held.  A great number of the persons who attended them were already teaching in a part-time or whole-time capacity, but, before we sent them out to the country as fully recognised whole-time teachers who would spend the remainder of their lives teaching under vocational education schemes, it was our business to see that, if they were to have anything to do with teaching the Irish language, or teaching through the Irish <Col N="378" /> language, they should be as well prepared as it lay within our power to make them.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. MacEntee) Seán MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to make further and, I suppose as a preamble might say, better provision for the relief of agricultural land from rates during the current year and next year.  Briefly, the provisions of the Bill confirm the announcement which the Minister for Finance made in the course of his <Col N="379" /> Budget speech as to how the additional sum of over £1,000,000, which he proposes to provide for the relief of rates on agricultural land, would be disposed of.  The House is aware, of course, that the present grant is administered and distributed in accordance with provisions of the Rates on Agricultural Land (Relief) Act, 1939, which provides that the grant will be given in three allowances which are known as the primary allowance, the employment allowance and the supplementary allowance respectively.  This Bill proposes to continue the system of giving relief under three heads, but under the Bill the existing allowances will be considerably increased.  According to the estimates which we have been able to form up to the present, the primary allowance will now take £1,827,000. That approximates relatively closely to the total amount of the present grant under all three heads.  In addition, the employment allowances are likely to absorb £587,000 odd, and the supplementary allowances another £464,000. Any Senator who is good at mental arithmetic can calculate what these sums will amount to.  They will amount to about £2,880,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proposals in this Bill depart in a fundamental way from the provisions of any Bill relating to or providing for grants in relief of rates on agricultural land which has hitherto been enacted, because under this Bill no fixed amount is settled for the agricultural grant. The total grant will be the amount needed to give the reliefs prescribed by the Bill.  These reliefs, as I have said, will take the form of primary, employment and supplementary allowances. The sum provided for primary allowances this year and next year, instead of being a fixed amount as formerly, will be three-fifths of the general county rate for the year, and will, therefore, vary as the county rate varies.  The supplementary allowance will be one-fifth of the general rate and will be allowed on the whole valuation above £20, and it also will vary, as in the case of the primary allowance, as the general rate varies. In addition to these two allowances, there will be an employment allowance, but it will be at a much higher <Col N="380" /> rate than the existing employment allowance.  Hitherto the employment allowance varied according to the primary rate of relief, and on the average it worked out at about £3 for each worker.  As, however, the supplementary allowance was granted in respect of any valuation over £20 for which an employment allowance was not obtainable, the net advantage to the occupiers was only about 30/- per man employed.  Under the present Bill, the average net employment allowance will be more than trebled, as it is proposed to raise the allowance to a maximum of £6 10s. 0d. per man employed, and to make it a uniform rate throughout the country.</P>
    <P>This Bill, I should say, will not affect agricultural land in urban districts. This year the occupiers of these lands will be dealt with under the Act of 1939 and will get the share of the agricultural grant as it stood last year.  The provision for that is made under sub-section (2) of Section 10 of the Bill. Next year, however, Sections 21 and 25 of the Local Government Act of 1946 will apply, and these sections, as the House may recollect, provide for the differential rating of land in urban districts and the agricultural grant will be paid into a municipal fund.</P>
    <P>Turning to the text of the Bill, the general rate is defined in Section 1 and except in County Dublin the general rate means the total rate levied over the whole county health district for any purpose except the defrayment of compensation for criminal injuries. Cork County presents a special feature in this regard, as there are three county health districts within that county and each of them has its own general rate.  I have mentioned that, under the Bill, uniformity in the ratio of allowances to the rate will obtain over the whole country and this will include Dublin County, but in that county, though there is a single county health district, there are three public assistance districts, each of which has its own rate.  It is to meet this case that the reference is made in Section 1 to a public assistance district when defining the expression &ldquo;general rate in the pound&rdquo;.  A further consequence flows from the definition of a general <Col N="381" /> rate, as given in the Bill, for this definition makes it clear that, for the purpose of the Bill, all rates levied over the whole of the rating area, county health district or public assistance district, as the case may be, for any purpose except the purpose of defraying a charge for criminal injuries will be taken as a general rate.  Some councils will find this a very substantial concession.</P>
    <P>Section 2 prescribes that the period for which the Act will be in operation will be this year and next year.  Section 3 is an important section, since it not only provides that all the additional agricultural grant of £370,000 which was given under the 1939 Act will continue, but it goes on in sub-section (2) to provide that the county councils will be entitled to get the difference between the sum allocated to them under paragraph (a) of sub-section (3) of Section 4 of the 1939 Act and any deficiencies in the revenue which, but for the new increase in the grants, would arise out of the reliefs given in the Bill.  It will be obvious that the provisions in this section remove the fixed limit which hitherto has been placed on the amount of the agricultural grant.</P>
    <P>Section 4 has been made necessary by reason of the fact that a new rating system was prescribed in the Local Government Act this year for land in urban districts.  In view of this provision, it has been necessary to redefine the specified valuation.  There is, in fact, no significant change in it.  Section 5 provides that the scale of primary allowances is to be equivalent to three-fifths of the general rate.</P>
    <P>Section 6 deals with the new supplementary allowance and, as I have already explained, it differs from the old in being an allowance on the whole of the valuation over £20 and will be fixed at one-fifth of the general rate. In Section 7 the provisions relating to employment allowances will be found. Sub-section (3) is a new provision which enables the county councils to receive claims up to the 1st February in a financial year in respect of which the employment allowance is claimed.</P>
    <P>Section 8 safeguards any occupier whose rates on land this year under the <Col N="382" /> Bill might be greater than they would be under the Act of 1939.  Section 9 will allow for reliefs being given by way of credit notes this year.</P>
    <P>Section 10 suspends the operation of those sections of the Act of 1939, which will be temporarily suspended by the Bill, that is to say, Section 11 of the Act of 1939, which contains provisions in relation to urban districts.  I should explain also that Section 11 of the Act of 1939 has been wholly repealed by the Local Government Act this year, but the repeal will not come into operation until next April.  The section, therefore, will continue in operation this year.  Similarly, in regard to Section 12 of the Act of 1939, which was partially repealed by the Act of 1946. Those are all the provisions of the Bill</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>The first point I have to make&mdash;and I suppose the Minister may be expecting it&mdash;is one of complaint. It was unfortunate that the Minister, anticipating, as he did, and knowing what was coming, did not intimate to county councils this year, before they sat down to levy the rate, that they should hold their hand.  Now, as he is aware, some councils are facing the problem of a greatly increased rate for the current year and were so perplexed with the difficulties in which they found themselves that they actually put off striking a rate from one meeting to another.  As far as I can recollect, the neighbouring county of Monaghan adjourned their meetings&mdash; whether they had special information or not I do not know&mdash;while we in Cavan struck our rate.  Then we received the Minister's intimation and had to come along at considerable expense and alter the accounting and the demand notes.  In addition we were making a demand from the ratepayers which we certainly would not have made if we had the later information. It would have been better if there had been some intimation that the striking of the rate might be adjourned for two or three weeks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know what other members of the House think about the Bill, but to me it seems a terribly complicated measure for what is in it.  I am not suggesting it is put in that form deliberately.  Because of the way he <Col N="383" /> had to construct the relief, I suppose the Minister had to put it like that, but I can say from experience that it is very difficult for the local representatives to understand the whole process by which this relief has been determined.</P>
    <P>I put it to the Minister that Section 7, as it is operated at present with regard to employment allowances, is hardly equitable.  The situation is that an employer will get an allowance for an employee only on the condition that the man is the full year in his employment. I am sure we all know that many employers may have three or four men permanently employed and for a considerable period of the year they may have as many as another half a dozen, yet there is no consideration or relief at all for the extra expenditure of the ratepayer on those men who are not occupied for the full year.</P>
    <P>The whole question of employment is determined by the National Health Insurance cards.  These cards have to be produced as evidence of employment for a full year.  Thousands of farmers have numbers of men employed, not for the full year, but for several months of the year.  This section makes provision for relief in relation to the number of men employed.  If the equities of the situation are to be discharged, I think that the provision should be extended to cover all the employment which a farmer gives.  If a farmer has four temporary men, surely these are equivalent to one man in full-time employment. With many farmers they would be the equivalent of two men in full employment.  There is no consideration for that.  It is not the fault of the farmers that men are not in full-time employment.  They are not available. I am sure Senator O'Callaghan or Senator Kehoe will bear me out when I say there are men on whose services you can draw for a period of months but you cannot draw on their services for the full year.  That aspect is worthy of consideration.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the whole question of our rating system should be open for examination and discussion again.  This relief, which the Minister thinks is very generous, does no more in the majority <Col N="384" /> of counties than bring the rate for the present year back to the level of last year's rate.  In all our counties the demands on the local ratepayers are rising very steeply.  Extra services of all kinds are being imposed and they have to be paid for.  The ability of the local ratepayer to bear the burden will have to be examined.  I say that, not out of my ignorance, but because I have gone to pains to study the conditions in my own county.</P>
    <P>I will give the Seanad a brief picture of the kind of situation that presents itself to the local authority in Cavan. I have a copy of the auditor's report which, at the end of the 1945 audit, revealed the fact that the balance due on loans borrowed by Cavan County Council amounted to £273,644.  Recently we had under discussion a variety of schemes, all of which are essential for the better living of the community. The council has given consideration to them to a lesser or greater extent at a number of meetings.  I asked that the members of the council should be provided with an approximate idea of what these schemes would cost.  The schemes, for which plans had been prepared, included water supplies, sewerage schemes, work under the Labourers Acts, hospitals and courthouses. The total estimated cost for those schemes that should be put into operation in my county amounts to £556,000, well over £500,000.  We owe £273,644, and if you tot the two amounts you will see that between the balance due and what ought to be spent in the county we have a total of £829,644.</P>
    <P>That would be our dead-weight debt, and the total valuation which would have to bear that burden is £282,375. At present our indebtedness is the equivalent of the total valuation of the county.  I do not know what the situation may be in other counties, but it seems quite clear that local authorities are faced with a stupendous problem. Great courage is required to do the things that are necessary.  We have to give an answer as to whether or not the people who entrust us with the responsibility of managing their local affairs are able to bear the burden which, under our present scheme <Col N="385" /> of taxation, must be placed on their shoulders if these schemes are to be carried out.</P>
    <P>The Minister is very enthusiastic about his scheme.  I am not quarrelling with it; in many ways I am just as enthusiastic as he is about the need of raising standards of health and living standards generally.  We have reached the stage when our whole system of rating and giving relief by way of grants to local authorities is very much like a patchwork quilt.  We have never tried to balance our accounts or considered what services must be given first consideration or whether we can devise a plan that will enable us to try to get ahead with schemes that the local authorities have in mind and that the Minister wants to see carried out.</P>
    <P>The ratepayers and their representatives are bound to be disturbed by the responsibilities they have to shoulder.  There are certain demands which are necessary in our towns and villages.  Sewerage and water schemes are urgently required.  People concerned with the health of the community cannot burke the issue.  When you realise the liabilities that have to be borne by the rural community if these schemes are implemented, then you become fearful.  There must be a national plan.  We must know over a long period what commitments we ought to enter into, so that we will be able to meet the liabilities arising from them.  The time has come for a review of local rating.</P>
    <P>So far as the Bill is concerned, we are glad of the relief which the Minister is giving through it, and I am prepared to facilitate the Minister in its passage through the House.</P>

      <P>The hour is late, and the House is not uncomfortably crowded.  Accordingly, I do not propose to spend any great time in drawing once more to the Minister's attention a provision in a form of words which, I think, is unfortunate and which ought not to be regarded as a precedent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>By Section 3 (2), the Oireachtas commits itself to entrusting the Minister with paying an entirely indefinite sum in the future.  This matter has <Col N="386" /> been debated in the Dáil, and the Minister has given certain answers.  He suggested that no precedent is being created.  So far as my researches go, a precedent is being created.  One of the few restraints which the Oireachtas has over the Government is the ultimate power of the purse.  I am aware, of course, that this matter is one in which the Seanad has comparatively little power.  But the Oireachtas as a whole is bound to vote any moneys which are expended from the Central Fund.  It can do so by voting a specific sum.  It can do so by empowering the expenditure of a sum up to a specified amount.  It has also done so in the past by empowering the Minister to expend a certain sum with the consent of the Minister for Finance.  In so far as it gave, by the last, formal power to the Government to expend the sum without coming back to the Oireachtas, I think it was exceeding what is desirable.  But, in the present Bill, by Section 3 power is given to the Minister for Finance to fill up any gap which may be necessary to supply the money to meet the rates and, at the same time, satisfy the agricultural grant.  I believe that to be a very undesirable precedent.  I believe it to be a precedent which we should not lay down.  I cannot accept that the answer which the Minister made to the Dáil is any answer at all, because the Minister said that, eventually, the actual sum will have to come up on the Estimates and the Estimates must be passed.  But how can any Legislature which had already expressly given the Minister power to commit himself to an indefinite sum and had allowed the local authorities to build upon that, subsequently refuse to sanction the Estimates which were within the power it had itself given?  I am not going to say any more about it.  I think the Minister will probably agree with me that the form of words here chosen follow no precedent in any other State. If he justifies it on the ground of an exceptional emergency, I can understand it.  But, if he is anxious to justify it as a form or practice which he is going to pursue in future, it is a matter which may have to be taken up more fully.</P>

      <P>From my point of <Col N="387" /> view, the Bill is a good one.  From my own experience over a long period of years a slump, such as has followed every war, will occur in 1948 or 1949.  If that slump is accompanied by an increase in the rates, it will be a bad job.  I should like to encourage the Minister to go forward with the Bill and to extend it over a great number of years.  I think the £6 10s. relief to be given for each man employed on the land is a unique method of creating employment on the land and also a very desirable one and is appreciated by a great number of ratepayers to whom I have been speaking.  I feel that it will have the effect of creating much greater employment on the land.</P>

      <P>As the hour is late, I do not propose to say very much, because I do not think very much has been said in regard to the Bill.  I do not think that it would be opportune on this occasion to discuss, as Deputy Baxter seemed to think it would be, the whole system of rating and revenue-raising devices which we have adopted for financing the local authorities. After all, this Bill does not provide for anything except for the relief of rates on agricultural land.  It provides, primarily and ultimately, for the relief of individuals, and not of local authorities. Nor do I propose to say very much about his rather unique expression of disappointment that a Minister should not have divulged Budget secrets in advance of the Budget speech.  The proposals which this Bill is to give effect to were announced by the Minister for Finance in his Budget statement and I was not in a position, naturally, to disclose them in advance. I am at a loss to understand exactly in what way any local authority was put to undue expense by reason of the fact that the announcement of these new proposals was deferred until the Financial Statement.  These proposals do not involve the making of any amendment in the existing rate.  The rate was struck, I think, early in April in most cases, even in those cases where an amended rate had to be made, and this Bill does not in any way affect the making of that rate, good, bad or indifferent.  It merely provides <Col N="388" /> that the amount of the rate to be collected ultimately from a certain section of the ratepayers will be less than it would otherwise have been.</P>
      <P>As to the extent to which the employment allowance has been criticised, I must say that it only covers whole-time constant employment.  The purpose of the allowance is to encourage the giving of whole-time constant employment.  So far as my personal influence in the counsels of the Government goes, I will not advocate any measure which would tend to a further casualisation of agricultural labour.  This Bill is intended to encourage farmers to keep their men in employment all the year round.  If any farmer is not able to do that, it may be regrettable, but he is not going to get any benefit under this Bill, so far as the employment allowance is concerned.</P>
      <P>As to Senator Kingsmill Moore's remarks, I have only to repeat that we are not creating a precedent.  I do not propose to enter into a legal argument with a learned lawyer.  I would not be able to hold my own.</P>

      <P>I would refer the Senator to the provisions of the Medical Treatment of Children (Ireland) Act, 1919; and, briefly, to summarise the provision of sub-section (7) of Section 1, that sub-section provides that any expenses incurred by a local authority in the execution of this Act shall be paid to the local authority from moneys provided by Parliament. The phraseology is not exactly the same, but it seems to me that the purpose is the same, that is to say, to indicate that moneys will be provided, provided, of course, that these expenses have been properly certified, within certain limits.  Similarly, the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act of 1932 provides that the Minister may, with the consent of the Minister for Finance and subject to the prescribed regulations&mdash;those are regulations made by the Minister for Local Government&mdash;make out of moneys to <Col N="389" /> be provided by the Oireachtas during such period, not exceeding 35 years, as the Minister may determine, a contribution toward the annual loan charges incurred by a local authority in respect of money borrowed by them for the provision of houses under the Housing of the Working Class Acts. Then the section goes on to fix the proportion of those charges which may be defrayed out of a contribution by the Minister.  In one case it is a proportion not exceeding 66? per centum of such annual loan charges and in another case not exceeding 33? per centum.  So that it would seem as if after all we are not creating a unique precedent when we are providing here that the Minister for Finance shall make in respect of each financial year to which this Act applies an additional grant equal to an amount which would make good any deficiency in the council's revenue, which would arise by reason of the implementation of Sections 5, 6 and 7 of the Bill.</P>
      <P>There is another point which I think I should make, that is, that the Oireachtas is not losing financial control for an indefinite period.  This Bill, as Senator O'Callaghan has pointed out, operates only for this year and next year.  This year we know very closely what our liabilities are going to be.  I do not anticipate that next year they will be very much greater.</P>

      <P>Before the Minister enters on this Bill, I understand that this Second Stage is going to be passed.  I have no objection to the Second Stage being passed and it could be passed very rapidly.  I take it that the arrangement made at the Committee on Procedure and Privileges will be operative, that is to say, that the Second Stage will be taken now and the other stages will be taken at the first meeting after Christmas.  If that is so, I was going to suggest, as people have difficulties about conveyance, that we could be satisfied with a very brief debate on the Second Stage because the Bill is of such a nature that anything anybody wants to raise can be quite easily raised on the Committee Stage.  I say that with no endeavour to delay the Bill.  Simply, it can be disposed of on the first day of sitting, the 15th January.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the indulgence of the House to stress that the Bill is a very urgent measure and that, so far as I am concerned, I should greatly appreciate it if the House could see its way to give me all the stages of the Bill this evening. As Senator Hayes has rightly pointed out, the Bill is a Bill with the principle of which we either agree or we do not.  It is essential and necessary in the public interest that all our manifold services for the prevention of hardship and the relief of distress and destitution which are now scattered over three Departments of State should be consolidated in one Department and under one Minister who would be responsible to the Government and to the Oireachtas for the proper co-ordination, reorganisation and development, if that is considered wise, of these services. Likewise, the problems which now affect the public health have become so complex and the necessity to safeguard the health of the individual in the interests of the State and of the community as a whole has become so generally recognised that, for that purpose, and for the purpose of doing this more effectively than it has hitherto been done, we should have a Minister who would be solely responsible <Col N="391" /> for the initiation and administration of such measures as in his judgment and in the judgment of the Oireachtas would best conduce to the preservation of individual health and the prolongation of human life.  It seems to me that if we are satisfied that these developments are essential in the public interest this Bill might be quickly and rapidly disposed of.</P>
      <P>I should like to ask the Seanad to accept my point of view and the point of view of the Government in this matter.  Therefore, Sir, I would like to press that all the stages of the measure be taken before the Seanad adjourns for the Christmas holidays. This Bill is essentially a Second Stage Bill.  The only amendments of significance which could be put down in Committee would be to delete Section 2 or to delete Section 3.  To delete Section 2 would be tantamount to the rejection of the proposal to establish a Department of Health.  To delete Section 3 would be to reject the proposal to establish a Department of Social Welfare.  Both these proposals are so closely interlocked that if one is rejected the other must fall with it and, if that other fails, then the whole Bill must go.</P>
      <P>Accordingly, if the Seanad wishes to oppose the establishment of one or other of the new Departments, whether it be the Department of Health or the Department of Social Welfare, then I suggest that the more consistent and the more convenient thing to do at this stage would be to defeat the Bill on the Second Reading.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I feel sure the Seanad does not want to reject the Bill or to resist the establishment of any one of the new Departments. Public opinion, as manifested by the votes in the Dáil, is behind this Bill.  The measure was supported in that House not only by the majority Party, the Government Party, but by two other Parties and by some Independents. With such a measure of support, there can be no doubt that the Bill will become law in due course and the only question that arises for consideration now is, when?  I would urge the Seanad very strongly, plead with it, even beg of it, to allow it to become law before the close of the <Col N="392" /> year, that is, in effect, to become law before Christmas.</P>
    <P>There are very strong reasons for that request.  Very critical questions of principle relating to a number of important proposals affecting the health and the welfare of the people remain to be finally determined by the Ministers who will eventually be responsible for health and social welfare. These Ministers have not been appointed yet and they cannot be appointed, even <i>in petto,</i> until this Bill becomes law.  Meanwhile, not only have these decisions on policy to be deferred but important administrative questions cannot be dealt with so long as the present condition of what is virtually an interregnum remains.  Naturally, the House will understand that the position in which myself or the Minister for Industry and Commerce find ourselves at the moment under this Bill, which is to divest us of powers and functions which we at the moment exercise, is that we will hesitate to use these powers to settle large issues which within a few weeks from now may become the responsibility of a colleague.  Hence the present position of this Bill inevitably conduces to administrative delay in dealing with important proposals.  That delay must occasion a great deal of inconvenience, perhaps even of hardship, to those who may be concerned with these matters, who may be concerned as persons administering voluntary hospitals or charitable institutions or may be concerned, say, as the staffs of mental hospitals, who will come within the ambit of the new Department of Health.  I am sure that it would be far from the mind of any member of the Seanad to prolong a state of affairs in which these delays are occurring.</P>
    <P>A further consideration which I would urge on the House is the fact that, unless the Bill becomes law before Christmas, it will not be possible to prepare Estimates for the new Departments and to secure the approval of the Minister for Finance and the Government for them in time to submit them to the Oireachtas next February with the general volume of Estimates for the other public services. It will not be possible, therefore, to <Col N="393" /> include any provision for the new Departments in the Vote on Account. Separate Votes by way of Supplementary Estimates will then have to be taken for each of the new Departments and this procedure, as the House will appreciate, will involve heavy additional demands on Parliamentary time during the busiest period of the financial session.  Perhaps even more undesirable consequences will follow if the Bill is not passed before Christmas for then we shall have the fact that the services which will be eventually brought under the Minister for Social Welfare will be provided for in the Estimates for one or other of the three Departments which at the moment administer certain of these services. These Departments will be the Department of Finance&mdash;the Department of Finance in so far as the Minister for Finance is responsible for the Estimate for the Revenue Commissioners&mdash;the Department of Industry and Commerce, and the Department of Local Government and Public Health.  The existing services within the new Department of Health which, in due course, will be controlled by the Minister for Health, will be provided for in the Estimate for the Department of Local Government and Public Health. But, unless the measure now before the House is passed, as I want to emphasise again, before Christmas, when the new Departments of Health and Social Welfare are set up, then simultaneously with the Supplementary Estimates which must be introduced in order to provide for them, additional Supplementary Estimates will have to be introduced in order to provide for the requirements of the new Department of Local Government, the pruned Department of Industry and Commerce and the reduced establishment of the Revenue Commissioners.  All these Supplementary Estimates, let me repeat, will have to be brought in and passed in order to cover services already provided for in the general volume of Estimates.  Inevitably the result, I suggest, will be to create public confusion&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;public confusion, in so far as the Oireachtas and the country will have no clear picture as to what the new Departments are going to cost nor, indeed, any real idea as to what is going to be the real cost of the public services as a whole.  I am stressing this, but I am not stressing it in order to try to create any erroneous impression outside of the seriousness of the situation which will obtain if the Seanad refuses to carry all stages of the Bill before Christmas.  I am stressing it in order that each Senator may realise what is going to happen. All this confusion and inconvenience, and all these grave disadvantages, can be avoided if the Seanad agrees to take all stages of the Bill this week or, if not this week, all the remaining stages next week.  I would urge very strongly that this should be done.  In urging this I am not losing sight of the fact that the Seanad Committee on Procedure, I understand, decided to-day not to take the Committee and Final Stages until 15th January.  But the Committee in coming to this decision did not ask for the views of the Government in the matter&mdash;perhaps quite justifiably because the Seanad admittedly is master of its own procedure and, in matters of this sort, may act as its own judgment and consideration for the public interest may direct.  I feel certain, however, that the considerations which I am now arguing on the House were not before it when it came to this decision to-day.  If they were, I am sure that the Committee, recognising the force of them, would have decided to dispose of the Bill before adjourning for the Christmas Recess.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In view of the late hour, the Seanad may not consider it advisable to take all the stages of the Bill this evening. Even if that is the case, I would press the House to meet next week on Tuesday, 17th or Wednesday, 18th, to take the remaining stages then.  I am not unaware that in asking this I may be putting members of the Seanad to some inconvenience but, as I have pointed out, public considerations for the urgent enactment of this measure which will so radically affect our services for preserving and maintaining <Col N="395" /> health and for preventing and alleviating hardship and destitution, are so great that I am sure no personal considerations will be permitted to count in the matter.  I feel, as I have said, that if any attempt had been made to consult the Government before the Seanad Committee took the decision I understand it took to-day, there would be no question but that this Bill would be disposed of before the House rises for the Christmas Recess.  I pointed out, and I think it is now admitted, that the Bill is urgently required, that the reforms it proposes to institute are recognised as necessary in the public interest so that it is not necessary for me to go into any prolonged explanation of its provisions. I, therefore, content myself by asking the House to give full weight to everything I have urged and to give me all stages of the Bill, if not this evening before the House rises, then next week.</P>

      <P>The Minister is a regular bogey-man.  I never heard the like of his story.  He made our flesh creep.  If this Bill, which the Minister delayed in the other House, which was held up because of the Minister's own performances there, is not passed through all stages now, all kinds of catastrophies and cataclysms will occur in the country.  Surely the Minister cannot believe that.  It is just nonsense. Nobody here is considering his own personal convenience or inconvenience. The situation is quite a simple one.  The Committee on Procedure and Privileges contains members of all Parties.  Why did not the Minister tell the members of his own Party on that Committee the long story which he has told us?</P>

      <P>There are people in this House who, to the best of my knowledge and belief, have considerable sympathy and contact with the Minister for Local Government.  Apparently, the contacts are very remote, because none of them knew yesterday anything about the extraordinary <Col N="396" /> situation which would arise if we did not give the Minister all stages of this Bill to-night.  The question is not one of personal convenience.  It is a question of how this House should do its business.  The Minister devoted more than 20 days of the time of the Dáil to a Public Health Bill which, but for the fact that the Opposition were intelligent and tenacious, would have got through the Dáil and occupied our attention here.  The Minister, in that event, would now be urging us to repeal that measure so as to enable him to pass this Bill through.  Is not that true?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I should not think of addressing a question to the Minister. He might reply at length.  It is because of that lack of understanding and bad arrangement of business that we are presented with a great deal of work which could only be transacted under the duress of long speeches.  I do not want to delay this Bill.  So far as this House is concerned, the Committee on Procedure and Privileges has always been unanimous in its arrangement of public business.  We have always been accommodating&mdash;on all sides&mdash;with regard to the convenience of Ministers.  On the other hand, Ministers have always shown themselves willing to come here to discuss motions and the different groups in the House have shown themselves willing to accommodate one another. So far as this Bill is concerned, I do not accept for a moment the view that, having done without those two Ministries for the past 25 years under two Governments, and for the past 15 years under the present Government, there will be a dreadful disaster if we delay this measure for three weeks. That is a childish submission.  When referring to the Estimates, in dealing with the question of procedure, the Minister said he could bring in a Supplementary Estimate, but he hastily added, looking across at me: &ldquo;Bringing in a Supplementary Estimate is a dreadful business and causes tremendous administrative inconvenience&rdquo;. It does not&mdash;and well the Minister knows it and well I know it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="397" /> What we should do is transact our business in the way we said we would transact it.  I do not believe that the Minister will be inconvenienced by our doing that.  There is no reason why the Minister should not assume that the Bill will be passed and proceed to discuss the financial arrangements with the Minister for Finance.  One would imagine that the Minister for Finance was a remote ogre&mdash;remote from the Minister and from the two Ministers-designate. Surely the Minister for Local Government and the Minister for Finance live and have their being in close contact.  Surely, there is no difficulty in assuming that this Bill will become law and leaving the two Ministers-designate to decide upon policy and settle matters with the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>We are now fond of British precedents. The British recently decided to set up a Ministry of Defence.  Mr. Alexander was mentioned in the papers as the Minister-designate for Defence before the Bill was passed into law&mdash; I do not know whether it is yet passed or not.  At any rate, the course the British adopted gave the British Parliament an opportunity of discussing the whole matter.  If a Parliamentary Secretary is to be appointed to one of these posts, why not proceed in the same way?  Instead of breaking arrangements, it would be much better if the Minister would make known beforehand what he wants.  If he had done so, we could have considered this matter yesterday.  I do not think that there is anything in the Minister's argument.  It is simply a matter of the Minister's Parliamentary business having been badly arranged in the Dáil. We gave the Government yesterday and to-day all stages of a number of Bills.  By doing so, we stultify ourselves as a House.  It is not a matter of personal inconvenience.  I am a resident of Dublin and I have no objection to meeting to-night or Tuesday, Wednesday or Thursday of next week. But we are stultifying ourselves by running all these Bills through.</P>
    <P>When the Minister tells us elaborately that we can only amend the Bill by rejecting its principle, he is really telling us something he does not know <Col N="398" /> very much about.  He may be humbugging himself in endeavouring to humbug us.  It would be better for us, for the future of the House, for our relations in the House and for our relations with Ministers if we were to keep to the arrangement made, not because we object to doing work at any time, but because a House of Parliament should work on some definite scheme.  I have a great objection to any Minister coming in here and holding up the big stick and saying: &ldquo;The public want this&rdquo;.  The public may want it, but they have been 25 years without it and the Minister is responsible for 15 years of that delay, if I am to use his line of argument.  Yet we are going to create a dreadful situation by forcing him to wait for less than a month.  The simple procedure would be to take the Second Stage of this Bill to-day and give the Minister all the remaining stages when we meet after Christmas&mdash;whether on the 8th or 15th January.  Instead of discussing the Bill in this atmosphere, better discuss it intelligently and calmly, with some little time on our hands, after Christmas.</P>
    <P>I think it can be said that we never held up a Bill in this House since 1938. No effort was made to do so.  We had nothing but reasonable discussion and it is most unreasonable for the Minister so to arrange his Parliamentary business that he confronts us at 11 o'clock at night with a Bill that makes very important changes in public health administration and asks us to pass all stages to-night or to meet with a scrap House within a few days of Christmas and pass it.  Would it not be better to get the Bill on the 15th or 8th January?  I do not know whether the Minister ever heard of this story: When the General Headquarters Staff of the Irish Army were taking over from the British, they were met at the gate by a fuming sergeant-major who said: &ldquo;Gentlemen, you are three minutes late.&rdquo;  A member of the general staff said: &ldquo;You have been here for 700 years and a few minutes more will not do you any harm.&rdquo;  This Bill has been 25 years off the stocks and a few weeks more will not do any harm.  Everything the Minister wants to do, he can do in <Col N="399" /> Government circles and with the Minister for Finance without this Bill coming into law.  I do not want to prolong discussion but I suggest that, for the sake of the goodwill that exists in the House and for the sake of the good name of the House, we should adhere to our own arrangement.  I do not think that it will do any harm and the Minister can get the Bill on the 15th or the 8th January.</P>

There is to be a new Minister for Health and it seems to me that it would be logical to suggest that there should be a change in the title of the Minister.

      <P>As the time available for the consideration of the Bill has been raised, I want to point out that pressure was used in the other House for several years to induce the Government to introduce a proposal of this kind; the resistance to the demand came not from the Opposition but from the Government.  I looked through the debates recently to see exactly how this Bill came into being.  I did not go back very far&mdash;merely to 1942&mdash;and I find the Taoiseach there strongly resisting a proposal to set up separate Ministries to deal with social welfare and public health.  As a matter of fact, here is a rather interesting thing.  On 17th February, 1944, the Taoiseach said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The present system of administration of social services is efficient and economical.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>He was then resisting a suggestion that there should be a separate administration for health and social service matters, but, three weeks later, the present Minister for Local Government made a speech at a meeting of the Medical Society of U.C.D. in which the introduction of this Bill was first announced.  That was back in March, 1944, two years and nine months ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill arrives here now and we are told that it must go through all stages before Christmas.  I do not think that is true; if there was that urgency to have this Bill enacted and made law before the end of the year, it should have reached us in reasonable time. There is a good deal which could be discussed on the Second Stage, and, in fact, the debate on the Second Stage might and should cover a considerable amount of ground, unless we are to take the Bill and say it is all <Col N="401" /> right because it is introduced by the Government.  We cannot do that.  So far as I know, we have no knowledge of what services are to be administered by either of the new Departments, and members of the House might like to offer suggestions as to the manner in which the administration of the services should be arranged.</P>
    <P>On many occasions I have drawn attention to what I consider our wasteful method of administering the public health services.  I was interested to read the debates in the Dáil in which the Minister expressed the view, in introducing this Bill, that the Government were ahead of public opinion. He seemed to be rather nervous; he felt he had to make a case that would convince the public that there was need for these two additional Departments. I do not know on what that view was based, except perhaps the fact&mdash;and this is very noteworthy&mdash; that, apart from Ministers and Parliamentary Secretaries, only 30 members of Fianna Fáil Party in the Dáil voted for the Second Reading of the Bill. That is a very alarming feature&mdash;that only 30 members of the Minister's Party, apart from Ministers and Parliamentary Secretaries, voted for the Second Reading.  I am, therefore, assuming that the speech in which the Second Reading of the Bill was recommended to the Dáil was addressed, not to the country, but to the members of his own Party, who apparently were either hostile to the measure or so indifferent that they did not come in to vote for it.</P>

      <P>Not very many, but, of course, it is not our Bill.  It is the Minister's Bill.  I would say, however, since the point has been raised by the Minister, that we have not been indifferent to this question and that we helped to shape the public opinion for the Minister which he so much desires to cultivate now.  I remember writing a memorandum for the Minister back in 1935.  I was a member of a commission of which the Minister did me the honour of making me a member; I <Col N="402" /> wrote a minority report in which I made a recommendation of this kind, although I must say it was a very attenuated one, because strictly it was outside the terms of reference of the commission.  Long before that, in June of 1926, I was asked by the Irish Trade Union Congress to prepare a report for them on the reorganisation of the social services, and I did, in fact, write a pretty lengthy report.  The Minister will be aware of this because I know he has access to the reports of the Trade Union Congress.  He has quoted them frequently.  What it is important to bear in mind, however, is that the recommendations I submitted to Congress 20 years ago were adopted unanimously by a body representing 250,000 people.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>I was dealing with the fact, which is important, that the Minister felt he was in front of public opinion, and made a very long speech in the Dáil trying to convince the public that there is a case for this Bill. I am trying to point out to the Seanad that there is no need to make that case, because public opinion was converted 20 years ago, not by the Minister, but by those of us who are now accused of trying to delay or destroy this Bill.  My main anxiety, however, in regard to the Bill is that there is nothing in the speech made by the Minister in the other House&mdash;he has made no speech here in support of the Bill&mdash;to indicate that the new situation will be better than the old.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We find the most extraordinary arrangements in existence for administering social services.  We have widows' and orphans' pensions administered by a special section of the Department of Local Government, and children's allowances by a section of the Department of Industry and Commerce. In this connection, it is interesting to note that when I made inquiry in certain circles as to why, of all things in the world, the Department of Industry and Commerce was saddled with the administration of <Col N="403" /> children's allowances, I was told that as the only official on the Departmental Committee in favour of recommending the payment of children's allowances was the representative of the Department of Industry and Commerce, the committee decided to hand the unwanted baby to that Department. That was the only explanation I could get for it.</P>
    <P>The whole system of administration is lop-sided with the result that we have a multiplicity of Government inspectors all over the country.  It is nothing uncommon&mdash;at least, some years ago, I remember it was nothing uncommon&mdash;to find three or four Government inspectors in one town on one day, simply because different kinds of inspectors were working for different Departments, doing work which was very closely related, so far as the lives of the people are concerned.  I am anxious that we should have some assurance that when this Bill becomes law and these two Ministries are established, there will be a proper rearrangement of the activities which we call social services and that matters, for instance, like workmen's compensation, unemployment insurance, health insurance, children's allowances and all such services will be brought together under one Department. I do not know whether that is the intention or not.  I think I remember reading somewhere that the Minister said there was no intention to bring workmen's compensation under the administration of either of these Departments.  That means, therefore, that so far as that service is concerned &mdash;and everybody in the House knows that it is a service closely related to the health insurance services&mdash;it will still be administered by the Department of Industry and Commerce.  That certainly seems to me to be a lop-sided arrangement.</P>
    <P>Then, again, there is the statistics section of the Department of Industry and Commerce.  To the ordinary person it would seem obvious that a section of a Department which deals particularly with vital statistics should be administered by the Department of Public Health or the Department of Social Welfare rather than it continue <Col N="404" /> an offshoot of the Department of Industry and Commerce, as it is now. I do not want to cover all these grounds.  I am drawing attention to the fact that a number of questions which ought to arise on this Bill and which ought to be discussed&mdash;questions and services in regard to which members of this House have had experience &mdash;that an opportunity of expressing an opinion on them should be afforded to those Senators.  I do not think the Minister should resent these opinions being expressed.  I do not think it is in any way offensive to him that members of the House who have had experience of the administration of these services should tell the House and tell the Minister the conclusions which their experiences have forced upon them.  The conclusion forced upon me over very many years of close association with the administration of some of these services is that there was, in fact, such rivalry between Government Departments administering services which are normally interdependent, that it was utterly impossible to make headway in regard to any kind of improvement so far as administration was concerned or so far as giving service to the public was concerned.</P>
    <P>I do not want to hold up the House at this hour.  My attitude towards the Bill generally is that I am in favour of it, and I am in favour of the Minister getting the Second Reading to-night. I am also in favour of giving him the remaining stages of the Bill as rapidly as possible.  I do, however, want to urge on the House&mdash;I have done so on other occasions when this issue has arisen&mdash;that it has no right whatever to set up precedents by which members abrogate their functions when they give all stages of a Bill at the one sitting. When members do that the House is denied the opportunity of considering the Bill in the light of the explanations given on Second Reading. In my view there should be at least one week's interval between the Second Reading Stage and the Committee Stage of any Bill.</P>
    <P>I am not concerned when I am told that we cannot amend this Bill.  I believe that we can amend it.  Senator <Col N="405" /> Mrs. Concannon has already drawn attention to a proper point for amendment. I want to draw attention to the fact that, so far as this Bill is concerned, it proposes to establish two new Departments without telling us what is to happen to the existing Department of Local Government.  I assume that that Department will change its name unless it goes altogether.</P>
    <P>Frankly, I want to say that I am not enthusiastic about the establishment of two new Ministries if it means that, by doing so, we make an addition of two to the existing 11 Ministries maintained by this State.  Frankly, I do not look with enthusiasm upon the establishment of 13 Ministries for this State, because it is not merely that you are going to appoint 13 Ministers, but that you are going to appoint 13 permanent secretaries, 13 private secretaries to Ministers and 13 private secretaries to 13 secretaries of Departments. You will have, as well, a whole hierarchy of principal officers, assistant principal officers, higher executive officers, and so on.  All that will follow on the establishment of two additional Ministries.  We have no estimate, and as far as I know the Dáil had no estimate, of what the additional cost involved by the establishment of these two new Ministries is going to be.  I am going to hazard a rough guess, and it is that every time you establish a new Ministry in this country you incur an additional expenditure of £10,000 a year without increasing the personnel of the Civil Service, and without recruiting one new civil servant.  The rearrangement of Departments and the establishment of the new hierarchy of civil servants will add £10,000 a year to your administration.  That is what is involved.  I think the Minister might have addressed himself to that point, and told us that certain other Ministries will disappear when these two new Ministries are established.  I would be glad to hear him say that the Local Government Department, as such, would disappear.  I would be glad to hear him tell us that certain other Ministries would disappear because, in my opinion, there are at least two or three other Ministries for which no case can be made.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="406" /> I do not propose to hold up the House any longer.  My view is that there ought to be one week's interval between the Second Reading and the Committee Stage of a Bill.  I should point out, however, although I am a member of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, that I was unable to be present at yesterday's meeting.  Therefore, I was not a party to the agreement which was reached between all the members of the Committee.  While I am very strong in the belief that this House would be wise in honouring these agreements&mdash;they have worked well so far as my experience goes&mdash;I still would not raise any objection to the House meeting again next week if that suited the convenience of the members for the purpose of considering the remaining stages of this Bill.</P>

      <P>This is a most peculiar position in which the House finds itself at this hour of the night.  The House is not to be blamed for that.  I want to protest as strongly as I can against the position in which the Minister has placed the House.  I think that he has been quite unfair not only to members on this side who try to do the work of the House but to all those who support his own Party.</P>

      <P>I would suggest to the Senator that he should address himself to the question before the House which is that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  The other question that he is dealing with can be discussed when we come to fix the date for the next stage of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>Very well, we can discuss it then.  Unfortunately, the position that I find myself in is due to this, that the Minister discussed the question whether or not the Bill should be taken to-night.  He did not discuss the Bill at all.  I had not the opportunity which Senator Duffy had of reading the debates on the Bill in the other House.  The Minister, when speaking here to-night, gave the House no justification and no reasons at all as to why the Bill should be passed.  He did not tell us what he proposes these new Ministers are to do.  Instead, he warned us of all the tribulations that <Col N="407" /> we would have to face if we did not get the Bill through immediately.  Senator Hayes said that the Minister spoke like a bogey-man.  In fact, he made me feel as if the new microbes which the United Nations Organisation has been talking about are soon going to be released on us&mdash;that is if this Bill is not put through.</P>
      <P>Senator Duffy raised certain problems with regard to the Bill from his angle.  He is prepared to assent to the proposition that the Bill should be read a Second Time.  I may say that I am not influenced to the least extent by anything that other Senators have said on this matter.  I do want to say that I cannot pretend to have any enthusiasm for this Bill, apart altogether from the fact that the Minister and his colleagues in other days were of the opinion that this State had too many Ministers and also apart from the fact that as Senator Duffy has said we are going to, under this Bill, add to the number of Ministerial offices and to the whole hierarchy of Government.  What I greatly fear is that, in certain respects, administration may very well be hindered by this breaking up that we are going to witness through the operations of this Bill.  You are going to have at the centre in Dublin three different chiefs and three different Departments.  What I am thinking about is, what is the position in the country going to be so far as the local authorities are concerned?  What are to be the responsibilities of a county council and of a county manager?  I am anxious to know what the responsibility of the county manager and of the county council is going to be for what may be termed local government, and, in addition, for public health and social services as well?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When one local authority is supposed to play its part in the administration of all these three services, what will you come up against?  At a meeting of your county council you will have to deal with the three Departments. When you attend your meeting once a month what do you find?  You find something that could be settled by one Department passing a communication <Col N="408" /> across to another and it cannot be decided by the council, simply because you have sectionalised the whole administration of local government and public health.  You have got yourself into a position where the local people, when they meet in their local councils, have to deal with three sets of officials. They have to endeavour to settle all these problems, problems which apparently cannot be settled by a Government Department except by breaking it up.</P>
    <P>We will have considerable confusion arising out of this.  I do not know who will be responsible for the other kind of problem we had earlier to-day, with regard to our rating and expenditure. I do not know whether the Minister for Public Health will be the dominant Minister in regard to the expenditure of a particular local authority, or will we have three Departments, each separate and distinct, acting without cohesion or any knowledge about what they want to have done.  Consider the position presented to the local authority, which has to co-ordinate the activities of all these Departments in its local domain.  When we are in a situation like that, when public health services are making certain demands that the Minister for Local Government may turn down, where will the local authorities come in?</P>
    <P>There may be answers to all this, but I have not heard them.  We have not been vouchsafed by the Minister any sort of information or entertained to any kind of debate on the value of the measure such as one would expect. There is the fact that this Bill will definitely involve local people in considerable additional expenditure by the implementation of many, perhaps necessary but very grandiose, schemes. We may not be able to pay for them, but we will find imposed on us the obligation to pay for them.  Nobody in the country, or who represents the people of the country, can have any enthusiasm for this.  Nobody who is aware of the burdens that we have to bear in the matter of local taxation could be enthusiastic about this.</P>
    <P>The Minister wants to divest himself of responsibility and he wishes to pass these burdens on to other people. <Col N="409" /> I do not believe that what the new people who will begin their careers as Ministers will initiate could be so revolutionary that the Minister, through the existing Departments, could not put it forward.  I feel the Minister has been stressing unduly the importance of this measure to the country.  We will go on, to a certain extent we must go on for some considerable time, very much as we have been going.</P>
    <P>The Minister, when speaking to-night, did not say anything to convince me of the value of this measure. I would like to have had a much more frank and better informed debate upon it than the very brief outline of the proposals which the Minister gave.  So far as I am concerned, while I am prepared to permit the Second Reading to go through, I cannot pretend to have any enthusiasm for the measure.  I believe that not alone will we live to complain about the additions to Ministerial offices that we are now creating, but we probably will live to discover that the high hopes the Minister has in mind as to what will arise out of the passing of this measure will scarcely be justified.</P>

      <P>I confess that I find myself in exactly the same position as that occupied by Senator Baxter. Coming from a county that two years ago was responsible for the repayment of loans equivalent to almost the entire valuation of the county health district, I could not be expected to be enthusiastic about a measure&mdash;and the people I represent could not be enthusiastic about any Bill&mdash;that does not promise relief from the burdens placed upon the community there.  The rates in my county have sky-rocketed for the past ten or 15 years and the people look upon this Bill as an opportunity for the creation of two more Ministers for the purpose of having salaried positions with the usual staffs attached.  The people are not enthusiastic about it. I am not enthusiastic and I am afraid that if some relief is not given very soon to the people, this might well be the last straw that will break the camel's back.</P>

First of all, it is quite untrue to suggest, as Senator Hayes suggested, that the Minister confronted the House with this Bill at 11 p.m.  I am not responsible for the manner in which the House conducts its business.  There have been measures of considerably less importance than this discussed at length here to-day.  This Bill left Dáil Éireann on the 4th December with a majority of three to one in support of it.  The Standing Orders of the House require that only three days' notice shall be given of any measure which has been passed by Dáil Éireann and, after the third day, it goes on the Order Paper for the Seanad.  Whether the Seanad meets to consider that Bill as a matter of urgency or not is a matter entirely for the Seanad itself. If the House is now discussing this important measure at 11 p.m. that, I suggest, is due to the obstructive speeches which have been delivered in this House upon other measures and the purpose, of course, can clearly&mdash;&mdash;</P>

He told us that the Party in the other House with which he is affiliated has for several years been urging that these two Ministries should be set up, and to-night we have had an exposure <Col N="411" /> of the hypocrisy which has characterised the proceedings and the attitude of Senator Duffy and his Party in relation to these important problems.

      <P>The position created by the introduction of this Bill is quite different from what has prevailed during the past 25 years.  I have pointed out that at the moment we are living in an interregnum.  There is one Minister responsible for Local Government and Public Health and in that capacity he is responsible for all the health services in the country, and for the administration of home assistance, widows' and orphans' pensions and old age pensions.  Not only is he administering what might be described as local government proper, but he is also responsible for functions which elsewhere are entrusted to a Minister of Health and some functions which elsewhere are entrusted to a Minister of Roads and Transport.  I have also pointed out that the Minister for Industry and Commerce is responsible for the administration of unemployment assistance, unemployment insurance, and children's allowances and that the Minister for Finance is responsible to the Revenue Commissioners for the administration of old age pensions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position which has been created by the introduction of this Bill and its passage through Dáil Éireann is that there are, in relation to a number of public health measures, certain important decisions of principle to be taken which should only be taken by the Minister who will, ultimately, be responsible for presenting these measures to the Dáil.  I pointed out that there are comprehensive schemes of hospitalisation, that there are a number of important projects for the building of new hospitals, awaiting sanction by a Minister.  No Minister who feels that a colleague of his who may be appointed within two months from now, and who, if he, as the present Minister, takes certain decisions in relation to these proposals, <Col N="414" /> will be in fact transferring responsibility to another colleague for the decisions which he himself takes, is going in these circumstances to prejudice the free exercise by his successor of his own judgment and discretion in relation to these matters.  Therefore, I pointed out that, not only are important questions of policy being held up, but important administrative decisions affecting the construction of new hospitals and the implementation of new schemes of health reform are being held up.</P>

      <P>On a point of order. May I ask why the Minister is permitted to pursue a line of argument which was denied to me when I was speaking?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>All this leads up to the merits of the Bill.  The Bill is urgent and necessary so that these important decisions may be taken.  I also pointed out that, if the Bill is not given to us to-night in all its stages, which I am asking for, a great deal of financial inconvenience will result.  Senator Hayes knows as well as I do exactly what the position is. The introduction of Supplementary Estimates is at any time undesirable. It is often unavoidable, but it is almost generally in relation to matters of minor detail which have been overlooked when the original Estimate was being drafted.  It is quite a different matter to have to bring in a Supplementary Estimate to establish new Departments of State, and it would be an absurdity for the Seanad deliberately to adopt a course which would involve the introduction of a Supplementary Estimate for these two new Departments almost simultaneously with the presentation to Dáil Éireann of the general volume of Estimates.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator did not say very much about the Bill.  I am addressing myself to this point, at any rate, that, if the Seanad does not give all the stages of the Bill to-night, then <Col N="415" /> so far as I am concerned, they might as well defer the Second Reading for another occasion, because it will make no difference to the passage of the Bill.  The device of giving us the Second Reading and deferring all the other stages of the Bill until after Christmas is merely designed to deceive and mislead the public.</P>

      <P>This Bill was opposed by Senator Hayes' colleagues in Dáil Éireann.  I have pointed out that when the Vote on the Final Stage of the Bill was taken, it was passed by a majority of three to one but the obstruction which characterised the passage of the Bill through Dáil Éireann has been continued here this evening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">

      <P>It may be that some members of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges were unaware of the urgency for the Bill.  In order that there should be no person under any misapprehension here to-night, I took pains to explain why it was necessary that this Bill should go through here to-night.  Now the matter is in the hands of the Seanad.  It is in the hands of the majority of the Seanad and I hope the majority of the Seanad will ensure that if the House is not going to give me all stages to-night that at least the House will be summoned&mdash;no matter what personal inconvenience it may involve for some of the Senators &mdash;to meet next week, to deal with this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Seanad kindly agree to meet next week, in deference to the appeal the Minister has made as to the importance of the <Col N="416" /> Bill being passed before the Recess? Since my association with the House both sides of the House have been always very agreeable to meet with the wishes of the Ministers and I think it would be well to uphold that tradition.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>Notwithstanding the misrepresentations to which I have been subjected in regard to this Bill, I repeat what I said at the beginning, that I am willing that the House should meet next week, on any day convenient&mdash;Tuesday, Wednesday or Thursday.  If it is necessary to get the Bill through before the end of the year, I am agreeable that the House should meet to consider the Bill provided, however, that there is no proposal to vary the Orders already made in regard to other Bills.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no such proposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am against giving the Minister all stages of this Bill to-night and I am against giving the Minister all stages of this Bill next week.  If the Minister had had the good sense to stay out of the House and leave it to Senator Hawkins's technique, he might have got the Bill next week with everybody's consent but, first and foremost, the Minister has delivered himself of a highly disorderly speech in which he talked about the urgency of the Bill and, secondly, the Minister has a long record of absolute incompetency in his management of his own business in the other House, and that is the reason we are here, at this hour of the night, discussing when we are going to do this Bill.  The Minister is incompetent in this House, because he does not tell his own supporters what he wants them to do.  Surely he does not blame me when he did not tell Senator Hawkins or any other representative of his Party on the Committee on Procedure and Privileges what he wanted.  I agree entirely with Senator Hawkins that we have had an excellent spirit here but we have been here to-night compelled to listen to a Minister, in the guise of concluding a Second Reading debate, pouring out futile, abusive misrepresentation of better men than himself, both here <Col N="417" /> and elsewhere.  That is what it amounts to.  I take it I am entitled to speak after 12 o'clock on this particular business.  We are discussing, are we not, when we are going to meet again?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanGoulding" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>In a certain sense, yes, Senator.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>So I thought.  If the Minister had adopted the reasonable attitude that other Ministers adopt he might have got his Bill, but when the Minister adopts what I can only call the language of the corner boy, he cannot expect anybody to facilitate him.  He does not know the first thing about the procedure of the Dáil and knows very little, in spite of having been Minister for Finance, about Supplementary Estimates or what they mean in the Dáil.  He was absolutely wrong in what he said, that Supplementary Estimates in the Dáil are only used about small things.  Some of the most important debates in the Dáil have been on Supplementary Estimates, and if the Minister were not in his berserk rage about the position in the Dáil and Seanad, he would have remembered that.  But the Minister's bad language gets in the Minister's own light&mdash;if I am not mixing my metaphors.</P>
      <P>As far as I am concerned I think we should maintain our own original proposal from the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, which is, to meet on the 15th January.  If we do not do that, I suggest we meet on the 8th January but I object to the House yielding to this kind of threat.  When a Minister comes in at the last moment with a Bill which he knows is important and when he uses abusive and obstructive language which misrepresents the attitude of responsible members of this House and, indeed, of the other House, I think he should not be facilitated. His whole bogey-man performance about all the evils that are going to result from holding up this Bill for three weeks should deceive nobody, least of all, members of a House of Parliament.  It is because I object to that kind of tactics and to that kind of unreasonableness that I do not want to meet next week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="418" /> I resent entirely the Minister's statement that there is anything about the personal inconvenience of members of the Opposition.  That is utterly untrue, and the Minister knows it is untrue.  There are people here, on both sides of the House, who have done as much work in their own way as the Minister, and the Minister knows that too.  There is no consideration of personal inconvenience or personal convenience in this.  It is simply that the Minister wants to degrade this House, just as he has done a great deal to degrade the other House, from being a Parliamentary Assembly to being simply a registering machine for what he wants.  He threatens us to-night that, if we do not want to meet, the majority will meet.  We know he controls the majority.  We do not begrudge it to him.  But no House of Parliament, as Senator Hawkins implied, can work satisfactorily on the basis that you have majority votes about the Order of Business.  If that is going to be the procedure here, that you are going to decide the Order of Business and the dates of meetings always by a majority vote, you will be a long time here, Sir, and you will get very few things done.</P>
    <P>It is a great pity that we could not have had some kind of calm discussion about this business and could not have adopted the suggestion that was made originally but, as far as I am concerned, I am against meeting next week.  I am in favour of adjourning and then considering this matter after Christmas, in the proper way, as was decided.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>Despite the heated argument that has taken place, the Minister has put a case that he wants the Bill and I do not think Senators can put forward any reasonable case why we should not meet next week and give the Minister the Bill, because that gives a chance of putting down amendments. I would appeal to the members to agree to meet some day next week. I do not think it would be a great sacrifice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>I hold to the point of view expressed by Senator Hayes, for this reason, that the business of this House can only be done reasonably efficiently on the basis that all sides of the House understand each other and on the basis that if we come to an honourable agreement it will be kept, whatever the consequences may be.  You can break an agreement once but, if you do, you will not find the other side as accommodating the next time.  This House is concerned with <Col N="420" /> something more than merely what one Minister puts before it. We have had three or four Bills from another Minister and the House knows the spirit and the atmosphere in which these matters were discussed.  That Minister did say that he wanted all the stages of certain Bills but when it was pointed out to him that it was not reasonable to expect that, he was prepared to assent to their adjournment. There was no evidence whatever that this was going to be sprung on the House when the Committee on Procedure and Privileges met and unless all the members of that Committee are able to honour their bond, one to the other, the business of this House, whatever Minister is in charge, will not be done anything like as efficiently as it would be if a proper spirit prevailed. Who is responsible for that? The Minister has come in here to-night and he has created an atmosphere that has been foreign to this House for the last two days.  He is raising neither the status of this House nor his own status in the estimation of the public.</P>
      <P>Question put and declared carried.</P>
      <P>The Seanad adjourned at 12.3 a.m. until Wednesday, December 18th, 1946, at 3 p.m.</P>
