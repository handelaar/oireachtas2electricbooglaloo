      <P>I think that the position in regard to this amendment last night was that the Minister had exhibited a certain careful reluctance to accept it.  The Minister made a statement which I did not quite follow, and I should be grateful if he would expand it.  He said that he was fairly convinced that owners of those highly-valued houses had offset the possibility of control in the rents which they were receiving.  I do not know whether the suggestion is that, between 1939, when the war broke out, and 1941, everybody who could had increased his rent because of the possibility of having rents stabilised at some future date.  If that is the Minister's assertion, then I say, with great respect, that such knowledge as I have does not correspond with it.  I think that between 1939 and 1941 there were no substantial increases whatsoever in the rents of those uncontrolled houses. Nobody increased his rent so as to get in what I may call a &ldquo;quick one&rdquo; on the Minister, in anticipation of control. <Col N="280" /> Although we have had rent restriction in one form or another from 1915 onwards, this is, I believe, the first occasion in which the restricting measure made no provision whatsoever to recoup landlords for the undoubted rise in prices and increased expenditure. In the earlier Acts the increase varied according to a percentage&mdash;10 per cent. or 20 per cent.  In every case some allowance was made to the landlord for the fact that his rent was being taken out of the economic field.  I agree that these houses should be controlled if there is any danger of profiteering.  But I see no reason why, if you stop profiteering by bringing them within the Act, the landlords should not be allowed an increase in the rent.  In that class of houses, the tenants, on the whole, are richer than the landlords, as I showed yesterday. The Minister has not answered the question why, in this Act, in the case of the large houses, as opposed to that of the smaller houses, there is no provision for a penny increase in the rent to the landlord.  The whole burden of increased expenditure is thrown upon him.  It is not divided between him and the tenant.</P>

      <P>When I spoke on this amendment yesterday, I was not clear that small houses&mdash;houses occupied by wage-earning and low-salaried persons&mdash;were included in the non-1923 group.  I quite see the Minister's point, that it might not be fair to grant an increase of rent in respect of the smaller houses.  Can the Minister differentiate between the valuation groups of those non-1923 houses?  It would be reasonable, especially after what my friend, Senator Kingsmill Moore, has said to ask that a small increase&mdash;say 10 per cent.&mdash;should be allowed in the case of those houses of £40 to £60 valuation.  That ought not to be administratively difficult and it would be merely justice to differentiate to that extent.  I appreciate the Minister's difficulty.  The Minister says he must try to make these measures as simple as possible.  I am afraid he has leaned to that point of view rather than to the necessity for holding the scales evenly and effecting justice as between the different classes involved. <Col N="281" /> I know that there is a great temptation to do what is called rough justice, to take the rough with the smooth, and to say that we cannot have regard to the niceties.  The point I am making is much more than a nicety.  I do not know why it was necessary to bring in those high-valuation groups at all. I do not think that the Minister told us that.  There are a number of smaller houses in the non-1923 group but what the necessity is for bringing in the highly valued houses I do not know.  The Minister should recognise that there is a great deal in Senator Kingsmill Moore's argument that the landlord in many of these cases is poorer than the tenant.  In the case of houses from £40 to £60 valuation, the tenants could well afford to pay a slightly increased rent, bearing in mind that there has been no allowance whatever for repairs in respect of this group.  The Minister said the other day that repairs had already been discounted in the rent charged.  But some of those rents have not been changed for years. In the case of those higher valuations, the rents, in many instances, had never been put up.  Between the wars, they remained at the same figure.  I do not think that an examination would support the Minister's statement, that the rents had been revised in those higher groups so as to take account of the increased cost of repairs, especially as the increase in the cost of repairs had not come about until after 1940.</P>
      <P>There is one other point which I should like to make.  I do not know whether or not I am in order in doing so now.  The matter to which I wish to refer does not seem to come under any section.  I want to make a plea to the Minister to consider the question of vacancies in regard to those houses of higher valuation and to allow some mitigation of the hardship which the owners are suffering.  When vacancies arise, the landlord should be allowed to take advantage of market conditions or he should be allowed a stated increase of rent.  That might lead to complications but, when you begin to control, you cannot avoid complications if you want to do justice to all parties.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>The figure of £60 valuation was an arbitrary figure but, in fixing it, we were following the 1923 Act.  Under that Act, the figure in Dublin was £60 and, elsewhere, £40.  It may be somewhat on the high side.  When the last Government commenced to decontrol, they decontrolled the £60 house and went on each year until they got to the £30 house.  They stopped there because they found that the rents were being raised in the case of houses which had been decontrolled.  I thought that I dealt clearly last night with the reason why there was not an allowance for repairs in the case of the non-1923 controlled houses.  Competition was very keen for houses in the 1941 class and very stiff rents were being charged. Everybody who sought to rent a house which was not controlled is aware that a stiff rent was charged.  Before the Emergency Powers Order was brought in, which allowed nothing for repairs in those cases, we went carefully into the question and we were satisfied that the rents were of such an order as not to justify the 20 per cent. increase allowed in the 1914 cases.  In 1914, houses were let at rather low rents and it was the ordinary practice to rent houses.  Since then, there has been a great deal of selling of houses.  A number of landlords were, undoubtedly, charging competitive rents in 1914 and there was a case for giving them the increase of 20 per cent. and something for repairs.  As I said last evening, this is a temporary Act.  If it is to be prolonged, it will be necessary to review the whole position.  Then, I am sure, the question of repairs will be considered. At the moment, I do not think that any great case can be made for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not suggest that anything extraordinary happened between 1939 and 1941.  There may have been increases.  I am speaking of the whole of the non-controlled houses. There was keen competition for houses to rent and high rents were charged.  We would not have been justified in allowing a 10 per cent. or 15 per cent. increase of rent, especially in a period in which the Government was trying to stabilise wages and <Col N="283" /> profits of all kinds.  Senator O'Reilly said that the cost of living had gone up.  It has gone up on the persons referred to by Senator Kingsmill Moore as well as on others.  The income of judges and senior counsel is not buying as much as it did before the war.  The persons living in those highly-valued houses have to pay the rent they were paying in 1941 and they have to pay more for necessaries, just as the owners of the houses have. Without a means test, how would you find out whether a landlord was a poor man or a wealthy man?  In doing as has been suggested, you might be imposing hardship on a class of persons who have been affected by the present stringent conditions.  When matters get easier, this question can be reviewed.  At the present juncture, I am not prepared to make any allowance for repairs in respect of that type of house.</P>

      <P>I am sure that the Minister did not deliberately wish to give us a distorted picture, but he did suggest that the bulk of those non-1923 houses were the subject of fresh lettings.  Has he examined that?  If he does, I am sure he will find that a very large majority of those houses are let at rents which have never been disturbed. Considerable hardship is involved.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 26:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="284" /> Before Section 15 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(1)  If on an application to the court under this section by the landlord of premises to which Section 14 of this Act applies, the court is satisfied that:</P>
    <P>(a)  the landlord was on the operative date or has come, since the operative date, into possession of the whole of such premises, and</P>
    <P>(b)  on the 7th day of May, 1941, the occupying tenant of the premises was relation of the landlord, and</P>
    <P>(c)  the rent payable by such occupying tenant was less than the rent the landlord might reasonably have expected in the year ending on 7th May, 1941, under any given contract of tenancy not being for more than a term of five years</P>
    <P>the basic rent of the premises shall, notwithstanding the provisions of Section 14 hereof, be determined by the court in accordance with the provisions of Section 16 hereof.</P>
    <P>(2)  For the purposes of this section the word &ldquo;relation&rdquo; means any lineal ascendant or lineal descendant, or brother or sister of the landlord or of the wife or husband (as the case may be) of the landlord.</P>
    <P>Senator Kingsmill Moore has a similar amendment, though mine is narrower than his.  It might save time if the two amendments were taken together.</P>

      <P>Is it agreed that amendments Nos. 26 and 29 be taken together?</P>
      <P>Agreed.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 29 was as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before Section 17 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>17.&mdash;(1)  Where either the landlord or the tenant of premises, the basic rent of which is ascertainable under Section 14, is of opinion that the rent so ascertained is less or more than that which the immediate landlord of an occupying tenant might in the year ending May 7th, 1941, reasonably have expected under any given contract of tenancy not being <Col N="285" /> for more than a term of five years the landlord or tenant of such premises may apply to the court to fix the rent of such premises under Section 16.</P>
    <P>(2)  On any application under the foregoing sub-section the court shall not award any costs to an applicant unless the rent so fixed by the court exceeds or is less than (as the case may be) the rent fixed under Section 14 by more than 10 per cent. of such rent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The point in this amendment is rather a small one.  I know of specific cases where a man who owned a house on May 7th, 1941, had let it to a near relative.  There are two such cases in my mind.  In one of them the house was let to a man's daughter and his son-in-law, and in the other, it was let to his sister.  In neither case was a competitive rent being charged because of the special relationship. Doubtless, there are not very many of these cases, but there are some and I suggest to the Minister that in such cases where the rent charged is not obviously competitive, and where the particular class of person who is in those houses leaves the houses, then the new basic rent should be fixed by the court by reference to what would have been the competitive rent in 1941, instead of being fixed at a specific rent at which it was let for the special reasons I have instanced.</P>
      <P>There are a few cases of that kind in Dublin.  Not only have I come across them myself but other solicitors have come across them and the effect of my amendment is that a basic rent will be fixed by the court under the second section instead of under the first.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TheodoreMoore" hpid="Mr. Kingsmill Moore Mr. Kingsmill Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kingsmill Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>My suggested section covers Senator Sweetman's point but is a little bit wider in its scope.  It is meant to cover the cases where the 1941 rent was either too high or too low by reason of abnormal conditions. The Minister has assumed that all rents at that date were fixed by the inter-play of ordinary economic forces, but a moment's reflection will show that while that may cover 90 per cent. of the cases, there are bound to be a number of exceptional ones.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="286" /> Let us take the case of a representative of a foreign country who expects to be here only for a short time.  He takes a fancy to a house, and just because of that he pays twice the normal rent for it.  The result of that is that the rent paid by a foreign diplomat becomes the basic rent when he is transferred to another country.  That is an example of where the rent would be too high.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, there are cases such as Senator Sweetman has mentioned where houses were let at low rent to relatives or old friends of the family who were in possession and who could not be disturbed. I know a small terrace of houses where it was the policy of the landlord never to raise the rent on an old tenant, with the result that in 1939 the rents were the same as 1904.  In some cases indeed the landlord made slight reductions because some of his old tenants had fallen on bad fortune.</P>
    <P>It is all very well to suggest, as we often hear it suggested, that the landlord is trying only to get the last penny out of his tenants, but many landlords dislike intensely the idea of raising the rent on an old tenant.  In such cases, needless to say, the tenants tend to become older and older and do not leave.  Very often too, as the result of an <i>ad misericordiam</i> appeal, the landlord reduces the rent&mdash;he may take off £5 a year because the tenant has retired from his old job and is not so well off.</P>
    <P>I am not inventing any of these examples.  I can give the Minister the names and places, and I mention them only because it may be found that in 1941 the rents concerned were either considerably too high or too low.  It is not right that, where those conditions prevail, the fortuitous rents prevailing at that date should be stereotyped for five years and, accordingly, I respectfully recommend to the Minister my proposed new section.  In other words, if either tenant or landlord think the rent is wrong, they have the option to have it fixed under Section 14 by going to the court and asking the court to fix it as a fair rent for a short-term letting.</P>
    <P>In case anyone should think that <Col N="287" /> that would give rise to a whole flock of applications in the court, it occurred to me that it might be necessary to discourage applications made through excessive optimism and, therefore, I provided in the sub-section which follows that unless the court raised or lowered the rent by less than 10 per cent. there will be no costs. This would mean that, unless there was a very substantial increase or decrease, the successful applicant would get no costs.  That is a check proposed to prevent cases by persons who are merely, if I might use the phrase, chancing their arm.</P>
    <P>They can go to the court, and if they show there has been substantial miscarriage of justice in having the rent automatically fixed at the 1941 standard, then they can get the costs of the application.  Otherwise, even though they may get a slight increase or decrease, they would have to abide their own costs.</P>
    <P>In theory, I cannot see any objection to this section.  Nobody can suggest that in every case the rent was fixed on purely economic grounds.  Nobody can contend where it was not fixed on economic grounds that it should be stereotyped on those uneconomic grounds.  Obviously everyone should have a fair opportunity to bring the case before the court and allow the court to form its own view.  The restraining provision in regard to costs would prevent people from bringing cases where the difference might be merely trifling.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment proposed by Senators Sweetman and Kingsmill Moore.  I do not know which of the two is the better amendment, but it seems to me that Senator Kingsmill Moore's is the wider of the two.  I can cite a case which concerns myself.  I own a house which is set to a close relative&mdash;my own brother, in fact&mdash;at a rent of £35 a year.  That same place is sublet at a rent of £140.  That is a definite case where if the rent was taken on the relevant date it would be a serious matter for me in the event of my wishing to set that house.  The house was <Col N="288" /> given entirely on account of family associations, and I am sure there are many such cases.  I think the amendment is fair and just in every sense of the word and I urge the Minister to accept it.  It would not inflict an injustice on anybody except on the owner of the house who, because of family affections, set his house to relatives at a lower rate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept what Senator Kingsmill Moore has stated, that there are many people who own houses who do not try to get the last penny from tenants but, speaking generally, I think it will be admitted that the rents that were charged on non-controlled houses were the highest rents that the landlords could get.  However, there does appear to be a case for consideration in regard to the examples mentioned by the Senator and I shall look into the matter to ascertain if there are any cases in which the rents might be too high or too low.  I am naturally reluctant to destroy the certainty we have already provided for in the Bill, but that cannot be helped.  I shall see what can be done in relation to this matter before the Report Stage in regard to these two points.</P>

      <P>I am not moving it in this sense: The Minister has already undertaken to consider the matter, but I want to make one remark on it.  Since the Minister suggested that he would look into it, I have given some further thought to it and consulted with other people informally as to what would be the best method of fixing the rent for these flats.  There are a lot of small matters into which I do not propose for a moment to go now, but I do urge on the Minister again that if he wants to start on the basis which has already taken into <Col N="289" /> account the elements referred to by Senator Sweetman&mdash;that is to say, the difficulty of getting payment, the cost of repairs, the difficulty of getting people out and all the various elements that flat owners have to deal with which render these lettings rather different from those of ordinary houses&mdash;that he can start with a basis which has already taken these matters into accounts, if he takes the national economic rent of 1941, that is to say, the notional economic flat rent of 1941, because if you can find out what such-and-such a flat would have been expected to let for in 1941 you have already a basis which has reference to the peculiarity of flats.  There has to be added to that the extra cost of construction, and, I would think, one or two other elements, sufficient to ensure that there is a good solid inducement to people to create these flats.  Since I was last talking, in an issue of the <i>London Times</i> there appeared an article pointing out the necessity of changing big London houses into flats and emphasising the point which I had made in the earlier debate.  This is a universal problem, and I do think you will have probably to provide some little extra bonus or inducement over and above the rent which would have been arrived at in the way I suggested, in order to ensure that the flow of flats will go on.</P>

      <P>In sub-section (2), page 11, line 39, after the word &ldquo;rent&rdquo; to insert the words &ldquo;not exceeding the existing rent&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a very simple proposal, and it is not new so far as the construction of the Bill is concerned.  This section deals with the considerable number of houses which would come under the provisions of the Act if they were not covered by Section 14 and the effective provision is sub-section (2), which says that the basic rent of premises to which this section applies shall be determined by the court.  The court is perfectly free, having regard to certain directives in the section, to determine the rent.  I simply want to get inserted <Col N="290" /> in the sub-section this positive directive, that the court shall not increase the rent.  That is the net effect of amendment No. 28: that in fixing a rent it should be indicated to the court that the new rent fixed on an application under Section 16 shall not exceed the existing rent.  This idea is already contained, in relation to another set of houses, in Section 29.  I should like to refer the House to sub-section (1) of Section 29, paragraph (d), which says that when an application comes before the court, in case it appear to the justice that the lawful rent of the premises, if determined by a provisional order, would equal or exceed the existing rent, he shall dismiss the application.  So that where an application comes before a district justice in respect of small premises to which Section 28 of the Bill applies, there is no option.  If the justice cannot reduce the rent, there is no option but to dismiss the application.  In other words, he cannot make an order increasing the existing rent.  I simply want to apply that further.  I want to apply it in respect of houses to which Section 16 applies, because it is the one group of houses in respect to which there is no yard-stick provided by which the court can determine what is a fair rent.  I am quite certain the Minister will see the reasonableness of that proposal, and that it is certainly not his intention that the court should in fact make an order increasing the rent.  I think he will agree that in that case there should be this direction in the section to the court, that it shall not make an order increasing the existing rent.</P>

      <P>I think that the basis laid down for fixing rents in Section 16 is fair enough.  The landlord is not allowed to increase the rent beyond a certain figure.  If the tenant applies to the court of if the landlord applies and is able to show that he is not getting what he would be entitled to do on the basis laid down, I think he is entitled to get an increase.  The other type of case deals with a different category of persons altogether.  Chapter XIII cases are those of poor people who live in slums.  They were the people that were under that particular <Col N="291" /> chapter, where they got cheap law, and all the rest of it.  In the case of the ordinary tenant in a house subject to Chapter II, I do not see what grievance he will have if he is required to pay only on the basis laid down in the section.  I do not think it would be fair at all if he could get a reduction. I am not prepared to accept the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is aware that he has already provided in Section 20 procedure by which the landlord can arrange the rent.  There is machinery in this measure for securing that an increase can be obtained in certain circumstances.  That is set out in great detail in Section 20.  I am dealing with a case in which a person applies to the court to fix the rent in respect of premises for which there is no firm method to guide the court in relation to what the fair rent should be.  The court shall simply satisfy itself that the immediate landlord of an occupying tenant might in the year ending 7th May, 1941, reasonably expect a certain rent.  The court is not obliged to have regard to the rents payable in respect of similar houses in a similar neighbourhood.  The court is not restricted in any way in determining on such an application what the rent should be.  It will satisfy itself as to what the landlord might reasonably expect to get for that house in the year ending 7th May, 1941.  It does not matter that the case of a similar house let on 7th May, 1941, for £100 is put in evidence.  The court is still free to say that the landlord might reasonably expect £150 for this particular house, the subject of the application, if he were renting it at that date, and may fix the rent at £150, although at the date of application the tenant is paying £100.  It may be said that of course the court will use discretion; that the court will exercise its functions in an intelligent manner and in a judicial manner.  I am not challenging that, but what I am suggesting is that a judge in a court is still an ordinary man like any of the rest of us. He will have prejudices.  He may think, as Senator Sir John Keane would think or as Senator O'Reilly would think, <Col N="292" /> that the landlord could never get enough.</P>

      <P>I am not accusing the Senator of saying it, but a judge might say it, and still be held to be acting reasonably.  He might also take the other view, that the landlord is the enemy of society and should get nothing.  I am merely pointing to the fact that the gentleman who occupies the judicial bench is still a human being, and if there is no code by which his conduct is to be governed then he will act as he thinks right, and what he thinks right will be conditioned by his environment, his antecedents and so on.  That is the reason why we take great trouble, in debating Bills in Parliament, to make sure that there are certain stated rules to guide the court.  We endeavour to ensure that the court will not be free to decide what it likes, but must decide according to the set of rules in which we prescribe what is the right thing to do. I am endeavouring to get a rule inserted into the sub-section which will direct the court that in no circumstances, on an application of this kind, shall the court make an order increasing the rent.  I would suggest that that is not an unreasonable proposition, and that if the Minister and the House refuse to accept it we will have amending legislation coming up within the next 12 or 18 months, when there will be many cases before you of most extraordinary decisions on applications under Section 16.</P>

      <P>Senator Duffy uses the analogy or the supposed analogy between the case he is making and conditions under Section 29, sub-section (1) (d), but the fact is that under Section 29 (1) it is provided that <Col N="293" />&ldquo;in case it appears to him that the lawful rent of the premises, if determined by a provisional order, would equal or exceed the existing rent, he shall dismiss the application.  There then is where the humanity of the court is provided for.  If the tenant foolishly puts in an application which might result in an increase being given rather than a decrease, it is provided in that particular case there will be no increase, and in fact that the application will be dismissed.  There is, therefore, no analogy between the two cases.  It is actually to protect the tenant that Section 29 (1) (d) is provided.</P>

      <P>There is an aspect of this matter which may not have occurred to Senator Duffy.  If we were to put such a provision as that in this Bill, the tendency then would be for landlords to charge the stiffest rents they could possibly get, so there would be no question of their getting arrears.  If the case did go to court, the landlord would get at least what the house would have fetched if it had been let on 7th May, 1941.  What I am saying now is that the tendency would be towards stiffer rents, and then if the tenant felt a grievance let him go to the court.  All he would get then would be the fair rent.  I am not accepting the amendment, but I am pointing out to the Senator that that danger would be there.  There would be an inducement to the landlord to look for the highest rent that he was satisfied that he could legally get on the 1941 basis.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 33:&mdash;</P>
      <P>At the end of sub-section (2), page 12, to add a new paragraph as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(e) (i) in case the landlord is responsible for the whole of the repairs to the premises, an amount not exceeding 1/12th of the basic rent;</P>
      <P>(ii)  in case the landlord is responsible for part only of the repairs, such lesser amount as may be agreed on between the landlord and the tenant or as may on the application of either of the said parties be determined by the court or in the absence of any such agreement or determination an amount not exceeding 1/24th part of the basic rent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Although this particular matter was not discussed last night, I made some remarks referring to it.  I shall not repeat what I said last night.  However, there is another aspect of this question which I should like to press on the Minister, and it is this: If the owners of these big houses are not going to get anything for the repairs they carry out, then, human nature being what it is, they will hang on with a lick and a scratch here and there, and will not carry out proper <Col N="295" /> repairs, and that is not good for either the tenant or the landlord.  I suggest, therefore, that if the Minister and his Department, or the tenants concerned, want to have these repairs carried out, there will have to be some kind of inducement to the landlord to get them carried out.  It has been suggested that if you give a kind of automatic allowance to the landlord for repairs, he may pocket it and not carry out the repairs.  Therefore, I suggest that the Minister should accept an amendment, something on the lines of sub-section (3) (iii) of Section 8 of the 1923 Act, which provided that where the landlord had expended an amount exceeding one-third of the standard rent in one year, or, during the period of the two years concerned, should have expended an amount exceeding two-thirds of the standard rent, on putting the dwelling-house into a reasonable state of repair, he should be then given an amount not exceeding 15 per cent. of such excess or excesses of expenditure.  The reason why the percentage was made so large was because it was given on the excess over a large fraction of the standard rent.  I would suggest to the Minister strongly that, if he does not accept this amendment in its present form, he should bring in some such amendment on the Report Stage to the effect that if in one or two years there should be an amount expended on repairs exceeding a portion of the basic rent, the person concerned should be allowed to add on a sum representing 15 per cent. of the cost of repairs.  I believe that that should be done.</P>

      <P>I should like to make a few remarks, Sir, on this section. The section says that the expression &ldquo;the critical date&rdquo; means, in the case of premises to which Section 14 of this Act applies, the operative date&mdash;the date on which the Bill shall become <Col N="296" /> law&mdash;and then the section goes on to say, in paragraph (d) that if the landlord, on or after the relevant date, and before the critical date, expends any amount on decoration or repairs on the improvement or structural alteration of the premises, a certain sum should be given.  That is in paragraph (d).  I do not see why the words &ldquo;on or after the critical date&rdquo; should be mentioned there, because, if the landlord had paid the money before that, I do not know why he should not be entitled to it.</P>

It does seem rather strange that, whereas, under the old Act, vacancies were allowed to be decontrolled no vacancies can be de-controlled now.  The Minister has shown a very open mind in regard to the various amendments proposed, but would he allow vacancies to be decontrolled in the present circumstances?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not be prepared to do that under the present circumstances. We must have some kind of control because, generally speaking, everybody wants to get what they can get.  So, I am afraid that we could not do anything about that at the moment, but after a while we shall try to de-control such houses.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>There is another aspect of this which I think might be pursued, and that is that when a house becomes vacant, the owner, who is prohibited <Col N="297" /> from getting an exorbitant rent, may attempt to sell the premises&mdash;the idea being that he will sell it at an inflated price.  I was told recently of a case of a house which was bought in 1939 for about £800 and was sold the other day for something like £4,500.  I suggest that if the idea here is to protect the public interest, the Minister should step in and control the selling price of such premises.  Senator Sir John Keane is thinking of an individual who got a monopoly, and who will exploit it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>

I am arguing that the purpose of this Bill, particularly Section 17, is to protect the public.  I am arguing also that Senator Sir John Keane's proposal amounts to this, that a person should have a free hand to exploit property, no matter how the public interest is prejudiced.  I throw out the suggestion, that if the Minister is swayed by such a claim, what he ought to do is, not what Senator Sir John Keane proposes, but to take additional powers, perhaps in another Act, to restrict the price at which houses could be sold. That would prevent houses for letting being withdrawn.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a small concession that I ask, and I hope the Minister can see his way to grant it.  In the case of a big estate 14 days or 28 days might not be a serious matter, but there are many cases where widows and poorer classes of landlords, if unable to reply, might have to suffer a penalty of so many pounds.  The suggestion is that <Col N="298" /> the time for reply should be extended from 14 to 28 days, and in the event of non-compliance, that the fine should be reduced from £10 to £5.  I suggest that what is proposed in the amendment will not inflict any hardship on anybody, whereas if the section is allowed to stand, it might inflict considerable hardship on large numbers, particularly on the poorer class of house owners.  Incidentally, I think it would be a great blessing if we could agree to omit the term &ldquo;landlord&rdquo;.  In view of its connotation in our national history the use of this term causes a certain amount of resentment, and tends to prejudice our judgment with respect to legislation affecting the interest of owners of property.</P>

      <P>Before Section 20 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  There shall be implied in every contract for the sale of controlled premises (if not already expressly included) a provision binding the vendor to give to the purchaser any information in the vendor's possession or procurement requisite to enable the purchaser to determine the basic rent of the premises being sold or any part thereof.</P>

      <P>I want to ensure that the same provision applies here as in the case of registered land.  The section is taken exactly from Section 15 of the Registration of Title Act, 1942, which the Minister piloted through the House. There is a provision there that, on the sale of registered land, the vendor must supply to the purchaser any information in his procurement which affects registered land under Section 47 of the Local Registration of Title Act, 1891, or Section 16 of the 1942 Act, without appearing on the folio.

      <P>The way it appears to me is this: when we come to deal with large houses to which this Bill applies we find the position that if the poor law valuation of a premises is, let us say, £27 or £30, Section 22 applies in <Col N="301" /> relation to repair, but if the valuation happens to be £31, it does not apply. These houses of the higher valuation are all old houses.  Many of the houses which are dealt with under this Bill are probably 200 years old.  Some are in excellent condition; others are obviously neglected, and in many cases are becoming slums.</P>
      <P>Many members of this House who know Dublin are well aware that, even in our time, some of the fine old Dublin houses have become slums through the neglect of their owners. That is true in places like North Great George's Street, shall we say, and it is becoming so in other areas where there are houses of some of the best workmanship in Ireland falling into decay. I think it is a mistake to make a distinction between the 1923 Act houses and the non-1923 Act houses, and when the Minister drafted the section himself, that distinction was not made. Neither was it made when he presented the Bill to Dáil Éireann for Second Reading.</P>
      <P>The reservation was introduced on the Committee Stage or the Report Stage, and I fail to see any grounds for it.  Certainly there was nothing said when the amendment was being brought in that would satisfy any reasonable person that there were substantial grounds for it.  What we are dealing with here is not merely houses built or flats reconstructed during the last 27 or 28 years, but, as I have said, the older houses of the higher valuation. I would suggest to this House that it is a great mistake to accept this condition and what Senator Sweetman proposes is that we should revert to the position which obtained when this Bill secured a Second Reading in the Dáil.</P>

      <P>The reason this is confined to 1923 cases is that there is a definite and specific allowance for repairs to 1923 controlled houses.  It is specifically and definitely mentioned that an allowance is made in the 1923 Act cases to enable additions to be made to the rent for repairs.  If they have not done anything, and if the place has got so bad that it is in rack and ruin, there is no justification for giving this addition permitted for the <Col N="302" /> purpose of repairs.  In other cases, if a house gets into a bad state such as mentioned here, there are other remedies open to the tenants, but to say that we are taking something from the rent which does not specifically give something for repairs, I do not think we would be justified.  That is why I excluded the 1923 controlled houses, and quite justifiably I think.</P>

      <P>In sub-section (2), lines 2 and 3, page 15, to delete the words &ldquo;by the production of a certificate of the sanitary authority or other evidence.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This amendment and amendment No. 40 hang together.  The Minister has drawn this section on the lines that the certificate of the sanitary authority is absolutely conclusive, in the court, and the court cannot in any way question that certificate.  I suggest, therefore, the deletion of the words in the second sub-section and the insertion of a new sub-section which will mean the production of a certificate will be prima facie evidence and the owner of the house will have an opportunity of showing that there is something wrong with the certificate and that it was produced by mistake or something like that.  The section as it stands would mean that a sanitary authority was in fact the final decider and I do not think the Minister can do anything like that.</P>

      <P>Speaking on this, I lay myself open, of course, to the charge of being an owner of slum property, but I do own a class of property <Col N="303" /> and I have experience of it in small towns.  The houses, undoubtedly, are not up to the latest standard of housing, and I see the possibility of a sanitary inspector coming straight from flush, with a lot of technical knowledge from some college, and with a hotheaded enthusiasm, saying that these houses are quite unfit to live in.</P>
      <P>They are not that, but they are not, undoubtedly, good houses.  The tenants pay about 2/6 weekly rent, and without going into any personal element, I can say that the landlords of such houses are really maintaining them largely out of charity.  I can prove to anyone who wishes to look into it but there is no surplus rent whatever on these class of houses when you carry out repairs. I do not want to stand over houses of this type that are not water tight and without adequate flooring and reasonable amenities, but in many cases the windows of these houses are very small and the light is not what you would expect to find in new houses.</P>
      <P>I can see the sanitary authority coming along and saying that it is quite inadequate and that new windows must be put in if the rent is to be maintained.  Those windows are 50 to 100 years old, and if some sanitary officer says to me that I must replace them, I can tell him he can have the whole house if he wants it, that I will simply give it up because it is worth nothing to me.  I am keeping it only because it is traditional to have some accommodation for those people who can only pay a low rent. If that happens the whole thing will be abandoned and these houses will be a constant source of expense to keep up.  That is the effect of this proposal if you do not allow the general condition of that class of property to be taken into account.  I am not standing over houses in disrepair, but I am asking that these smaller houses should be taken into consideration and that the standards of modern houses should not be applied to them.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 39:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (2), page 15, line 11, after the word &ldquo;rent&rdquo; to insert the words &ldquo;where in respect of such premises the lawful rent has been determined and in any other case not exceeding 20 per cent. of the existing rent&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This sub-section enables the court, on an application being considered, to order that the rent to be paid for the premises to which the application relates will be reduced by such an amount not exceeding 20 per cent. of the lawful rent as the court thinks proper.  It does occur to me that <Col N="305" /> there may be cases to which this sub-section applies in which the lawful rent has not been determined.  I am not so sure &mdash; the Minister will probably correct me if I am wrong&mdash;that it is not conceivable that cases would come before the court in which sub-section (2) may not apply, bearing in mind that, as the section stands, it applies to controlled 1923 Act houses. That means to say that it will bring in a number of houses constructed before the 4th of August, 1914, which were not subject to control during the past 20 years, that is to say, houses the valuation of which exceeds £30 in Dublin and exceeds £25 outside Dublin.  These houses are going to be brought in now.  The question is whether a case can come before the court under sub-section (2) where the lawful rent has not been determined, and what I am endeavouring to secure is that, where the lawful rent has not been determined, then the penalty shall be 20 per cent. of the existing rent, whatever that may be.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that this is necessary.  If such a thing as the Senator has mentioned could happen, the court has power under Section 55 to fix the lawful rent before deciding what the reduction will be.  The last clause in Section 55 gives it that power. It is most unlikely that such a question will arise but if it does arise sub-section (5) of Section 55 says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;In addition to the powers specifically conferred on the court by this Act, the court may deal with any matter arising under this Act whether a dispute has or has not arisen in relation to that matter.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I should like the Minister to reflect a little bit.  He happens to be Minister for Justice and he is in a better position to reflect on what the court would do in a case of this kind. A positive penalty is provided in this section in respect of certain premises. Let us assume, if I may do so without being disrespectful, that Senator Sir John Keane were defendant in an <Col N="306" /> action under Section 22.  He would not hesitate to brief the most expensive and most eloquent counsel at the Irish Bar, to go into court and argue that, in its wisdom, the Oireachtas provided a penalty in respect of a house for which the lawful rent had been fixed and also in its wisdom refrained from providing any penalty where the lawful rent had not been fixed.  I submit to the Minister that this is a case in which the court would be inclined to say that Section 55 does not apply.  It has a different application altogether and the court would accept the eloquent appeal of Senator Kingsmill Moore that this was a wise House in making a distinction between two classes of houses, one in which the lawful rent was fixed and one in which it was not fixed.  I ask the Minister not to brush aside this point as easily as he appears to have done.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This to my mind is one of the most important amendment that I have moved.  It might appear to some Senators that I had some personal interest in increasing rents and getting increased allowances for repairs, but in regard to this particular matter I should like to say that I have no personal interest whatever.  I have discussed this sub-section with a great number of people &mdash; some here in Dublin City and some in the provinces &mdash; and solicitors and others, as well as householders, seem to be of the opinion that if this sub-section is allowed to stand as it is there is going to be a very serious amount of trouble. There will be thousands if not hundreds of thousands of certificates applied for.  While the lot of the owner of property is not so far a very happy one, his lot will become quite an impossible one should this sub-section stand as it is.  My amendment proposes to delete the words from and including the words &ldquo;but if&rdquo; in line 31, to and including the word &ldquo;certificate&rdquo; in line 32, and to insert in lieu thereof the words &ldquo;but on the hearing of an application under this section the court may in addition to any other Order declare that&rdquo; the tenant shall be entitled to deduct the fee from any subsequent payment of rent.  That seems to be a very fair proposal, because in the normal course or at <Col N="308" /> least in a very large number of cases the matter will go before the court, and it does seem extraordinary that a tenant can, the moment he gets the certificate, make the deduction, and so prejudice the case, as it were, in advance, assuming that all the rights are on his side.  This is a small concession, and I would very strongly appeal to the Minister to accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 43:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before Section 23 to insert the following new section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>If the rent of any controlled premises in respect of any period whether before or after the passing of this Act exceeds the lawful rent the amount of the excess shall, notwithstanding any agreement to the contrary, be irrecoverable from the tenant of the premises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a proposal to substitute one form of section for another.  In other words, what I am proposing is that we should drop Section 23 as it appears in the Bill and insert the section which stands in my name on the Order Paper.  It seems to me that the section as it appears in the Bill is roundabout and cumbersome.  I do not know whether it is necessary that sections of Bills should be drafted in this cumbersome manner.  I think it is not.  I imagine we could get simple language to convey precisely what we want done.  It is desirable that we should do that when we are dealing with legislation affecting the ordinary, simple people, who will need to have recourse to the courts to defend their interests under this Bill when it becomes law.  Apart from that, I am taking exception to the limiting provision of the section itself.  The section <Col N="309" /> provides that if certain rents exceed the lawful rent the excess is irrecoverable by the landlord from and after the date on which this Bill becomes law.  It also provides that where the excess rent was paid by the tenant it is recoverable by him only from the date on which the basic rent is fixed.  I cannot follow why an illegal payment is sacrosanct if it occurred before the date on which this Bill becomes law. In respect of a large number of premises to which the Bill applies, control has, in fact, existed since 1915. In respect of all premises coming under this Bill which were erected before 2nd April, 1919, irrespective of the valuation, they were all covered by the Rent Restrictions Acts up to 1926. Certain premises now coming under the Bill were decontrolled under the Act of 1926, but an Emergency Powers Order was made on 1st February, 1944, that is two years ago.  Still, notwithstanding the operation of the Emergency Powers Order and the Rent Restrictions Acts, under this Bill we are allowing people who have been overcharging to retain the amounts overcharged, and we are providing that the tenant may not recover the overcharge when the amount of it is determined, unless it is an overcharge in respect of a date following the passing of this Act.  The amendment I propose is a simple one.  It can be readily understood.  It provides that if the rent of any controlled premises in respect of any period, whether before or after the passing of this Act, exceeds the lawful rent, the amount of the excess shall, notwithstanding any agreement to the contrary, be irrecoverable from the tenant of the premises.  There is another amendment later dealing with the recovery by the tenant of moneys unlawfully demanded from him by the landlord.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not prepared to accept this amendment.  There is a difference between the two types of cases.  There are Section 8 and Section 14 cases.  In this case the rents are known or can be discovered.  The landlord can find out what the rent is, and if he overcharges he is deliberately doing it.  In the other case, the rent is not known. <Col N="310" /> It has to be fixed.  It is up to the tenant, if he thinks it too much, to move in time.  If he delays, it is his own lookout.  I do not think it would be fair to the landlord to ask him to pay back an excess rent that had been charged if, in fact, the rent had not been determined.  I think that would be a most unfair thing to do.</P>

      <P>With regard to Section 24, Sir, I think we should look at the practical implications of sub-section (2) which has to deal with <Col N="311" /> the question of a person making entries in a rent book or similar document, because there might be some injustice there.  I have known of cases where a rent collector made wrong entries in the rent book, but the landlord did not know anything about that, and when the matter came to light, the landlord accepted the tenant's word and was satisfied that there was fraud on the part of his employee.  Is it not, however, the practice that the tenant keeps the rent book, and, therefore, if an entry is wrongly made in the rent book, surely the tenant should point it out to the collector?  Surely, it should be the business of the tenant to point out to the collector immediately that the entry is wrong, and then it can be brought immediately to the attention of the landlord or his agent that a wrong entry has been made.  It seems to me to be rather unfair that the landlord should have to suffer for improper conduct on the part of his employee.  I do not think it should be a matter of an automatic penalty, so to speak.</P>

      <P>This is my point of view, and I think it is a question that should be put beyond yea or nay, and not be left as a question to be again decided by the court.  There is an ordinary provision in the next section to the effect that if the tenant can only get six years' arrears of rent, overpayment cannot be recovered after he has left the premises.  I think it should <Col N="312" /> be a shorter period, and I think that we should limit this thing in some way. I know that a decision was given in some such case, although I cannot recollect it at the moment, but I think the decision was that the tenant could not get anything at all after he gave up possession.  Perhaps we can discuss that matter on the Report Stage, but I think that the wording here is not quite correct.</P>

      <P>In page 16, in line 34; and also in line 38, to delete the word, brackets and figures &ldquo;(1923) Act&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Bill was originally introduced it provided that the section would apply without any reservations to small premises.  During the Report Stage in the Dáil the Minister introduced a proposal which had the effect of excluding certain premises from the provisions of Chapter 3, small premises which were built or reconstructed subsequent to 2nd April, 1929.  The provision is going to exclude from the cheap procedure of Chapter 3 thousands of houses and tenements in Dublin, Cork and Limerick.  It will certainly affect a very large number in Dublin, because, as is well known, considerable numbers of houses have been reconditioned and turned into tenements during the last few years.  All these premises will be taken away from the provisions of that chapter.  I think that is a mistake.  I know that there is a tremendous outcry amongst people affected or who believe they are affected by this exclusion.  What is important about it is this, that if Chapter 3 applies to such houses, the tenants of which are usually persons without much spare cash, they are entitled to approach a District Court clerk to make a complaint which will be transmitted to the district justice and determined by him outside the court proceedings.  It is going to be costly for both sides.  By the amendment inserted in the Dáil every house constructed since 2nd April, 1929, or any house reconstructed into a self-contained flat or tenement is excluded. No reasonable grounds could be <Col N="314" /> advanced by the Minister for doing that.  Grounds for exclusion may be advanced by the Minister for Finance. If the Minister in charge of the Bill tells us that he was obliged to take out houses which are now excluded, but which were included in the original Bill, because the Minister for Finance was not willing to bear the expense which the proposal would have incurred, we know where we are.  If that is the argument, perhaps we will be prepared to accept it, but it is difficult to know where we are if the argument is that, for some extraordinary reason, these houses were excluded, not on the ground of finance but on some other ground.  If they were excluded on some other ground I should like to hear it.  Large numbers of people are affected, and I urge very strongly, before the Bill leaves this House, that the provision should be restored to the condition in which it was when it originally reached the Dáil.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not going to accept the amendment.  This particular chapter was designed to meet the case of the poorer sections of the community.  In the beginning it was drawn too widely and, on re-examination, I was quite satisfied that these facilities would bring in a type of person who did not want them.  These people have their rights under Chapter 2.  There are special provisions in the Bill to encourage people, who feel that they have to pay rent that they ought not be paying, but who, for want of means, are afraid of the legal expenses to go to court.  It was pointed out in the Dáil, and I was quite satisfied on re-examination, that if we left the provision as it was, we would bring in plenty of people in houses under £10 valuation who could take advantage of other parts of the Act.  They are still covered if they feel that they are charged rents that they consider to be too high.  This is a new idea, designed to help those who are generally referred to as slum dwellers.  I am satisfied that by limiting the 1923 Act to cases of £10 and under, they will be dealt with.  We definitely want to exclude the type of person I mentioned, who may be <Col N="315" /> living in one of the houses that was not controlled until an Emergency Powers Order was made, and who may have a case.  If that is so, that person can proceed under other parts of the Bill.  I am not prepared to interfere. The Minister for Finance did not interfere in this matter at all.  That is not my defence.  I acted after full reconsideration, and I want to confine the provision altogether to slum dwellers who may need legal help but who are not able to pay for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister discusses this amendment from the angle of valuation.  He made the case that he does not want to bring in people living in houses of a higher valuation than £10 because they can afford the type of litigation provided for in Chapter 2.  That is not the case I made.  I have not asked that the provisions of the Bill be extended to anyone beyond the £10 valuation mark.  What I am asking is that, within the £10 valuation, flats or tenements which were reconstructed since April 2nd, 1929, should be brought into the Bill.  The line of demarcation is completely different.  It is a question of excluding houses, no matter how low the valuation may be, if they were built since 2nd April, 1919, and of excluding flats constructed since that date and tenements created since that date.  That is what is being done.  Some of the people excluded may be living in a tenement the valuation of which may be £1.  That does not matter; they are excluded in relation to the date of reconstruction, not in relation to the valuation.  The Minister has been completely misled in relation to the effect of this measure.  The exclusion <Col N="316" /> is entirely related to dates, not to wealth or poverty nor to high valuations or low valuations.  If the Minister would consider the matter, he would have to agree that a person living in a tenement which was converted in 1920, 1925 or 1930 would require the facilities provided by this Bill just as much as if he were living in a tenement constructed 50 years ago.  The provisions of Chapter 3 are directed towards the financial circumstances of the tenant.  It is recognised that, no matter what provisions you might make to protect the interests of tenants, they would be ineffective unless you afforded the tenants an opportunity of establishing their rights without incurring heavy legal expenses.  That is conceded by the Bill so far as it relates to occupiers of premises which were built or reconstructed by the end of March, 1919.  If there was any alteration since that date&mdash;if there was reconstruction in the case of a tenement or if a house was built since that date&mdash;the tenant, irrespective of the valuation of the premises, is deprived of the facilities afforded by Chapter 3.</P>

      <P>I am, because I think, with all respect to the legal profession, that it does include certain people whose main interest is to promote their own welfare.  Senator Sweetman knows quite well that in this city there is a gentleman known in the profession as &ldquo;the ambulance chaser&rdquo;.  As a matter of fact, a member of the solicitors' organisation asked me on a couple of occasions to give him some information concerning the activities of certain members of his own profession who he believed were trafficking in this practice of following the ambulance to the hospital to see if there was a possible action under the Workmen's Compensation Act or under common law.  Are we opening a lucrative business to these people?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am advised to the contrary, and if they do go into it and if we are going to make a prohibition against anyone charging for their services under Chapter III, then we ought to include the solicitors in that prohibition.  As a matter of fact, it is known that the houses of the clients to which Chapter III applies have become a source of revenue for certain solicitors which it is difficult to describe as anything but a racket.  If a person desires to rent a house in a certain part of this city, he can only get that house by going to the office of a named solicitor, and paying that solicitor a fee to prove an agreement which is in a printed form and cannot be altered. You cannot alter a comma of the agreement but you have got to pay the solicitor's fees, and the matter is causing a great deal of uneasiness, because many of these people feel that they can do their business quite well without going to a solicitor.  People who are taking a small house at a £1 a week, on a week to week basis, feel they do not need this elaborate procedure of going to a solicitor.</P>

      <P>And I suggest that provision for the payment of solicitors should not be inserted in this section. There are charitable organisations in this city served by well-known practitioners, both solicitors and barristers, who spend a night or two per week at offices of these organisations giving advice and legal aid free to poor persons in relation to various matters which affect the interests of poor persons.  This service is given voluntarily by a number of well-known and, indeed, very busy legal practitioners. I want, if possible, to ensure that there will be no market opened up for the gentlemen who do nothing free for anybody, who are out for the profits which legislation unfortunately often creates in many spheres.  I think it is a great mistake that, when the Minister was inserting this provision, which prohibits anyone from acting as agent for fee or reward, he did not exclude solicitors as well.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LouisODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think my friend understands the section at all or he would not have made statements he has made.  The section, as I understand it, provides that any tenant or his agent, no matter who the agent is, can go to the clerk of the district court and ask to have a provisional order made.  There is no necessity whatever to go to a solicitor for the purposes of that application.  No solicitor need be employed at all for the purposes of the application.  We know, and Senator Duffy knows, that people have organised tenants and made them pay much more than they would ever pay to a solicitor.  They receive big fees as rent recovery experts or in some other capacity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">

    <Speaker pid="LouisODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>For that reason, just as I am against Senator Duffy's amendment, I am equally for Senator Sweetman's <Col N="320" /> amendment because if Senator Sweetman's amendment is not carried, the section will have little or no effect. All that will be necessary is that a man should call himself an association, get certain people to subscribe and then do this work for reward.  The object of the section is to protect the tenant from charges by anybody and he need not go to a solicitor.  I think it is a very proper and necessary section.  If a man is well-off and does want the luxury of a solicitor, then the least he might do is to pay for the services of such a solicitor, but you will find that nobody will.  It is not necessary that he should.  These people will simply go to the clerk of the District Court and that is all they need do.  Should there be an appeal by the landlord the court has power to order the State to pay the costs of the tenant.  There seems to be no sense in the amendment.  I do not think that Senator Duffy understands the meaning of the section.  If he did he would not have proposed the amendment at all.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 47:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (4), to insert after the word &ldquo;reward&rdquo; in line 8, page 17, the words:&mdash;&ldquo;or is remunerated directly or indirectly out of the funds of any body, association, society or company of which the tenant has been or is a member, or to the funds of which the tenant has been a subscriber.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is an amendment which I think is very necessary.  The Minister, I am quite sure, is aware of the type of case I have in mind, and as there is a real necessity to deal with the scandal <Col N="321" /> it is perhaps as well that I should explain the amendment briefly to the House.  What happened, and what will happen if the sub-section is left as it is, is that a person will get three of his friends together and will say to them: &ldquo;We shall form the Gardiner Street tenants' association.  The three of you will form it and you will appoint me secretary of this association.&rdquo; Having appointed himself secretary of the association, he will then go and canvass for members of the association and will put it to the people whom he canvasses that the association will, through its secretary, lodge an application for him under this section, adding: &ldquo;Before you join it, you must pay a fee of 20/-.&rdquo; The person thus going out to canvass for members will not be paid by the tenants.  He will be paid by the association. Therefore the sub-section as at present drafted will not get him.  If it were going to stop at that, it would be bad enough, but it can be very much worse.</P>
    <P>What will happen further is that the secretary of the association, having got a number of people to join the association, and having filed on behalf of the tenants an application under the section, will come along and say: &ldquo;This may not be heard for some time, and you would be a very unwise person if when that time came you had not got a satisfactory amount of your rent put by.  The safest thing you can do is to pay that rent to me until the case is determined, instead of paying it to the landlord.&rdquo; That did happen under the previous Acts in specific cases.  I know an instance where that did happen with one particular person under the 1923 Act at a time when, as the Minister can remember, there was a very great delay in the Circuit Court in Dublin. The court was heavily in arrears in dealing with Rent Act cases.  The secretary of some of these associations did make suggestions that the rents of the premises should be paid to him pending the determination of the cases.  Unfortunately, in some cases, some of these mushroom organisations carried on in that way and when the appeal came to be determined, the association and the secretary of it were not to be found. I want to make it perfectly clear that <Col N="322" /> such a state of affairs cannot possibly arise under this section.</P>
    <P>The Minister has provided in the sub-section that a person not being a solicitor may not act as agent on an application directly or indirectly in expectation of reward but I do not think that the sub-section as drafted would cover the case of a demand by an association or the secretary of the association.  I have framed my amendment in such a way that if the inducement is to join an association on the pretence that the association will make the claim, then that equally will be looked upon as a racket, which is the only word I can use to describe accurately the abuses which occurred previously.</P>

      <P>This amendment is intended to ensure that Chapter III will in fact apply to persons living in small premises.  As the Bill stands now it seems to me that what is contemplated is that the tenant alone may initiate proceedings under Chapter III.  The landlord is not entitled to institute any proceedings under Chapter III.  But the landlord is not precluded from instituting proceedings under Chapter II in respect of houses&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>I probably misled the Senator by referring to Chapter III in this case.  I meant Part III.  I was referring to the procedure under the Chapter II earlier on.  At any rate, the net point is this, that the tenant of small premises to which this Part of the Bill relates is entitled to what we can, I think, call for short costless proceedings to defend his interests, if he takes the initiative, but only if he takes the initiative.  What I am endeavouring to do here is to provide that this Part of the Bill only will apply to small premises, so as to ensure that the landlord may not interpose before the tenant makes any <Col N="325" /> move at all, and take proceedings on his own account.  Let us see what happens.  The landlord is a free agent to fix any rent he likes, whether it is a lawful rent or an unlawful rent. There is a method provided here for limiting his activities if he acts unlawfully, but we can only determine whether or not he is acting unlawfully when proceedings are taken in court to test the validity of his acts.  In fact, there are two methods open to the landlord.  He can go into court, under Section 9, I think it is, in respect of small premises, and ask the District Court to settle the rent of his premises.</P>
      <P>The court proceedings will be reasonably expensive; in fact they may be unreasonably expensive in relation to the type of tenant concerned.  But that is not the only method open to the landlord.  He can serve a notice of increased rent under Section 20, and he can continue charging the increased rent unless and until the tenant takes proceedings.  Of course the tenant in that case would take proceedings under Part III.  As the Bill was redrawn in the Dáil, Part III applies only to tenements which are at least 30 years old. Some of them would probably be 300 years old.  I am anxious that, so far as these premises are concerned, the provisions made under Part III will be a reality, and that the landlord will be precluded from taking proceedings to have the rent settled under any other part of the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>This is, in the main, a drafting amendment.  It recasts paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of sub-section (1) of Section 31 in what are considered to be better and less rigid terms than the existing paragraphs.  The only change of any substance which the amendment makes is that it gives the justice, when dealing with an application by the landlord under Section 31, the additional power of revoking the provisional order and substituting for it such new order as he considers the circumstances may require.  Under the existing provisions of paragraph (b), he can only confirm or vary the provisional order.</P>
      <P>The amendment also remedies a drafting defect in the existing paragraph (a), by deleting sub-paragraphs (ii) and (iii).  Provisions identical with these two sub-paragraphs furnish the grounds for the making of a provisional order under paragraph (b) of sub-section (1) of Section 29, and it is clearly wrong that the same provisions should be the ground for subsequently revoking the order under paragraph (a) of sub-section (1) of Section 31.</P>

      <P>To delete sub-section (3).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A new principle is being introduced in Part III.  It is now proposed, we find, that the court should come to the rescue, as it were, of the poorer classes of tenants and enables such tenants to get justice, let us say, under the Act, and public funds are to be drawn upon accordingly.  Now, I have great sympathy with the idea underlying that, because we know that many injustices do occur as a result of insufficiency of means to fight a case in court, but I should like to draw the Minister's attention to one fact.  The District Courts have made mistakes in the past, and there might be an obvious mistake made in the District Court, in which judgment might be given in favour of the tenant.  The landlord, being in a position to procure the best legal advice may know that the judgment of the District Court is wrong and he decides to take the matter to the Circuit Court.  At this stage, I think it would be well if there could be some machinery, or something in the nature of arbitration proceedings, so that both the tenant and the landlord could be advised that if the case were brought <Col N="329" /> to the Circuit Court, a lot of money would be lost, and that that money could be saved if some agreement could be come to between the parties concerned.  As the section stands, the aggrieved person, who has got a judgment in the District Court, will, perhaps, be more stubborn about bringing his case to the Circuit Court since he knows that win or lose his expenses will be paid.  I think that that could be avoided.  There has been some talk about the St. Vincent de Paul Society intervening in such cases, and it seems to me that there would be a case for some such body to come to the rescue of such people, being acquainted with the character and prospects of the people concerned.  That is the aspect of the matter which appeals to me, and I think it is an obvious one.  It is quite obvious, it seems to me, that there might be many cases, also, where it might not be well to bring the matter again to the Circuit Court, and therefore I think this whole question should be a matter for further consideration. I do not want to press this, but I suggest to the Minister that it would be in the interest of tenants and of everybody concerned to have these cases examined and settled without having to go through this machinery of appeals, wherever that is possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it necessary to give the court power to have tenants' costs paid where a landlord brings an appeal.  If a tenant brings an appeal he has to take the consequences.  If every case of what is called a poor tenant under this chapter were to be appealed and if he was to be liable for costs, the whole of these proceedings would be useless as they would not be availed of.  It is very necessary to give the court that power if we are going to help those people to have their rents fixed.  I do not know how we could manage arbitration.  It is better to leave this matter as it is.  If the court upholds an appeal it should have power, in the case of a poor person, to have the costs paid.</P>

      <P>In sub-section (1), paragraph (e), page 20, line 48, to delete the words &ldquo;or to reside&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This provision relates to the rights of a tenant in circumstances in which the landlord might, under this Bill, recover possession of premises.  For instance, in the case of a dwellinghouse, he is entitled to recover possession if the dwelling is reasonably required by the landlord for occupation as a residence for himself or for any person <i>bona fide</i> residing or to reside with him.  That is opening the door for the recovery of premises not merely when a person is residing with a landlord, but when he is about to reside with him.  That is going too far, and I suggest that the section should be amended in the manner proposed.</P>

      <P>There is a great deal in what Senator Duffy said regarding the words &ldquo;or to reside&rdquo;, and I ask the Minister to consider a redrafting of the section.  A landlord might say that although he had no person residing with him, someone was going to reside for whom he wanted possession.  It is a rather difficult question, and the Minister might reconsider it.  I might mention that the section follows too closely a section of the Act of 1923. Clause (b) of Section 4 of that Act refers to houses or premises used for immoral or illegal purposes.  In Coughlin's book a case of Foran v. Lee was cited.  Mr. Lee, a tenant of a licensed house in Galway, in days when there was very little law, was convicted of selling poteen, and because he was convicted the landlord took an action against him long afterwards and got a decree for possession.  Eventually the landlord himself became a rich man from the sale of poteen.</P>

The court has to be satisfied on the question of greater hardship.  Unless the court considers it reasonable to make the order, they will not do so.  That provision as to reasonableness was in a different part of the section when the Bill was introduced.  As it is now, it governs the whole section.  The court has very wide jurisdiction.  It will be for the court to decide the question of greater hardship and I am satisfied that the provision is fair and reasonable.</P>

      <P>In amendment No. 57, Senator Duffy seeks to delete the words &ldquo;or to reside&rdquo;.  These words are contained in the Increase of Rent and Mortgage Interest (Restrictions) Act, 1920, Section 5 (1) (d).  They were repeated in Section 4 (1) (d) of the Increase of Rent and Mortgage Interest (Restrictions) Act, 1923.  They are continued in this Bill.  In my opinion, the words &ldquo;to reside&rdquo; are governed or controlled by the words &ldquo;<i>bona fide</i>&rdquo; which precede them, so that the court must be satisfied that the person for whom the house is required proposes to reside <i>bona fide</i> with the landlord.</P>
      <P>I do not know whether there have been many cases on this sub-section or not but I do not think that any harm can be done by allowing the words to remain.  As the Minister pointed out, a patient in hospital may be about to come home to reside there.  A relative abroad may be about to come home.  No harm has, so far, been done by these words, and I submit that Senator Duffy has made no case for their deletion.  Therefore, I suggest that he should not press his amendment.</P>

      <P>I do not know what kind of case Senator Ryan expected me to make.  It seemed to me that the case was self-evident.  The case I want to make now is that, when there was a hard-faced Tory Government in Great Britain, the Rent Restrictions Acts then in force were amended so as to make it easy for a landlord to go into court and secure possession from an occupying tenant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government in this country in 1923 followed that practice and these words were also inserted in the Act of 1923, but I do not think that is the kind of argument that would appeal to the Minister.  If I remember anything of his political views, they seemed to me to suggest that much of the legislation of his predecessors should have been undone.  This is an opportunity for him to undo some of the injustices caused by the Act of 1923 and I cannot imagine I could make any stronger case for taking these words out of the Bill than to remind him that they were inserted by his predecessors when they had a <Col N="334" /> free hand to do almost anything they liked.</P>

      <P>Senator Ryan mentioned the case of a person coming out of hospital.  The Minister also makes the point that it enabled a person coming out of hospital to reside with the landlord of a premises as a justification for the recovery of possession, but I would point out that if, in fact, the landlord had a relative in hospital who was likely to come to his house to reside, the moment that relative in hospital reside with him, he is entitled to recovery of possession if the application is reasonable under the Act, even if these words come out.</P>
      <P>I am not asking the House to remove the provision in the Bill which enables a landlord to secure possession of a premises required by him for the accommodation of somebody residing with him, whether relative or not, but you will remember that the Bill goes on to provide that the landlord is entitled to possession if he can show that somebody is residing with him or about to reside with him for whom he requires the premises, or that they are wanted by a tenant, or somebody employed by a tenant of his in some other house.</P>
      <P>All these provisions take away materially from the protection afforded to an occupier, and you will observe that so long as these words mentioned in No. 57 remain a landlord is required to show that it would be a greater hardship to refuse than to grant an application, or that there is alternative accommodation reasonably equivalent for the occupier &mdash;not that he must show that there is alternative accommodation&mdash; and that it would be a greater hardship to refuse the application. All he needs to do is to show that one of the grounds exists.  I think at least whether we carry this amendment or refuse to carry it, we should know what is provided in the Bill. We should not leave ourselves under any illusion or the public under any illusion.</P>

      <P>In page 21, before sub-section (2), to insert the following new sub-section:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(2)  Where on an application by a landlord to recover possession of a dwelling it appears to the court that the landlord purchased the landlord's interest in such dwelling during the currency of the tenancy subsisting at the time of the making of the application, no order for possession shall be made <Col N="336" /> unless the court is satisfied that prior to the sale to the landlord of the landlord's interest in such dwelling an opportunity to purchase such interest on reasonable terms was given to the tenant and not availed of.</P>
    <P>This is a proposal to insert a new sub-section. It deals with a situation where somebody other than the landlord formerly owning the house makes application to the court for possession. In other words, the premises are sold, the purchaser comes into court and makes this case of greater hardship or the other pleas contained in the sub-section with which we have dealt.  The amendment proposes that possession will not be granted unless the court is satisfied that, prior to the sale of the landlord's interest in the dwelling, an opportunity to purchase on reasonable terms was given to the tenant and not availed of.  We can imagine the case of a person in possession of a dwelling house for many years.  The landlord then dies and the representatives of the estate sell this house amongst other property, without giving the tenant an opportunity of buying the house.  Then the new landlord goes into court to look for an order for possession.  I am endeavouring to ensure that, so long as this new Bill remains in force, an order for possession will not be granted unless the court is satisfied that the tenant then in possession was given a reasonable opportunity to purchase the premises on reasonable terms.</P>

      <P>I think the position has been so far, at least in any case in which I have been interested, that where it is proved that at the time the landlord purchased the premises the tenant was in possession, the court thereupon takes the view that the landlord bought the property with his eyes open and that, in these circumstances, the greater hardship would lie if the tenant were dispossessed. That, to my knowledge, has been the practice up to this and, in view of that, I do not think that Senator Duffy's amendment would meet the case.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 60:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 21, before Section 38, to insert the following new section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  Where on the application of the landlord an order for the recovery of possession of controlled premises is made by the court under this Act and, at the time of making the order, the court is satisfied that the occupying tenant or his immediate predecessor in title with the consent of the landlord for the time being or otherwise reasonably expended on or after the critical date, any amount on improving or on the structural alteration of the premises or on the decoration of or repair to the premises and that such expenditure would, if this Act were not in force, have added to the letting value of the premises, the tenant shall on giving up possession be entitled to be paid by the landlord compensation of such amount as may be agreed upon or, in default of agreement, shall in accordance with the provisions of this section be determined by the court.</P>
      <P>(2)  The compensation awarded by the court under this section shall be such amount as, in the opinion of the court, represents the capitalised value of the added letting value of the premises at the termination of the tenancy as is attributable to the improvement, structural alteration, decoration or repair (as the case may require) which is the subject of such compensation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(3)  The capitalised value for the purpose of this section of the addition to the letting value of the premises mentioned in the next preceding <Col N="338" /> sub-section of this section shall be fixed by the court having regard to the probable life of the improvement, structural alteration, decoration or repair (as the case may be) and to all other relevant circumstances, but shall not in any case exceed twenty times the annual amount thereof.</P>
    <P>(4)  Where compensation is payable under this section by the landlord to the tenant and the court is satisfied that such tenant has received from the landlord benefits by way of reduction of rent or otherwise in consideration, expressly or impliedly, of such improvement, structural alteration, decoration or repair as is mentioned in this section being or having been made, the court shall deduct from the compensation such sum as the court shall think proper in respect of such benefits.</P>
    <P>The proposed new section is an effort to secure compensation for a tenant against whom an order for possession is granted by the court.  You will remember, Sir, that early on this Bill was amended so as to exclude the item of repairs from the matters which would be considered in relation to the fixing of the rent.  First and foremost, there is the question: Will the tenant pay the rates?  I think it is assumed for the purpose of arriving at the net rent that the tenant will pay the rates.  Provision was also made in the first draft of the Bill on the assumption that the tenant would be liable for repairs.  That was deleted in Committee in the Dáil but there is no provision for taking into account expenditure by a tenant on repairs to premises the subject of an application to the courts.  It seems to me that if the court makes an order giving the landlord possession, it is reasonable to claim that if the tenant in fact has made substantial improvements which would have the effect of giving to the premises a higher letting value, if this Act were not in force, he should be entitled to compensation for these improvements.</P>
    <P>I may say that this provision is lifted almost entirely from the Landlord and Tenant Act of 1931 so that <Col N="339" /> these provisions do already apply to houses covered by the Act of 1931.  I am endeavouring to secure that they will apply to houses which are not covered by the Act of 1931 but to which the present Bill would apply. There is no new principle involved and nobody could say that it would be a hardship on the landlord, taking over premises that were substantially improved at the expense of the tenants, if he had to pay compensation for such improvements.</P>

      <P>I think this amendment is much too far-reaching, and really not appropriate to a Bill of limited duration of this kind.  The Senator has stated that the provision already appears, though I should not imagine that the circumstances are identical, in the Landlord and Tenant Act of 1931.  I am not quite clear what premises are included in that Act or are excluded from this Bill but let us examine this proposal.  It seems to be patently absurd.  What is the significance of the words: &ldquo;with the consent of the landlord for the time being or otherwise?&rdquo; That word &ldquo;otherwise&rdquo; requires examination.</P>

      <P>I submit that you cannot allow improvements done without the consent of the landlord to be considered as a matter for compensation. That is, I think, the fundamental doctrine on which the whole matter must be determined.  Otherwise the tenant, of his own free will, may do a number of things which might be held reasonable but which might in point of fact be far too luxurious for the character of the building.  Again, why bring in the item of repairs?  No occupier who contracts to do repairs is entitled to compensation for those repairs.  The repairs are merely making good the wear and tear and deterioration of the property.  I do think <Col N="340" /> that this amendment is a most dangerous one, and should not be accepted.</P>

      <P>I am afraid I cannot agree with this amendment, nor do I think that it will in any way do what Senator Duffy has in mind.  If that amendment were in this Bill immediately after Section 37 I have no doubt whatever that when the district justice came to consider the question of greater hardship he would consider that there was never any hardship on the tenant because the tenant was going to get certain compensation.  In fact, therefore, if the amendment were in the Bill I think it would mean that there would be less restriction on possession than there is in the Bill as originally drafted.  I think the amendment would to a very large extent defeat one of Senator Duffy's objects.</P>
      <P>Quite apart from that, the amendment itself in some way deals with the principles that are in the Landlord and Tenant Act, but it quite omits cognisance of two things.  First of all, so far as the Landlord and Tenant Act is concerned, before the tenant can get compensation for improvements he must serve an improvements notice, so that the landlord will have an opportunity of objecting that the work to be done is not in fact an improvement at all.  In my opinion, that is one vital objection to the amendment as worded. The other objection I have to it is that it takes into account the occupying tenant or his immediate predecessor in title, but in this Bill we are quite clear that a statutory tenant is to be prohibited from selling his interest, and I cannot see what reason there is for incorporating the wide words &ldquo;predecessor in title&rdquo; where one tenant succeeds another, unless you admit the principle that that tenant had bought and paid cash for the interest.</P>

      <P>If the Senator meant to incorporate merely somebody who had obtained it by will or inheritance, he would have found a precedent for that in the 1931 Landlord and Tenant Act, where there is a specific distinction in certain parts between purchasing occupiers and occupiers who merely <Col N="341" /> come along and take the premises after the death of the original tenant.  I cannot anticipate any district justice not taking the view that, with this section in, there would never be any hardship on the tenant.  Therefore, I think it would completely defeat the idea the Senator has in his mind of widening and extending the provisions of Section 37.  Of course what does happen is that if the justice is in any doubt at all as to what is the hardship involved in the case&mdash;if he thinks there is genuine hardship on the landlord but that there is some hardship on the tenant&mdash;he defers giving judgment on the matter; he says that for six months, or whatever period he thinks is fair, he is not going to give an order for possession.  In that way he evens out the hardship, so to speak.  With this amendment there the tenant would never even get that opportunity of looking for other premises.</P>

      <P>I think there is something in the amendment.  There is no doubt that it is a hardship on a person who has expended money on improvements, and increased the letting value of the house by those improvements, to be pitched out without any compensation. Senator Sweetman suggests that the justice or judge would say that if the tenant is getting compensation there is no hardship on him.  I do not agree with that at all.  I think possibly a better argument against the amendment would be to say that if the tenant can prove that he did expend money on improvements the court would consider it a tremendous hardship if he were to be evicted from the house.  I think that is a better argument against the amendment.  Of course I agree that this amendment as it stands could not be accepted, because there would have to be notice given to the landlord.  He would either have to get an opportunity of objecting to the repairs and improvements or an opportunity of doing them himself and increasing the rent.  I agree that the words &ldquo;predecessor in title&rdquo; could not be considered, but perhaps the Minister might look into the matter between this and the Report Stage and make some concession.</P>

If there were going to be any amendment, it is not under this Bill it would be done.  It would not relate to a Rent Act but to the Landlord and Tenant Act.  I thought it would have been out of order; it really is a Landlord and Tenant Act amendment rather than an amendment to a Rent Restrictions Bill.</P>

      <P>Speaking about some amendment the other night, the Minister stated that it would be well to have the Act, so far as possible, self-contained, and to do away with the need for reference to other Acts where possible.  I propose then, <Col N="343" /> instead of allowing the word &ldquo;lawfully&rdquo; to stand, to insert a definition on the lines suggested in No. 67. What I propose is that in sub-section (4), before paragraph (c), a new paragraph should be inserted as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(c) that the tenant will not sublet the premises or any part thereof without the consent in writing of the landlord, and if he obtains such consent the terms of every subletting shall be submitted to the landlord for his approval and the letting can only be made with such approval.</P>
      <P>Now, I take it that that is really the sense in which the word &ldquo;lawfully&rdquo; is intended to be used in this Bill, and, if a definition of the word is included in this Bill and the necessity for reference to other Acts can be obviated that would be an advantage when this Bill becomes an Act.  In looking up cases recently in regard to subletting, I came across a very remarkable case known, I think, as <i>Sisk v. Cronin</i>, and that had to do with a case where a house was let to a tenant who did not actually occupy the premises, but later on his brother occupied the premises.</P>
      <P>The landlord initiated an action for recovery of the premises and it was held that he was entitled to that but, in the meanwhile, the premises had been sublet to the brother.  Now, my point is that the brother might have been a ne'er-do-well or might have had some other objectionable features about him, but in this case, although the original tenant did not occupy the premises, and his brother did, the court held that the brother was entitled to remain there.  The purpose of this amendment is to see that such premises cannot be sublet without the consent in writing of the landlord, and that the terms of every such subletting shall be submitted to the landlord for his approval.  I think that if that provision were made a lot of unnecessary litigation would be avoided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are many such cases, but the case I have mentioned is one with which this amendment would deal.  I have heard of innumerable cases where this abuse of subletting prevails.  I am <Col N="344" /> sure that we all know of cases where the person occupying premises has sublet them at three or four times the rent that the owner of the premises is receiving.  Incidentally, if this amendment were accepted, it would go a long way towards remedying these abuses in regard to the subletting of portions of houses used as flats, because the owner of the premises would then know what was happening in regard to the subletting.  I think that everybody will agree that the premises should not be sublet without the consent in writing of the landlord.  If that were done, such a practice as I have referred to, in the case of the two brothers, could not occur.  I do not think there should be any objection to that, except, possibly, in the minds of some solicitors, who seem to have a doubt as to what the word &ldquo;lawfully&rdquo; means.  I understood that the word &ldquo;lawfully&rdquo; had a definite meaning, but I have asked many solicitors what the word meant, and they could not tell me.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to give sympathetic consideration to this amendment, because, in regard to this matter of subletting, if he would agree to the amendment, it would make a lot of people who are interested in house property much happier than they are at present.  Such people are very uneasy at the moment, and I think that the acceptance of this amendment would clear away a lot of difficulties and would tend to bring about a resumption of the buying of houses for letting.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LouisODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that the word &ldquo;lawfully&rdquo; can be very easily defined.  It is the opposite of the word &ldquo;unlawfully&rdquo;.  Premises cannot be lawfully sublet if there is a clause in the yearly tenancy or lease prohibiting subletting, but if there is no such clause, the tenant is entitled to sublet, and I do not think that the statutes are opposed to subletting either.  I think that, about a century and a half ago, there was some question about a period of seven years, during which the tenant could not sublet without the consent of the landlord, but apart from that every tenancy enables the tenant to sublet unless there is something in <Col N="345" /> the lease, document, or agreement, preventing him from doing so.  Accordingly, if there is no specific objection in the agreement to subletting, then such subletting is lawful.</P>
      <P>As regards the question of rent, I do not think that any tenant is entitled to charge a sub-tenant more than the statutory rent, and I think it is illegal for him to receive more than what he is paying to the landlord, and if he were brought into court, the landlord would be entitled to get back the excess.  I do not think Senator O'Reilly should press this amendment because I think that the law covers the point, and when we come to consider Section 40 I think we can consider that matter in connection with tenancies generally.</P>

      <P>The Minister will admit that the question of subletting is a very serious one.  When one reads the innumerable cases that occur one is bewildered.  I came across one case where a tenant sublet the whole of a house, with the exception of one corner which he reserved for himself.  Seeing that there is such a variety of such cases it would be an advantage to put in a definition, such as is suggested in the amendment.  It would do no harm.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="346" /> It would make the position perfectly clear by removing the uncertainty that now exists.  The definitions given are not as comprehensive as what I suggest, whereby a tenant should have the written consent of the landlord before subletting and should submit each subletting for approval.  The landlord would then have control of the premises.  That would ensure that there was no collusion between the parties. Collusion might lead to other complications. There can be no objection to the amendment except that of redundancy.</P>

      <P>Perhaps the Minister will reconsider it.  It is quite wrong for a tenant to sublet property as against the landlord and get the benefit.  Would it not be possible for the State to say that where there was collusion it was an offence, and where proved would be punishable?  There is every temptation for collusion.  The position is most unfair.</P>
      <P>When there is collusion it means practically robbing a landlord by evading the restrictions in the Act.  I think it is the Government's responsibility to see that landlords are protected against what I call fraud.</P>

      <P>I cannot see that point. The landlord has certain rights and if he wants to protect himself against subletting he can do so when arranging to let a house to a tenant.  If a sub-tenant is prepared or volunteers to pay more than the amount limited by the Act that is his lookout.  The landlord cannot get any more.  If a tenant says that he is prepared to pay twice as much I do not see how that could <Col N="347" /> be stopped.  As the law stands a sub-tenant can go to court and say that he is paying twice as much rent as he should be paying, and can get back the excess amount.  How is there any fraud there on the landlord?</P>

      <P>I think a good landlord should be able to control not merely the tenant but the sub-tenants on his premises.  I see no objection to the giving of control in a case where a person gets possession of a house and later allows another person to come in. In a case I know of while there was nothing very objectionable on the part of the people themselves, the whole character of the street was altered.  The position lends itself to the greatest possible abuses.  I do not think anybody would have a word to say against the giving of control in such cases.  I might mention a case where the sale of his interest by a tenant was completely held up because of a sub-tenancy.  The lessor was not responsible for the sub-tenancy, but although the other person was anxious to buy, the whole business was held up on that account.  That indicates the importance of controlling the tenancy and the sub-tenancy.  I appeal to the Minister to give further consideration to this particular aspect of the matter, as it lends itself to abuse.  I am not referring to the financial end at all.</P>

      <P>It would be far more important to deal with the matter in advance and give the owner of the place an opportunity of considering what type of sub-tenant should come in.  In a provincial town, it is not always easy to put the law into motion. All sorts of practical difficulties arise. The question of evicting a person is a very serious matter&mdash;so serious that most of the building societies and insurance companies will refuse to lend money on houses in the provinces, because they know that, if any difficulty arises about the payment of instalments, it is very unpleasant to have to take ejectment proceedings. If a tenant is already in, it is very objectionable, from the local standpoint, to have to take proceedings to put him out.  The trouble should be cured in advance by controlling the ingress of the tenants, and that is the main purpose of my amendment.</P>
      <P>As regards the Minister's point about the introduction of &ldquo;Section 40&rdquo; into my amendment, I had thought it better at first to leave out &ldquo;Section 40&rdquo; and to put in &ldquo;in accordance with the provisions of this Act&rdquo;.  On consulting a person of fairly considerable experience and legal training &mdash; he is in practice in Dublin&mdash;I was informed that the proper place in which to put this provision was Section 40, because it governs a number of similar matters. That may be wrong.  I intended to have Sections 38 and 39 self-contained, but I was advised that that was the wrong place to put in the words.  If, on consideration, it was thought better not to put in &ldquo;Section 40&rdquo; but to say &ldquo;in accordance with the provisions of this Act&rdquo;, Sections 38 and 39 could be made self-contained, and no reference to any other Act or authority would be necessary.</P>

Why is it not feasible to say that, while premises are controlled, no tenant shall be allowed to sublet without the consent of the landlord, notwithstanding anything to the contrary.  If you limit and restrict the operations of the covenants in a lease which are favourable to the landlord, what objection is there to restricting some of the rights of the tenant, if justice results?</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 63:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 22, at the end of the section, to add a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(4)  For the purpose of this section the word &ldquo;family&rdquo; shall mean and include father, mother, grandfather, grandmother, son, daughter, grandson, granddaughter, stepson, stepdaughter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment seeks to give a wide, but not too wide, definition of the word &ldquo;family&rdquo; in this section.  As the section stands, not merely is provision made for protecting a tenant after his contractual tenancy has ended by making him a statutory tenant, but there is further provision made that, after the statutory tenant has died, his wife or her husband, as the case may be, and, after the death of the wife or the husband, any member of the family may remain on in the tenancy, creating a rather new kind of tenure to the law, which has known fee simple and fee tail but now is to be faced with a kind of tail collateral, whereby the right is given practically to any relation of the tenant to remain on in the premises, no matter what the effect on the landlord.  It is perfectly reasonable that you should not put out the immediate household&mdash;that the mother and the father, the son and the daughter, should be allowed to remain there.  I suggest that there should be an extension to include the grandfather and grandmother, grandchildren and stepchildren, but I think that it ought to stop there.  As a matter of fact, there is a strong argument against allowing houses to be crowded out by collateral relations of the tenant.  The pioneer of housing for the working classes was Octavia Hill, who started, in London, a scheme analogous to our own Iveagh Buildings, and who found it necessary to have only two rules for the tenants.  One of the rules was that no relatives were to be allowed to go into a particular tenement, because that led to overcrowding, and there could not be control under those circumstances. If any tenant is desirous of making certain of this kind of family succession, cousins or aunts or nephews will come to live in the house, so as to <Col N="351" /> secure it after the death of the tenant. That is quite outside the purpose of this Bill.  I suggest that the definition I have given to &ldquo;family&rdquo; is quite sufficiently wide and that you should not allow it to have the too-wide connotation of almost any degree of relationship.</P>

The courts would apparently have no power to shut out aunts and cousins.</P>

They cannot say that in house C an aunt is a member of the family and in the next house say she is not.  The definition should be the same whatever house it is and whatever the conditions of the family.  For the guidance of the courts you must give them a definition in the Act because the courts cannot give a different definition from case to case.

      <P>In sub-section (3) to delete paragraph (a), page 22, and insert in lieu thereof the following paragraph:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) a statutory tenant shall not, as a condition of the assignment or giving up possession of controlled premises or any part thereof, ask or receive the payment of any sum, or any other consideration by any person other than the landlord.</P>
      <P>This is a very necessary amendment. In the 1923 Act there were words introduced that a statutory tenant might not take money from anybody for giving up possession.  That was introduced with the object of ensuring that a statutory tenant should not make money out of his tenancy.  The object was merely to protect him with a roof over his head and not to allow him to make a profit out of it, but on the wording of that particular Act a question did arise as to whether a statutory tenant could sell his tenancy to an outside person, taking money for it, and putting it into his own pocket, which was clearly against the object of the Act, because he was then putting into his own pocket money which by right would belong to the landlord.</P>
      <P>This is designed to make the matter clear.  It provides that a person who stops on as a statutory tenant, though he may assign his property, shall not be allowed to take any money for the assignment, or shall not be allowed to take any money, if he assigns it free, for giving up possession.  In other words, it attempts to prevent abuse of the Act, but still, no doubt, it will be done covertly.</P>

      <P>When we were discussing the matter last night, Senator Kingsmill Moore rightly stated that the authorities, so far as he could remember, held that anybody who got a notice to quit became a statutory tenant.  I have since looked them up and find that was so.  From the year 1923 to 1926, when the Act said that a notice to quit was not necessary, the landlord who served a notice to increase rent also served a notice to quit.  Therefore, all those tenants are statutory tenants, if the decisions are right.  I hope they are not right and I hope we will make them right by the amendment of this Bill and make it clear that nobody is a statutory tenant unless the court has refused an order for possession on the grounds that he is a statutory tenant.  If it can be held that everyone who got a notice to quit is a statutory tenant, then most of the town tenants are statutory tenants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sub-section (3) comes along and says that a tenant can get nothing for his interest in the premises.  He may assign them if he gets the consent of the landlord, but he must not get one penny for it.  What harm does it do to the landlord if he got £8,000 or £10,000, what the premises are worth?  How does that harm the landlord?  The landlord will get a solid and substantial tenant and will receive his rent as he received it before.  He will be as well off as if the premises were <Col N="355" /> assigned to a man of straw, or to somebody to whom he consented.</P>
    <P>You are possibly depriving an old man without money who wants something to live on, and cannot make any provision for himself, out of a business premises he has built up for many years.  He will not come under the Landlord and Tenant Act of 1931, because the landlord has not attempted to dispossess him.  He is held to be a statutory tenant, and, therefore, you are depriving him of a saleable interest in this matter.  It is a serious proposal, and if carried out will have dreadful effects. I would suggest that sub-section (3) be amended to bring it into accordance with sub-section (4) (b).  Then there will be consistency in the section.  At the present time there is no consistency because a man can sell or assign if he gets the consent of the landlord but no matter what consent he gets from the landlord he cannot take a penny for his interest.  I would suggest to the Minister that he should consider an amendment somewhat on these lines: to insert after the words &ldquo;any person other than the landlord&rdquo; the words &ldquo;unless the assignment is made with the consent of the landlord or by way of an assignment without such consent where the court has determined that the withholding of the consent was unreasonable.&rdquo; That would make the matter consistent.</P>
    <P>Even then the tenant could not sell without the consent of the landlord, but the landlord could not withhold consent if the court considered that that was unreasonable.  That would not deprive the tenant of a very valuable interest.  As we all know, houses in a town, where the tenant resides on business premises, are worth thousands of pounds.  That interest can be determined by the landlord serving notice to quit.  Of course the landlord will serve notice to quit unless something is put in the Act to prevent his doing so.  The Minister may also consider that possibly this question should come under Section 37 because under Section 37, if a landlord brings the case to the court after notice to quit is served, he will get an order determining the <Col N="356" /> interest of the tenant even though he does not prove that he requires the premises for himself and the question of greater hardship does not arise.  I submit that, unless he brings himself within some of these sub-sections, the court should have power to dismiss the case and revert the tenant to the rights he held before the notice to quit was served.  If you do not do that, you are confiscating very big rights but you are not injuring the landlord.  The landlord gets nothing in any event.</P>

      <P>I find it almost impossible to follow Senator O'Dea.  I am not, of course, a lawyer but it seems to me that once a tenancy is up, the tenant has no rights according to the ordinary law.  He has not got valuable rights which he can sell.  If the State comes in and makes him a statutory tenant it seems to be nonsense to talk about his losing valuable rights which do no harm to the landlord.  It may not under the law deprive a landlord of money but it will deprive landlords of general rights because it will mean that everybody will become a statutory tenant.  If that principle were adopted any rights of landlords in this country might be forfeited for ever.  When a bargain is made, and a lease has ended, there is only one reason for making the occupant a statutory tenant and that is to prevent hardship. There are no other legitimate or fair grounds for it that I can see.  I cannot understand the argument of Senator O'Dea.</P>

      <P>I cannot understand why the Minister was so ready to agree to this amendment seeing that the amendment might destroy some very valuable rights and interests that a statutory tenant might develop in his premises.  Suppose a statutory tenant developed a small business, he would have a goodwill interest in it.  Probably he could sell that goodwill apart altogether from the premises and assign the premises without any money consideration but unless the tenant could do that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>On a point of order, I referred to cases where notice to quit was served several years ago before the Act of 1931 at all was passed, as well as to cases that occurred since. There was no Landlord and Tenant Act at that time, therefore the tenants could not get their rights.  If it is held that once the rent is increased and notice to quit is served every person is a statutory tenant, all these people can then be thrown on the road.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The whole gravamen of this question as I see it is very simple.  The whole purpose of this Bill is to protect people who are not well off from having to pay too much in rent for their houses. Whether these people have to pay too much by way of a lump sum plus a small rent, or too much by way of a large rent, makes very little difference to them when they come to pay it.  If we were to do what Senator O'Dea suggests, then it would merely mean that any person who wanted to be in a position to rent a house within the control limit would have not only to pay the controlled rent but in fact would have to pay down in addition a large sum of money.  The reason for this Bill is that there is a shortage of houses, and, in consequence, there are too many applicants each time a house becomes vacant.  If the statutory <Col N="358" /> tenant were prepared to sell, then we would have exactly the same thing as we have in respect of other houses in Dublin at present, which are going at fantastic prices, as Senator Quirke will agree.  Senator O'Dea's suggestion would mean that the poorer classes of people would have to pay some fantastic price and that a man who had not got perhaps £400 or £500 to put down would not be able to get a controlled house to rent.  I understand that the whole purpose of this Bill is to avoid that.</P>

      <P>I thought we had discussed this matter sufficiently on the definition section and that was the reason I agreed to accept the amendment. The whole question that arises seems to me to be whether we are going to allow an incoming tenant to be mulcted in the form of a lump payment. As far as small shopkeepers' rights are concerned, they are protected under the Landlord and Tenant Act and these rights are not being interfered with here.  As Senator Sweetman has pointed out, the purpose of this Bill is to give people occupying houses a certain security and to prevent increases of rent beyond a certain amount.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LouisODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid there is still misunderstanding.  The Landlord and Tenant Act was passed for the protection of people undoubtedly, and it did give a certain amount of protection to certain people.  It prevented a man being put out of his house if he was a yearly tenant and had carried on business for a period of three years, or, if he had a shorter term than one year's tenancy, if he had carried on business for seven years, and if he was wise enough at certain times to give notice to the landlord that he required a renewal of his tenancy, a fact that is not at all known to many of the tenants in this country.  But remember this, that it is only since that Act was passed, where the landlord serves a notice to quit, that the tenant can claim his rights under that Act.  As I mentioned before, thousands of notices to quit were served between 1923 and 1926.  According to decisions, all those people are statutory tenants.  They <Col N="359" /> cannot claim under the Landlord and Tenant Act because the landlord now does not claim possession.  Therefore, they do not come within that Act at all.  A cute landlord can keep them at bay as regards that Act.  Whereas other people are protected, and have got their rights under that Act, numerous people are not given the benefit of the Act of 1931.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>Here is the opinion which I have been quoting:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;In no previous Rent Restrictions Act or amendment of same are there any such words as &lsquo;which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld&rsquo; in reference to the landlord's consent to assigning or subletting either. These words do occur in the Landlord and Tenant Act, but the two Acts are not in any way analogous. They treat with different matters. In the Landlord and Tenant Act you are dealing with cases where there are leases or long terms in question, apart from the Act altogether.  Consequently, the tenant would naturally have some interest in assigning <Col N="361" /> the premises when there is still a part of the original term to run, but in the case of the Rent Restrictions Act and in this new Bill there is no period of time to run in connection with the existing letting, and nothing to assign except the artificial legal period made or granted by the Rent Restrictions Acts themselves.</P>
    <P>Section 40 in the new Bill provides that the tenant is not to receive any purchase money in assigning the premises.  That, of course, shows that he should not be allowed to assign, which shows that he has no financial interest in the premises beyond his own tenancy, and if the Bill is allowed to stand as it is, with the words &lsquo;which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld&rsquo; in it, it would be giving him a direct interest in assigning the premises.  It would then be practically impossible to prevent his selling his interest for money, even though the receiving of the money is forbidden, as it would be impossible to know when he did receive cash or other consideration for the transfer.</P>
    <P>It is understood the Rent Acts are passed to protect tenants themselves, to secure them against unfair increases or to prevent them being unfairly ejected, but there is no reason whatever, morally or legally, why they should be given the right to assign to another person the tenure which they have in the premises under the Rent Acts.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In other words, if those words are allowed to stand, having regard to the manner in which the court has at all times interpreted the meaning of those words, the last trace of the landlord's interest in the premises will disappear. This provision is being inserted for the first time in a Rent Restrictions Act, an Act which, as stated already, deals with rent restrictions and not with the relations between landlord and tenant as set out in the Landlord and Tenant Act, 1931.  Take the case of a tenant who arrives at a time when he himself wishes to leave the premises.  It may be because of old age, or for one of various other reasons.  A friend comes along and says: &ldquo;I would like to go in there&rdquo;, and there is some suggestion <Col N="362" /> that if the landlord's consent can be obtained he will not see him short at Christmas or some other period, and the Act is then got round in a manner which nobody can prevent.  The condition is that the landlord's consent is to be obtained, and here is a provision that the landlord must not unlawfully withhold his consent.  The tenant then goes to the court.  I am advised that the effect of this is that practically all sales will cease.  The last right of the landlord disappears.  This is a matter which is going to affect, amongst other people, members of the legal profession. As Senator O'Dea seems to be opposed to this sort of thing, I wonder what the Law Society will do as a matter of discipline when they come to hear that he is objecting to an amendment such as this.  It certainly is not going to be in the interests of the profession.  Something similar applies to auctioneers, although I would not say that Senator Quirke would be interested in this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamQuirke" hpid="Mr. Quirke Mr. Quirke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quirke</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not suggest, nor do I think that anybody else would suggest, that any Senator here would put his own personal interests before the interests of the general public, and I think that Senator O'Dea should also protest against such a suggestion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. P. O'Reilly Mr. P. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that Senator P.J. O'Reilly meant it in that way.  I think he only made the remark in a humorous way, and it is so seldom that Senator P.J. O'Reilly displays a sense of humour, that I think we should forgive him on this occasion.</P>

      <P>I am thankful to my namesake for coming to my rescue. I used the words mentioned by Senator Quirke in what I intended to be a humourous sense, but I now see that it is dangerous to display a sense of humour here.  On previous occasions when trying to put across a little humour I got very little encouragement either.  I think, however, that the display of a little humour occasionally would do no harm.  Perhaps after this explanation I may be allowed to indulge in this line a little bit more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I look upon this amendment as the most vital one submitted.  I am advised to that effect by others and I believe <Col N="363" /> it myself.  The Minister has stated that he wants to keep within the provisions of the previous Rent Restrictions Acts as far as possible.  In this connection here is another bit of humour which I hope the Minister will forgive.  May I tender the advice given by someone: &ldquo;Stick close to your desk and never go to sea.&rdquo; I am afraid, however, that the Minister has already gone to sea when he inserted the line in this Bill which the amendment seeks to have deleted. In this way he has entered on very dangerous waters.  He has imperilled the whole Act and changed its character. That is why I submit that the amendment should be accepted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LouisODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I may say that, as a matter of fact, I have no personal interest in this matter.  I have only one case of a tenancy, and that is likely to last much longer than I will, but I do not know why Senator P.J. O'Reilly was advised in this way. This applies to every lease, covenant or agreement&mdash;I have not got the right part of the section of the former Act &mdash;but it is sub-section (2) of that section, which is to the effect that it shall be unreasonable to withhold a reasonable sum in respect of such sum as may have been incurred by the tenant in respect of such expenses as may have been incurred by him, if there has been agreement or consent on the part of the landlord.  In other words, what the tenant has to do now, in the case of any lease, is to ask the landlord to consent to such a provision, and if the landlord refuses and goes to court, and if the court says that that is unreasonable, the matter is dealt with in that way.  This Bill is only following the wording of the section in the original Act.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. P. O'Reilly Mr. P. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>The words which Senator P.J. O'Reilly wants to have deleted were inserted with the consent of the Dáil, and I take it that the Dáil wanted these words inserted as a direction from the Oireachtas to the Legislature.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>If Senator O'Dea would look at lines 12 and 13 on this page, I think he will find that so far as they are consistent with this Bill, it <Col N="364" /> is more or less on the lines of the 1931 Act.  I am not quite sure whether the 1931 Act would, in fact, govern these matters&mdash;I would have to consider the Interpretation Act before I would be as positive in my view as the Senator has been in his.  Passing from that, however, my real difficulty is that I am afraid if these words are left in, or if a situation is permitted to exist which these words seem to employ, the evil to which I have already referred will remain, and it will be practically impossible to prove whether a statutory tenant is getting a hand-over or not for the tenancy.  I am afraid that if this is left in you will have the situation remaining in which &ldquo;key money&rdquo; will be there underground, and that the really poor tenant who has not a lump sum of money to put down will be left in the position that he cannot get possession of a tenancy.  The position will be that it will be very difficult for such a tenant because the out-going statutory tenant knows that he cannot, legally, demand &ldquo;key money&rdquo;, and the incoming tenant, knowing about that, realises that he cannot get possession unless he is prepared to put down a lump sum for &ldquo;key money&rdquo;.  Therefore, the person who cannot afford to put down that money cannot get the tenancy, and you will have the same kind of underground business going on all the time.</P>

      <P>If you pass away from the law, there is very little to be done about the matter.  As Senator Sweetman has pointed out there is very little to be done in the case of people passing money from one to the other, underground, so to speak.  I am not a lawyer, but it seems to me that it is just the same as the black market: the fellow who buys the stuff at an exorbitant price is just as bad as the fellow who sells it, and the receiver is as bad or worse than the thief.</P>

      <P>Everyone present will at once agree with Senator Quirke when he says that unless the laws are respected very little can be done.  It is equally true, however, to say that the laws should be designed so as to make it as easy as possible to comply with them.  If this amendment is accepted it will make it more difficult for people to evade the law.  I remember being in Switzerland some years ago and being told that it was very rare for a single case of larceny to occur.  I often wondered if that was due to the very fine character of the people or due to the efficiency of the laws.  I think the two, more or less, work together. It certainly makes it more difficult to have evasion of the laws.  That, in addition to the other point, is a strong recommendation for this proposal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be glad if the Minister would explain the paragraph in sub-section (4).  As it originally stood a tenant could not assign statutory premises.  Now he can.  Why it was changed is not clear to me.  Anybody with any experience knows that if you say to a tenant that he cannot do it without the consent of the landlord, the latter cannot refuse unreasonably except in very exceptional circumstances, such as the carrying on of improper or extremely noisy business or an injury to the neighbourhood. We know from experience that that means that the landlord cannot refuse consent.  But why have the right to assign to someone else?  If there is the right to assign he might as well have the right to sell.  I think Senator O'Dea's case has something in it.  If there is nothing of value why give the right to assign?  If there is the right to assign should there not be the right to receive something for it?  The whole case here is that when the State creates a statutory tenancy it is simply protecting a man against hardship. It is not intended to have any money value.  But here we are giving a money value which he can assign to someone else.  If he cannot receive money why give him the right to assign?</P>

Clause (b) does not say &ldquo;may&rdquo; but &ldquo;shall not assign without the consent of the landlord&rdquo;, and later we added &ldquo;which shall not be unreasonably withheld&rdquo;.  If a landlord unreasonably withheld his consent, a tenant had the right to go to the courts to decide whether consent was unreasonably withheld.  There was a very long debate in the Dáil and I was satisfied that there was no reason why it should not be brought into line with the section in the Landlord and Tenant Act of 1931 quoted by Senator O'Dea.

      <P>Supposing a landlord has a house let to a man, who is not his employee but is the employee of a company with which he is intimately associated, and that the tenant decides to leave the area.  The company wishes to put another employee from somewhere in the neighbourhood into the house, which is not held by virtue of the employment, because the landlord is not the actual employer.  That appears clearly to be a case in which it is reasonable enough for the landlord to say that he wants to give the house to another tenant of the same type.  In such circumstances, I should like some direction from the Minister as to whether a case like that comes within the section.  It appears to me that it is not the ordinary direct employment which restricts possession, but that that is a case for which provision <Col N="368" /> should be made, especially in these days, when a good deal of business is carried on by way of private company, when ownership is different.  Frankly, I do not see what benefit is conferred on a tenant by being entitled to assign premises, unless he is going to get something for doing so. Unless he is going to get something for it, I cannot see what benefit he obtains.  If the Minister could explain what benefit he is going to get, without getting key money or the premium which he is prohibited from getting, I should find it easier to understand the form in which this paragraph is drawn.  As drawn originally, it was absolute sense.  Even though the Minister has told us who suggested it in its present form, I am afraid it does not mean anything.</P>
