      <P>It is with the greatest regret that I announce to the House the death last night of Senator John T. Keane.</P>
      <P>Senator Keane had only been a comparatively brief period with us but, since he became a member, he had commended himself to us all by his pleasantness of manner and his sincerity. He had taken a prominent part in the National movement in his native county and had served that county well in his public activities. With the assent of the House, I shall convey to his widow and family the expression of our deep sympathy.</P>

    <Title>Land Bill, 1945&mdash;Report and Final Stages.</Title>
    <P>The following amendments by Senator Sweetman were on the Order Paper:&mdash;</P>
    <P>1. In page 3, Section 2, paragraph (b), subparagraph (v), after the word &ldquo;purchaser&rdquo; in line 3, to insert the word &ldquo;and&rdquo;; and to delete the words &ldquo;and that the purchaser has failed to comply with the direction&rdquo; in lines 4 and 5.</P>
    <P>2. In page 3, Section 2, paragraph (b), to add at the end of the paragraph a new subparagraph as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(vi) a certificate under the Common Seal of the Land Commission certifying that the purchaser has failed to comply with a direction under this section shall be <i>prima facie</i> evidence for all purposes of the fact so certified.</P>
    <P>3. In page 3, Section 2, paragraph (b), to add at the end of the paragraph a new subparagraph as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1758" /> (vi) for the purposes of this section, the phrase &ldquo;to reside&rdquo; shall mean to use, sleep in and occupy the dwelling-house concerned as the normal and sole home and abode of the allottee.</P>

      <P>Amendments Nos. 1, 2 and 3 hang together.  In our discussions on the last day, we were agreed that it was only after adequate definition of the word &ldquo;residence&rdquo; that it would be possible to have the certificate of the Land Commission limited in the way suggested in the then amendment.  With the permission of the House, therefore, I propose to deal with the three amendments together.</P>
      <P>Agreed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>We discussed this matter at some length on the last occasion and I do not propose to weary the House by going over the same ground.  The dangerous provision is paragraph (5) of clause (b) of Section 2.  The certificate of the Land Commission, under that paragraph, is to be conclusive, in the first place, of the fact that a direction was given to the allottee to reside on the holding. With that, I am in entire agreement. That is a purely administrative act and I see no reason to query it.  In the second place, the clause provides that the certificate of the Land Commission shall be conclusive that the direction given to the allottee has not been revoked.  Again, that is an entirely administrative matter and one with which it is entirely unnecessary to deal. In the third place, it is provided that the certificate of the Land Commission shall be absolutely conclusive and binding on the allottee and on the courts that the allottee had not carried out the direction to reside on the holding. It is having regard to that provision that these amendments are framed, so as to make it incumbent on the Land Commission, and possible for the allottee, to discuss in court whether or not these are the facts.  As the section is phrased at the moment, the Land Commission are not only, so to speak, prosecuting counsel but they are also judge and jury.  I suggest that that is a bad principle of law.  So long as you have that principle, no matter <Col N="1759" /> how just the decision may be&mdash;the House will recollect that, on the last occasion, I admitted freely that, in my experience, the Land Commission had not been unjust in dealing with these matters&mdash;you will not have that facade of justice which is as absolutely essential as justice itself if you are to have an ordered community and a self-satisfied community, so ordered.  The effect of the amendments is that the Land Commission would go to the court and hand in their certificate in evidence stating that the allottee had not complied with the direction given to reside on the holding.  The court would then call on the allottee and the allottee would have an opportunity of showing, if he could, that he had complied with the Land Commission's direction.  If that were done, the Land Commission would then have an opportunity of putting forward further evidence to show that the evidence offered by the allottee was not, in fact, true but was misconceived.  They could show that Land Commission inspectors had gone to the holding on such and such a date and such and such a date and that there had been no sign of life about the house or the farmyard, as there would be if they were being used. In order that the court may determine the matter on a reasonable basis, it is, of course, necessary to define the word &ldquo;reside&rdquo;.  In amendment No. 3, I have suggested a definition, which is, I think, sufficiently stringent and restrictive to make certain that it meets the very proper idea in the mind of the Land Commission that people for whom houses have been built should occupy those houses. If the House would be good enough to look at the wording of amendment 3, it will see that &ldquo;to reside&rdquo; is there defined as meaning &ldquo;to use, sleep in and occupy the dwelling-house concerned as the normal and sole home of the allottee&rdquo;.  It appears to me that that is about as stringent and restrictive as a definition could be and therefore it seems that the Land Commission could scarcely say that a definition so phrased was so wide as to enable allottees to escape the net.  I have no doubt that, if the Minister is opposing this amendment&mdash;and he has not said <Col N="1760" /> so yet&mdash;he will do so on the ground that the Land Commission inspectors go through the holding from time to time on various occasions before they throw a man out on the side of the road and that it is not possible for them to ascertain anything more than that there was nobody living there on a particular day or days.</P>
      <P>A very valuable suggestion in regard to that was made to me by another member of the House outside, that it should be possible for the Land Commission to make arrangements with the Department of Justice so that the local Gárdaí would be available to give evidence as to whether the man was using the place as his normal and sole home.  It would not be very much trouble for the Gárda on patrol round that area to drop in from time to time and find out whether the allottee was really living there.  Even without that, in a country area everybody knows the position and the Guards know very quickly if Paddy Murphy is really residing on the holding or living with his mother four miles away and coming to the holding only on a day when somebody gives him the wink that the inspector has been seen in the neighbourhood. All the difficulty could be overcome by reasonable co-operation between the Land Commission and the Department of Justice.</P>
      <P>I suggest seriously that the House should not accept the view that it is impossible to frame legislation which will deal with the genuine case merely because of the difficulty of proof.  We are completely united in making certain that people who have been given houses, erected for them at the public expense, are made give them up or live in them and utilise them properly. There is a risk that we might put a man out of his house and home on to the side of the road without a full and complete investigation by an independent authority; and that risk, however small people may think it may be, is one that should not be taken when there is another avenue open, as I have indicated in these three amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Minister will see his way to accept these amendments. I am sure he is not going to make the case that they are put down <Col N="1761" /> to obstruct the Land Commission in discharging the obligations which this Bill will put upon them.  Senator Sweetman had no such intention, nor has any member of the House any desire to restrict the activities of the Land Commission when they get these powers.  However, it is of fundamental importance, even from the point of view of the Land Commission, to assure the public that, in their administration, they have exhausted all possibilities in order to establish the facts of the case. It would be very unpleasant experience indeed to find that they had carried out the equivalent of dispossessing a man of a home which had been given to him and had left the impression in the minds of people that they may have acted on information which was not completely and absolutely correct and sound in every particular.</P>
      <P>Doubtless, there will be cases where the facts may not be too clear and nothing is better, from the point of view of the prestige of the Land Commission itself, than to challenge any of these alleged defaulters to go to the court.  That is the desirable course, though it may take a little more time. That would be a challenge to the man and to those who would defend him, to his friends or to people who might go even to the extreme of becoming law breakers in his defence, to go into court and prove that the facts were not as the Land Commission held they were.  From that point of view, this is the sort of amendment which the Minister should accept.  It would make sure that he would never be open to attack from right or left for having done something he could not stand over before any judicial authority.  In cases which must be, for a number of reasons, difficult and highly sensitive, it is very important that every possibility be exhausted, in order that the Land Commission may establish that its decisions have been equitable.  I hope the Minister will see it from that point of view and accept the amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TheodoreMoore" hpid="Mr. Kingsmill Moore Mr. Kingsmill Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kingsmill Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the Committee Stage, I have had an opportunity of re-reading a rather important report which was made in a neighbouring country and which the Minister will recognise when I call it the Donoghmore <Col N="1762" /> Report.  It was made to the British House of Parliament on Delegated Legislation and the delegation of judicial and semi-judicial functions to Ministers and Ministerial Departments. One of the points on which the Commission was unanimous was that, where a Department was given power to decide judicially or semi-judicially a point in which they were interested, only a bad Department could decide the question fairly.  A cynical Minister or a cynical Department would be able to approach the question with complete dispassionateness, but a Department really keen on carrying out its own job, and a Minister imbued with the spirit of his Department, would inevitably approach the question from a point of view which would be objectively biased, though from his own attitude it would be subjectively fair.</P>
      <P>I think that position would apply to any decisions given by the Land Commission in a matter such as this.  I have no doubt whatsoever that the officials and inspectors, in making decisions, would not for one moment be guilty of any conscious unfairness. Their very keenness and anxiety to get the thing done as well as possible must inevitably create a slightly one-sided and biased outlook.  The better the man, the more keen he is to get the job done, the more he will suffer from that unconscious bias.  The House must remember that, if there is a bias of which you are conscious, you can guard against it, that there is very little danger in the case of people who have a conscious bias, as they know of it; but if you have an unconscious bias it is one against which you cannot guard, for the very reason that it is unconscious. Lawyers have laid down, and statesmen have recognised, that no one should be put in the position of attempting to decide a thing judicially when all his desires and interests are on one side and when his outlook is inevitably coloured.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, that is the position in which people who give certificates of this nature are inevitably put.  I have no objection to a <i>prima facie</i> certificate, but I have every objection to it being a conclusive one, because if it is to be conclusive it means that the person <Col N="1763" /> who gives it will have to divorce himself from the interests of his office and attempt to look at it in a way which is impossible for a really keen administrator.  I strongly support the amendment.  Although the certificate may be <i>prima facie</i> and would be accepted in nine cases out of ten, I still think there should be an opportunity of going to the courts, both in the interests of the Department itself and in the interests of the people against whom such a certificate may be given.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoylan" hpid="Minister for Lands (Mr. Moylan) Seán Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Lands (Mr. Moylan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no doubt of the good intentions of Senator Sweetman.  I am reminded by Senator Baxter's support of Senator Sweetman of the old saying: &ldquo;The Lord preserve us from our friends.&rdquo;  I had no suspicions of Senator Sweetman's attitude, but when I heard that Senator Baxter is prepared to give him a character I began to get slightly suspicious, especially when Senator Sweetman used the old phrase that it is better that the three amendments should hang together rather than hang separately, I suppose.  There is something in that unconscious bias.  It is a good thing to know it is there.  Most of us do not recognise, of course, that we suffer from it, the members of the Seanad particularly.  I am not a cynical person, nor do I think the Land Commission is a cynical Department.  As I have often pointed out to the Seanad, it suffers itself from a particular defect. The Seanad is perfectionist, but we in the Land Commission are not.  We do not ever look for, or hope for, perfection in the allottees, it is so difficult to get suitable allottees even allowing for their various faults, the Land Commission will be more than slow in dispossessing any allottee.</P>
      <P>There is such a clamour for land, there are so many tricks, shall we say for want of a better word, utilised by these applicants to secure tenancies, that when the Land Commission does secure an allottee that in any way reasonably meets his commitments, it grasps him in its arms and retains him in spite of the many and various faults that he may have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill is directed entirely against <Col N="1764" /> people for whom the Seanad have no more use than I have, people who have got land as a gift from the State, a gift to which very definite commitments were attached.  In spite of every effort on the part of the Department authorised to deal with these people, they have failed to meet in any way their commitments.</P>
    <P>Senator Sweetman said that he did not wish to bore the Seanad by going over all the arguments that have been used in the debate on this Bill.  If I were to speak at length on it, I would be merely repeating what I have already said.  The Land Commission does not regard itself as a punitive body or instrument.  Its real purpose is to implement State benevolence.  It is because you must take men as you find them and try to make them what you would wish, that we have to take men who are not by any means perfect for our purpose.  We try to do the best we can with them under all conditions. I said before that this Bill is directed at a very definite evil.  We have here an evil which is confined within a limited circle, and the purpose of the Bill is to deal with people who are doing harm to the fabric of this State. The body that is authorised to deal with them is the one that has the greatest amount of experience, and, if I may say so, it has achieved and retained the highest character in its dealings with those people.  That body is the Land Commission.</P>
    <P>Now, in an ordinary case of contract, it is only right that both parties to the contract shall have full access to the courts.  This particular case is entirely different.  Here are people for whom houses have been built at the public expense who sometimes refuse to live in them&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>That is begging the question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;and who, at the best of times, make the pretence of living in the houses.  The Land Commission inspectors, as I have said, visit these houses at different periods of the day. Different inspectors visit them, and their neighbours write in anonymous letters about them.  They never will, of course come forward as good citizens <Col N="1765" /> and give direct evidence.  In regard to some things a knowledge of a departure from right is quite clear, but yet it is difficult to prove that in court.  In view of that we might, of course, take the attitude that we had no evidence that would be accepted in court against those people, and, therefore, we might say that they must go free.  That would seem to be the attitude of the Seanad. In general, it is correct.  But here are people&mdash;again I must repeat myself&mdash; who are beneficiaries of the State with certain commitments imposed on them because of the gifts they have received at the expense of the nation.  Time and again inspectors of the Department, who are concerned in dealing with them, visit their houses.  They find that there is not a mouse stirring in any of the houses&mdash;no animal or bird of any kind.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>What I want to convey is that decisions in court are made by the judge on the bare facts he has before him.  I suggest&mdash;and I do not think it needs any explanation for Senator Baxter&mdash;that the Land Commission has a much deeper knowledge of the facts associated with all these cases than ever comes out in court. They know a good many of the repercussions that cannot be brought forward in evidence.  Under the 1923 Act the allottee is supposed to work his holding to the satisfaction of the Land Commission and not to the satisfaction of anybody else but the Land Commission. It is only reasonable to argue that a man for whom a house has been built on land, who will not live on the land and who will try to deceive in every way the Land Commission by making a pretence of living on it&mdash;that such a man cannot meet his commitments under the 1923 Act of working his holding to the satisfaction of the Land Commission.  As a beneficent body, the Land Commission is not inclined to punish these people in any way and this Bill is not directed towards punishment but directed towards reform.</P>
      <P>We ask the Seanad to give us the power to deal with this, that or the other man who is an allottee and who is not residing in his house in accordance with his agreement and to the satisfaction of the Land Commission. The form of words given us by Senator Sweetman is perfect.  It is a perfect description of residence, but a form of words will not meet the case, unfortunately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's objection in the other House was that there could not be a perfect form of words.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>A perfect form of words that will give us authority and power to deal with these people who are <Col N="1767" /> recalcitrant&mdash;that is my argument.  I think whether they hang separately or together, they must hang.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel towards the Minister exactly as he feels towards Senator Sweetman.  I have confidence in his sincerity in regard to this matter. I am even prepared to accept his word that when he says he felt a certain nervousness in facing the lawyers that, as he pointed out before, there is no cynicism in his nature.  I still think, however, that without accusing him of cynicism he largely evaded the principles that are behind the amendments.  He said that the people whom this Bill was intended to deal with were people for whom the Seanad had no more sympathy than he had. That is agreed.  His answer is that because there is a difficulty you are to give to a Department of State the final decision.  He argues that these people will be treated almost as if they were in swaddling clothes and that they are placed in the hands of the most reasonable Department that ever existed.  He seems to think that has something to do with the principle underlying the amendment.</P>
      <P>I suggest that for the purpose of considering the merits of this amendment the Land Commission have all the infallibility they can have, and the question of their merits or how they will deal with the matter will not arise.  I am strongly of the opinion, however, that it is not wise nor is it a good principle to introduce, that the final decision in a matter of this kind should be left to a Department of State.  I know you may say there are other cases.  I know there are similar cases and that there is a tendency in that direction, but on every occasion when that principle arose I have opposed it.  If I did not it is because I overlooked it.  I am strongly of the opinion in this case that the three amendments proposed by Senator Sweetman would provide the Department with as good an assurance as they could possibly get in law&mdash;that where they had a case they would have very little difficulty in proving it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1768" /> The Minister says that a judge could only decide on the facts before him.  I am puzzled by that statement because it does not seem to me that the Land Commission can decide otherwise than on the facts before them, and I do not believe that they would decide otherwise. What else could they have but the facts before them unless they had whispers or rumours, which I do not think they will deal with.  It is a question of whether the Land Commission or the judge in the last instance can decide the facts before them. Under these amendments I think the Land Commission will be placed in a much stronger position.  If they decide that the allottee had vacated his holding and if he appealed against that then unless I am wrong&mdash;and I am not a lawyer&mdash;it seems that the allottee would have to satisfy the judge that he resided within the meaning of the definition in this amendment, that is that he lives and sleeps in and occupies the dwelling-house concerned as his normal and sole home and abode.</P>
    <P>I cannot conceive of a case where the allottee could prove that to the satisfaction of the judge and where the Land Commission would have any grievance.  Frankly, I do not believe there would ever be a case taken by the Land Commission in which the allottee could prove that because the Land Commission would jolly well know and be in a position to find out if that were so.  Here is a principle introduced in a Bill which I think is fundamental and one which the Seanad should not acquiese in.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LouisODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder would the Minister compromise on these amendments. With regard to the first amendment which suggests leaving out certain words, it would not be so important to leave out these words if the second amendment were accepted and make the Order of the Land Commis- <i>prima facie</i> evidence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>But the first amendment gives only consequential words, if the second amendment is accepted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LouisODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>It says that it shall be evidence not alone that the direction was given to the purchaser but that <Col N="1769" /> the direction has not been revoked and that the purchaser has failed to comply with the direction.  Could we leave out the words &ldquo;the purchaser has failed to comply with the direction.&rdquo; I do not think there would be any harm in having it as evidence that the purchaser has failed to comply with the direction because I presume that the certificate will be given a very short time before proceedings are instituted. It would be given where the purchaser has failed to reside in the dwelling-house.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know that the Land Commission will treat each allottee with very great consideration.  That will make it all the more difficult for them to decide.  They will have reports from their own inspectors.  It is very difficult for a public authority to turn down the reports of its own inspectors.  If they do not accept an inspector's recommendations, their action will look as if it were a vote of lack of confidence in the inspector.  It will be very hard for the Land Commission to do that.  The certificate is to be conclusive and the allottee can offer no defence in court when the case comes into court afterwards. The words are used here, &ldquo;shall recover possession&rdquo;.  I suppose that refers to recovery of possession by process of law, so that the case will have to come into court in any event if the allottee refuses to give up possession.  Why should there not be an opportunity, then, to offer evidence? It is for the allottee to give the evidence.  If the certificate is <i>prima facie</i> evidence, it is evidence for all purposes unless evidence is given to contradict it and show that it is wrong. The onus will be on the allottee and it will be a very strong onus.  He would not only have to give evidence himself but he would have to bring some of his neighbours to prove that he was actually residing in the place and that the certificate should never have been issued.  It is difficult for inspectors to decide these matters.  They will get anonymous letters from people anxious, perhaps, to get the holding of the allottee.  Their letters may contain untrue statements.  When the inspector calls, the allottee may be working in a bog a long distance off and he may find no sign of life about the place.  Taking <Col N="1770" /> that state of affairs in conjunction with the letters he had received, the inspector would be justified in reporting that the man was not residing on the holding.</P>
    <P>I do not know what the procedure after that would be.  I suppose the matter would go to the commissioners. The commissioners would be in the awkward position that they would not like to turn down their own inspectors. There will, therefore, be a certain amount of compulsion on them to make the order.  At the same time they will be slow to make it.  It would be easier to make if they knew that it would be only <i>prima facie</i> and not conclusive evidence.  I think that the second amendment should be accepted and that the other two amendments should be withdrawn.</P>

      <P>I cannot see why the Minister would not accept the words &ldquo;<i>prima facie</i>&rdquo; instead of the word &ldquo;conclusive&rdquo; because, by doing so, he would be giving away nothing, so long as the words remain in Section 2 (a) (1) &ldquo;to the satisfaction of the Land Commission&rdquo;.  The purchaser must reside continuously to their satisfaction in the dwelling-house.  Senator O'Dea has stated that a person against whom proceedings are instituted may call in his neighbours to prove that he is residing in the house.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LouisODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  What I said was that, if the amendment were accepted and if the certificate were only <i>prima facie</i> evidence, then the allottee would have an opportunity of calling evidence to prove that he was residing in the house.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Assuming that the amendment is accepted, the neighbours can prove nothing because of the phrase &ldquo;to the satisfaction of the Land Commission&rdquo;.  Senator Sweetman's definition is worthless because the Land Commission must be satisfied that the person resides in the dwelling-house. The Land Commission are the final judges of fact under the Bill. Before bringing in this amendment, making the certificate only <i>prima facie</i> evidence, the words &ldquo;to the satisfaction of the Land Commission&rdquo; should have been deleted.  It appears <Col N="1771" /> to me that it is a matter of tweedle-dum and tweedledee whether the words &ldquo;<i>prima facie</i>&rdquo; or the word &ldquo;conclusive&rdquo; go into the Bill because, if a certificate is given that the purchaser failed to comply with the direction, that direction, even if merely <i>prima facie</i> evidence, cannot be rebutted by anybody so long as the Land Commission are not satisfied that the purchaser resided continuously in the house.</P>
      <P>Therefore, in my opinion, the Minister would be giving away nothing by agreeing to the insertion of the words &ldquo;<i>prima facie</i>&rdquo; and Senator Sweetman would be gaining nothing by their insertion. The only advantage is that there is a strong dislike in legislatures to a Department of State being the final judge of fact, apart altogether from any legislative powers given to it. But, in this Bill, we are giving the Land Commission power to determine facts, because the Bill provides that the person must reside continuously in the dwelling-house to the satisfaction of the Land Commission.  If he resided there even to the satisfaction of the judge, that would not be sufficient.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is very difficult to define &ldquo;residence&rdquo; because the word &ldquo;residence&rdquo; has a special meaning in reference to the Act in which it appears.  We have the word &ldquo;residence&rdquo; appearing in the Income Tax and other Acts.  The question of residence is a personal one. For example, it was held in England by a judge that a man who lived in a boat for twenty years resided in England, although the boat shifted about from time to time.  A person may have a residence even though he lives in a hotel and has no home, so to speak. In a number of Acts, the word &ldquo;residence&rdquo; is qualified by other words.  A person is said to be &ldquo;actually resident&rdquo;, &ldquo;ordinarily resident&rdquo; and &ldquo;temporarily resident&rdquo;.  The word has many shades of meaning but, in the end, the question is one of fact for the tribunal before which the question comes for decision.  Under the Income Tax Acts, the question of residence is one of fact for the Special Commissioners. Under this Bill, residence is to be not only impliedly but expressly <Col N="1772" />&ldquo;to the satisfaction of the Land Commission&rdquo;. In the operation of this Bill when it becomes an Act, it will, in my opinion, be immaterial whether the words &ldquo;<i>prima facie</i>&rdquo; or the word &ldquo;conclusive&rdquo; appear in the Act so long as the words &ldquo;to the satisfaction of the Land Commission&rdquo; remain. Therefore, I suggest that the Minister should accept the amendment.  He will be giving nothing away so long as the words &ldquo;to the satisfaction of the Land Commission&rdquo; remain.  Even though the certificate may be <i>prima facie</i> evidence that the purchaser has failed to obey the direction, it will be, for all practical purposes, conclusive, because no person&mdash;not even the judge&mdash;can say that a peson has resided in a house to the satisfaction of the Land Commission if the Land Commission itself says that the person did not reside there to its satisfaction.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I am inclined to think that the point made by Senator Ryan&mdash;that there should be a further consequential amendment deleting the words &ldquo;to their satisfaction&rdquo;&mdash;is probably correct.  The only reason I say &ldquo;probably&rdquo; is because, if his argument on these lines is correct, it is perfectly clear to me that paragraph (5) in clause (b) is meaningless.  If paragraph (5) is necessary then Senator Ryan's point falls completely to the ground.  If I may say it against myself, it is just as much Senator Ryan's point as a lawyer's point.  There is a principle at issue here clearly set forth in the amendment for the House to be able to understand and, of course, there is the underlying argument that, in a Legislative Assembly, when you decide a principle you make minor verbal alterations following this principle. That is not the way the Act must be construed after it is passed and signed and when it comes up in the courts for construction.  In the Legislative Assembly it must be on the lines on which the Assembly carries out its business.  So far as these amendments are concerned I agree that they must, as the Minister said, &ldquo;stand or hang together&rdquo;.  If these three amendments are passed it is a very simple matter to make a consequential verbal amendment in the <Col N="1773" /> other House when the Bill goes back there.  The real question at issue is a question of principle and the Minister and I are agreed on that point.  We are not tying ourselves to any verbal difference.  I must say I was very surprised when the Minister was prepared to accept the actual wording of the definition of &ldquo;residence&rdquo;, and as he has accepted this the only issue in principle is whether the allottee is going to get a chance of proving in court that the inspector of the Land Commission was incorrect.  It is entirely begging the question for the Minister to say that this section is only for the purposes of dealing with recalcitrant allottees.  If the allottee is recalcitrant in the manner in which the Minister suggests, the court will give the Land Commission their decree. But if, as pointed out by Senator O'Dea, the man is away on the bog when the inspector of the Land Commission is visiting the holding, he should get an opportunity of so stating in court and of leaving it to the judge to determine whether he or the Land Commission is correct.  I cannot accept the Minister's view that this is a provision that is going to be operated benevolently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1774" /> My view about such a principle is that we should never in legislation consider the personnel of the particular Department who are going to operate a measure.  I may fairly say that so far as this provision is concerned I am perfectly satisfied that the Minister himself and the personnel of the Land Commission are going to operate it satisfactorily and that they are not going to operate it unfairly.  But that is not the basis upon which legislation should be enacted.  The basis upon which legislation should be enacted is the restrictive basis that any Minister or any Department can be wicked if they got the chance.  I am not suggesting anything personal against the Minister or the Land Commission in making this statement.  But this is the basis on which legislation should be enacted, otherwise you are going to have the absolute power of the State overshadowing the rights of the individual.  That is the principle I am seeking to have established and I ask the House to support it.</P>

    <P>Amendment declared lost.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 4:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 3, Section 4, to add to the section a new sub-section as follows: (2) Before certifying under the preceding sub-section that the purchaser has not so worked the holding or parcel the Land Commission shall have regard to the amount of capital and the equipment possessed by the allottee at the time the holding or parcel was allotted to him.</P>
      <P>The object of the amendment is set out on its face.  I do not know how long some of the allottees may be in possession of some of these holdings.  It may be so long ago that they have forgotten, and so may the Land Commission. I believe that a number of these people may find themselves on the roadside due to this: that they were given holdings originally without any of the capital or equipment necessary to make these holdings a really workable proposition.  It is very hard to condemn a man to-day for weakness and faults that are really due to that original decision, because it was a fault to give a holding to a man who had neither the capital nor the equipment necessary to make the holding a success.  Anyone who has any experience of farming, large or small, can be quite satisfied that if a man does not get a proper start he would want to be a miracle worker to make a success of the undertaking.  I know some people can actually work miracles; others are expected to do it but failed&mdash;and that failure may come about because of circumstances being altogether too strong for the occupier and because of the fact that at the time the Land Commission transferred the land to these people they should have known that without these men getting a proper start they could not be expected to achieve success.  I think if that is not taken into account before a final decision is taken by the Land Commission, the Commission is doing less than justice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What you have got to do with people like that instead of putting them on the roadside is to put them in a position to work the holding.  It may be that some of them were very much older and less competent than others and that somebody else will have to be put in possession.  When these other people come along if they get the capital and equipment necessary they may be able <Col N="1777" /> to make a success where their predecessors failed, but I am convinced that the Land Commission will be doing less than justice if they put out on the road men who failed because they never got a decent start.  I say that that failure lay as much at the door of the Land Commission who put these people on the land originally as it did at the door of the occupier, of the man who got the holding.  The natural desire is to get possession of land in this country or any other country.  Men want to get possession of property, whatever use they will make of it.  I am not going to go into considerations which may have been weighed in arriving at decisions in relation to these people who were given holdings originally, but I think it is a lack of consideration and certainly not equitable to dispossess a man who was not able to start properly and whom you did not treat in the way others may be treated now when they get possession of a new holding.  These people are doing better than many who originally got possession of the holdings.  If these considerations were taken into account by the Land Commission I do not know how many cases would be influenced by them, and I hope the Minister will see his way to accept the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me that there is no necessity for such an amendment as this.  The section of the Bill is quite clear.  In practice the Land Commission take into account, not alone the matters which Senator Baxter wishes to provide in his amendment but they have taken into account every surrounding circumstance in regard to each case so as to avoid any injustice.  The Land Commission has held its hand from doing many things which it would be reasonable, right and just to do rather than adversely affect any allottee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Here again men get land and houses from the Land Commission as a gift of the people of the country.  There is attached to this gift certain commitments and every allottee who gets a holding from the Land Commission knows the conditions under which he gets it.  He gets no stock.  He gets the house and land and he is supposed to <Col N="1778" /> have sufficient capital and equipment to make it a going concern.  If he has not that he is getting the land under false pretences.  As Senator Baxter says, a great number of people in this country will do anything they can to get possession of land.  They will make every sort of statement possible to support an argument in favour of giving them land.  The Land Commission must make every effort it can to secure suitable applicants and in the great majority of cases the Land Commission succeeds.  There are bound to be failures in every activity of life.  I think that the Land Commission has succeeded and I want to insist again and again that this Bill is not a punitive measure.  It is a measure of reform.  There is no intention of taking punitive action against any man who is now holding land, but if he does not reform in the future then this Bill is the weapon for dealing with him.</P>
    <P>Certain powers would be taken from or not given to the Land Commission by the acceptance of these and other amendments and I think Senators are not quite logical in depriving or denying the Land Commission of these powers. If the principle embodied in the Bill was of general application I could understand the anxiety of Senators not to give the desired powers, but it is directed to an evil which is in a circumscribed area.  Senator Sweetman spoke some time ago on the question of restricting any type of personnel by legislation, but we have already given the Land Commission absolute powers to give the land.  The land is not given by the courts.  There is no court decision, and grievances are often expressed, as every Senator knows by people who do not get land&mdash;by applicants for land.</P>
    <P>Their grievances might be quite legitimate.  Many of them are, in fact, quite reasonable.  But you have given complete authority to the Land Commission to select applicants for land arbitrarily; there is no question of a court.  This amendment does nothing but emphasise the action the Land Commission will take.  There is no need for such an amendment.  It would be very wrong to give expression to this view in legislation because it would give an opportunity to many <Col N="1779" /> people to defeat the Land Commission in their attempt to get the land properly worked.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I find it difficult to see how this amendment would operate in practice.  What is at the back of Senator Baxter's mind is quite clear&mdash;that it is very unfair to blame allottees for not having done a job when they were not given the means to do that job.  I must confess that I agree with Senator Baxter that that would be unfair.  The objection is, quite frankly, an antecedent one.  The objection, as I see it, is that the Land Commission should not have alloted land to people who had no hope of working it.  It was unfortunate that that was done.  If he has done nothing else, Senator Baxter has drawn attention in this amendment to that fact and it is to be hoped that, as a result, there will not be a repetition of this action of giving land to people who cannot possibly work it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister says that what I am drawing attention to in this amendment will be present to the minds of the Land Commission in coming to a decision.  I am sure that the Minister is no less kind-hearted than I am.  He has a job of work to do.  A limited number of people are not using certain lands which they got, as he puts it, as a gift from the State, in the way in which it was intended they should use them.  I am not disputing the facts nor am I disputing the wisdom of the action being taken by the Land Commission in certain cases. Here, you have a number of people who have grown older since they got possession of this land.  Probably, they went into possession with high hopes. Presumably, they were men of spirit with not much means.  They were given possession of holdings and, from the word &ldquo;go&rdquo;. they were not equipped to work the holdings.  There is no question that there was an error of judgment on the part of the Land Commission. I agree that people will go to very great lengths to get possession of land from the Land Commission but the Minister cannot have it both ways.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not easy to hoodwink the Land Commission and I do not think that it <Col N="1780" /> was possible for allottees to persuade the Land Commission that they had possessions which they actually had not.  I do not think that any of those people got possession of land by persuading the Land Commission that they had deposits in the banks or stock to put on the holdings.  Perhaps the men had the conviction that they could make good.  Many of the men in possession of land and fully equipped who got holdings were broken since 1929 or 1930.  That was due to circumstances quite beyond their control.  Men who were less well-equipped to meet the onslaught of economic difficulties could hardly be expected to make good in circumstances in which abler men were worsted.  For the Land Commission to come in and dispossess a man now, to leave him on the roadside without adverting to the circumstances which existed when he got possession of the holding, is to put all the fault at the door of the allottee and to fail to advert to the failure of the Land Commission in its original decision.</P>
    <P>It is easy for a Department to wash its hands of failure.  I find no fault with the administration of the Land Commission.  Perhaps, I am less in contact with it than other Senators because it has less to do with the part of the country from which I come than it has to do with other parts.  Be that as it may, account must be taken of the fact that you have a limited number of persons who are now ten or 15 years older and less competent than they were when they got possession of these holdings.  They are to be dispossessed. I do not know what is to happen to them.  If they are to become the waifs and strays of society, you will be creating a problem.  There is a moral obligation on the Land Commission, before these people are dispossessed, to cast their minds back to the circumstances under which they obtained possession of the land and see whether or not they got a fair start. If they did not get a fair start, if they got land under conditions which made it impossible for them to be successful, all the responsibility for failure should not be placed at their door.  Some of the blame should be borne by the Land Commission.  Before the Land Commission put these men on the roadside, <Col N="1781" /> there is a moral obligation on them to consider that aspect of the problem. However, the Minister is not accepting that view.</P>

      <P>The Minister made no case against the amendment on the last occasion.  The point at issue is a very small one but a principle underlies it.  On the last occasion, the Minister said that there was no need for this amendment as the Land Commission would always do what it suggested.  If the Land Commission are to carry out the necessary steps, they should do so in pursuance of a statutory obligation so that they cannot change their minds at a later date.  In the Act of 1891 it is provided that the land certificate will be conclusive evidence of title except as by that Act is otherwise provided and except in so far as on the face of the land certificate is expressed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 38 of the Act of 1891 provides that where a holding has been added to another holding it need not be expressly stated on the face of the land certificate.  The Minister makes this point, that in land certificates in the future there would be a note added that the particular land in question would be subject to Section 38 of the <Col N="1782" /> Act of 1891.  I made the point that while I accepted this as being his intention, it could happen, even with the Land Commission, that a mistake could be made.  If, after a proper investigation, this certificate was not given, no solicitor and no lawyer and no competent person purchasing this particular holding could avoid getting a bad title.  No matter what investigation a solicitor went through on behalf of his client if the Land Commission certificate did not contain these words, even through a mistake, the people who purchased, maybe at a substantial price, could be put out the next day. Sub-section (2) of Section 6 declares that any assignment made in contravention of the section is void.  The Minister produced so many red herrings and begged the question so often on my first three amendments that the result is that what the House has done is completely chaotic.  I am trying to avoid the Minister drawing more red herrings and begging the question on this amendment.  Let us keep to this amendment.  I am entirely in agreement with the Minister that where land has been added to an uneconomic holding to make the holding economic, the holding should not be again subdivided. If it is, it means that there are two uneconomic holdings where there was only one originally.  We are all agreed on this principle.  It is only a question of the machinery to operate it and the machinery proposed by the Minister is quite satisfactory if carried out.  I fail to see why there would not be a statutory obligation on the Land Commission to carry it out and a statutory right for a person who purchases, if through error, the Land Commission fails to do what the Minister promises.  I suggest that if the Minister looks at it from this angle he cannot find any objection to this amendment.  All I am asking is that if a person buys without notice what is a consolidated holding, his rights should be preserved.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the Land Commission and the Minister should be able to take all the steps necessary to make sure that the purchaser has notice.  If he buys a consolidated holding after getting notice I have no patience with him, but where a purchaser buys in <Col N="1783" /> good faith without notice, there is no justification for the Land Commission saying that this man has a bad assignment and is liable to be put out of his land.</P>

      <P>I fear the Greeks when they bring gifts.  When Senator Sweetman kicks off by saying he is in entire agreement with the Minister I immediately see a red herring in his hands with which he proposes to disembowel me.  The principle is that where a man with an uneconomic holding applies to the Land Commission for an addition to the holding when land is being divided in his locality and is successful in his application, the Land Commission has achieved one of its main purposes of making uneconomic holdings economic by the addition of a certain amount of land. If permission is given to the man who gets the land, to sell immediately one portion of it, then instead of having made an uneconomic holding economic we have made two uneconomic holdings. I do not think that any great injustice can be done or even a minor injustice, but I can see that if the loopholes were permitted to continue a great many people might take advantage of them.  I said to Senator Kingsmill Moore on the last occasion that there is no reason why we should not try to make any case of injustice in a Bill right, unless through our trying to do so, a greater injustice is created.  In this particular case the Land Commission will take the first opportunity, and that will be an immediate one, of notifying the Land Registry to make the necessary endorsements on the papers concerned, and will, as far as is humanly possible, provide against the errors which Senator Sweetman fears.  I think that instead of any defective decision of the Land Commission he was more fearful that his legal colleagues might neglect to make the proper investigation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It appears that this section is for the purpose of restricting the purchaser in dealing with additional land given to the seller for the enlargement of his holding.  The original holding may be registered in the Land Registry, but the enlargement may not.  If the original holding is vested, then it ought to be easy to put on the folio some note of caution that would enable the purchaser of the <Col N="1786" /> original holding, which I presume would be sold with the enlargement, of the existence of the enlarged holding. It is usual, I think, to provide that where a holding is given to a purchaser, he cannot assign, sub-let, or sub-divide it without the consent of the Land Commission.</P>
      <P>This provides that he cannot assign, sub-let or sub-divide the additional holding or the additional land.  The difficulty may arise where the additional lands are registered with the Land Registry and the section applies in such a case.  The question then arises: how is the purchaser to know that this was additional land?  In theory, perhaps, the method suggested by Senator Sweetman would work, but it could never work in practice because the seven days' limit would be impossible, and it would be unfair to impose it on any Government Department.</P>
      <P>Senator Sweetman has said that the Revenue Commissioners can give a certificate within seven days that there is no income-tax due.  I do not agree with him, because I know it is the practice of the Revenue Commissioners when they receive an application for certificate, to look for some means of imposing income-tax, and I know that certificates have been held up for months while the Revenue Commissioners proceeded to see how they could assess income-tax.  It looks all right in theory, but it does not work out in practice.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the compromise. His amendment would make sub-section (2) read as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Every assignment, transfer, sub-letting or sub-division in contravention of sub-section (1) of this section shall be void, except as against a <i>bona fide</i> purchaser for value who had no notice that any additional land had been provided by way of enlargement.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is clear that the amendment can apply only to transfers.  It cannot apply to sub-letting, because the <i>bona fide</i> purchaser will not be concerned with these matters.  I wonder are there <Col N="1787" /> many <i>bona fide</i> purchasers for value who would be in the dark as to the exact position, because if a person is selling land, I think it is his duty, when he receives a requisition on title, to make inquiries in the Land Commission and if necessary, to send his town agent to ascertain the exact position.</P>
    <P>I think the onus is on the landlord to satisfy the purchaser that the purchaser is not in danger of buying something against which there is a statutory inhibition.  While, in theory, Senator Sweetman's amendment may be all right, I do not think that anybody will suffer injustice if the amendment is not inserted in the Bill.  I do not think there was any danger of that.</P>

      <P>If it is a vested holding a note can easily be put on the folio in the local registry of title and there can be no dealings on the land without reference to the Land Commission.  It would be easy to ascertain whether the additional land can be given or not.  Looking at the section I cannot say that I know the meaning of the word &ldquo;provided&rdquo;.  The Land Commission provide for the addition of land to a tenant's holding before they actually give him the addition.  They must, first of all, provide it.  After they provide it, they convey the fact to him at some future time that he is getting the land. According to the wording of this section, if the Land Commission have taken a portion of land for a particular person and have provided that land for him, <Col N="1788" /> although having given him no notice, then if that man sells his original holding, the sale would be null and void.  It is all very well for Senator Ryan to say that the duty is on the vendor to show good title.  It is, but the trouble is that, if the vendor gets hold of the money and disposes of it before the sale is declared null and void, it means that the purchaser has lost both land and money.  That would be a very unfortunate position.</P>

      <P>On the amendment itself, I do not approve of the words &ldquo;without notice to the purchaser&rdquo;. That would seem to imply that somebody is bound to give notice.  The Land Commission is not so bound, so from whom must the notice come?  I would prefer the words &ldquo;without knowledge and who could not have had knowledge of the fact&rdquo;.  Something should be done to provide for the danger that Senator Sweetman has contemplated.  I do not know now when it could be done.  There is also a difficulty about the word &ldquo;provide&rdquo;. If notice is not given, he could easily say: &ldquo;I am not getting additional land.&rdquo;  Then application has to be made to the Land Commission and it would be very hard for the Land Commission to know within a certain time. The position is that a scheme is made by the local inspector and is sent to the commissioners.  It is approved or disapproved. I suppose it is made out in duplicate, as otherwise it would be very hard for the Land Commission to notify within the time.  Some provision should be made and I do not know when the Minister can do it, if he does not do it now.</P>

      <P>This Section is in operation since the Land Act of 1939 and the change in the law now is to make it retrospective.  If it were not there, any man who had a vested holding could sell his holding immediately he had an addition made to it.  This would create a position which we must try to avoid. The Land Commission proposes to take the point of view expressed here in the previous debate, that is, to try to get in a note on the folio as quickly as possible Naturally, I expect that a <Col N="1789" /> solicitor doing his duty and trying to protect his client will make application for information in regard to the matter to the Land Commission and to the Land Registry; but there cannot be, under the new circumstances, any tremendous delay in getting the particular note on the folio, and that will be done.</P>
      <P>I am not so sure that people will pay away money easily, particularly under the direction of a solicitor, without being sure of their ground in regard to these things.  I have not such a bad opinion of solicitors as Senator Sweetman appears to think I have. Every effort will be made to provide information as swiftly as possible for solicitors and their clients.  We cannot make provision for everything.  It is not possible even for Senator Baxter to interpret Senator Sweetman for me, nor is it possible for Senator Ryan to do so.</P>

Then it may transpire that the Land Commission made a mistake in writing that letter.  Under this section, as phrased, notwithstanding that, my purchaser would have no title and could be put out of his holding, not merely by the Land Commission but also by the fraudulent John Murphy. That is what I am trying to avoid.  The Minister will agree that that should not be and that there should be some method of avoiding it.</P>

      <P>One satisfactory point about it is that, when a man knows he is to get an addition, he is not going to sell the land until the addition comes, since the holding would be so many times more valuable with the addition.  He also knows that an addition usually is given to him for the purpose of being amalgamated with the <Col N="1790" /> holding and that, if he parts with the holding, the addition probably would not be given.</P>

The situation now is that the second amendment was passed, the first amendment&mdash;which was bound to be consequential on the second&mdash;has been defeated and the third has been defeated also.  Therefore, you have the certificate of the Land Commission at one moment <i>prima facie</i> and the next moment conclusive.  I am not worried about it in regard to a particular case, but there is a principle involved.  So far as the second amendment is concerned, the last person to agree to it would be the Minister, if he had not got the third amendment.</P>
      <P>The Minister got the third amendment thrown out, so that I really do not know where we are.  I suggest that there should be some agreement, some method under the procedure of the House, by virtue of which, when it is agreed as it was agreed and formally put from the Chair that the three amendments would be taken together, the decision of one would automatically carry a decision on consequential amendments.  I raise this matter so that it may be clarified perhaps at the next meeting of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, because otherwise the effect of it is that we have arrived at a completely nonsensical result.</P>

      <P>(4) The managing director shall perform such duties as are delegated to him by the board.</P>
      <P>I have put down this amendment to give the Minister an opportunity of clarifying what he stated on the last occasion.  The House will recollect that, on the 8th of this month, when we took up the Turf Development Bill in the evening, we were discussing an amendment dealing with the powers of the managing director, one proposing to delete the necessity for a managing director.  In the course of that discussion the Minister indicated, at column 1636 of the Seanad Debates, that the Government would appoint a managing director, and would indicate in general terms &ldquo;the powers which the managing director is to exercise, as such&rdquo;.  Subsequently, on the following day, at column 1645, the Minister made it clear that the managing director was going to carry out the duties that were given to him by the board, and that his powers would not be indicated in the terms of his appointment. This is what was said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Mr. Lemass: It is intended that the managing director will carry out his duties subject to the board.</P>
      <P>Mr. Sweetman: And will carry out such duties as are delegated to him by the board?</P>
      <P>Mr. Lemass: Yes.</P>
      <P>Mr. Sweetman: And only such duties?</P>
      <P>Mr. Lemass: Yes.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That seemed to me to clash with what the Minister had said on the previous night.  I have put down this amendment to get the situation clarified.</P>

      <P>The language which one uses in ordinary conversation is, necessarily, different from that which one would use in framing legislation.  I had a difficulty in finding words to describe precisely my objection to this amendment without falling into errors arising out of the legal significance of terms and their ordinary colloquial significance.  The board will consist of a chairman, a managing director and other directors.  When, therefore, one talks of the managing director and the board as being two separate authorities, one first of all has to make it clear that the board is a body which includes the managing director.  He is one of its members.  It is not intended, nor do I think it would be desirable, that the board should have power to delegate to the managing director any of the duties of the board.  I think it is desirable, and the Bill so provides, that the board may perform some of its functions through, or by, the managing director.</P>

I think that the managing director should at all times carry out his duties, subject to the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps I should clear up one further possibility of error.  I contemplate that the warrant of appointment which the managing director will receive from the Government will set out in very general terms what his duties as managing director are to be.  I do not contemplate that the Government will merely say: &ldquo;You are managing director; find out what your duties are from the board&rdquo;.  I think that the Government will give in some general <Col N="1794" /> terms, an indication of the functions that he is to perform as managing director, and will relate the conditions of his employment to these functions. I do not mean that the Government will attempt to draw up something like a City Management Act which would set out the functions to be exercised by the managing director and the other functions to be exercised by the board.  The managing director will be part and parcel of the board, and in matters of policy and matters which are properly the concern of the board, he will be one person there with one vote.  So far as his status is concerned, he may have greater influence than an ordinary part-time director would have, but, on any matter which goes to a vote, his vote will count no more than that of any other member of the board.</P>
    <P>To sum up, therefore, I think the position should be left as it is.  I do not think it is desirable that we should have any specific provision for a delegation of duties by the board to the managing director.  The managing director, in my view, will be the executive officer of the board sitting with other members of the board at meetings to determine questions of policy and the general lines upon which the board will proceed; also carrying out executive acts which the board could not be expected to attend to, but such acts as do not affect the authority of the board.</P>

    <P>This amendment was put down because I am not quite clear what the words &ldquo;national territory&rdquo; are meant to connote in this section.  Section 11 sets <Col N="1795" /> out a number of disqualifications of members of the board and it states that a member shall be disqualified if he ceases to be ordinarily resident in the national territory.

      <P>There is a difficulty in this matter.  Article 2 of the Constitution says the national territory consists of the whole island of Ireland, its islands and the territorial seas.  The word &ldquo;Ireland&rdquo; is the English translation of &ldquo;Eire&rdquo; and if we were to put &ldquo;Ireland&rdquo; in the English translation and put Eire in the Irish text of the Bill it might be misinterpreted to mean the area under the Government of Ireland, that is the Twenty-Six Counties. When we use &ldquo;national territory&rdquo; it means the whole island and this provision simply means that the managing director shall be eligible to act as such so long as he is resident in Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I put down amendment No. 4 for the purpose of initiating whatever discussion may arise on this matter.  Amendment No. 13, in Senator Kingsmill Moore's name, seeks to impose on the board liability to pay compensation for damage to property which is not covered by the existing provisions of the Bill; that is to say latent damage due to interference by the board which because the fact of that interference or the damage that might follow from it could not be anticipated beforehand or ascertained in any definite way, was not notifiable under the provisions of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senators will remember that we discussed this matter on the Committee Stage, and Senator Kingsmill Moore argued that owing to the fact that this <Col N="1798" /> body would be performing its functions under powers conferred on it by statute no action would lie against it in the circumstances I have mentioned, unless negligence or carelessness could be proved.  To the extent that that argument was sound I think I have met it by this amendment, which removes that disability.  The amendment contains no expressed provision for the payment of compensation but that does not mean that a claim cannot be made against the board and, of course, an action in the courts would not be necessary unless the board denied liability. I think this amendment goes as far as is necessary to meet the case which Senator Kingsmill Moore made. I gave the matter very careful consideration since the Committee Stage and decided if there was a case to be met it was the contention that it was generally desirable to put the board in the same relationship to the canal company or any other person in respect of such damages and claims for compensation arising out of damages, as a private person would be.  I understand that Senator Kingsmill Moore wants to go further than that.  He proposes to give the canal company or any other private interest which might be affected in this way a claim for damages against the board even in circumstances where such a claim could not be sustained against a private person. I do not think that that is desirable. The board can acquire property compulsorily and can interfere with certain rights compulsorily.  It cannot do so, however, unless it notifies the person concerned and takes certain other steps, such as depositing maps and plans and making known what precisely the action it is going to take is. If, having followed the procedure laid down in the Bill, it does interfere with anybody's property or rights, then compensation is payable, to be determined, in default of agreement, by arbitration.  In circumstances where action by the board causes damage, other than in circumstances in which the board exercise their compulsory powers, the position under the existing law would be that a claim for damages could be sustained if such damages could be shown to be due to negligence or carelessness.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1799" /> I am proposing here that, where the board, without complying with the provisions of the third chapter of the Bill, interferes with any easement, wayleave, water right or other right, a person having an interest in those rights, or the owner of the rights, may maintain an action for damages against the board as if the board were not acting pursuant to a statute. In so far as the board was in a stronger position in resisting claims of that kind by private persons or public companies by reason of the fact that it was acting under statute, that position is being remedied and I think that that is going far enough.</P>
    <P>The illustration used was the possibility of the excavation of a bog adjacent to the canal affecting the water supply of the canal.  The bog is there now and always was there.  It was there when the canal was built.  The private owner of the bog could have undertaken its drainage or even the mechanical winning of turf from it if he had so decided.  The mere fact that the bog has passed into the ownership of Bord na Móna and that the board has begun the development of the bog should not, I think, strengthen the position of the canal company.  I agree, and this amendment is intended to ensure, that it should not weaken the position of the canal company.  As the law stood, the canal company could not proceed against Bord na Móna for the loss of any right through the drainage of the bog unless it could prove negligence or carelessness.  In future, it will not necessarily be in any worse position to sustain a claim against the board than it would be in sustaining a claim against a private person and it seems to me that that is an adequate safeguard for the canal company or any other interest which may be affected by the exercise of the board's powers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LouisODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree with the Minister in that.  Sub-section (2) of Section 32 refers to compensation for land acquired and states:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The amount of the compensation to be paid by the board on account of the termination, restriction or other interference (whether permanent <Col N="1800" /> or temporary) by the board under this Act of or with any easement, way-leave, water-right or other right over or in respect of any land or water or the diversion, closing, removal or other interference (whether permanent or temporary) by the board under this Act of or with any private road, way, or bridge, or any canal, or other artificial waterway or any artificial water-course or the interference (whether permanent or temporary) with any land by the board under this Act shall, in default of agreement, be fixed under and in accordance with the Acquisition of Land (Assessment of Compensation) Act, 1919...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In that case, it appears to me that any interference, whether in the nature of a tort or otherwise, is to be the subject matter of compensation, to be fixed under the Act of 1919.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kingsmill Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say, in the first place, that I much appreciate the way the Minister and the Minister's staff have met me in regard to the points which I raised and by the introduction of the amendment which now stands as a Ministerial amendment.  That it does not go further is largely attributable to myself for not having made my points sufficiently clear on the Committee Stage and <Col N="1801" /> through my having been guilty of a slight misstatement of the law which I did my best to correct by letter immediately afterwards.  The ways in which Bórd na Móna can affect the property of a private individual might be put into three categories. In the first place, they can do so by the compulsory acquisition of the property of an individual or corporation. That was adequately dealt with by the original sections of the Bill.  Secondly, they can compulsorily interfere with the easements or rights of property of any person though they do not take the property or easement, and that form of intentional interference was, I think, also met with in the Bill as originally drafted and is the type of intentional interference which, I think, is referred to in the sub-section which Senator O'Dea has just read.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LouisODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>It refers to interference and does not state whether it is intentional or otherwise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TheodoreMoore" hpid="Mr. Kingsmill Moore Mr. Kingsmill Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kingsmill Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>It deals with interference under the Act; that is, by using machinery provided by the Act to serve notice of intention to interfere. That is the way I interpret the Section. In those two respects, the Bill, as originally drafted, met the reasonable requirements of the private owner. There is, however, another class of case which I envisaged and which is especially likely to happen when dealing with some unstable thing such as bog, the properties of which are not easily understood, and engineering in connection with which is complicated. That is, an injury which you do not either anticipate or desire and which may be caused, without any negligence on your part, by reason of the properties of the material on which you are working.  A typical case would be if, by taking away large quantities of bog, you had interfered with the lateral support of another person's property, causing the collapse of that property. Another case which has been called to my attention since the Committee Stage is where you are working bog on a hillside and, as a result of the excavations, there is a slipping of the whole bog, covering agricultural land at a lower level.  Both of these cases are, I think, met by the Minister's <Col N="1802" /> amendment.  There is a third class of case which would be met by my amendment which stands last on the Order Paper and for which the Seanad should, I think, make provision.  I stated&mdash;and stated wrongly&mdash;in the course of the debate on Committee Stage that if, by conducting drainage operations on your own land, you removed from another person's land water which, in fact, was supporting his soil or his house an action would lie at common law.  When I stated that, I stated the law too widely.</P>
      <P>There was a case decided about 1869 which set out that where one owner, digging his own land and draining his own land, by these operations, drew off water from his neighbour and caused his neighbour's house to crack and fall down there was no right for the neighbour to get damages.  Ever since this case was decided the courts have been trying to get away from it. They have decided that if the water contained a few ounces of mud the principle does not apply.  They have refused to apply it to semi-liquid asphalt.  They looked upon that case with a jaundiced eye and said that if ever a similar case came before them again they would probably reserve their decision.  This law was laid down for a private and isolated transaction concerning the activities of individuals. Here you have given to a great company very necessary compulsory powers.  I am not making any complaints about these compulsory powers because it is proper that the company should get them and they are necessary, but the fact is that Bord na Móna is going to masticate the surface of Ireland by the square mile.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It will not be a question of digging a turf bank, it will be a question of scraping away the surface of the land for miles and miles.  Instead of taking away a few hundred gallons of water it may be a question of interfering with the subterranean support of very considerable areas of land, land upon which there are cottages, agricultural holdings, roads, canals and railways.  My amendment is designed, first of all, to avoid very lengthy and complicated cases that would depend upon the evidence of experts as to <Col N="1803" /> whether water only or water and a small amount of mud had been taken away.  You can see such a case going from court to court and finally arriving in the Supreme Court to be decided possibly by a majority after a ten days' hearing.  Firstly, I am trying to avoid this and secondly I am trying to ensure that when you give extensive compulsory powers to a public utility company, such as this board will be, then if, in the exercise of their powers, they injure the ordinary individual, they must pay compensation fixed by an arbitrator to be appointed by the Minister.  This principle should be introduced in all legislation which gives compulsory powers.  We must remember that it has been laid down in the courts that while a thing done by one person may cause only a little annoyance it may be unbearable if done by many.  What is contemplated now by this company operating so widely with effective powers of compulsion is similar to the activities of a number of individuals working together.  I submit it would be a sound principle in legislation, for this company, which is being given a vast amount of money, over £750,000 of public money, and being given these compulsory powers, to be made liable to compensate the ordinary small man for injury done by them, even though the state of law at the time would appear, in view of the evidence of engineers and geologists, to make it doubtful whether he might be able to recover in the courts.  I ask the Seanad to accept this.  There are a couple of minor criticisms I would like to make of the Minister's amendment; points on which I am sure the Minister would be likely to meet me.</P>
    <P>First of all the Minister's reference to paragraph (d) of Section 17.  If you refer to paragraph (d) it is merely dealing with lands which are vested in the board.  It says that it is the duty of the board to manage, develop, and work bogs and other lands vested in the board.  As I read it the words &ldquo;vested in the board&rdquo; qualify &ldquo;bogs and other lands,&rdquo; so that the Minister's amendment would be merely in respect of work done by the board on lands vested in them.  They have power to <Col N="1804" /> build bridges over canals and that would involve building foundations on the canal company's land.  Therefore the Minister's amendment should be worded to ensure that the board would be liable when performing their duties, whether on land acquired by them or on other people's land.  That is a minor matter.  Another matter I would like to impress upon the Minister is the importance of an arbitrator.  I have been impressed by the fact that where you are dealing with expert witnesses an arbitrator is often a more satisfactory tribunal than a court.  You can choose a person who is known for his expert knowledge.  In the case of the Barrow drainage, Professor Rishworth was the arbitrator and he was probably more expeditious and satisfactory than a court.  I ask the Seanad to accept the broad principle I have expressed and secondly, if the Seanad does not accept it, I ask the Minister to modify his amendment in the two ways I have suggested.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>With reference to paragraph (d) of sub-section (1) of Section 17, I cannot, frankly, follow the Senator at all.  Section 17 sets out the duties of the board and these duties are of a definite character.  They have a duty to develop and work bogs and land and they also have a duty to sell turf and foster the use of turf but these other duties have no relation to the management, development and working of bogs and other land and no question arises of interfering with other people's property in the manner to which the Senator referred.  It is certainly not intended to give a claim for compensation where the board interferes with other people's interests in the discharge of the board's duty to sell turf or foster the sale of turf.  I would like to get a clear statement of the precise difference between the Government amendment and what the Senator has in mind.  I do not profess to have any legal training.  If I enter into legal technicalities, I fear I will be lost. Clear instructions were given to the draftsman&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TheodoreMoore" hpid="Mr. Kingsmill Moore Mr. Kingsmill Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kingsmill Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I have never found the Minister lost on any subject yet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The instructions which <Col N="1805" /> were given to the draftsman were that he should prepare a Bill which would give this board the power to acquire compulsorily whatever property they needed for the carrying out of their job.  These instructions were given, because any Government concern going out to buy property in the open market will always find that it will be salted, consequently it has to be able to protect itself by retaining powers of compulsory acquisition subject to the fixing of compensation by an arbitrator.  Where, therefore, the board exercises compulsory powers in any way under this Act, there is ample provision for the fixing of compensation by an independent arbitrator. Senator Kingsmill Moore raised the question of interference with property other than interference covered by the Act.  At that time, I did not appreciate that the board was in a different position from a private person.  It seemed to me that if the board acquired property, it would be in the same position as a private person, if it interfered with the rights of an owner of property adjoining the lands or bogs which it acquired.  But, looking into the matter, I found that this board was in a somewhat different position from that of a private person.  The different position was this: if it interfered with anybody's rights outside the Bill, the person interfered with could not take an action against the board unless it could be proved that the board had acted negligently or carelessly. Having examined the matter, I considered that it was, perhaps, undesirable to leave it like that in the particular circumstances of this company. I use that phrase to show that I am not trying to establish a precedent for any other Government undertaking that may be established and given compulsory powers of acquisition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I decided that it was not desirable to put it in a position different from that of a private individual or enterprise so that persons affected would not have the same rights against it.  That is why this amendment has been tabled. That covers adequately, I think, cases of damage not associated with the board's compulsory powers of acquisition, but Senator Kingsmill Moore wants to go further than the proposal <Col N="1806" /> in the amendment by ensuring that the individual concerned will get compensation to be determined by an arbitrator appointed by the Minister.  I think that is going too far.  If you ask me what are the rights of private persons against each other in respect of the kind of interference contemplated here, I cannot answer that legal question. What I am proposing is that the board will pay compensation admitted by both sides as equitable, and if they do not admit liability, that the aggrieved party may go to the courts to get the issue determined.</P>
    <P>I think that the amendment is reasonable.  It is confined to giving a right to take an action for damages to a person whose rights are interfered with by the board.  There will be no action in the courts unless the board resists the claim when it is made.  If the board admits the claim, and agrees to settle it by the payment of compensation, there need be no recourse to the courts.  If the board resists the claim, then it will be because it denies that there is any basis for compensation, and I do not think it reasonable in those circumstances, to ask the board to pay compensation until the matter has been decided by a court.  Therefore, the person whose claim is denied by the board will have to proceed in the ordinary way in the courts.  As I understand Senator Kingsmill Moore's amendment, it presupposes that there will be payment of compensation by the board and that the only question to be decided is how much should be paid.  That is going farther than I would suggest we should go.  I would suggest that the board has the right, first of all, to consider itself whether there is justice in any claim against it, and, if it considers there is justice in it, it should meet it. If it does not consider there is justice, then the matter can be decided by the courts.  I feel that to go further in the direction contemplated by Senator Kingsmill Moore's amendment would be going too far.</P>

      <P>The amendment is rather puzzling to me in some respects. In fact it does not appear to be necessary at all.  Since, according to Section 31, the board is bound to issue notices and advertisements the amendment could be summarised by stating that &ldquo;if the board acts illegally&rdquo;&mdash; that is if it does not act in accordance with the provisions of Section 31&mdash;&ldquo;any owner of property affected by the actions of the board may maintain an action for damages&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the other hand, if the board acts in accordance with the provisions of the statute, and issues the required notices compensation may also be claimed.  The amendment assumes that <Col N="1808" /> as the Bill stands if the board acts illegally there is no room for an action against it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

      <P>If the board acquires somebody's property, or interferes with somebody's rights, it must give public notice in advance of its intention to do so.  It must deposit plans and particulars and proceed precisely in the manner set out in the Bill in each case. The compensation is determined under the relevant statute, the Land (Assessment of Compensation) Act of 1919.  What was mentioned was damage done to somebody's property that could not be foreseen&mdash;a case in which notice could not be given&mdash;damage which might emerge only some years after the work had been done, and of which no notice to interfere, or notice to acquire could have been given.  It was to give a right of action for damages in such cases that this amendment was put forward.  Without this amendment, no action would lie.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a difficulty in that.  It is the penalty clause that is worrying me.  I put my amendment rather deliberately in the first sub-section. It was the second sub-section that was worrying me.  I tried to draft it into the penalty clause, that the person would not be liable to a penalty unless the authority has been shown to him, and I found it was impossible to draft it like that.  I think it is wrong that a person should be liable to conviction under the second sub-section if the officers of the board had not produced the authority.</P>
      <P>The only objection I could anticipate from the Minister was that the board might make the case that an officer going on the lands could not find anyone there to whom he could show the authority.  That is why I put in the words &ldquo;if so required&rdquo;.</P>

I do not see why a person should be put under the pain of being convicted for kicking someone off his land.  There are certain people who might be easily recognisable as the local officials of the board, but there are plenty of other people who might not be so recognisable.  I suggest that it is not going to hamper the board in any way.  If the Minister does not like the words &ldquo;so required&rdquo;, he might make it &ldquo;so requested&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>The Minister ought to find out what some of his colleagues are doing, as he voted for some of the measures going through the other House.  We have heard a good deal about the need for uniformity.  In the Local Government Bill, which has passed its Report Stage, and for which the Minister voted last night, there is the following provision, in Section 53, dealing with entry on land:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(1)  Any officer or agent of a road authority who is duly authorised ...may enter on any land....</P>
      <P>(2)  A person entering on land may do thereon all things reasonably necessary...</P>
      <P>(3)  Before a person enters under this section on any land, the road authority...shall either obtain the consent (in the case of occupied land) of the occupier or (in the case of unoccupied land) of the owner or shall give by post to the occupier or owner (as the case may be) not less than 21 days' notice of the intention to make the entry.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That is quite practicable, but I explained here on the Committee Stage that there were difficulties in providing for that in this case. These officers, surveying land for the purposes of the Turf Board, may not always be in a position to know when they are passing from one person's holding to another.  In fact, it may be that inspection of one person's holding <Col N="1811" /> may show the necessity for the inspection of another.  The Senator need not be afraid that the board will abuse its powers.  They would authorise their inspectors properly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TheodoreMoore" hpid="Mr. Kingsmill Moore Mr. Kingsmill Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kingsmill Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Second Reading of this Bill I took occasion to to make a few remarks upon the dangers and difficulties which seem to me to be inherent in any system of Government-controlled companies and boards.  I said then, and I now repeat, that I thought it was too soon for any student of political science to form any concluded judgment on the balance of the merits and demerits of such a system; but that it was not too soon to try to perceive some of the pitfalls which beset such a system in order to avoid them, and give the system a fair chance of proving its capacity. When the Minister came to reply, <Col N="1812" /> he accepted broadly the justification for my remarks, and on his part he introduced several qualifications by way of counter-balance.  I would like to say this, that I think his qualifications were both accurate and weighty, and I accept them fully and any remarks that I then made should be taken in the light of the Minister's reply.  I should also like to say this, that the way in which the Minister has met in Committee and on Report certain amendments designed to remove features of the Bill which I thought undesirable has also convinced me that these features in the original draft were the result of oversight and not the result of any Machiavellian attempt to interfere with the rights of other bodies or people.</P>
      <P>Having said that, however, and with those qualifications, I think there is nothing that I have to add to or subtract from what I actually did say upon the Second Reading.  But I find myself in the rather unusual and equivocal position of having to answer criticisms upon a speech which I did not make, which I did not intend to make, and which, if I had made it, would have been directly in conflict with opinions which I have expressed not once but several times in this House.  If Senator Ó Buachalla had not omitted to draw his gladiatorial sword until I had left the House&mdash;I was here for nearly all his speech and only left on other business when I thought he was concluding&mdash;I would have had an opportunity of correcting, at an earlier stage, any misconceptions under which he may have been labouring. Perhaps he was not here when I was speaking, and relied on the reverberations of the ante-chamber or of the Restaurant, which are not always accurate echoes of what occurs in the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TheodoreMoore" hpid="Mr. Kingsmill Moore Mr. Kingsmill Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kingsmill Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that is one portion of this House that Senator Ó Buachalla has never seen, and I have been careful to exclude it.  Perhaps I was not very distinct when I was speaking, or it may be that my words were not adequate to convey my meaning, or perhaps Senator <Col N="1813" /> Ó Buachalla may be a little bit hard of hearing; but, whatever the reason, it is clear that though my words may have impacted on his ear drums, they did not convey their intended meaning any further.  In so far as Senator Ó Buachalla's speech consisted of a personal attack on myself, I do not propose to answer it.  In so far as it purported to represent and, in fact, misrepresented what I had actually said, I will leave the matter to the impartial verdict of the Official Reports.</P>
      <P>But, in so far as it implied that members of this House are to be confined and restrained in their, criticism of Government policy or Government measures, I think it does call for one or two words of comment.  Parliamentary government is government by discussion and criticism, and nobody understands that more fully, or honours it more scrupulously, than the Minister whom we now have the pleasure of having before us.  I have noticed that the Minister certainly does not at any time resent criticism.  If he did resent criticism he would not be a statesman, because it is the business of statesmen to welcome criticism in so far as it is justified, to accept it when it is well-founded, to answer it when it is erroneous; in so far as it is dishonest to expose it but to resent it, never. Resentment of criticism is always a failing.  In this imperfect world there will be those who may labour under a misconception of the origin of such hypersensitivity attributing it to an incapacity to understand the criticism or an intellectual inertia which shuns the labour of finding the correct answer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kingsmill Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>If I may refer to the Official Report, I will give the Senator his actual words.  His speech was made in regard to certain matters in relation to which as I was not in the House I can claim the right to reply. Before I was interrupted I was going, in my next sentence, to make it clear that I was not attributing Senator Ó Buachalla's resentment to any of the three points in relation to criticism which I have made just now.  It is quite obvious that on these occasions it is an endearing if excessive Party loyalty which makes Senator Ó Buachalla scurry to the defence of a Minister before the Minister is attacked, even a Minister like the present Minister for Industry and Commerce, who is well able to look after himself in the House.  He also&mdash;and this is a matter which I deprecate&mdash;apparently finds himself unable to regard as either rational or sincere the opinions of anyone who does not accept fully and completely all Senator Ó Buachalla's political Bible from what I might call its traditional Genesis to its still unpublished Revelations.  That, I think, is very unfortunate, because if we are to work here it is vital that we adopt, when it is necessary, constructive criticisms.  Since I have been a member of this House I have learned a great deal and have been informed and assisted by the view expressed by members on the other side of the gangway and that has influenced me in many ways in the application of political thought.  It is necessary that we all should do that and, as Senator Ó Buachalla knows, the original speech I made here was an abstract speech, and if he imagines that I was getting at any particular individual in that speech he is very much mistaken.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamOBuachalla" hpid="Liam Ó Buachalla Liam Ó Buachalla">
      <NameTxt>Liam Ó Buachalla</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I am entitled to spend a few minutes in making some comments on the speech we have just heard.  If there is one thing in which I believe it is freedom of speech.  I am sure there must have been occasions in this House when certain speeches and statements were made which I would much prefer had <Col N="1815" /> not been made, particularly in view of existing circumstances, but on the matter of principle I will give first place to no man in my loyalty to freedom of speech.</P>
      <P>In this Bill as in other Bills we were faced with the introduction of a new type of industrial or commercial organisation.  The introduction of that type of organisation is looked upon with a certain amount of suspicion in some quarters.  I do not question the right of any man to suspect the introduction of that type of organisation and I do not question the right of any man to criticise the method of appointing members of the boards that will be entrusted with the working, and the managing of these organisations. Senator Kingsmill Moore made a certain speech and I want to assure him that I was present during the whole of that speech.  I may have misunderstood him.  I do not think so.  Anybody looking over the reports of the proceedings of that same evening will find that I was misunderstood myself and that that misunderstanding led to a certain Senator, a man whose friendship and ability I appreciate very much, making a charge against me which was not sustainable.  Things like that do happen.  But will anybody say that my speech was unfounded when I quote the following words which were used by Senator Kingsmill Moore in his speech on that occasion.  He said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;People are apt to be blind to the deficiencies and acutely aware of the merits of those whom they like, and the scales will be weighed in favour of those who are most congenial to the people who have the appointments even though less individually qualified from a purely technical view of efficiency.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I stated on that occasion that there was an implication in the Senator's speech.  Those are the words he used and I leave it to the House to decide whether in view of that statement and the other statements which occurred in the course of the Senator's speech the criticisms I made were justified or not.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill which the Minister has now to administer is a <Col N="1816" /> Bill which in my opinion holds tremendous possibilities for the country.  I do not quite know if the Minister or anybody else has tried to calculate the measure of the power he has got in his hands.  If he did it would be very interesting from the scientific point of view.  It would be interesting if he were able to tell us what there is in the bogs of this country that can be turned into power and utilised by the people of the country for the work of the nation.  Whatever the Minister may have to say about the Bill I think he can find no complaint with the manner in which it was treated here even by people who are looked upon as unfriendly critics such as Senator Kingsmill Moore.  It is only by the clash of men's minds that you can get opposition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we are going to be so sensitive and considerate for Ministers or Ministerial policy as not to say what we think, it is going to be a hopeless mess.  In that position we will give the Ministers their Bills and the Ministers themselves will be the first to discover the flaws.  My view of this measure which the Minister has piloted through both Houses is that there are very great possibilities for the future of the country depending now on the manner in which it is utilised and the people who are going to be charged with the responsibility of making it operative.  If you got a group of people together of the calibre of the Minister&mdash;and he has plenty of faults as, I am sure, he is aware, as the rest of us are aware of our faults&mdash;on the board, it is very difficult to see the limits to which this measure could carry the country.  The first step which the Minister has to take to ensure that the nation will get the most out of this measure is to get the best brains in the country to administer it.  Anything less than the best personnel will not be fair to the nation.  I hope that this is not regarded as a Party measure.  It was not treated in that way in this House nor, so far as I know, in the other House.  It will be the possession of the country to-day and to-morrow. It is an instrument by which life here may be made better and our resources developed to the full.  To get a job well done, the best brains should be employed and, in this case, persons <Col N="1817" /> with imagination, drive and industry will be required.  The whole development of our bogs will depend on those people.  It will also depend on the machinery which those people choose. Those who constitute the machinery will be of the same type as those who choose it.  If they are mediocre persons themselves they will choose persons of that type.  If you have in the management persons of real ability, they will obtain the services of persons of capacity.  It is only persons of real ability who are judges of real ability in others.  Going down the scale, a great deal of the success of the undertaking will be contingent on the output from the people employed on the bogs.</P>
    <P>The cost of the power to be provided by the fuel produced in the bogs will depend on the output of the individual worker.  The Minister expressed the view in connection with industry that, if industrialists were to do their job as well as the nation was entitled to expect, they would have to work hard, be efficient and produce wares which would compare favourably with those produced elsewhere.  In our bogs, the output per day will have to be equal to the best in any other place.  That must be the aim.  I have no doubt about the physical capacity of the men in this country to do a good day's work.  They can compare favourably with men elsewhere, but I do not think that we can expect from those men a high output per day unless they are reasonably paid.  The people who are choosing the material must realise that.  Labour must be paid for its hire. All that is part of the problem.</P>
    <P>I have high hopes of the good which will flow from this measure.  It would be difficult to visualise all the good it can do the country.  I doubt that even the Minister himself is fully aware of its possibilities.  He does not, in my opinion, lay sufficient stress upon one aspect of this scheme of development. I think that that is because his intellect has been developed on the industrial side owing to the fact that he has been charged with handling that aspect of activity by the Government and that rural activity has not, accordingly, been given very much place in <Col N="1818" /> his general make up.  Others of his colleagues are entrusted with that responsibility.  The production and marketing of the power we are to get from turf is only part of this great development.  A day will come when the production and marketing of turf will lessen and something else much greater will emerge.  The future of the undertaking will depend very largely on the way in which the scheme is planned right from the beginning.  I hope the whole problem will be regarded in that light.  If it is, somebody will say of the Minister in this regard, whatever they may say of him in other regards, that he &ldquo;builded better than he knew&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I should like to add a comment with regard to the development of our peat resources and the problem of meeting the country's needs from those resources. Apart from what Bord na Móna may do in the areas in which they are to develop those schemes, I think they should give attention to obtaining greater supplies of fuel than we have been able to secure up to the present from our bogs.  There can be no real fuel security until we reach a stage when we shall have one year's supply in reserve.  In areas where turf is used as a fuel, no provident farmer is without a reserve which will carry him on until February or March of the succeeding year, at least.  That is always the aim in my district and in the areas around.  I was down in Clonsast with my colleagues.  I saw the reserves of fuel there.  I was through the park recently.  To my eye, the stocks there are considerably reduced. It would be disastrous if the country found itself without any reserve of fuel and with very bad weather in the early part of the year.  We might be left without the means of carrying on our everyday life.  Bord na Móna should concentrate on that problem, apart from what is to be done in the areas to be dealt with under this Bill.  It should be set the task of encouraging turf production in the bog areas of Leitrim, my own county, and other such places. They should be encouraged to go in for greater production on the undertaking that supplies will be taken over, stacked by Bord na Móna and used as <Col N="1819" /> reserves.  As I argued with the late Mr. Hugo Flinn, an attitude of mind has been created towards the burning of turf in our towns and cities which is quite understandable.  The emergency situation demanded that anything which would burn should be got out and sent into the cities and urban areas.  We have had no proper survey made to show where the really good turf deposits are.</P>
    <P>But, if you are able to carry over one year's fuel in advance, you can survey your ideas and can ensure that only the best fuel is brought to the towns and cities.  That cannot be done until you build up your reserves.  When we come up from the country, and go into hotels and other places and see the kind of fuel they get, we are surprised that they take it, because we would not accept that quality in our own homes.  Indeed, we would hardly take it out of the bog.</P>
    <P>Now, that is a situation which can be corrected.  It could be overcome if Bord na Móna adopted the suggestions which I have made.  No doubt it will require an expenditure of effort, but I think that the effort would be well worth while.  It is an urgent problem &mdash;a problem which we must face, to establish the good name of our own native fuel.  I believe that if we do that, we are assured of a great future for this country.  We must aim at a better quality fuel which will convince the people in the towns and cities that they must use it in preference to anything else offered to them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Foran</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot let this occasion pass without expressing appreciation of the way in which Senators were treated on their recent visit to the bog.  Many Senators had their eyes opened when they saw conditions on the bogs for themselves, and I feel that their visit to the bogs made the passage of this Bill easier.  I feel also that if Senator Kingsmill Moore and Senator Ó Buachalla had joined us in that visit we would not have had such long contributions to the debate from them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to say to Senator Kingsmill Moore that our appreciation <Col N="1820" /> was not due to either the food or the drink which we received on the bogs. We were informed and educated by the leaflets and diagrams which the Turf Development Board supplied to us. We were given maps and details of the surveys of the general conditions prevailing in each bog and it is a great pity that every Senator could not have availed himself of the invitation to see the work for himself.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether it was the Minister or the Turf Development Board who arranged the visit of members of the Seanad, but it was a very wise move.  It shortened the time which the House would otherwise spend in considering the Bill.  I was very glad to hear Senator Baxter expressing the opinion that the burden of turf development in this country depended very largely on manual labour.  That being so, we should recognise our duty to reward manual labour properly, so that we could get the best possible output.  It is not very usual for Senator Baxter to take that line.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasForan" hpid="Mr. Foran Mr. Foran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Foran</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a good augury that people are beginning to recognise the necessity of paying a living wage to those who do the work, and, to that extent, I thoroughly agree with Senator Baxter.  I hope that Senator Counihan will take the same view on other subjects nearer home.  I would like to say that I was perfectly satisfied that the people responsible for the employment on the bogs and the conditions I saw prevailing there, are enterprising people.  If there are complaints that output is low, labour conditions should be closely examined, but I am satisfied, from what I saw, that labour conditions on the bogs are not bad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During our visit to the bogs, I had conversations with the ordinary men working there, and I think it is a healthy sign and a good sign, that they expressed their satisfaction.  I hope the standards prevailing on the bogs will be recognised outside the production of turf&mdash;in agriculture, and in industry generally.  My purpose in speaking now is to express my appreciation of the effort that was <Col N="1821" /> made to enlighten the members of this House by enabling them to see these bogs in operation.</P>
    <P>I have an appeal to make to the Minister.  That is to extend the briquetting scheme.  I know that the process may be costly&mdash;more costly than the production of ordinary turf&mdash; but we need the briquettes and we must see that grates are installed which are suitable for turf burning.  I would ask the Minister to bear this suggestion in mind.  Burning ordinary hand-won turf in Dublin tenements is often a terrible problem when you have to use grates which were never intended for turf.  The people who have to use those unsuitable grates deserve every sympathy and the Minister should leave nothing undone to see that proper grates are provided as soon as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Summerfield</NameTxt>
      <P>In the course of the discussions on this Bill many references were made to the board and to ordinary business concerns.  As a business man, I would like to add my meed of appreciation to those who gave us the opportunity of paying a personal visit to the bogs.  Wonderful arrangements have been made on the bogs and those responsible for them deserve every tribute.  I am glad to say that the men who do the job are comfortable and quite happy with their conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was obvious to us that those who have organised the production of turf were born organisers.  We had only to keep our eyes open to realise that. What impressed me even more than Clonsast was the Kildare hand-won scheme.  Its obvious efficiency was a tribute to the engineers, and those supervising the engineers, and I came away with the feeling that we ought to take every measure to ensure that the development of our turf resources should be a permanent part of our national economy, no matter what its cost.  In Kildare, we saw men housed under proper conditions&mdash;conditions which were a real delight to inspect. We inspected carefully all the arrangements which had been made for their feeding and general comfort.  It was good to see so many men working under such good conditions instead of <Col N="1822" /> watching them getting aboard emigrant ships or living in the slums of our cities.</P>
    <P>It would be sound national expenditure to develop this scheme to the fullest extent and to make bog development a permanent part of the national economy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Kingsmill Moore referred to the difficulties associated with the conduct of economic activities by Government boards.  The fact that such difficulties exist will not be denied.  I am sure, however, that it will be agreed that an enterprise of the kind contemplated in this Bill could not be well carried on except by a State organisation.  That being agreed, it is clear also that that State organisation must be given reasonable powers and facilities to do the job well.  What is the main difficulty associated with the conduct of economic activities by Government companies? It is, I suppose, the absence of the profit motive, which is the driving force behind private industry.  If the absence of that force, that impetus towards efficiency and economy in operation, is to be offset, it can only be done by securing for membership of the board and on the staff under the board people with the necessary enthusiasm for the work upon which they are engaged.  It is not always possible to obtain that.  Excellent administrators, engineers and technicians of one kind or another are available who will take one job or another, according to the size of the salary and the conditions of employment offered to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of the Turf Development Board&mdash;which will disappear upon the enactment of this measure, to be replaced by Bord na Móna&mdash;we were fortunate in securing, not merely on the board but on the staff of the board, numbers of competent people who are enthusiastic for their job.  The spirit which the members witnessed among the staff at Clonsast and the other camps they visited was attributable, I think, to that fact.  The members of the Turf Development Board are people with other interests, which are, from the point of view of their personal livelihoods, far more important <Col N="1823" /> to them; yet they undertook the duties involved in membership of the board in the same spirit in which men joined the L.D.F. or other organisations during the war.  They did it with the main purpose of giving public service. They devoted to the duties of the board not merely a great part of their business hours but also a large part of their leisure time and their week-ends. Perhaps it will be illustrative of the spirit of the board when I mention that, in the case of at least one member to whom I mentioned the possibility of an increase in the small fee which the members of the board now are paid, I was told that, if the fee were increased, the member would resign.  His attitude was that nobody would believe that he was on the board for the fee he got so long as the fee was small, but they might misunderstand his presence there if the fee were large; and he would continue on the board only so long as there was no doubt that his membership arose solely from the desire to give service in that manner.</P>
    <P>The board were particularly fortunate in building up enthusiasm for their job amongst the technical staff and amongst the workers whom they employed.  I agree entirely with Senator Foran that an enterprise of this kind cannot be successful unless there are harmonious relations between the executive officers and the manual workers.  That must be based upon fair dealing: it cannot be obtained otherwise.  That situation exists amongst the staff of the Turf Development Board and I hope it will continue to exist in the staff of Bord na Móna.</P>
    <P>Senator Baxter referred to the desirability of having a year's stock of turf.  The advantage of having such a reserve stock is obvious.  However, I want to make it clear that Bord na Móna, the organisation to which this Bill refers, will be responsible only for the mechanised turf production scheme. The production of turf for the national pool, which was begun during the emergency and which is necessary still, is mainly undertaken by county council organisations.  The Turf Development Board, at the request of the Government, <Col N="1824" /> took on in addition to the operation of the mechanised bogs, the responsibility for organising, developing and supervising the hand won turf camps in Kildare and the adjoining areas.  Their contribution to the national pool is also considerable.  If the fuel emergency continues for any length of time, it may be that some steps will have to be taken to relieve county councils in regard to responsibility for turf, so that the county council staffs can devote their time to their ordinary duties. For the time being, however, it is necessary to rely on them for the bulk of the turf that comes into the national pool, to supply the turf ration in the eastern areas.</P>
    <P>It would not have been practicable, at any time up to the present, to have produced such an excess of turf through their organisation as to make possible the accumulation of substantial reserves.  Some reserve was maintained each year, and some reserve will be maintained this year, but it would not in itself be sufficient to maintain the ration over a protracted period, if for any reason production in a particular season should not be practicable. The activities of Bord na Móna will be confined to the production of turf by mechanical means and, in so far as a substantial proportion of that turf will be used as fuel for electricity generating stations, there must obviously be substantial reserves accumulated, so that the production of electricity from the stations will be dependent in no sense upon conditions in the bog, whether weather or other conditions, that might interrupt the continuity of production.</P>
    <P>Senator Foran referred to briquettes. It will be the responsibility of Bord na Móna to endeavour to improve the briquette-producing process.  I would not be frank with the Seanad if I were to pretend that that process is perfect yet.  The actual manufacturing of briquettes from milled turf is quite satisfactory and little improvement in that process is likely, but all the problems involved in producing the milled turf and in transporting it from the bog to the briquetting factory have not been resolved yet.  The board is working on that task and will <Col N="1825" /> have the responsibility for endeavouring to solve those problems.  I am informed that this year, probably due to the favourable weather conditions and the application of the experience of the board in other years, the production of briquettes is proceeding in a very satisfactory manner.  The briquetting factory was brought into production much earlier than normal and consequently the output of briquettes will be higher than in previous years, assuming that the season continues favourable.  That is important, as these briquettes are used at the moment entirely for industrial fuel and form a very essential part of our supply of industrial fuel.</P>
    <P>Before concluding, there are one or two minor matters to which I should like to refer.  They are matters which were mentioned during the discussion in Committee and which I promised to look into, but which, in my opinion, did not call for the production of amendments by me for the Report Stage.  Senator Baxter referred to the obligation of the board to work the bogs in such a manner as to leave a bog, when exhausted for fuel-producing purposes, suitable for afforestation or agricultural purposes. I am satisfied that there was no need to amend the Bill to ensure that result.  In Section 17, the Bill places, as a duty on the board, the management, development and working of bogs and lands vested in it.  That is not merely an empowering section.  Its purpose there is not merely to say that the board may do these things.  Its purpose is to give these duties to the board, to make it mandatory on the board to manage, develop and work these bogs to the best advantage, and it would be a dereliction of duty on the part of the board, according to my interpretation of the Bill, if it failed so to organise its production schemes and to manage the bogs as not to leave the land at its highest value for whatever purpose is more suitable when the turf production ceases.</P>
    <P>I think it was Senator O'Dea who inquired whether the definition of &ldquo;land&rdquo; in the Bill covered bogs.  I <Col N="1826" /> have had the points examined, and I am assured that the definition covers land of all kinds.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LouisODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think I asked that question.  I think that what I was afraid of was that the Bill did not give sufficient powers to the board to regulate its procedure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, perhaps, I may be attributing to Senator O'Dea a query that was put by some other Senator.  I think it was Senator Sweetman who made the suggestion that the board should be under no obligation to offer the cut-away bog, the reclaimed land left after the turf production work had ceased, to the Land Commission in the first instance. I was assured that it was not necessary to put any statutory obligation on the board in that regard, because the obligation is on it to dispose of that land to the best advantage.  There will, normally, be consultation between the board and the Land Commission, and, in fact, so far as the Turf Development Board is concerned, all its activities in relation to the acquisition of bogs and the development of bogs are undertaken in consultation with the Land Commission.  There will, normally, be consultation between Bord na Móna and the Land Commission as to the disposal of land which the board no longer requires.  If the Land Commission requires the land it will have the opportunity of obtaining it.  The obligation on the board will be to dispose of the land to the best advantage.</P>
      <P>Senator Ryan referred to the phrase &ldquo;in law or in equity&rdquo;.  I am not going to offer a personal opinion as to the necessity for the double provision, but the Parliamentary Draftsman said to me that, while the phrase might be a little over-cautious, he would not agree that it was altogether meaningless. He contended that there is a real distinction between legal and equitable remedies, despite the amalgamation of the courts, so that the safest thing to do is to leave the Bill as it is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These were the only points mentioned in Committee which I undertook to examine, and which did not come <Col N="1827" /> forward again on the Report Stage. This is now the Final Stage of the Bill.  The board is being given a great responsibility.  It is being asked to undertake a very great enterprise, and I am sure I am expressing the hopes of all the members of the Seanad when I say that the success of that enterprise will be a great contribution to the national economy.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Counihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That the Seanad is of opinion that Emergency Powers (Export of Dead Poultry and Rabbits) Order, 1945 (Temporary Amendment) Order, 1946, made by the Minister for Agriculture, should be revoked.</P>
      <P>The Order made by the Minister, completely prohibiting the export of rabbits under any conditions from the 7th March, 1946, to the 26th October, 1946, has caused a great deal of alarm amongst farmers.  Everybody knows that rabbits have become a terrible pest and plague to farmers in many parts of the country.  That is particularly so at the present time, when farmers are growing cereal crops over a very big acreage.  We all know the amount of destruction they can do. There is no need to tell Senators of the enormous rate at which they breed. In view of all that, I hope the Minister will have no hesitation in revoking the Order.  Rabbits, as I have said, are very prolific.  They breed eight times in the year.  The period of gestation is only 30 days.  It is estimated that one rabbit will produce between 50 and 60 young ones in a year.  Pennant, the great naturalist, has estimated that the progeny of one mother-rabbit in four years would be 1,274,840.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Counihan</NameTxt>
      <P>In many countries rabbits have become a terrible plague. The Governments of Australia and New Zealand, as well as some Governments in European countries, pay a bounty <Col N="1828" /> for the destruction of rabbits.  I think that for some years our own Minister for Agriculture paid a bounty of 3d. each for the destruction of rabbits.  It is difficult, therefore, to understand why he should have changed his mind and made this prohibition Order.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Lands is taking power in the Forestry Bill, which was before the House a few weeks ago, to enable him to go in on farmers' lands to destroy vermin, principally rabbits and hares.  It is an extraordinary thing that anybody should have advised the Minister for Agriculture to make this prohibition Order.  There is not a farmer in any part of the country, except in those parts where they have rabbit warrens, such as they have in parts of Kerry, that would not be delighted to pay a bounty out of his own pocket for the destruction of rabbits.  I invite men to come on my land to trap, snare or shoot rabbits. The only obligation that I put on them is to close the burrows and the holes which, if left open, are likely to be a source of danger to valuable horses and cattle.</P>
      <P>In the case of cereal crops, such as wheat or oats, rabbits do a terrible lot of destruction in the early spring and summer when the crops are growing. Later, when these crops are getting ripe, the fields are simply infested with rabbits.  They go through the corn knocking it down and burrow here and there through the fields.  Farmers know all these things and that is why they are very alarmed at the prohibition Order in relation to rabbits.  They would give anything to have them completely wiped out.  I think there is very little need to explain further why this Order should be revoked and I hope the Minister will not put the matter to the House but do the right thing and revoke the Order.  It will be interesting to see what the Minister has to say in regard to the position and I do not want to challenge a division.</P>

      <P>Only that I do not want to bore the Seanad I would like to give them a little history about the rabbit question, and of what happened during the war.  As the war developed, in Great Britain, which was the export market for rabbits, they set up organisations to deal with imports there.  In 1941, an association called A.D.P.A.R., the initial letters of the wholesale distributors of poultry and rabbits, was set up in England and they declined to accept rabbits from individual exporters in this country and asked to have a central organisation set up here to do the exporting.  Previously we had an organisation here known as Eggsports, Limited, who were dealing with the export of poultry and eggs and they undertook the export of rabbits also then.  The price was fixed at a fairly good figure, much higher than was paid for rabbits pre-war, and the only condition laid down was that the rabbits would have to be sent over in good condition.  Eggsports, Limited, who were doing the exporting of rabbits, found it extremely difficult to get rabbits out in good condition in summer months and in 1942, they asked me to make an Order.  In the previous year, 1941, we went on with our exports and although they were big in that year only 10 per cent. of the amount sent out for the whole year went out during the five months May, June, July, August and September. Rabbit exports had been extremely high in that year, higher than they have been since and I mentioned the figure of 10 per cent. to show that there was no big natural export during those months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the following year they asked to have no exports sent out during May, June, July and August and that was done.  In 1943 they asked to have September added; in 1944 it was the same, and in 1945 they asked to have April added.  In fact, last year and this year again there was practically no export of rabbits between the end of March and the end of October, except in a few days.  That is the position as regards the making of the Order prohibiting the export of rabbits during a certain period.  I hear it said that there is a lot of rabbits in <Col N="1830" /> the country.  There is no means of taking a census of rabbits, but if you take the export figures you will find that in 1941 the export was 229,000 cwts. and that the figure reduced every year until 1942, when it was 72,000 cwts.  I take it that was an indication that the number of rabbits was getting less, but I have heard it being argued this year that the number of rabbits has increased in the country and that they seem to be very active.  That may be so, but, on the whole, I think the number of rabbits must be somewhat less in recent years.  The reason for this prohibition on the export of rabbits during a certain period was that we probably would have had a prohibition on the other side if we had not it here because it had been laid down as a condition that the rabbits should be sent out in good order.</P>
    <P>I was in one of the rabbit packing stores before the Order was made.  I heard Senators talk about having visited the bogs and that they were interested in what they saw, but I can tell them that if I took them down to the packing station for rabbits they would reject Senator Counihan's motion with ignominy, because they would not stand for rabbits going out from this country in the summer months when they were in such bad condition.  Senator Counihan mentioned that we were paying a subsidy on rabbits before the war.  We were, and the reason was that you will not get men to trap rabbits unless they get a good price, and if you do not get the rabbits trapped they will not be destroyed.  Therefore, we must see that the price is good and we can only keep it good by sending out the rabbits in good condition.  Rabbits will not go out in good condition in the summer, but only in the winter, and unless we keep up a good price the fact remains that the trappers will not work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was coming to that. Apart from this export business there was a certain market for rabbits during the summer.  Recently at my own place I met a man with a rabbit.  I was delighted to see the rabbit with him just as Senator Counihan would <Col N="1831" /> be, and I asked him what he was getting for it.  He said he was getting 2/-.  That was not a discouraging price at this time of year at any rate.</P>
      <P>I think the Seanad will have to agree that in the first place it is better to prohibit the export of rabbits rather than have a prohibition Order put on by the British Ministry of Food if the rabbits were going over in a bad condition. Secondly, even if we were to take the risk it is better that we should get a good price for rabbits so that they will be trapped and that good prices will be obtained during the winter months, but certainly not for exports during the summer months. We have had the same end in view as Senator Counihan has&mdash;to get rid of the rabbits as best we can, and that is why the Order was made.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Counihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will have to do my job on this matter.  There are farmers anxious to see what support they will get on this.  The Minister states he wants the rabbits in good condition, at the expense of the farmers of course. At the present time we are exporting veal and lamb to England and if that is going out in good condition I cannot see why rabbits could not also be sent out in good condition.  Rabbits are packed in cases and each of them is left hanging after having been paunched.  They are put into a box and properly packed.  I cannot see any reason why they have not been exported during all these years, and at the present time, too, when food is so badly wanted in England.  I cannot see why we should prohibit them for the sake of making a good thing for these poor Eggsports, Limited. I think that it is Eggsports, Limited, the Minister is thinking about.  He is not thinking of all the injury that is being done to the farmers.  It is his interest in Eggsports, Limited, that caused him to make this Order.  He did not consult the farmers before he made the Order to ascertain their view and I protest against his failure to do so.  I am putting the motion to the House and I hope it will approve of it. It is quite clear that the rabbits are causing destruction and I do not know <Col N="1832" /> why the Minister should, for the sake of making a good job for Eggsports, Limited, cause the farmers to be victimised.</P>

Think of all the skins we should have.  Think of all the food we should have.  I think that Senator Counihan has given the Minister food for thought, if not for actual consumption. Consequently, I appeal to him not to put the motion to a division.  If he does, I shall vote against it.</P>

      <P>May I point out that the body mentioned by Senator Counihan, Eggsports, Limited, cannot make a profit out of their business?  They are not a trading body and cannot make profits.  They are merely a committee for regulating matters.</P>

      <P>I am always out for a compromise.  Will the Minister promise to consider the question of not making the Order next year?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I consulted the Consultative Council on Poultry and Rabbits in connection with the Order and I shall consult them again next year.</P>

      <P>Will you consult the farmers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The farmers are represented on that council.</P>

      <P>Senator Counihan said that he did not know why lamb and veal should be shipped when rabbits could not be shipped.  Lamb and veal are not in the same category as rabbits.  The great bulk of the rabbits would be young and would not be fit for shipping.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCounihan" hpid="Mr. Counihan Mr. Counihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Counihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Then there should be prohibition of export for eight months of the year because there would be only four months in which they would be fit for shipping.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Rabbits are not examined by a veterinary surgeon before slaughter, as calves are.</P>

      <P>I think that the motion is worthy of more serious consideration than it has received.  A geat deal of damage is being done by the rabbits and I wonder if cold stores could not be utilised in this connection as they are utilised in most of the butchers' shops.  If something on those lines was <Col N="1834" /> provided, it would meet the position and remove a grievance, particularly on the part of small farmers.</P>
      <P>Motion, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
      <P>The Seanad adjourned at 8.25 p.m. until 3 p.m. on Wednesday, 29th May, 1946.</P>
