      <P>Since the Order Paper was circulated, we have received from the Dáil the Industrial Research and Standards Bill, 1946. We propose to put the Second Stage of that Bill, together with the Second Stage of Air Navigation and Transport Bill, 1946, on the Order Paper for to-morrow.</P>
      <P>Agreed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>Before this Bill is returned to the Dáil, I should like to refer to certain of the provisions that we have now passed and which I would ask the House to regard as most unsatisfactory.  This Bill leaves the House with the existing provisions with regard to the appointment of deputies&mdash;I do not mean Deputies of the Dáil but deputies acting for local government officials&mdash;practically unchanged. I admit that an amendment has been accepted by the Government under which Orders authorising the appointment of deputies are reviewed every six months, but such Orders are not, under the amendment, laid on the Table of either House and the public have no knowledge of what actually is happening in any individual case.  In fact we come to this, that the practice in a recent case which has created great disquietude amongst the public generally is still perfectly legal under our law and presumably that practice still has the approval of the Minister. I am glad, however, to see that the Taoiseach has suggested that the present practice does not appear to be altogether satisfactory and might be reconsidered, so I hope, in view of that <Col N="726" /> pronouncement in high places, that the Minister will consider some alteration and simplification of the present practice.</P>
      <P>I have also to ask at this stage&mdash;I asked it before and I am entitled to ask it again&mdash;when we are to receive from the Government an outline of the reforms in local government which, I think, the Minister himself has said are in contemplation.  We know it is proposed to appoint two new Ministers to do the work at present being done by one&mdash;in fact, when the reforms about which we have been told are brought about three Ministers will be sharing the work now done by one. The Taoiseach did me the honour on a motion I proposed in this House to come and say that we would be given shortly an indication of the new reforms.  That was&mdash;I am speaking entirely from recollection&mdash;six weeks ago and we have heard nothing yet. I hope now that the Minister may, in his closing remarks, give some indication of when we shall receive a memorandum&mdash;I do not like the term &ldquo;White Paper&rdquo; because it is so very loose&mdash;giving us some indication of the contemplated reforms, a memorandum which can be published, considered and be the subject of correspondence in the Press well in advance of any operative legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also asked the Minister&mdash;as I felt I was entitled to do&mdash;in connection with any future reforms, whether he could not get back to a position where local authorities had some real responsibility and did not have to go under some rigid regulation or go hat in hand to the central authority in all the details of their business.  I made a suggestion, which has not been dealt with yet, that the finances should be separated and that local authorities should be given certain spheres in which they alone were unfettered in finance, where the whole of the money for such services would be found from the rates and where there was no necessity for interference, in fact every reason why they should be left alone, in the discharge of their separate functions.  The other functions which were outside the financial resources of the local authorities could <Col N="727" /> be financed by the taxpayer and there the central authority could impose what conditions they like and the local authority would be used only in an agency capacity.</P>
    <P>That appears to be the only way we will ever get back to real initiative and restore to the elected representatives the independence which is their due and which is necessary if we are ever going to use local authorities as a training school in administration for the rising generation.  If we want to see the apotheosis of regulation, we have only to study that long clause which has been necessary to allow to local representatives a few paltry shillings for their travelling expenses.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has his Bill practically in the form in which he introduced it and I presume he is feeling very satisfied with the fruits of his labour in both Houses.  There are certain sections to which exception has been taken in both Houses, but the Minister has had his way.  I wish he could realise that the objections which have been raised in regard to those sections were serious objections, founded on the belief and the conviction that the form in which they were drafted was obnoxious to the principles of local government as many of us would like to understand them and have them interpreted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now that the Minister has his Bill, I hope that this instrument, which will be part of the machinery of local government, will be used wisely. Nothing could be more unsatisfactory or more unfortunate than a conflict between local authorities and the central executive.  I would like to have some indication from the Minister at this stage as to his view of the responsibility of local authorities.  Apparently, he has one view and many of us coming from the country have another.  We feel that men on local authorities are fully matured persons.  We want to see inculcated in our people, in their small communities&mdash;either in their urban district councils or in their county councils&mdash;such a spirit of citizenship and such a sense of responsibility as will urge them, in every decision they take, <Col N="728" /> to act wisely and courageously, in no narrow sense but in the best interests of the community as a whole.  If the central authority takes the line that local bodies are, in certain respects, not competent to take a decision after that fashion, there is a great error of judgment on the part of the executive. If the Minister uses the powers given in this Bill in a particular way, he will bring local government into disrepute and it may very well be that he will not succeed in raising the status of his own Department in the eyes of the country.</P>
    <P>We all want to see real progress, and even those of us who differed with the Minister in regard to the Bill or certain principles in it, are just as keen to see real progress as is the Minister or anybody who has subscribed to his point of view.  Yet there can be no strength in our society here unless society is strong at its roots and unless our local communities have a sense of responsibility and a desire for progress.  There is no use in trying to argue that the top, the central authority, can be all the time the sponsors of everything that is great and constructive and truthful. Unless our local councils and local councillors are trained in the first place with the belief and understanding that they are really responsible in their own areas for the good conduct of local affairs, you will not get them to interest themselves in the conduct of local affairs in that intelligent fashion which is necessary to take wise and progressive decisions.</P>
    <P>The Minister can give our local affairs that slant&mdash;or he can do the other thing.  If he wants to arrogate to himself and his Department the right to place local authorities, in every responsible decision which they have to take, in a subordinate position, he will get the sort of people on local councils who will be little better than slaves and for whom none of the intelligent people in the ratepaying community will have much respect. That is very undesirable from every point of view.</P>
    <P>I hope that this measure, for which the Minister is now obtaining sanction <Col N="729" /> from the Oireachtas, will be administered wisely and sympathetically.  Let the Minister try to get it into his head that, even if he may have lived all his life in towns and cities, there are grown-up people in the rural communities in the country.  Let him realise that, after the destruction on the Continent, where the whole social order had gone to pieces, the first aim of the people, in trying to provide some semblance of responsibility, was to establish responsible local councils. If anything should happen here, that would have to be the basis also.  It would be very disastrous and very unfortunate, therefore, if in the administration of local affairs, as far as the central executive were concerned, they created a situation where the local people had only contempt for the powers vested in local authorities or for the respect that the central authority had for the local authority.  The Minister has all the things he needs now and I hope his powers will be used wisely.  If not, he will breed another spirit in the country, a spirit and an atmosphere perhaps little more friendly to the Custom House than that which animated our people more than 25 years ago.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidJohnMadden" hpid="Mr. Madden Mr. Madden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Madden</NameTxt>
      <P>In a few brief words I wish to join with Senator Baxter and Senator Sir John Keane.  I think it was said four or five years ago, in a discussion in this House or outside it, that the present generations are taking very little interest, if any, in Governmental administration.  No young men to-day are bothering about our National Parliament or Government or taking an interest in the general administration of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is the reason of that?  It is admitted anyway through the country that the tendency over a number of years has been for too much centralisation. There is unquestionable evidence that there is less confidence in the people generally, especially when one remembers the continued, consistent and determined efforts of generations of our people through the Parliamentary machine that operated then to try to extract from an alien authority the right of national or local government.  At that time we were <Col N="730" /> called Hottentots because of some supposed racial defects or of our incapacity to govern.  I believe that we were even traduced as dishonest.  We were denied the rights of local government, but an experiment was introduced in 1898 and local government was established. The first county councils were then set up, and on them we had a fine body of men who gave unremunerated service.  Speaking for my own county, I know of two Ministers in two different Governments, who eulogised and paid compliments to the honesty, efficiency and progressive work that was done by the councils in my own county.  I am sure that good work of the same kind was done in the other counties.  That continued on down the years.  We had men of a fine standard elected to the local councils.  They attended the meetings week after week and discharged their duties with great efficiency.  At a later period the boards of health were established.  The members who served on those boards and attended the fortnightly meetings likewise received no remuneration for the great work they did, not even a cup of tea.  All that work, as I say, was characterised by Ministers in two of our national Governments as great progressive work.</P>
    <P>What position do we find ourselves in to-day?  The local councils have no power whatever.  Will the Minister tell me what powers they have? In my county, under the public health services, we disburse about £350,000 a year.  We formerly had control of all the county institutions, of the public health services, of the building of houses and cottages and the appointment of tenants to cottages.  All that has been changed. There is this disbursement of £350,000 in my county, but we have nothing to say to it except when the estimate is submitted to us once a year.  I would like to know from the Minister what power has been left to the public bodies.  I would ask him to realise the fact that at the last county council elections it was very hard to get responsible, intelligent men to go forward for election.  The result is that the personnel of county councils has not improved in recent years. <Col N="731" /> How can public men be expected to take an interest in the work of local government when they have practically no power?  In my county they have no control over the disbursement of that sum of £350,000.  That is the position in a county where you have 500,000 of a population.  They have not even power to appoint a tenant to a labourer's cottage.  The result is that some very undesirable selections have been made.  The local councillors have no control whatever over those selections.</P>
    <P>I would appeal to the Minister to see that, if local government is to be maintained in this country, some of the powers which have been taken from the local bodies &mdash; and practically all power has been taken from them&mdash; ought to be restored.  There ought to be a readjustment of the position.  All parties are represented on those local boards, and I can tell the Minister that if the present position continues we will not get responsible men to come forward and offer themselves for election. That is the feeling amongst the members of all parties in the country.  Why should they, when they have no power in the administration of the affairs of their areas?  The whole thing, as I say, is centralisation and the present position is drifting practically towards a dictatorship.  At the present time it takes months and months to get letters or other business attended to.  The energies of the members of local bodies are almost exhausted in making appeals to get business attended to. That is a condition of affairs to which I hope the Minister will give his attention.</P>
    <P>The local county councils should be regarded as a sort of preparatory school in which men would get experience in administration so that they might fit themselves for the discharge of their duties if elected to this House or to the Dáil.  I believe that service on a local body would give that training.  I am afraid that in future, however, that will not be the case because you will not get men of standing, who would take an interest in public administration, to come forward and serve on the <Col N="732" /> county councils.  The whole thing is directing itself towards centralisation and bureaucracy in Dublin.  I saw a letter in the newspapers the other day from Professor O'Rahilly in which he made the point that if you want anything you must go to Dublin, so that the whole thing is tending towards centralisation which is the very antithesis of democracy.  All that will undoubtedly have very serious reactions upon the interest which the people, both as individuals and as a collective body, should take in the administration of the affairs of the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>We had a good deal of discussion on this Bill both on the Committee and Report Stages.  I do not propose to traverse that ground again.  On this, the Fifth Stage of the Bill, I want to stress this point: that no matter what Government may be in power, and no matter what Minister for Local Government may be in authority in the Custom House, it will matter little if the services provided in the local areas cost more than the people can afford to pay.  It is the people who have to pay the piper, and in the years that lie ahead what we must consider is how much the people can afford to pay for the services provided. We must always remember that the vast majority of the ratepayers make and earn their living out of the land.  There is not much use in the year 1946 preparing large-scale and grandiose plans if, in the years that lie ahead, the people cannot afford to pay for them.  It should be our duty to ensure that the financial arrangements for the execution of those plans will not place an undue burden on the people who will have to carry it&mdash;the farmers and the members of the agricultural industry.</P>
      <P>During recent months, in order that I might be able to ascertain the views that had been expressed on local government throughout the years, and in order that I might be able to get, so to speak, a background for many of our discussions here, I have been reading some of the old Dáil debates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was particularly interested to read the debates that took place in the Dáil <Col N="733" /> on the local government estimates in 1928.  I was particularly interested to see that the whole theme adopted by the Minister and his colleagues&mdash;I do not mean the Minister, personally, but the colleagues of the Minister&mdash;at the time was that it was quite useless to plan social services which the country could not afford.  Of course, we were being told at that time that the country was being run on an imperial scale, but that has now evaporated completely so far as the present Government is concerned.  I found the particular sentence in that debate which very much appealed to me.  It was a sentence used by a speaker on the 23rd of May, 1928, in column 1841 of the Official Debates and in which he said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;While I thoroughly sympathise with those who wish to improve the social services, we must always take into account that we have to keep the social services so that the people will be able to meet the cost of them.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That happens to be a quotation from a particular Deputy who, I think, came from Waterford and whose name was Deputy Seán Goulding.  Therefore I think it is very appropriate that I should quote it at this stage.</P>
    <P>It is always important that that point of view should be kept before us and much of the objection that was taken in this House to Section 30 of the Bill was based on the foundation of fact that it is the people in the particular areas themselves who are best able to judge what the people of these counties can afford to pay; that it is the local people who know the circumstances and who know and understand what services are required very much better than what Senator Hayes referred to as the streamlined efficiency of the Custom House.</P>
    <P>This Bill is going from us now and will become law in a few days.  I want merely to stress that if in its administration that local angle and local responsibility are lost sight of then local finances will get into an impossible mess and the people will find that the services for which they are asked to pay are more than they can <Col N="734" /> possibly afford.  You are then going to find exactly what Senator Baxter and Senator Madden stated here that you will not get responsible people to take their part in public local administration, unless you treat them as men and not like children, and unless you put upon them responsibility and having given them responsibility permit them to carry it out, to shoulder their burdens in a proper way to meet that task.  I agree that public representatives should be taken to task if they do not do their job properly, but we should not be trying to keep them in apron-strings from Dublin all the time. If you do that the quality of local representation will decrease and decrease and there will soon be the situation in which you will have no one on local authorities able to make a co-operative and constructive effort in the planning of the particular counties concerned.</P>
    <P>That cannot be stressed often enough and I think the Minister has come a considerable way from where he was two or three years ago in respect of the position of elected representatives, <i>vis-á-vis</i> the managers.  If we are not going to have a managerial system as a dictatorship of the managers it is not going to be of much assistance if we transfer the dictation of the manager to the dictation of the Minister.  In that way you are not going to get any progress or solve the problems for the people in the various counties in the State.  Unless full, adequate and mature consideration is left to the elected representatives to work with the officials of their county then there will never be that co-ordination between local and central government which all of us agree is absolutely desirable and essential.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel that this Bill is a milestone on the way to the consolidation of local government law.  Local government law has been described by an eminent judge as a jungle and the Minister in this Bill has penetrated the jungle to a certain distance and has come out without losing his bearings. The jungle is very thick, however, and the undergrowth has to be cleared away before local government law in this country can be placed upon what might <Col N="735" /> be described as a readable basis.  I think the Minister deserves to be congratulated on making this preliminary effort, especially in connection with the law relating to bridges and to rating, and I trust that in the near future he will deal with other aspects of local government law.</P>
      <P>We have heard a great deal in this House about the rights of local authorities. These rights are set out in the form of statute law and he who runs may read.  Therefore, when a member of this House asked the Minister to state the powers of the elected members of local authorities he was simply asking the Minister to state what is the law, because the law is there and the Minister cannot change it.  While he may explain it, the Acts speak for themselves.  Senator Sweetman, when speaking on the Report Stage of this Bill on the 10th July, 1946, said in column 572 of the Official Report:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Senator Ryan's point of view appears to be that the manager should be all-powerful in local government, whereas my point of view is the reverse.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I would like to correct Senator Sweetman and I desire to say that the views which he attributed to me are not my views.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to hear it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have never said nor have I ever expressed the view that the manager should be all-powerful in local government.  My standpoint is the standpoint of the law because the law provides that the powers, functions and duties of local authorities shall be performed by the elected members of the local authority and by the manager as the case may be.  As between the elected members of local authorities and the managers I am perfectly neutral.  I have no axe to grind as between the elected representatives of the local authorities and the manager.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, when I have heard claims made on behalf of the elected members of local authorities which are not given to them by law my legal sense revolts and I must say what I believe to be the <Col N="736" /> actual legal position.  While I hold no brief for any manager, whether he is a city manager or a county manager, I do feel that there is a great tendency to make the managers scapegoats and I think that that attitude of mind should be changed.  The members of local authorities who feel that their powers have been cut down by statute and who realise that the elected members of local authorities have not got the powers they had before the introduction of the managerial system ought not to throw the blame upon the managers.  If any blame is to be attached, it is to the legislature which enacted those laws.  Therefore, I say that the elected members of local authorities&mdash;and there are elected members of such authorities on both sides of this House&mdash;should make an effort to make the best of the law as it stands, an effort to co-operate with the managers in the administration of the Local Government Act.  It is now rather late in the day to be decrying the deprivation of the powers of the elected members of local authorities, because the managerial system was initiated as far back as the year 1929&mdash; 17 years ago&mdash;and it has gone on apace since then.  It was first extended to the cities and later to the counties. While I do not attribute any improper motives to any member of any elected body, I do feel that a number of the members of elected bodies are humbugging themselves into believing that they have greater powers than the law gives them.  I read a considerable number of local papers every week and I am rather interested in the proceedings of local authorities.  I am tired reading debates which show that members of local authorities have interfered in matters with which, in law, they have no concern.  They take advantage of their position as what I might call independent members, free from official control of any sort, to upbraid and browbeat the managers. The managers are not responsible for the managerial system.</P>
    <P>The sooner that is realised the better.  By law, the managers are officials of the local authority.  They are officers of the local authority but they are not officers of the elected <Col N="737" /> members of the local authority who are only in the position of the manager himself&mdash;performing certain functions of the local authorities.  Therefore, I suggest that elected members of the local authorities should read the Local Government Acts and ascertain what are their powers and functions.  I suggest that they should confine themselves to these functions and should not intrude upon functions which are given, by law, to the managers.  The elected representatives of the people, no doubt, feel that there has been a slur upon them in being deprived of the powers formerly wielded by members of local authorities but, in my opinion, there should be no such feeling, because every member of an elected assembly knows what are the powers and functions of that assembly. Therefore, I suggest, in reply to Senator Sweetman, that the members of local authorities who have the power to make the rates and to impose burdens on the county should have regard to their responsibilities in the making of those rates.  I hope that this Bill, which we are now passing, will be the forerunner of a number of Bills to clear up the confusion which, undoubtedly, exists at present in local government law.</P>

      <P>Nuair a diúltíodh dhúinn an cuigiú céim den Bhille seo an tseachtain seo thart, bhí mé ag smaoineamh go mbféidir go raibh réasún maith ag na Seanadóirí a bhí in a naghaidh agus go gcloisfimís rud éigin nua nuair a thiocfadh an Bille ós ár gcómhair inniú.  O thosaigh an chainnt inniú go dtí anois, níor chualamar ach na rudai ceanna go mion agus go minic a chualamar nuair a bhí an Bille ós ár gcómhair cheana. Bhí mé ag suil go ndéanfaí tagairt don athrú mór atá tagtha ar chúrsaí rialtas aitiúil ó 1898.  Na daoine atá ag caint ar rialtas áitiúil agus atá ag lochtú na hathruithe a rinneadh sa dlí le déanaí, is cosúil nár thug siad fá deara agus nach dtugann siad fá deara chómh mór agus atá an saol athruithe agus chó mór agus atá rialtas áitiúil athruithe &mdash;chómh mór agus atá rialtas áitiúil tar éis dul i méid agus a chasta agus atá sé eirighthe.  Ní thuigeann siad <Col N="738" /> chó simplí agus a bhí gnaithe rialtais áitiúil fadó agus nách ionann gnó an ama san agus an gnó atá le déanamh anois.  Ní thuigeann siad nach bhfeileadh an tseirbhís a thug na comhairlí contae sna blianta atá thart don obair an lae indiu.  B'eigean dóibh dhá lá nó trí laethe san seachtmhain a thabhairt don obair anois chun é a dhéanamh go sasúil.  Dúradh, mar locht ar an Acht um Bainistí Chontae nach mbeadh daoine oiriúnacha cliste sásta dul ar na comhairlí contae.  Na daoine adeir sin, an gcreideann siad é?  Cuid de na daoine a labhair inniú rinneadar a ndicheall dul ar na comhairlí contae agus, do réir m'eoluis, déirigh leo.</P>
      <P>Tá eolas agam ar mo chontae féin&mdash; Contae na Gaillimhe.  Is fíor go bhfuil lucht an <i>Grand Jury</i> imthithe as an gComhairle Chontae i gContae na Gaillimhe ach ní hionann sin agus a rá nach bhfuil na fir óga&mdash;feirmeóirí, siopadóirí, múinteóirí agus daoine eile &mdash;gach orlach chomh cliste agus chomh tuigsionach leis na daoine a bhí ann rompu, agus dar liom, tá níos mó spéise ag na fir óga san obair.  Is dícéillí an rud a rá nach bhfuil aon spéis ag an phobal sa rialtas áitiúil ó tháinig an tAcht um Bainistí Chontae i bhfeidhm.  Ní dóigh liom go ndeachaidh an oiread iarrthóirí isteach fán toghadh ariamh sna contaethe agus a chuaidh isteach fán toghadh deireannach. Nach léir ón ní sin go bhfuil spéis ag na daoine san rialtas aitiúil? Is aisteach an dóigh in a n-abrann daoine rudaí nach mbionn bun no barr leo&mdash;rudaí ar a mbeadh fios acu dá mba rud é nach raibh a súile dúnta agus gan a cluas le h-éisteacht orthú.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deirtear go bhfuil na daoine mi shásta leis an dlí rialtais aitiúil. Nach fíor é go ndearna Fine Gael, Clann na Talmhan agus an lucht oibre a ndícheall ag an toghadh deireannach an tAcht um Bainistí Chontae do thabhairt isteach már ábhar conspóide i ngach ceárd den tír&mdash;i gContae Cill Dara, i gCondae Muineacháin, i gContae an Chabháin agus i nGaillimh?  Nach fíor é gur phléidh siad an cheist ós cómhair na ndaoine agus gur dhiúltigh na daoine glacadh leis na tuairimi?  Níl aon údarás leis an gcainnt seo go bhfuil an pobal <Col N="739" /> míshásta leis an Acht um Bainistí Chontae.  Tá daoine míshásta anseo agus ansiúd ach nuair a deirtear go bhfuil an pobal míshásta, ní ceart é, go h-áirithe má's amhlaidh go bhfuiltear ag iarraidh a rá go bhfuil an tromlacht mi shásta.  Rinneadh tagairt d'Alt 30 agus fuarathas locht air.  Faoi Alt 30 beidh de dhualgas ar an gcomhairle chontae &ldquo;to maintain at a reasonable standard the public service for the maintenance of which the rating authority is responsible.&rdquo;  Ar dhiúltaigh aon Chomhairle chontae sin a dhéanamh roimhe seo?  Tá a fhios againn gur fhág comhairli contae áirithe seirbhísí poiblí gan airgead agus nár choinnigh siad cuid de na seirbhísí poiblí ar caighdeán réasúnta. Dá mba rud é nár thárla a leithéid seo b'fhéidir go mbéadh údarás ag na daoine atá ag fáil lochta ar an alt so acht is fíor gur thárla a leithéid de rud.  Os rud é go bhfuil an scéal mar tá sé, nach ceart údarás a bheith ag an Aire iallach a chur ar na ndaoine seo a ndualgas do chomhlionadh is cuma an dtaithníonn sé leo, nó nach dtaithníonn.</P>
    <P>Cuireadh Comhairle Contae fá chois tamaillín ó shoin toisc nár choinnigheadh na seirbhísí poiblí ar caighdeán réasúnta.  Dúradh gurb tíoranacht é sin agus nach raibh na daoine sásta léi ach ní fíor é san.  Chó luath agus a fuair na daoine faill, caitheadh amach an dream a dhiúltaigh na seirbhísí poiblí a choimeád ar caighdeán réasúnta agus cuireadh isteach dream a rinne beart do réir brí an ailt seo.</P>
    <P>Is iontach nach ndearn na daoine a bhí ag cainnt ar thíoránacht, tagairt don fhiosrachán áitiúil poiblí a cuirfeas an tAire ar bun má tá sé míshásta le comhairle.  Bheidh cead ag na daoine agus ag lucht nuachtáin a bheith i láthair ag an bhfiosruchán sin agus má léir nar thuig an comhairle contae a ndualgas, tabharfar deis dóibh an fhaillighe a leigheas.  Ma's rud é nár thuig an tAire an scéal i gceart, tá cumhacht faoi fho-alt (2) aige an dearmad a leigheas.  Is iontach gur dhún na cainteoirí a súile ar an alt so.  Dá léadh siad an talt so bheadh orthu a bheith in a dtost agus sin rud nach bhfeileann dóibh.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="740" /> Rinneadh tagairt don chostas a bheidh ann i gcomhair rialtas áitiúil san am atá le teacht.  Táim ar aon intinn leis na daoine a dúirt go gcaithfimid súil a choimeád ar chaitheamh airgid ach tá súil agam go bhfeicimíd go gcaithfear airgead ar na seirbhísí poiblí do réir mar bheas gá leis agus do réir mar bheas na daoine in ann é d'íoc.  Nuair a bhí an cogadh ar siúl, bhí daoine ag éirí suas lá i ndiaidh lae agus ag fógairt: &ldquo;Is féidir leis an Rialtas airgead a fháil i gcomhair cuspóirí míleata, cuspóirí cogaidh agus cuspóirí airm ach ní féidir leo airgead a fháil i gcomhair cúrsaí síochánta, síbhialtachta, cúrsaí a rachadh chun leasa an phobail.  Tá súil agam go mbéimíd in ann airgead dá chaitheamh ar leas an phobail anois agus go n-aontochaidh na daoine a labhair in aghaidh airgid a chaitheamh, go bhfuil sé chomh riachtanach airgead a chaitheamh in am síochána ar rudaí mar iad seo agus a bhí le linn an ré éigeandála airgead a chaitheamh ar cuspóirí míleata.  Tá áthas orm gur tháinig an Bille chun chinn.  Comhartha is ea é go bhfuilimid fásta agus a dul chun cinn suas agus tá mé cinnte go mbeidh rath ar an obair a déanfar faoi.</P>

      <P>As one who is a member of public bodies, in the position which I occupy I should like to state that apart altogether from the fact that I have not been legally trained, the only true guide and outlook that one may effectively bring to bear on the discharge of his public duties is the old knowledge that a juryman must have when he comes to give his decision in a case of law, and that is to be guided by commonsense.  Sometimes, I think, we are not guided by commonsense.  I think Senator Ryan, when he expects members of public bodies to study every Act and bring to bear upon them the knowledge which solicitors, barristers, or the distinguished men who reached the glorious position of a judgeship possess, is setting up a standard which cannot be expected from one like myself who has to earn his living by the plough.  Nevertheless, it is by the plough we all must live.  The most <Col N="741" /> efficient animal to deal with the plough is the horse, so I should like to bring to bear upon the discharge of my task some horse sense.  If the horse fails me, I shall have to fall back on the donkey and bring to bear upon the question some ass sense.  When I hear Senators speak in the clouds I should like to suggest to them that that is the best way to approach the consideration of the laws which we pass here. When we are invited to approve of everything the Minister does, to study Acts of Parliament and to disregard the dictates of our consciences, I think we have only to look to the rural parts of Ireland and to see the flight from the land to realise that all is not going as well as some Senators would have us believe.</P>
      <P>What is the great cause of the flight from the land?  One of the causes is the ever-increasing rates.  What has the abolition of public bodies done to relieve rates?  We brought down, to the various counties it is true, a number of managers at £1,200 a year.  Sometimes they did very well.  I am always anxious, when speaking on this subject, lest my remarks might be interpreted as finding fault with the managers, to say that I have no fault to find with the managers that have come into my district.  The only fault I have to find with managers in general is that they are not always guided by commonsense.  The manager we have at the present time is a most conscientious official.  He does nothing but what the council tell him to do. He is a most efficient manager.  He was our secretary, but they took him away to another county where, apparently, the council could not get on with him and he came back to us. Personally I think he is happy and I am perfectly happy with him.</P>

      <P>Senator Ryan told us that the Managerial Acts were originated in 1929, but the Government have introduced so many changes into the local government system that the people do not know where they are at present.  When they read the papers they are mesmerised. <Col N="742" /> Talk about studying Acts of Parliament! When you try to tell people something of what is happening, their comment generally is: &ldquo;Of course we can well believe it but we think we have heard only half of it.  There is far worse than that.&rdquo;  What a change from the time when the people gathered around the forge fires to read the local paper and to discuss local administration! They discussed local administration around the firesides in the cabins in which some of us were born and to which some of us might like to go back.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A few years ago we heard a lot about parish councils.  The Taoiseach went down to Clonmel and addressed a meeting in conjunction with Fr. Hayes and one would think from his remarks that we were to have parish councils the next day.  We were told they were to replace the boards of guardians. In the days of the old rural councils whenever a parish wanted, say, a pump the matter was given the fullest consideration and the people of the parish would know what it would cost.  What right had the Government ever to abolish these councils?  What was the meaning of it except to give contracts, which were formerly given to local people, to Dublin firms and foreign contractors? The most a man would get out of a local contract would be £5, but how many &ldquo;fivers&rdquo; are spent nowadays on foreign contractors?  I think I would be doing an injustice to the Minister, that I would be acting the part of a hypocrite, if I did not dissociate myself from the policy which is now being pursued.  I would be doing an injustice to the Taoiseach if I did not say that I welcomed his announcement as to the setting up of parish councils.  If such councils were in existence, people would know what was happening on the councils when they read the local paper, and they would read local news with far more interest than they read it now.  If a man went wrong on a council in the old days there was a quite way of dealing with him&mdash;he quickly lost his influence with the local electors.  &ldquo;He is looking for a job for himself&rdquo; they would tell you.  How many such men <Col N="743" /> lost the chairmanship of councils because they were looking for jobs?</P>
    <P>In the old days there was a local paper in Dundalk known as the <i>Dundalk Examiner</i>, and there was a family of the name of McGahon living in the town at the same time, the members of which were constantly winning scholarships.  When some members of that family were elected to the local council, the <i>Examiner</i> said that the council was educating the members of the family, simply because one of the members of the family happened to be the editor of the other Dundalk paper. If the ratepayers see that some men are anxious to get on local councils in order to get jobs for themselves, they will quickly turn against these people and send them into retirement.</P>
    <P>By bringing to bear on the problems of local government the horse-sense that was to be found generally amongst the members of these bodies in the old days, a far greater degree of efficiency was attained than could have been produced by the trained men of whom Senator Ryan speaks.  The great need at the moment is to bring about a reduction in local taxation by derating or otherwise so as to make rural Ireland the ideal place that we all wish to live in.  We are not going to achieve that result by the methods which are being pursued at present.  The Taoiseach was on right lines when he declared that he wanted to give the powers formerly exercised by boards of guardians to parish councils and when he said that parish councils should have the initiative in local matters, with the county councils as supervising authority.  The initiative should rest at all times with the local council and not with the Department in Dublin.  These are my views.  They may be unpopular with the Minister. He may think that I am half &ldquo;balmy&rdquo; but I think I would be false to the people I represent if I did not express them.  They may not find any approval in the Custom House but I feel that they have a stronger place in the hearts of the people to-day than the Custom House and I think they should be expressed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator McGee has objected to this Bill because it does not derate land.  The question of derating has been considered in this country for a very long time.  First of all, a commission was set up by the last Government when they were in office.</P>
      <P>They came to the conclusion that derating was not and never would be a feasible proposition in Ireland.  Derating in England is an entirely different matter as there are miles and miles of road covered with houses and it is practically all a town, with very little land.  The vast valuation of the towns is so many thousands of times greater than the value of the land that one could easily derate the land in England as the increase on the buildings would be very small.  The factories, shops and dwellinghouses with which the country is studded over, would make it easy to clear the land of all derating.  It is entirely different in this country, where the people would not be able to live in the towns if we had derating, as they would be rated out of existence.</P>
      <P>While this Bill was going through, I complained that in one section the Minister was making certain rates county-at-large charges and I felt that that would be putting an extra burden on the towns.  My argument was considered, but not accepted; but if Senator McGee had his way there would be no towns, as they would be impoverished in a very short time if they had to pay for the derating of all the land in the country.  The Government has gone a very long way to release the farmer from his burdens. They gave the double agricultural grant and in the present Budget&mdash; which Senator McGee seems to have forgotten&mdash;£1,000,000 is provided for the relief of the rates of the farmers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator McGee says that people are leaving the country and seems to complain that this Bill or local government generally is accountable for that.  I cannot see the connection at all.  This extra money is intended to enable the farmers to give an increased wage to the agricultural labourer and keep him on the land, so there seems no point at all in the Senator's argument that <Col N="745" /> people are leaving the land because of local government, either under this Bill or under any Act previously passed.</P>
    <P>Some people have objected to the County Management Act and it has been used here as a political argument against the present Government.  It must be remembered that the idea was conceived by the previous Government and was brought into force in 1929 in regard to certain areas.  It was intended to be applied to the whole of the country and would have been applied if there had not been a change of Government.  The present Government has been slow enough in bringing it into force.  The Act was passed only in 1940 and did not come into force until August, 1942.  Whether it is good or bad, both Governments are accountable for it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is gratifying to me to know that, after the prolonged discussion which we have had on this Bill here, the intelligence and good sense of the Assembly should have triumphed and that this Bill is going back to the Dáil &mdash;as Senator Sir John Keane said and Senator Baxter also indicated&mdash; practically unchanged in its significant provisions.  I think it is a great tribute to the House that notwithstanding the highly coloured misrepresentation of which the provisions of this Bill were made the object, truth should have prevailed and commonsense should be triumphant.  When first it came here, this Bill was represented, by that small group in the Seanad which chose to oppose it, as an attempt to curtail further the rights and powers of the local authorities.  In replying to that criticism, I dealt <i>in extenso</i> with all the various provisions of the Bill and I showed that, so far from curtailing the powers of the local authorities, it, on the contrary&mdash;except, perhaps, in one instance&mdash;endeavoured to enlarge them and did confer on the local authorities certain powers which they had not possessed previously.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is rather a matter for regret, however, that persons of experience both as legislators and as members of <Col N="746" /> the local authority should endeavour to create an impression in the public mind that there is any conflict of jurisdiction as between the local authority and the central executive. Senator Baxter said that nothing would be more unfortunate than that a conflict should arise between the central executive and the local authority. I do not think that such a conflict will or can arise, because the local authorities do not exercise their functions in the discharge of any natural right. They are subordinate bodies and&mdash;except in a minor way, in regard to bylaws and such regulations as they themselves may make&mdash;they cannot be held to be legislative authorities.  They are bodies which were brought into existence in the very early days by the central authority to fulfil certain local obligations.  They were bodies which were brought into existence almost <i>ad hoc</i> in order that they might discharge certain specific responsibilities which were laid by the central authority upon their local area.  As far as my knowledge of their origin goes, they may be said to have been brought into existence, in the first instance, in order to ensure that the king's highways, his roads and his bridges, should be properly maintained: in order that he might make his customary progresses with due dignity and with full security.  It was because this involved a certain expenditure in money, materials and labour on the part of the inhabitants of the local area concerned, that we had convened the first grand session of jurymen or burgesses or knights or property owners in the particular shire which was to be made the subject of the royal visit. We cannot, in dealing with these arguments, allow even Senator Baxter to erect these local authorities, with which he is so much concerned, into little satrapies or republics or statelets. They are, in fact, as I said at the outset, administrative and executive bodies called into being by the local authority in order to ensure that the local services shall be properly maintained and looked after.  It would be a most unfortunate thing, from the point of view of the development of local administration, if this false <Col N="747" /> theory as to the powers and origin of the local authorities were to gain any sort of currency or any sort of acceptance among our people.</P>
    <P>We have had also running through this debate an attempt to set up a false antithesis as between the local authority and the Central Government. We had it to-day, not only in the statements which have been made in the speech of Senator Baxter but also in the speech of Senator Sweetman. Senator Sweetman said that it matters little what local services are to be provided if the cost of them is more than the people in the local areas are able to pay.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir John Keane Sir John Keane">

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>That simply means this in the last resort: any State service beyond the taxable capacity of the people, but the logical position which members of local authorities and which some members of the Seanad have taken up is that these services are to be provided, and that while people living in specified local areas are entitled to the full benefit of them, nevertheless, they are not to be called upon to pay for those services in their capacity as ratepayers.  That, as I say, is based upon the view that an antithesis, a false antithesis, can be set up as between the local authorities and the Central Government, between the local areas and the State.  The local areas form part of the State&mdash;the State is composed of them&mdash;and there is no use in saying that what the local authority cannot afford to bear that the State can afford to bear.  There is no logic or sense in that.  If the position were to be taken up that ratepayers, as property owners, cannot bear it, and that, therefore, the people who have no property must bear it, the speciousness of the argument would at once betray itself.  Surely, if we were to claim that the services are beyond the capacity of people who have property to bear them, and that, therefore, the main burden must be put upon those who have no property, or who occupy property of such insignificant value that they might as well be said to have no property at all, <Col N="748" /> then, of course, as I have said, the speciousness of the argument would at once betray itself, and those who have been trying to set up here that false opposition as between the local authorities and the central executive would at once be disowned.</P>
      <P>Senator Sir John Keane was a particular exponent of this theory: that the owners and occupiers of property, as such, should only be called upon to bear a definite limited cost of the public services, and that all other costs should be borne by the central authority.  I will go so far as to accept Senator Sir John Keane's proposal to this extent, that where the benefit of a local service is restricted to that particular area, then a particular charge for that particular service should be imposed upon that particular area, but where, as in the case of many county services and many national services, the benefits are enjoyed by the people of the county as a whole, where they all benefit directly or indirectly from them, as they do, for instance, so far as the operation of the public health services is concerned then, I think, that a very good case can be made for asking the people in the local areas to contribute definitely upon some specified basis to those services which, even though nation-wide, benefit them locally in the major degree.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, we all know that the occupation of property is a reasonable index&mdash; I am not saying that it is an infallible one&mdash;but, it is a reasonable index of a person's ability to bear taxation and to contribute to the public services.  On the other hand, the mere fact that a person must spend a definite amount on food and clothing to sustain himself in health makes the imposition of indirect taxation in the form of taxes on food, clothes and transport, fall with undue severity on the general mass of the people.  A very large proportion of our State income is derived in that way, and, therefore, one has to be very careful to ensure that the burdens which should be properly borne by the local authorities should not be passed on to the State, because the consequence of transferring them in this way would <Col N="749" /> mean that a very large proportion of the taxpayers of the country would be bearing an undue share of the burden, and would, perhaps, be taxed beyond their reasonable capacity.  But that is precisely what Senator Sir John Keane is demanding.  He is demanding, in fact, that the burden of maintaining local public services by the local authorities should be reduced in order that the ratepayers may be relieved of those burdens, and in order that they may be transferred to the general mass of the taxpayers.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to labour this aspect of the matter unduly but it is an aspect that we have to keep in mind when we are endeavouring to determine what would be a fair ratio to set up as between the portion of the cost of the public services which should be borne by the local authorities, that is to say the ratepayers, and the portion to be borne by the central authority, that is to say the taxpayers of the country.  It is quite true that all of us have a dual personality in this matter.  We are at once ratepayers and taxpayers at the same time; and when we are big ratepayers we naturally tend to exaggerate perhaps our share of the burden as ratepayers and to say that it would be very much better if the little ratepayer&mdash;that is the indirect taxpayer in general-accepted as a taxpayer a very much larger share of the cost.  The position is, however, that the Government has to <Col N="750" /> have regard, not only to the ratepayers but to the taxpayers, and to the capacity of both classes to pay, and, therefore, has to try to maintain, by rough and ready means if you like, a fairly equitable balance as between them.</P>
    <P>I am sorry that Senator Sweetman is absent because he had apparently indulged in a great deal of research in the past four or five weeks to inform himself as to the background and surrounding circumstances under which this Bill has been produced, and I had intended to correct the misapprehension which he seems to labour under.  In the course of several of the speeches which he made here Senator Sweetman has taken credit to himself for bringing about a change of mind and of attitude on the part of the Minister in relation to the position of the managers and the elected bodies under the County Management Act, 1940.</P>
    <P>I have here the Report of the Department of Local Government and Public Health for 1942-43 and in it appears a circular letter dated 20th August, 1942, in which is set out the views of the then Minister for Local Government, and who has not been changed since, on the relations which should exist between the county managers on the one hand and the elected representatives on the other and as to their respective powers and functions.  I find that on the 20th August, 1942, I set out my views in the following form:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The functions of county councils and elective bodies as defined in Section 1 (3) of the Act are divided into reserved functions and executive functions.  The reserved functions are those exercised by county councils and elective bodies.  These are set out in detail in the Second Schedule of the Act.  Every function which is not a reserved function of a county council or elective body is exercisable by the manager who will discharge on behalf of the local body all executive functions.</P>
    <P>The reserved functions of county councils and the elective bodies include the making of the rate and the borrowing of money.  The determination of policy and the ultimate control <Col N="751" /> of finance, therefore, rests with the elected members of public bodies. The county manager's duty will be the execution of policy and the spending of funds that are made available. He will be entrusted with and be responsible for the successful conduct of the public business of the county.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Following the issue of that circular the Estimate for the Department of Local Government was discussed in Dáil Eireann on the 3rd and 4th November, 1943.  In the course of my reply to the debate on the Estimate I said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That leads me naturally to this other aspect of the matter.  I do not regard county managers as being in any way superior to the elected bodies.  On the contrary, in my view, the elected bodies are the paramount element in local administration. I am determined&mdash;I mean in no arbitrary way, but so far as my views can influence the operation of this Act&mdash;to make it quite clear to everybody that those who constitute the elected representatives of the ratepayers are of paramount influence in local affairs, in just the same way as this Assembly here is the paramount influence in the government of the nation.  But this Assembly does not want to concern itself with what is happening to this particular civil servant or that particular State employee.  Deputies can put down questions and, if they are not satisfied with the Minister's explanation, they can express their views and opinions in that regard but they do not &lsquo;butt&rsquo; in on his day-to-day management of his Department.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I went on to say, speaking on the fact that there were certain functions reserved to the manager:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The reservation is no wider in the case of a county manager than it is, say, in the case of a Minister.  I mean, it mainly relates to the control of the staff.  The Minister has control of his staff.  That control is hedged round by certain precedents and traditions.  The county manager is charged with the control of his staff. The control of the staff of the local <Col N="752" /> authorities is vested in the county manager and, of course, it is hedged round, too, with certain precedents and certain conditions.</P>
    <P>That is just the position of the county manager.  I think it is on all fours with that of the Minister, except that a county manager is, perhaps, much more rigidly subject to the control of the members of the elected authority than sometimes Ministers or Governments are subject to that of the elected representatives of the people, because, if the local authority want to give directions to the county manager, they can do so without the danger of creating any serious political crises.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was in November, 1943.  On the 27th January, 1944, this circular was issued to each local authority and, of course, to all the members of the local authorities.  It was issued before Senator Sweetman became either chairman or vice-chairman of the Kildare County Council.  This circular said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The elected representatives are given by the Act of 1940 wide powers in connection with the exercise by the county manager of executive functions.  The manager is bound by the decisions of the elected body on the provision made by them in the annual estimates, and save with their consent he cannot exceed the total amount provided by them for any particular purpose.  He must whenever requested by the local authority furnish all information in his possession or procurement concerning any business of the authority. Subject to some exceptions set out in sub-section (5) of Section 29 of the Act any council or elective body at a meeting specially summoned for the purpose can by resolution passed in accordance with that section require the manager to do any particular thing which he can lawfully do as part of his executive functions.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Later on in this circular I went on to say this:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The representatives of the electorate are the controlling <Col N="753" /> element in local affairs.  It is for them to formulate policy and in association with the manager to consider the solutions for local problems.  A loyal acceptance by the manager of the predominant position of the elected body will do much to elicit from them the support to which he is entitled in the discharge of his duties.  The law gives the manager the right to take part in the discussions of local bodies.  When he does intervene he should do so with tact and discretion.  The manager must be prepared to give advice readily to members who are unacquainted with official routine and be obliging and courteous in his dealings with members of the local body and the public.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Following this in 1944-45 this circular was issued in which I stated:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;A county manager is not an authority exercising powers independently of the local body.  He is by law an officer of the county council and the responsibility of the county council in relation to him is quite clear.  The county council are the general supervisory authority in county affairs and the manager comes within their jurisdiction.  If, for instance, the county council have reason to believe that the manager has failed to perform the duties of his office satisfactorily or has become unfit to hold his office, they can by a majority of not less than two-thirds, suspend him whilst the question of his fitness is being investigated, and if after investigation it is found that he should not remain in office, they can, by the same majority and with the Minister's consent, remove him.  There can be no doubt that the council are the controlling power.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Then I went on to deal with reserved functions.  I said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Under the system of management in operation here, the various functions to be discharged fall into three classes.  The first class comprises functions which are performed directly by the elected members, second comprises executive functions <Col N="754" /> which are performed through and by the manager and the third supervisory powers performed directly by the elected members.  The supervisory powers of the elected body include a general power to supervise the performance by the manager of the executive functions, power to examine and revise the estimates, power to obtain information and plans, and power to direct the manager to do specified things... The elected members have the power of the purse.  They exercise this in much the same way as the Dáil exercises similar power.  The county manager cannot spend until the local authority have authorised him to do so.  He is bound by their decisions on the provisions made by them in the annual estimates, and save with their consent, he cannot exceed the total amount provided by them for any particular purpose. The council alone have the power to make the rate and borrow money. They must, of course, maintain the services they are bound by law to maintain but there is considerable discretion allowed them as to the manner in which they shall discharge these obligations.  The annual estimates are drawn up by the manager and presented to the members with an explanatory memorandum.  It is part of the functions of the members to examine these estimates in detail and if necessary revise them before adoption.  Subject to their carrying out their legal obligations, it rests with them to decide how much shall be provided for each service.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think I have given to the House enough documentary evidence to show that there is no foundation whatever for the sort of statement we have been listening to from some members of the Seanad in the course of this debate.  I hope that having read these statements that Senator Madden who was so anxious to know precisely what are the functions of the local authority will have no difficulty now in informing himself fully on the matter, by reading in full the documents from which I have quoted.  I was rather surprised to hear Senator Madden saying here that it was impossible now to get responsible <Col N="755" /> and intelligent men to come forward and participate in local affairs.  I presume that Senator Madden is speaking for his own Party in this regard because I have not heard this sort of statement from any other quarter in this House during this debate.</P>

      <P>I have not heard it, and I must assume that the real difficulty which Senator Madden and his friends are experiencing in this regard is due to the fact that the people have found them out, so that responsible and intelligent men are not prepared to go forward on their behalf.  That is, if these statements are literally true, but knowing Senator Madden and Senator Baxter I refuse to accept them as being precise statements of fact.  On the contrary, I think that irresponsibility and lack of intelligence which on occasions have characterised some utterances here are assumed and are not by any means real.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator McGee unfortunately is out of the House because I would like to have informed him upon one matter which appeared greatly to disturb him. He asked where had the abomination come from into Ireland of abolishing rural councils.  I should have thought that Senator McGee should have been able to answer that question himself, and I am perfectly certain that if he forgets the answer Senator Baxter will be able to make good the deficiency. The rural district councils were abolished by the first Minister for Local Government and Public Health and the first President of the Executive Council of the Irish Free State, a gentleman no longer actively participating in politics but of whom Senator McGee and Senator Baxter were warmhearted admirers and staunch supporters. When I say this I do not wish to decry their affection in this regard in any way.  I am merely reminding them of the fact and emphasising what Senator Ryan told them; that we are witnessing here the expansion and development of local government.  It is the fact that we have from time to time to bring in measures of this sort and put them before the Seanad that proves <Col N="756" /> that government and local administration are not static things but that they are dynamic, living and growing and that any deficiencies in them have to be dealt with here in the Oireachtas, and that we have the machinery and organisation for ensuring that when established procedures and practices have been out-dated by the progress of affairs and by the increasing complexity of our problems, they can be amended and made workable.  I am glad to be able to say to Senator Baxter and I hope he regards it as a matter of congratulation as I do, that the Bill is going back to the Dáil substantially in the form as it came to the Seanad.  That is a tribute to the good sense and independence of this Assembly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>Sub-section (2) of this section provides that &ldquo;whenever the Government makes an Order under this section, the Government may, in lieu of making provision for or doing any particular thing in or by such Order, authorise or empower by such Order a Minister or any other person specified or indicated in such Order to make the said provision,&rdquo; and so forth.  I cannot understand why these words are inserted in the sub-section&mdash;&ldquo;or any other persons specified or indicated in such Order.&rdquo;  It seems to me that the powers conferred by Section 2 fall under seven headings which are set out in sub-section (1), paragraphs (a) to (g), inclusive.  These are powers to make regulations for the control of supplies or services, for the control or prohibition of the import or export of particular classes of goods, for the acquisition or seizure of foreign currency, control over the use of land, for the giving of authority to local bodies in certain cases, for the giving of State guarantees <Col N="757" /> in regard to the interest and principal on borrowings by certain bodies and for the reduction or suspension of certain duties.  These are the matters which may be provided for under sub-section (1) of Section 2.</P>
      <P>It seems to me that while it may be proper in certain cases to authorise the Minister to make Orders in relation to these matters, for instance in relation to the user of land, there is no justification for authorising any person other than the Minister to exercise the authority which is conferred by the section.  It may be that what is contemplated is that a Parliamentary Secretary or a permanent secretary of a Department over his own name may make these Orders.  I think it would be unwise for us to pass a Bill of this kind, in which a provision is made in relation to the seven points I have mentioned, authorising the making of Orders by some persons other than the Minister.  I would urge the Minister to consider whether these words should not go out.</P>

      <P>This sub-section is identical with Section 2 (3) of the Act of 1939.  One use that was made of that section of the Act of 1939 was to appoint a controller with power to regulate flour and bread supplies.  It is not certain that it may not be necessary to have such a post in future.  Therefore, it is considered essential that the Minister should have power to authorise a person such as the Controller of Bread and Flour Supplies to carry on this work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is, in many ways, very different from the Act of 1939.  It has a much narrower scope than the Emergency Powers Act.  It authorises the doing of things which are mentioned in sub-section (1), by Order.  The sub-section says that &ldquo;the Government may whenever they think fit, by Order, do all or any of the following things.&rdquo;  It sets out these things and then, taking account of the fact that it may be desirable that the Minister should have power once this Order is made, to regulate some of the things to which I refer, the Bill makes provision in sub-section (2) for that <Col N="758" /> power being exercised by the Minister. Then it goes on to say: &ldquo;or any other person specified in the Order&rdquo; made by the Government may exercise these powers.  If these powers are to be exercised other than by the Government, I would suggest that that should be done by the Minister.  If an Order has to be made relating to the control of flour or bread, that Order should be made by the Minister and should not be made by any other person.  I think we are going very far if we insert a provision that Orders under a Bill of this kind in relation to the seven matters I have mentioned, are to be handed over to the discretion of a person who will not be answerable to this House.  We shall have no right to raise any question regarding the manner in which a person other than the Minister performs these functions. I would urge very strongly that the Minister should not press to have that provision inserted.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister tell us in how many other instances somebody was authorised to act in this capacity? In the first place, I should like to make this remark in relation to the sub-section.  Surely the Minister can visualise a loosening up of the position, when the same powers will not be necessary?  The whole point which he makes would be very well met by authorising the Minister for Supplies to act in this way.  I agree with the case made by Senator Duffy and I think myself the Minister ought to see the reasonableness of it.  The Minister refers to the Controller of Bread and Flour Supplies.  I find it difficult to visualise any situation where a controller of flour would be necessary for the proper control or distribution of flour in a way that could not be arranged by the Minister for Supplies. Looking at it sensibly, it is all important that a power like that should not be delegated to any other person.  The phrase is very wide as it is.  Anybody at all can be vested with authority under this sub-section.  Perhaps the Minister would enlighten us as to how many persons were vested with authority of this kind in the past and what the prospects are of having to use that power in future?  The point <Col N="759" /> which the Minister makes, it seems to me, could be adequately met by vesting the Minister for Supplies with that power.</P>

      <P>I was aware that a similar power was given in the 1939 Act but, to the best of my recollection, when it was given in 1939 there was a certain amount of misgiving expressed. The situation that existed then was such that it was perfectly possible that Parliament might not be able to meet at all and it seemed necessary to provide the Government with the maximum power.  I do not know whether there is any case other than that of the Controller of Flour in which this power was given to a senior official in a Department or whether under strict law the Minister was or was not responsible under the section.  In fact, he was, because the official was a senior official of the Department and questions could be put to the Minister and the matter could be raised in debate.  The really fundamental thing that arises is that there should be some measure of Parliamentary control.  I hardly think there could be any possible intention on the part of the Government to go outside the senior Civil Service in giving powers of this kind.  Certain undertakings were given in 1939, and I think we might have an undertaking now that this power will not be given, while the present Government is in office, other than to persons who are responsible to Parliament, through the Ministers concerned.</P>

      <P>Might I ask the Minister whether any of the powers delegated under Section 2 would come within the provisions of Section 8 and be tabled automatically in both Houses of the Oireachtas?  That would give some control over them.  Section 8 says that every document or subsidiary instrument made on or after the operative date shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and there are powers to annul.  The words &ldquo;subsidiary instrument&rdquo; are defined in Section 1 as &ldquo;an Order or regulation made (whether before or after the passing of this Act) under power conferred <Col N="760" /> by a Government Order&rdquo;.  It would appear to me that anything done under sub-section (2) of Section 2 by a person to whom power had been delegated would automatically have to be tabled and, therefore, there would be control in the matter.</P>

      <P>I think Senator Kingsmill Moore has answered effectively Senator Duffy's point that a person appointed under this section would not be answerable to the House.  Senator Baxter asked how many persons were so appointed under the 1939 Act.  Only one was appointed.  I do not know how many would be appointed in the future, but I should say it would not be many, as it was found administratively inconvenient for the Minister to delegate his powers under the Act of 1939.  All we can say is that the Controller of Bread and Flour operated to save our people a lot of inconvenience that other countries suffered.</P>
      <P>In this present Bill, there is a provision that not only Government Orders but also Ministerial Orders and directions in writing of any kind, arising out of the powers conferred on the Government in this Bill, will be tabled.

      <P>On behalf of Senator Sweetman I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In sub-section (2), page 4, line 25, after the word &ldquo;Order&rdquo; to insert the following: &ldquo;(except the Emergency Powers (No. 373) Order, 1946 (S. R. &amp; O. No. 16 of 1946))&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Sweetman has asked me to mention this, as he is unable to be here. Order No. 373 provides, I understand, <Col N="762" /> that the courts shall take judicial cognisance of any Orders made under the Emergency Powers Act.  Senator Sweetman was of the opinion that the court should not be bound to take judicial notice of subsidiary Orders.  What happens is as follows: the court will be referred to a certain Order and told that it has to take judicial notice of it. That does not mean that the court necessarily is hoodwinked, as the judge can say: &ldquo;I have to take judicial notice of it, but you must give me a print of it, in order that I may see what is in it.&rdquo;  Senator Sweetman was informed that very often what happened in the District Court was that there was no Order there, the court did not know it and the local solicitor said: &ldquo;Well, it contains something of this nature,&rdquo; giving a rough idea, and the court had to take judicial notice of the document which was not in front of it.</P>
    <P>That is a very undesirable state of affairs.  Senator Sweetman was anxious to have it limited so that in the case of Orders which were subsidiary Orders&mdash;not big Government Orders which are pretty easy to get&mdash;the court should not be bound to take judicial notice of them, but that it should be incumbent on the person who wished the court to act on such an Order to produce a copy of it and prove it in court in the ordinary way.  If I may respectfully say so, I think that Senator Sweetman's view is one that ought to commend itself to any person who has had anything to do with the courts in which it is necessary to give the judge the exact words of the instrument which he is asked to put into force.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>On the section, Section 3 continues in force a large number of Emergency Powers Orders.  One of them, which is specifically referred to in the White Paper, is Emergency Powers (No. 30) Order, 1940.  This Order suspended the operation of the Civil Service (Transferred Officers) Compensation Act, 1929.  I did not put down an amendment to provide that the Order would be excepted because I recognise that it probably could not come to an end immediately, but I do not think its indefinite extension is satisfactory without some clear indication of what is to be the Government policy on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In order to make the position clear to the House I want to refer briefly to the history of this matter.  As a result of the Treaty of 1921 many thousands of civil servants who had given faithful service to the United Kingdom Government were transferred to the service of the Irish Government.  They could, it is true, under the terms of <Col N="764" /> Article 10 of the Treaty, have elected to retire on specially increased pension terms if they were unwilling to serve under the Irish Government, and a small number did so.  We are not, of course, concerned with them.  But the vast majority were not only willing but eager to give loyal service to a native Government and remained in the Irish service.  Under Article 10 of the Treaty, these men, known as &ldquo;transferred officers&rdquo;, were entitled to retire subsequently on special terms if the conditions of their service as they existed at the time of transfer were altered to their disadvantage by the Irish Government.  In certain respects the provisions of Article 10 were found to need elucidation, and in 1929 an agreement, interpreting and supplementing Article 10 of the Treaty, was made.</P>
    <P>There were three parties to the agreement of 1929: the Irish Government, the British Government and the transferred officers.  According to the statement made by Deputy Costello, speaking in the Dáil on the 26th June, 1946, it was negotiated by him&mdash;he was Attorney-General in 1929&mdash;following discussion and consultation with representatives of the transferred officers. (The reference is Dáil debates, vol. 101, col. 2479.)  This agreement was signed on the 27th June, 1929, on behalf of the British Government by Mr. Philip Snowden and Mr. Sidney Webb, and on behalf of the Irish Government by Mr. Blythe and Mr. McGilligan.  It was given the force of law in Ireland by the Civil Service (Transferred Officers) Act, 1929, and in Great Britain by an Act called the Irish Free State (Confirmation of Agreement) Act.  For the purpose of the matter we are considering to-day, the main feature of the 1929 agreement was the setting up of a board in this country which was given full power to determine the compensation to be granted to transferred officers whose conditions of service were altered to their disadvantage by the Irish Government.</P>
    <P>In June, 1940, the Minister for Finance made a regulation stabilising the Civil Service bonus by reference to a cost-of-living index of 185.  As I explained <Col N="765" /> in this House on the 25th July last (Official Debates, cols. 467-471) the Civil Service bonus is not a bonus in the sense in which we ordinarily understand the term &ldquo;bonus&rdquo; in the business world.</P>
    <P>It is simply a sliding scale adjustment by reference to variations in the purchasing power of money calculated by reference to the cost-of-living index. All basic salaries of civil servants in this country are still fixed in terms of 1914 monetary values, and an addition to the salary, computed by reference to changes in the cost of living and called a &ldquo;bonus&rdquo;, is paid to the officer.  The bonus takes full cognisance of such changes only in the case of the lowest paid officers, and is progressively scaled down as the basic salary rises.  The cost-of-living index figure for the purpose of the bonus&mdash; assumed to be 100 as at July, 1914&mdash; was 230 in September, 1921.  It had sunk to 155 in 1933, and the Irish Exchequer reaped the full benefit in reduced bonuses paid to civil servants. It had gone up to 185 by July, 1940, and the effect of the stabilisation regulation was to ignore further increases. This position was maintained until December, 1944, and as from the 1st January, 1945, the operative index figure was altered to 210.  But the actual figure in November, 1944, was 296, and I believe the latest official figure published was 287.</P>
    <P>Obviously, the Government's departure from the bonus arrangements&mdash; effected without any consultation with the Civil Service &mdash; would have given grounds to transferred officers to claim compensation under the 1929 Act.  In order to prevent the presentation of such claims the Government, again, I understand, without consultation with the officers concerned, made an Order under the Emergency Powers Act on the 26th June, 1940, suspending the operation of the 1929 Act, and Section 3 of this Bill continues this suspension.  Speaking in the Dáil on the 26th June last the Minister for Industry and Commerce said (column 2471):&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;When it was proposed to suspend the operation of that Act, following <Col N="766" /> upon the stabilisation of the bonus, the British Government was so informed and, on the understanding that the suspension of the Act would be for the period of the emergency only, the British Government intimated that it had no observations to offer.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Emergency Powers Order (No. 30 of 1940) which suspended the operation of the 1929 Act and, of course, of the agreement with the British Government which is contained in the Schedule of that Act, is continued in force by Section 3 of the Bill now before the House.</P>
    <P>It is probably known to members of the House that on two occasions the British Government took action to protect the interests of these officers whom they transferred to the Irish service, with a view to securing that they should be compensated in the event of their conditions of service at the time of the transfer being altered to their disadvantage, and, whilst the British intimated in 1940, when they were extremely preoccupied with other matters, that they had no observations to offer on that proposal to suspend temporarily the 1929 agreement, it is very probable that they would object to the scrapping of the agreement or to the interests of the transferred officers being permanently affected.  I am not personally concerned with what may be or may not be the views of the British Government but rather with our obligation to keep faith with civil servants who have served us well and to whom we gave an undertaking which we ought to keep.  It was pointed out by the Minister in the course of the debate on this matter in the Dáil that if the Act of 1929 as it stands were allowed to become operative again many civil servants would be entitled to retire on special terms because of the alterations which have already taken place in their terms of service in the period from 1940 to the present date, and it was suggested to him that this difficulty might be met by an amendment of the 1929 Act which would provide for excluding from consideration what has already happened <Col N="767" /> whilst restoring the rights of transferred officers for the future.  Obviously, if something along these lines was to be adopted the Government could not properly proceed by unilateral action. It is not good enough to say to the civil servants who are affected by this Order: &ldquo;You have served us so well and are so useful to us that we cannot keep our bargain with you&rdquo;.  That is virtually what is being said.  The integrity of the Civil Service is essential to the welfare of any democratic State. We expect the highest standard possible of honour from civil servants and it seems to me that they are entitled to expect an equally high standard of honour from the State in its dealings with them and in the maintenance and keeping of agreements.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that this matter should, as in 1929, be the subject of negotiation and discussion with representatives of the transferred officers, and that any amendment of the agreement with the British Government, which is scheduled in the 1929 Act, should be effected by negotiating with that Government an agreed amendment after consultation with our civil servants who are affected.  I am informed that there are upwards of 6,000 transferred officers still in our Civil Service.  There is a much smaller class whose interests, I think, should not be overlooked.  I mean the men who have retired under the age limit since the bonus was stabilised and whose superannuation awards were adversely affected by this stabilisation. The superannuation awarded to an established civil servant under the conditions of his service is a provision for his future after he retires.  Under provisions contained in the Superannuation Acts of 1859 and 1909, the amount of the award is limited to a proportion (depending on the length of service) of the remuneration he was receiving at the time of his retirement. The amount of this remuneration was arbitrarily reduced by the Government as a temporary measure during the emergency, and it would be iniquitous if the amount of the pension of an officer who retired <Col N="768" /> during the emergency were to be reduced for the rest of his life merely because he reached the age limit during the emergency.</P>
    <P>I might add that not only the amount of the annual pension is involved.  The transferred officers who reached the age limit since July, 1940, would have been in the service of the British Government since 1909.  In that year male officers who were already in the service were given an option to elect to be superannuated when they ultimately retired in either of two ways (a) they could receive a pension equal to two-thirds of their remuneration at retirement, or (b) a lump sum plus a pension equal to half of the remuneration at retirement. Most of them, I am informed, chose the second method, that is, they elected to commute one-fourth of the full pension for the right to a lump sum.  In justice, it seems to me, there can be no discrimination between the two types of case, and in cases falling under the second class, that is (b), the revision of the superannuation award must apply to the lump sum as well as to the annual pension.</P>
    <P>As I have said I did not put down an amendment asking that this Order should be expected because I recognise that Order No. 30 must remain in force for some little time until the matter is fully considered.  I think the House should expect from the Government an assurance that this matter will be carefully considered and that arrangements will be made by which anything that we promised or undertook to give the Civil Service will be put right as equitably and as soon as practicable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to say that I approach this question from a slightly different angle from that of Senator Douglas.  Apart from every other consideration it appears to me that the Government is morally bound to put civil servants in the same position in relation to their relationship with their employers as it is proposed to do in the case of every other employee.  At the moment a Bill entitled the Industrial Relations Bill is going through the Dáil, the purpose of which is to set <Col N="769" /> up new machinery which will regulate conditions between employers and workers as from the 1st September of this year.  When that Bill becomes an Act, Emergency Powers Order (No. 260) which has been the instrument used for that purpose during the last five years will be revoked.  For some strange reason the Government in relation to its employees refused to revoke the Emergency Powers Order under which certain restrictions were placed on a number of civil servants.</P>
      <P>I do not desire at this stage to consider, except in a very brief way, what may be the effect of the revocation of Order No. 30 of 1940 beyond saying this: That the purpose of the Order is to place a certain number of civil servants in a strait-jacket and I do not think this House ought to agree to that purpose being continued.  When this State was set up 25 years ago, some 21,000 civil servants were transferred from the British to the Irish Government.  These civil servants were free to choose to serve an Irish Government or to serve a British Government. In the making of that choice they were perfectly free and 21,000 of them chose to serve an Irish Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When they were making that choice, certain guarantees were given to them by their old employers and by their prospective employers in relation to their future conditions and terms of service.  As Senator Douglas pointed out, the provisions of Article 10 of the Treaty were subject to negotiation subsequently and the agreement reached was scheduled to an Act of the Oireachtas in 1929.  During that period, between 1921 and 1946, 15,000 civil servants retired on pension.  The great majority retired&mdash;probably 90 per cent. &mdash;because they had reached the retiring age.  All of them, whether they left the service before the retiring age or whether they remained until the retiring age, enjoyed the privileges, or shall I say the rights, conferred upon them by the Treaty and by the Act of 1929.  The 6,000 who are still serving are denied the exercise of those rights. I am concerned only at this moment with the right of the civil servants to <Col N="770" /> have liberty to do what they contracted to do and what the State contracted they should be permitted to do.  That is, to have recourse to the tribunal, if they so desired.</P>
    <P>Is it likely that there will be a rush on the part of those 6,000 persons to quit the service once they are free to retire, as they would be if this Emergency Powers Order were revoked? I think that is unlikely.  Of the 6,000 persons concerned, 4,057 are employed in the Post Office.  That is to say, they are postmen, post office clerks and minor-grade civil servants, the great majority of whom are unable to live a reasonable life on their present salaries and, therefore, most unlikely to retire until they are obliged to retire. It was argued in the other House that, if this Order were to be revoked, and if civil servants were to be free to retire at 50 or 55 years of age and have recourse to the board set up under the Act of 1929, there would be a flood of resignations.  Surely, that is untrue. I do not think that any sensible person would suggest that a postman, who finds it hard to live on £4 a week, will go out on a pension of £2 per week. That is fantastic.  These 6,000 persons have been in the service since 1921. They had many opportunities of going before the board and making a case for retirement under the Act of 1929 if they had desired to do so.  In 1933, for instance, there was a cut in all Civil Service salaries.  Every one of the transferred civil servants then serving could have made a first-class case before the board for permission to retire under the Act of 1929.  None of the 6,000 persons now serving chose to take that course.  I think that it is true to say that, during the past 25 years, there were a number of occasions upon which every one of the transferred civil servants could have made an excellent case before the board, if he desired to do so, for permission to retire.  Those who are now concerned have been loyal to the Government.  They have continued to serve the State.  They have taken all the knocks coming to them and now the Minister thinks that, if he revokes this Order, which holds them in a strait-jacket, they will leave the service <i>en masse.</i>  I think <Col N="771" /> that that is most unlikely, for the reasons I have stated.</P>
    <P>As a matter of fact, I have spoken to civil servants affected by this Order, who might be said to be in the higher reaches of the service.  I asked them frankly whether, if the machinery of the 1929 Act were restored, there would be a rush of the higher civil servants into retirement.  The answer I got was that, even amongst the higher-grade civil servants, there would be no anxiety to retire because they could not afford it.  Many of them would prefer to remain on after the retiring age if permitted so to do.  Anybody who reaches the age of 60 is entitled to retire from the Civil Service and this Order does not affect them; it affects only those who are under 60 years of age.  That is to say, persons who were comparatively young in 1921. Any person who was 40 years of age at the time of transfer is now 65.  Anybody who was 35 years of age then is now entitled to retire because he has reached the age of 60, so that we are really dealing with people who were comparatively young civil servants at the time of the transfer.  The great majority of them held minor positions and still hold minor positions.  As I have said, 4,057 of these officers are employed in the Post Office.  The next largest group&mdash;775&mdash;is employed by the Department of Finance.  I take it that that includes officers employed by the Revenue Commissioners.  So on down the ranks.  The figure includes people in the lowest scale of the Civil Service and people who are never likely to reach the higher levels at which it could be claimed that their continued employment is essential for the maintenance of the Government machine.</P>
    <P>What is this board that was set up by agreement between the transferred civil servants, the Irish Government and the British Government in 1929? The constitution of the board is provided for in Section 3 of the Civil Service (Transferred Officers) (Compensation) Act, 1929.  It provides that the board shall consist of a chairman and two members representing the Minister for Finance and two members representing <Col N="772" /> the transferred officers.  It is a board in which the position of the chairman can, and is often likely to be, the deciding factor.  The persons who desire to retire under the Act of 1929 on the grounds that their position in the service has been made worse by some action of the Government must satisfy a board that they are entitled to the conditions prescribed in the agreement affixed to the Act of 1929. They have got to satisfy a board on which they have two friends and may I say as lightly as I can, two opponents, with a neutral chairman, who is, of course, appointed by the Minister. No doubt the chairman at the date of his appointment must be a judge of the Supreme Court, of the High Court or of the Circuit Court.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt the Minister will agree that so far as the chairman is concerned it is likely in the long run that he is going to be the deciding factor.  The chairman is not likely to act unfairly.  Unless the civil servant who desires to retire can make an excellent case for the enjoyment of these provisions, he is not likely to succeed.  The argument, therefore, for the retention of the Order is that the Minister knows he has done something to these people that he is not entitled to do and that if they go before the board they will be able to satisfy the board that the Government has broken its agreement with the civil servants. On these grounds and on no other grounds are they entitled to the advantage that they secured for themselves and which was conceded by an Irish Government in 1929.  It is true, of course, that there is associated with this issue the question of the stabilisation of the bonus to which Senator Douglas has referred, but I do not think that this question of the stabilisation of the bonus has a real bearing on the question.  These 6,000 people have accepted buffetings of every kind for a quarter of a century and they are still in the service.  I think, therefore, that what they are seeking more than anything else is that the Minister would trust them to serve the State efficiently and voluntarily and not put them in the position of being tied to their posts as if they were just <Col N="773" /> irresponsible people who could not be relied upon to live in liberty.  I think the Minister is unfair to himself and unfair to the State when he acts in this manner towards people who have served the State notwithstanding all the rebuffs they have got from this Government and its predecessor during the last 25 years.  I, therefore, urge very strongly that so far as Emergency Powers Order No. 230 is concerned, it should be excluded from the provisions of this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I spoke on this matter on the Second Stage of this Bill and there is very little that I would like to add to what Senator Douglas and Senator Duffy have said except this point.  It seems to me that this is immoral.  Supposing you heard of an employer who had made a written agreement with his employees and had gone outside for a person as a witness and then without giving any notice or without any consultation simply said: &ldquo;I am not going to keep this agreement because you are good and so loyal, so efficient&rdquo;. That is something which seems to me to be immoral.  It is from this angle I think we should look at the matter. The civil servants affected by this Order are not civil servants who have refused to serve the Irish State.  They are civil servants who elected to serve it and they have served not only one Government but two Governments and gave service which has won for them so to speak, golden opinions from all shades of politicians and because they were so good we are telling them that there can be an exodus if this Order was kept in being.  Speaking in the other House on the Second Stage of this Bill, the Minister for Finance who is a better judge, said that if we released them from control to-morrow and allowed them to go before the tribunal again, he thought there would be very few cases indeed.  There would be very few cases for two reasons.  The great bulk of these people cannot afford to retire on any terms and a good many more of them who are regarded by the Minister as key-men, have got substantial promotions and for that reason are not likely to retire.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="774" /> Apart altogether from the question of money and material gain, there is an irksome feeling that in this particular Order they are being unfairly treated.  That is something the Minister should not do to people who have served so loyally, as Senator Duffy has said, for the past 25 years.  Possibly what the Minister is really worried about is the effect upon the Civil Service in general.  He told us that this Order was necessary.  If that is so, perhaps the Minister would give us an idea of what is going to happen the people of whom Senator Douglas spoke, those who went out on superannuation during the emergency with their pensions calculated on stabilised bonus and salary.  I think the Government of a State should be just as anxious to fulfil its agreements made with its own employees as any ordinary employer should be and that they should avoid giving bad example.  This is peculiarly bad example and the case that there would be an exodus from the Civil Service is not a sufficient justification.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I always suspect the strength of a case when Senators have to fall back on accusations of breaches of the moral law.  I do not think we have broken the moral law.  When we introduced Order No. 30 in 1940 it was necessary if our people were to survive the catastrophe of the war that we should take very drastic action and in doing so we trampled on the corns of a very large number of citizens indeed. War conditions compelled us to do it. Senator Duffy says that we interfered with the rights of the civil servants to the extent that this was necessary to protect the rights of the citizens as a whole, including the civil servants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we had allowed wages and salaries of all descriptions to rise with the cost of living, undoubtedly the taxpayers of the country would be saddled with a very big bill and consumers with an ever-increasing rise in cost of goods. This Order No. 30 was portion of a general scheme of action which the Government took in order to keep down, as far as they could, costs of living and the costs of taxes which are an item in the cost of living and in order generally to make certain that whatever costs were there would be <Col N="775" /> distributed equitably.  The emergency that called for the introduction of Order No. 30 of 1940 is not yet over, and the only reason, I am certain, that the Seanad would agree to the Second Reading of a Bill of this kind is because Senators know it is not over. If it is not over for the community as a whole, and if the Seanad is entrusting the Government and the Minister for Industry and Commerce with these powers, with which they would not normally be entrusted, it follows that they should also agree that there is a condition of affairs still existing which warrants the Government in continuing in operation Order No. 30 of 1940.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Hayes that if we abolish Order No. 30 of 1940 and allow 6,000 transferred civil servants afterwards to go before a reconstituted tribunal, we should have very few cases.  I do not know how many &mdash; it is anybody's guess&mdash;we would have in the first few months but certainly if we had one or two, that might entice more to go.  If the remainder of the transferred officers did not see their way to do so, they would be disgruntled that certain officers had gone off.  The remainder of the civil servants, for whom we must have some regard, would be disgruntled even if only a few went off.  On the whole, I think we would be well advised in present circumstances to continue that Order and to give power to continue it under this Bill.  Senator Hayes wants to know what will happen that particular Order after a year.  I do not know what is going to happen.  No one can prophesy what is going to happen in the next year.  Things may improve or things may not improve sufficiently rapidly to enable us to get rid of all these Orders.  If they improve so rapidly as to enable us to get rid of them with safety to the interests of the community, no one will be better pleased than the members of the Government.</P>

      <P>The Minister has been very gentle with some of us.  I would point out that the issue involved is not that adverted to by the Minister. Strictly speaking it has nothing to do with the public interest or salaries or wages.  The only issue is whether the Minister would trust civil servants to act reasonably in the absence of this Order.  I would recall to the Minister's mind that the Public Services (Temporary Economies) Act, 1933, enacted by the Government through his predecessor, invited civil servants to tender their resignations if they were dissatisfied and to apply to the board to have their pensions settled in accordance with the Act of 1929.  I do not know how many did apply but there were 10,000 or 12,000 civil servants involved. Somebody mentioned that the number who actually retired was 40 out of 10,000 or 12,000.  How many are likely to retire, now that we have only 6,000 of these civil servants, if this Order were revoked?  As the Minister says, it is anybody's guess.  I do not know but I have a suspicion, from any talk I have had with civil servants, that very few will retire, once it is revoked.  They, however, resent the Order being there, just as members of trade unions resent Order No. 260.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce is taking steps to get rid of Order No. 260 as from 1st September and I ask the Minister for Finance to do the same thing in regard to these civil servants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Here is a rather remarkable thing. As has been emphasised by everybody who spoke the civil servants concerned are people who voluntarily chose to serve the Irish Government.  Suppose they had not voluntarily chosen to serve, supposing they had been coaxed in from Britain, how would the Minister have treated them?  He would have acted in a totally different manner.  A few weeks ago we had before us the Superannuation Bill, 1946, in which the Minister inserted a special provision to deal with one solitary civil servant who did not voluntarily enter the service of the Irish Government but was induced to come from London to take up a post in Ireland.  Because he came over from London, as a result <Col N="777" /> of inducements offered to him, he is going to suffer none of the disabilities of those who decided at the very outset that they would take their chance here in Ireland.  The Minister for Finance, speaking in the Dáil on the 25th of June, deals with that.  Speaking on the Second Stage of the Superannuation Bill he says:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Section 3 is entirely new and deals with a special case in respect of which it was found necessary to take exceptional measures when the Public Services (Temporary Economies) Act, 1933, was being enacted. On account of personal undertakings given to the individual concerned shortly after the Saorstát Éireann administration began to function, my predecessor, who promoted the Public Services (Temporary Economies) Act, felt, after representations made to him from the Opposition Benches, that an exception should be made and this officer was exempted from the reduction in salary applied to civil servants generally. In view of the headline set in the 1933 Act, I have felt that this officer should similarly be exempted from the bonus stabilisation provisions imposed on the civil servants as a whole.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This is an illuminating situation.  The man who stood out and said: &ldquo;I am not going to serve any Irish Government until I know exactly how I am going to be treated,&rdquo; has special provision made for him not merely in regard to salary and bonus but in regard to pension.</P>

I was hoping that, when the whole of the facts were brought to the notice of the Minister and when it became clear to him that nothing worth while was being risked in revoking this Order but that the Government and the country stood to gain considerably by trusting the Civil Service to continue loyally without being tied in any way, the Minister might assure the House that he was willing to have this Order taken out of <Col N="778" /> the Bill.  If he takes the long view, I think he will agree that that would be the wisest course.  I urge him strongly to give an assurance that this Order No. 30 will not be continued after the 1st September next.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is fairly clear from the wording of it. The section declares that &ldquo;every Government Order, every subsidiary instrument and every direction in writing&rdquo; in the case of all these things, &ldquo;shall before the operative date be deemed always to have been judicially noticed.&rdquo;  I am seeking to delete the words &ldquo;subsidiary instrument and direction in writing&rdquo;.  The effect of this section, of course, is that it avoids the necessity for the prosecution of having to hand in during the hearing <Col N="780" /> of the case a particular Order, subsidiary instrument or direction in writing.  Quite frankly, I feel that it would be more satisfactory if not only the subsidiary instrument and the direction in writing had to be handed in, but also if the Orders had to be so handed in.  I understand that an omnibus amendment dealing with these three matters was considered in the other House, and for that reason I am trying, so far as I can, to avoid discussing again, from the same angle, matters already debated in the Dáil. For that reason and rather against my will, I have left in the words &ldquo;Government Order&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I do think it is important that there should always be, as a matter of strict law, in the hands of whatever court it may be, the Order, the subsidiary instrument and the direction in writing under which a man is being prosecuted.  It is not reasonable to expect everyone to know, in the same way that everybody is expected to know the statute law, about the subsidiary instrument and the direction in writing.  The Minister, I think, will agree with me that if it is not essential to have the Orders available, that, very often, what is given for the benefit of the district justice is the view of the particular Order by the State solicitor concerned.  I think it is an essential part of fairness in criminal proceedings that the actual subsidiary instrument and the direction in writing should be handed in to the court.  It will not mean that additional trouble of a worth-while nature is being imposed on the State.  It will merely mean, where prosecutions are going to be taken, that when the evidence is being given the solicitor or person conducting the prosecution will hand in the Order to the tribunal, whether that tribunal is an ordinary court or the Special Criminal Court.  If that is done, then the subsidiary instrument or the direction in writing so handed in will be put on the records.</P>
    <P>It is conceivable that, without that, there could be a miscarriage of justice because of the fact that the exact terms of the Order were not before the court at the time when the case was <Col N="781" /> disposed of.  I am fully aware, of course, that justices would have the right to call for the Order, but when dealing with a tremendous number of cases in a District Court it is not always feasible to deal with the matter on that line.  If it were made a part of the statutory proof that the prosecution should produce these, I do not think that any prosecution, properly considered and properly tendered, would fall to the ground on that head, and I do not think there could be any suggestion that we would have in any way interfered with the proper enforcement of the law in this type of case.  I would seriously ask the Minister to give favourable consideration to this suggestion.</P>

      <P>I support the amendment as a lesser concession to the deletion of the whole section.  This whole matter of judicial notice has preoccupied me for the last two years as I have had certain cases in court before district justices under the Emergency Powers Act and Orders.  I, as a lawyer, had understood that the proper procedure was that an Order made under statute did not prove itself, and that it had to be proved in accordance with the law.  Section 4 of the Documentary Evidence Act of 1925, as adapted, provides that rules, orders, regulations or by-laws may be proved by the production of a copy of such rules, orders, regulations or by-laws printed under the superintendence or authority of, and published by, the Stationery Office.  Now, when a charge is brought against a citizen of this State it must be proved by evidence.  There are three exceptions to matters which must be proved, namely: (1) matters which are judicially noticed; (2) matters which are presumed; and (3) matters which are admitted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question is, what are matters which are judicially noticed?  A great number of matters are judicially noticed, such as the number of days in the week, the number of days in the year, the geography of the State and particular statutes of the State. Statutes passed after 1850 were declared to be judiciously noticed by <Col N="782" /> the Interpretation Act of 1889, so, therefore the district justice is presumed to know the law as enacted by the Legislature and as set out in the statutes. He is not presumed to know what is in an Order made under a statute either by the Government as a whole or by a Minister.  Therefore, in order to prove an Order which is given the force of law, but which the district justice is not presumed to know is law, a procedure has been laid down by law for the proof of such Order, namely, to hand in a copy of the Order as published by the Stationery Office. That would be quite simple and would be the ordinary procedure in prosecutions. Prosecutors ought to know the law, at least more law than the citizen who may not be represented by a lawyer.  I noticed that the habit had grown up of not proving Government Orders in the ordinary way as required by law.</P>
    <P>I protested, but my protest was brushed aside by a district justice who would not listen to law.  Two years afterwards the matter was brought before the Court of Criminal Appeal and a conviction was set aside, because the Order was not produced before the special tribunal. But then something happened which I think is a disgrace to the Government. An <i>ex post facto</i> Emergency Powers Order was made, No. 373 of 1946, Statutory Rules and Orders No. 16 of 1946 which stated:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Every Government Order, including this Order, and every subsidiary instrument shall be (and, in the case of every such Order or instrument made before the date of this Order, be deemed always to have been) judicially noticed&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Then there was a sop thrown in:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Nothing in this article shall render a person, who has been acquitted of an offence, liable to be charged again with that offence.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The fact remains that a person could not in law, even if wrongly acquitted, be brought up and charged a second time.  This Emergency Powers Order arose from the incompetence of State prosecutors and their incompetence was <Col N="783" /> bolstered up by an Emergency Powers Order.</P>
    <P>Now how is that Emergency Powers Order to be proved and how could a district justice take judicial notice of it?  It would be necessary in strict law to hand in the Order at every hearing in order that the district justice should be made aware of it and that every other Order should be judicially noticed.  That Order was discussed in the Dáil on political lines, but I have no intention of dealing with it on political lines here.  I am dealing with it purely from the legal point of view.  Instead of following the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal and carrying on in future what had been carried on for years, the Government made this Order bolstering up the mistake of prosecuting counsel.</P>
    <P>Section 9 of the Bill we are now discussing is intended to perpetuate that Order in legislative form.  The explanatory memorandum issued with the Supplies and Services (Temporary Provisions) Bill, 1946, contains the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Section 9. &mdash; Judicial notice of Government Orders, subsidiary instruments and directions.  This section re-enacts the provisions of Emergency Powers (No. 373) Order, 1946. ...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It does not re-enact it.  It goes further because in Emergency Powers (No. 373) Order, 1946, there is no mention at all of directions.  It is confined to every Government Order and every subsidiary instrument.  So that the House may understand what a subsidiary instrument is, I would like to explain that under Section 2 of the Emergency Powers Act, 1939, the Government was empowered to make Orders dealing with certain matters provided it was necessary to do so or expedient for securing the public safety, or the preservation of the State, or for the maintenance of public order, or for the provision and control of supplies and services essential to the life of the community.  Under that section an omnibus Order&mdash;No. 224 of 1939 &mdash;was made.  It gave power to Ministers <Col N="784" /> to make Orders under it and therefore an Order made under Order No. 224 of 1939 was a subsidiary Order.  A somewhat similar scheme is proposed in this Bill.  The Government will make an Order and the Minister will make an Order under that Order; the Minister's Order would then be a subsidiary instrument.  But here in this Bill it is provided that when the Minister gives a direction it shall be deemed to be and to have been judicially noticed.</P>
    <P>You can purchase a Government Order or a subsidiary instrument in the Stationery Office but where can you purchase or even see a direction&mdash; an oral direction.  I see now that it says: &ldquo;every direction in writing shall be deemed to be judicially noticed&rdquo; but where can you purchase the direction if it is not published as an Order?  I would suggest that this section should be removed from the statute roll at the earliest possible moment.  It is a blot on it and should never have come on it.  The Emergency Powers No. 373 Order of 1946 should never have been made.  Instead of taking their beating in court like men the Government resort to the might of the State under the Emergency Powers Order.  This particular document had nothing to do with the preservation or the security of the State or with the control of supplies and services.  It was merely to bolster up lost prestige because they would never admit they were wrong.  I do not expect that this will be deleted from the Bill.  I hope when this Act expires that we shall see the last of this judicial notice of Orders or of directions or anything like that.</P>
    <P>There is no reason why there should be one law for the prosecutors and another law for the prosecuted.  Why should the prosecutors get any advantage as regards procedure in trials over and above what the defendant or the accuser has to put up with?  I support Senator Sweetman's amendment not just because he does not move to delete the section but because I support the principle involved in it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TheodoreMoore" hpid="Mr. Kingsmill Moore Mr. Kingsmill Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kingsmill Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one particularly vicious thing about this <Col N="785" /> provision.  It has been touched upon by the other speakers, but because they did so in a broad way I do not think they have underlined it.</P>
      <P>Subsidiary instruments have to be tabled.  At least they are brought to the notice of the Oireachtas and, being tabled, they are at least printed, but directions do not come within the definition of subsidiary instruments. They will not be tabled, they may not be printed, they may not be even roneographed, and the court has to take notice of a document of which there may be only one copy in existence which is not available to the court.  That I think to be particularly vicious.  I have got so accustomed to the habit of the Government when they see a mistake has been made of passing an emergency Order to stop the hole that I was very relieved to hear Senator Michael Ryan voicing genuine heartfelt indignation at a process which I have always thought to be stealing legislative power from the Oireachtas and an abuse of Governmental and executive functioning.</P>
      <P>It has really gone too far when the courts are told to take notice of a document which has never been put before the Oireachtas in the form of tabling and which may never have seen the light of day except in one copy made by a person to whom power has been delegated by the Government under an earlier section of this Bill.  I do hope that the Minister will at least see his way to take out of that section the word &ldquo;direction&rdquo; so that the courts shall not be bound to take judicial notice of a thing which is not procurable at the Stationery Office.</P>

      <P>Any subsidiary instrument made prior to the operative date will be tabled, as I understand the wording of Section 8.  The Minister has completely failed to meet the point I made in putting this amendment and which was put very much more closely by Senator Ryan, who showed that he had gone into the matter very fully.  There seems to me to be a serious matter of principle <Col N="788" /> involved.  I can perfectly easily imagine a District Court justice, in pursuance of this section, giving a decision in a case in which he is presumed to know the existence of every subsidiary instrument and direction in writing that would bear on the charge but of which he does not, in fact, know. I can see that happening quite easily. I can see the strongest possibility of a conviction against a man on a misunderstood interpretation of the law, because the subsidiary instruments and directions in writing relevant to the case were not handed into court.  It could easily happen that the justice would be depending on recollection alone; he might not have a copy of the direction in writing before him. Probably, he would never have seen it. The most he would have seen would be a reference in a newspaper or a reference put up by the person conducting the prosecution.  There is involved in this matter an absolutely vital principle affecting the fairness of the way in which people are to be prosecuted before our courts.  Nobody is trying to shelter wrongdoers. Nobody is suggesting that a wrongdoer should not get the full rigour of the law to which his offence entitles him. We are suggesting that there should be a certainty, beyond any possible shadow of doubt, that the full legal position was before the court when judging and sentencing that man.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nothing is to be gained by this section except the saving of a little trouble to the Department concerned &mdash;and a very little trouble at that. The saving of a little trouble is not worth the risk that a man might be convicted unfairly, might be sentenced unfairly and might have his whole life ruined.  The Department would be saved merely the trouble of sending down to a court and handing in the subsidiary instrument or direction in writing upon which they were basing their case.  Senator Ryan has given a clear example of the State's taking up its mighty sledge-hammer against an individual of humble means.  There is no justification for saying that a man should be prosecuted without the person who is drawing the prosecution having all the legal forms, statutes, <Col N="789" /> orders, subsidiary instruments and directions in writing before him.  If the man who frames the prosecution must have all these things before him, what is to prevent him from sending those things to the court in question and having them handed in so that the full implications of these documents will be present to the court when the case comes before it?</P>
    <P>The House has in recent weeks been accustomed to seeing Senator Ryan and myself knocking spots off each other and the fact that we are joined together on this shows that there is a real principle at issue&mdash;a principle of whether a man is going to be convicted fairly and according to the law or whether he is going to be convicted on what might be purely a recollection.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>All I can say is that I do not believe a district justice would sentence a man who was prosecuted for an offence if he had not seen the law on the matter.  Senator Ryan indicated certain things that justices are presumed to know and one of those things is the statutes passed by the Oireachtas.  The State has not to prove in court to a district justice that a particular Act was passed.  A justice is presumed to know the law and the prosecution has not to prove it or to prove the number of days in the week and so on.  I think it is fairly reasonable to assume that when an Order has been put down on the Table of the House a justice is presumed to know of its existence.  If he cannot get a copy either from some member of the legal profession in court or somewhere else I am sure he would postpone the case until he can get a copy, until it is either handed to him by someone else or obtained by him in some way.  I do not see how Senator Sweetman can really be afraid of a miscarriage of justice because this is put into the Bill.</P>

If a man is prosecuted for a breach of a Government Order, subsidiary instruction or direction in writing, and if the direction in writing has not been laid on the Table of the House it can be proved in court.

      <P>I think I can settle the difficulties of the two Senators.  The Government got a lot of powers under the 1939 Act and it got rid of them as quickly as it could&mdash;every one of them. It is asking for powers under this Bill which it wants to exercise only for as short a time as possible.  Whether this Bill is dated for six months, for two years or 22 years, the same thing will happen in relation to the Orders made under it&mdash;the Government will keep them in operation only for as short a time as possible.  I agree with Senator Duffy from one point of view.  If this Bill or any Bill like it has unfortunately to be renewed, it should be renewed at some other time of the year, so that I shall not have to come to the Seanad instead of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, who is responsible for the Bill.  I think it would be better, if the Bill has to be renewed, that that should be done in the autumn.  As far as I am concerned, I am prepared to accept Senator Duffy's amendment, at the same time giving Senator Summerfield the assurance that even though the Bill is expressed as giving the Government these powers for an extra four months, that is not going to extend the duration of a single Order by one day further than the Government thinks it necessary to keep it in operation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>This section is the first of the operative sections in this Part of the Bill.  In fact, the whole scheme of the Bill is really dependent upon the division of the Dublin Metropolitan District into three divisions. There is nothing in the Bill which states specifically the divisions that are going to be created but I take it that I am correct in thinking that the divisions are divisions according to the nature of the work and not geographical divisions.  The divisions according to the nature of the work will probably be the custody division, the summons division and then the general division.  I am asking the Minister to give us an indication of the divisions which he proposes to adopt. I cannot see how he proposes to operate.  It will be agreed by everybody that the most important type of case to be disposed of urgently in the District Court is the custody case, as there the people are already before the court, so to speak, and it is essential that they should be dealt with before any other business.  In the scheme which the Minister proposes, if I am <Col N="794" /> interpreting his mind correctly, the custody division is going to deal with all those cases that are already before the court in custody.</P>
      <P>What the Minister has in his mind, perhaps, is that the custody division may have before it at a particular time not quite enough work fully to occupy all the justices.  There is a provision later on whereby justices may be transferred from one division to another, but if that transfer is to be effective it is essential that there should be someone on the spot who would be able to gauge exactly the point at which there is likely to be less work in a particular week for custody cases and that gauging must be done some considerable distance in advance. Documents, civil bills, summonses and so forth have to be served a stipulated time before the hearing by the court. It takes some little time to effect service and it really means that the decision as to whether there are really going to be two, three, four, or five custody courts sitting in a particular week is a decision that must be taken some time in advance.  It is no good having a situation arise on a Monday morning that the custody division suddenly decides that it will not have enough work for that week, that the custody justices can be transferred to other divisions and that work can be conjured out of the ground for them in those other divisions.  The decision must be taken some time in advance, so that the documents can be served.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, it seems to me that the whole scheme is a wrong one, that what there should be is a continuance of the present scheme, with slightly different executive functions.  There should be one senior metropolitan justice, who would be given by the Department an executive officer whose business it would be, under his direction, to organise and direct the work and that he should be keeping the control, as he would be the person best able to judge in advance which division was likely to have pressure of work and which division was likely to have slackness of work.  In consequence, the people on the spot would be able&mdash;as the Minister and his Department could not possibly <Col N="795" /> be able&mdash;to know how many cases of a particular sort could be dealt with at a particular time.  The consideration of this whole scheme depends to a very large extent on how the Minister intends to arrange the divisions and I would particularly like him to indicate that to the House on this section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Boland) Gerald Boland">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>I think we dealt partly with this matter on the Second Reading.  The question which has arisen now is not the question which arose then, that is, the tendency to interfere with the rights of the courts.  I suppose the fact that I read out Section 47 of the 1926 Act probably satisfied the Senator that I had the right to do it.  The practice will be that the person on the spot will arrange these things, that is, the principal justice in each division; and the Minister is keeping himself in reserve to come in and give a ruling, if necessary. There will be a principal justice attached to each section and he will have a fair idea as to how many justices will be required for each division. I suppose it will not be possible to deal with all the business at once, as we all know there may be a hang over at one time and that there may be slackness at another time.  Generally, the scheme is that it will be in the hands of the principal justice in each division and it is only where trouble arises, if it does arise, that the Minister will use the right he has had all along.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I did that before.  There will be three blocs&mdash; custody cases, ordinary criminal cases; civil cases; and the Children's Court, with possibly the new rent cases, when we give effect to that part of the Rent Restrictions Act.  That is the general idea.  If there is any change necessary, there will be consultation, I can assure the Senator, and I will try to arrange the work in the most satisfactory manner.  If there is a big rush in one section and slackness in another, I have no doubt it will be quite easy to get the justices to transfer from one <Col N="796" /> section to another, but there may be the case of some man who may have thought he was going to have an easy time and did not want to work.  We will have to preserve the right we have to say: &ldquo;You must go into that section, as there is not enough work in the other one.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I tried deliberately to keep away from the line the Minister has taken.  There are to be three divisions, and the Minister knows as well as I do that if he suggests to the principal justice of the children's division that there is a slackness of work in that division, the principal justice of that division will react, as all humans react, and say: &ldquo;Not at all, you must not steal anyone from me&rdquo;. The principal justice of the criminal division will be calling to the Minister, saying he is overwhelmed by pressure of work.  Accepting fully that the Minister is going to consult with the principal justices, the man who has no responsibility for the overwhelming pressure is not going to give away his assistants.  I am sure the Minister realises that, no matter how slack things were in the Department of Justice, if the Department of Finance came along to him and said his Department had too much staff and they were taking 20 people away from him, he would be up in arms at once. This is exactly the same principle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If there is one justice responsible for the administration of the whole District Court, then the responsibility is on that justice to switch the various assistants around so as to get the work done in the best way.  Where the responsibility is divided there will not be the same acceptance of the fact that one division is slack and another division is busy.  I agree at once with the Minister that to have one single principal justice responsible for the whole Dublin Metropolitan District would not be effective and it would not be possible unless the Minister were prepared to give to that senior justice an executive officer who would do the management work that is necessary. It is a fact, and it is as well that it should go on record as a fact, that during the great pressure of work that <Col N="797" /> there has been in the district courts in recent years, there have been remarkably few cases of adjournments at the last minute because the justices working as one organised whole under the senior justice have been in the position of being able to know what cases were likely to come on, what cases required adjournments and what cases were not quite ready for proof. In consequence, the senior justice has been able to spread out the work as a homogeneous whole.</P>
    <P>The Minister under this Bill is setting up three divisions.  I would ask the Minister completely to forget that in this there is any question of interference with the Department.  If I want to attack the Minister for interfering with the courts, and I may want to do that on another section, I can assure him that I shall do so in no uncertain terms.  On this particular point, my anxiety is to have the courts operating as a homogeneous whole in order that the business can be directed as a whole.  I do not understand the benefits which the Minister imagines are going to be obtained under Section 5, and I think that he ought to explain the matter for the benefit of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LouisODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I must say that I agree with Senator Sweetman.  I do not like this stereotyped method of dividing the work as proposed in this section. If the section read that the Minister &ldquo;may make regulations from time to time to divide the work, to allot certain justices to particular divisions and to change them from time to time from one division to another,&rdquo; that would be a much more elastic system, and I think it would be much better than the procedure laid down in Section 5 and also in Section 7.  Section 7 provides that an ordinary justice of a division may from time to time be transferred from his division by the Minister to another division.  What does that mean?  It means that the Minister makes an Order on a certain date changing the justice from division A to, say, division C.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I am dealing with Section 5, but that section must be read in conjunction with Section 7.  I am objecting to the stereotyped method in which the section is drawn.  I would prefer if Section 5 read that the Minister could make regulations for the division of the work, and arrange that certain justices might carry on the work according to his directions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 10 provides for that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LouisODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know that it does.  Section 10 provides that:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The business of the District Court to be transacted in the Dublin Metropolitan District shall be distributed amongst the several divisions in such manner as the Minister may from time to time direct.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Now, that does not help at all.  That simply enables a distribution of the work to be made amongst the divisions in the way that the Minister has outlined&mdash;to give the criminal cases to one division, civil cases to another division and the children's cases to another division.  There are to be so many justices in each division.  If there is a glut of work in one division one week the Minister may make an Order transferring a justice from division A to division B or C and the justice will remain there until the Minister makes another Order transferring him back to his old division.  I suggest that the whole method is bad and I think it should be altered by empowering the Minister to make regulations.  If given that power the Minister could make elastic regulations that would enable justices to be transferred from time to time.  There is no reason why the senior justice of a division, if he has no work to do in that division, should not be asked to work in another division when there is a good deal of business.  Under Section 5 that cannot be done, but it could be done if the Minister were given power to make regulations.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the most important section in the Bill.  If things were working satisfactorily I would not have brought in this Bill at all. The Minister must have the right to <Col N="799" /> divide up the work.  The principal justice in each division will have the right to manage the business in that division.  If everything does not go right it would be the duty of the Minister to see that the work is arranged as it ought to be.  It will be his business to see that enough work is being done in each division.  If there is a slackness of work in one division and too much work in other divisions, and if the justices do not fix that up between themselves, then the Minister will come in and say what must be done. I cannot understand Senator O'Dea at all, because Section 10 provides that the work amongst the several divisions shall be distributed in such manner as the Minister may from time to time direct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LouisODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>The point that I made was that if the Minister makes an Order transferring a justice from division A to division B or C, the justice remains there until the Minister makes another Order transferring him back to his old division.  That might be very difficult.  I suggest that that should be done under regulations.  It could be done by the senior justice, subject to the Minister's approval.  I think that the section should be made more elastic.  There should be power to say to a justice that he was to go into this court to-day and into another court to-morrow.  Under the section, he may say: &ldquo;I am in this division and I will not go into that court&rdquo;.  In a case such as that the senior justice has to go to the Minister and get an Order transferring him.  In that case there is a delay waiting for the Order.  I think that the section will work badly.</P>

      <P>The Minister said that the present system is not satisfactory. As one who has experience of operating under the present system I could not allow that statement to go uncontradicted.  It is the almost universal opinion of solicitors practising in those courts that the present arrangements are satisfactory except that the work during the emergency increased and kept on increasing.  I <Col N="800" /> suspect&mdash;I am not putting the blame at the Minister's door&mdash;that the Department of Finance fell behind a long way in appointing the necessary number of additional justices to deal with the work that was there.  That is the only thing that was wrong.  There is nothing wrong with the present system.</P>

On a couple of occasions there was a remark made by the justice that there was something like that. Immediately we found out any request had been made it was attended to. Once or twice it happened that a complaint was made in court.  When I examined into that I found that no request had been made.  Any time I got a request for help, so that people would not be kept waiting to have their cases dealt with, I immediately went to the Minister for Finance or to the Government and I was given all the help I wanted.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To add to the section a new sub section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(4)  Nothing in this Part of this Act shall be so construed as to prejudice the terms and conditions of service operative prior to the passing of this Act, of the justice appointed by the preceding sub-section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="801" /> On the Second Reading of this Bill the Minister stated that he was doing nothing to alter the contract already existing between the State, on the one hand, and those people who are asked to take up and who do take up positions under the State, on the other hand.  I accepted the Minister's word on that and I regarded his statement as being of such importance that I considered it should be reflected for all time in the statutory provisions of the Bill.  For that reason I have incorporated his statement in this amendment so that it would be there on record in the Act itself.  I am not suggesting anything new in my amendment; I am merely giving legislative effect to a statement made by the Minister here on the last occasion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>What I stated was that there was nothing in this Bill which would interfere with the contracts of appointment of any of the justices. Neither is there.  Why then put in something, as part of the Bill, that I said here on the last occasion?  With all due respect, I think that is a most ridiculous suggestion.  The matter is either covered by the Bill or it is not. If there is nothing in the Bill interfering with the rights or the contracts of appointment of justices, then there is no necessity to make the obvious more obvious still.  I think I made that quite clear, when I explained what Section 47 says.  There is quite enough in the Bill without embodying statements made by me in the House here. Surely, the Senator is sensible enough to see that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDouglas" hpid="Mr. Douglas Mr. Douglas">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Douglas</NameTxt>
      <P>I quite understand the Minister's point of view but in practice we have found that very often in the interpretation of a Bill something is read into it which was not intended when the Bill was originally drafted. It is not infrequent to have a provision incorporated in a Bill to the effect that nothing in a particular section &ldquo;shall interfere with.&rdquo;  I think that is what is at the back of Senator Sweetman's mind.  It is not a matter of putting over a fast one on the Minister.  It is a question of trying to make it quite clear that it cannot be so interpreted, <Col N="802" /> knowing that the Government has no intention of changing any previous or existing arrangement.  Therefore, it would seem to me that it would be better in a Bill of this kind, which is very complicated, to make a proviso that nothing in it can be taken as interfering with the contracts of the justices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I have the strongest possible objection to that.  I certainly think we have, both in this House and the other House, people sufficiently intelligent to point out anything which might interfere with the contract of a justice.  It is up to them to point out anything which may interfere.  That has not been done.  Surely, it reflects on the situation when I am asked now to copper-fasten it like this.  If there is anything in the Bill there are plenty of people quite competent to point that out without our having to incorporate a statement of that kind in it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister, or his colleagues, have on occasions taken up the same attitude on other Bills, namely, that his interpretation of the Bill was the correct one and that the interpretations put upon the Bill by others were incorrect.  It has happened that people in the Civil Service, or working for the Government, who are in a position to give their whole-time service and their especial skill so essential for these things, have given interpretations of sections.  Subsequently, it was found that the interpretation put upon the measure was not the interpretation that was intended and that the interpretations put upon statutes and put upon the Constitution were not the interpretations that were intended.  There is a fairly recent case on record in that regard.  However, I do not want to labour the point, but I do want to have this case copper-fastened beyond all shadow of doubt.  I want that done not because of the Minister or of the Government, or because of any Government which may succeed them, but for all future Governments which may not take out the same interpretation as the Minister has taken.  This amendment cannot do the Minister any harm whatsoever <Col N="803" /> and it will beyond question copper-fasten the matter and allay the anxiety that exists at present on the part of some of us, namely, that there is a change in status in effect contemplated under the Bill, though we accept at once the Minister's statement that he does not so intend.  I do say, however, that there is within the four walls of this section a possibility that a Minister who wished to could alter the terms of an existing contract.  I think that if such a possibility exists the proper legislative thing to do is to put into the Bill now an amendment so as to place such a possibility beyond the power of anyone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>In answer to that, if the tendency was in that direction there would be some case for the Senator's amendment.  But the tendency is in quite the reverse direction.  As I pointed out on the Second Reading, under the 1926 Act the Minister had a say in these matters and it was not until 1937 that the justice was given a say in them.  As far as the status is concerned, it has been altered here but it has been altered to the advantage of the district justices.  There is a definite alteration in the direction of making their status better than it has been in the past.  Therefore, the tendency is quite the reverse.  For that reason I am not going to accept the implication contained in this amendment. I shall strongly resist it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>May I give one example of interference?  In Section 6, sub-section (2), paragraph (b), power is given to the Minister to nominate an ordinary justice of a division to act temporarily as a principal justice, but without additional remuneration, and the section says that such justice so nominated shall act accordingly.  That is to say, the principal justice gets extra salary in consideration of extra work presumably; but under sub-section (2) of Section 6, the Minister has power to say to any ordinary justice of the metropolitan division that he must act as a principal justice temporarily without remuneration.  He cannot say that to a principal justice because he cannot transfer a principal justice without <Col N="804" /> his consent.  Now, whether that is a change in the terms and conditions of service, or whether it is a breach of contract, I do not purport to say because I do not know.  Quite plainly, it gives the Minister power to make a particular individual do more work without remuneration.</P>

I believe the Committee on Procedure and Privileges take the view that it cannot.  I hold the view that it can.  I believe the Cathaoirleach is quite correct in saying that the Committee on Procedure and Privileges decided to the contrary.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LouisODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I was hoping that I would be allowed, on the Report Stage, to submit an amendment suggesting that this matter be referred back to the Dáil for the purpose of amending Section 48 of the Courts of Justice Act, 1936.  That section provides that a district justice will be entitled on retirement after 30 years' service to a full pension&mdash; that is, two-thirds of his salary.  It appears it would be very difficult for any district justice to attain that length of service.  He would need to be <Col N="811" /> appointed when very young.  First of all, he would have to be apprenticed to a solicitor or he would have to practise at the Bar and he has to be so many years qualified before he can be appointed.  The practice is not to appoint a man unless he has a good deal of experience.  A man has to be a certain age before he is appointed.</P>
      <P>It would be very difficult to attain the period of service specified.  A district justice is in somewhat the same position as a Circuit Court judge. Circuit Court judges have been appointed as young as any District Court judge.  The Circuit Court judge in our county was very young when he was appointed and the Circuit Court judges in Dublin and all over the country are very young.  They could just as easily go to 30 years' service as a district justice, but, as a matter of fact, after 15 years they can retire on full pension.  In the case of district justices I would lengthen the period from 15 to 20 years.  My suggestion is that they should get their full pension if they retire after 20 years' service.  It is a very reasonable suggestion.  Perhaps the Minister will consider it between this and Report Stage in order to see if anything could be done in that direction?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I raised this matter immediately after the Minister spoke on the Second Reading.  I was then in some doubt as to whether there was an overriding power which limited the pension to two-thirds of the salary. In case there was not such an overriding power, I put down the rider in amendment No. 7.  It appears to me that it is not unreasonable to ask that a district justice should obtain his full pension rights after 20 years' service. As Senator O'Dea has said, a district justice has to spend years in order to be qualified as a barrister or a solicitor.  Then he has to spend years practising as such before he can be appointed as a justice.  For such a man to be in the position that he must serve 30 years before he can get his full pension, seems to be a hardship. It is particularly a hardship in view of the fact that in portion if this Bill <Col N="812" /> the age limit is being reduced to 65. Some district justices have been functioning for slightly over 20 years.</P>
      <P>I do not know whether the Minister can give us any information as to the number of justices who will have to retire because of the age limit before they achieve 30 years' service.  I suggest that, having regard to the fact that 15 years' service is sufficient for the High Court and Circuit Court judges, a period of 20 years as the maximum for a district justice is not unreasonable.  I should like the Minister to look at the matter in the same light and tell us how many cases there will be in which justices, because of this section, will not get the full two-thirds pension to which I think the Minister and the House feel they are entitled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator O'Dea and Senator Sweetman in urging that the district justice should be entitled to a full pension after 20 years' service. It is only right that a district justice should be brought into line as regards pension with circuit judges and High Court judges.  Of course, district justices are as a rule appointed at an earlier age to the Bench than Circuit judges or High Court judges, but even at the present time it would be very hard to find any district justice who, being compelled to retire at 65 years of age, would have had 30 years' service to entitle him to a full pension.  It is true that over 20 years ago a number of young men were appointed district justices, but I think the tendency is to appoint more mature men as district justices nowadays.  Therefore, I can only add my voice to those of Senator O'Dea and Senator Sweetman in urging that the Minister should take some steps, by persuasion of the Minister for Finance or otherwise, to improve the pension rights of district justices in the direction indicated by Senator Sweetman and Senator O'Dea.</P>

      <P>I do not know whether the Minister can do this in this particular Bill, but certainly the position is that we have had more than 20 years' experience of the district <Col N="813" /> justices and the system, I think, has proved to be successful.  There can be no doubt about that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>The position, as explained by the Minister in the other House, is that since 1932 the tendency has been to appoint people of a later age than previous to that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">

      <P>That is right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>There are several reasons for that.  Everybody was young in 1922 and for the first ten years younger people were appointed. The retiring age has now been reduced to 65 and if the Minister for the time being or the Government for the time being should not be restricted in their choice, they should be able to appoint a person of 45 to be a district justice in the knowledge that when he is 65 he will get a full pension.  I happen to know a case which rather surprised me although on reconsideration I understand it quite well.  In the Gaeltacht a man may continue to 70. I came across a district justice recently who will go on until 70, but even at 70, having been appointed in 1924 or in or about that time, will not get his full pension.  That is to say, he will not have served 30 years when he reaches the age of 70.  He was appointed rather later than the others.  I do not want to labour the point.  I expect the Minister is, at any rate, in some sympathy with it, but in order to give freedom to appoint people of mature years and in order to recognise the success which has been achieved by district justices generally, I think they should be put, if not in exactly the same position as Circuit and High Court judges, at any rate in a better position than the present one.  The period of 30 years should certainly be reduced to 20 years.  It would make it easier to get the right type of material, I think, and it should certainly get consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HelenaConcannon" hpid="Mrs. Concannon Mrs. Concannon">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Concannon</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with those who have said that it is in the public interest that district justices as a general rule should be men of some maturity and experience of life.  For <Col N="814" /> the District Courts, which are the courts of the people, we want men not only of integrity and experience, but of ability.  At 35 it is an exceptional man who will have proved himself but between 35, 40 and 45 men develop very rapidly, especially solicitors and barristers who have contact with the world. We must consider the position of a man who has a prospect of making a good practice as a solicitor, and gives it up to become a district justice.  We want the type of men who are likely to be a success as solicitors or barristers, but we should not expect too great sacrifices from them.  They sacrifice the prospect of a good career and a business, especially in the case of a solicitor, that they could pass on, perhaps, to their son.  If a district justice gives up the profession of solicitor&mdash; it is the more concrete case I have in mind&mdash;to become a district justice, unless he has been appointed at 35 which is comparatively speaking, immature, he retires on a small pension.  I do not think that that is really in the interests of the common good.  We want, as everybody has stressed, men of ability, of great experience and ripe judgment.  They have important duties to perform and much of the peace of the countryside depends upon the judgment of the district justices.</P>

      <P>I supported this idea in another form on the last day.  The more general support there is for this idea in the House the stronger will be the Minister's position in dealing with it.  There is a problem and it is foolish for us to close our eyes to it. Those of us from rural Ireland realise the part played by the District Court in the life of the people.  It is the people's court.  The status and prestige of the law are determined to a very great extent by the competence, personality, integrity and ability of the district justice.  Personally, my view is that no matter how good the material is that is available for service in that court, it is not one bit too good for it. It is absolutely essential to get the very best material that is available.  I have had very little experience of the law in any sense, but if anyone who is practising as a barrister or solicitor <Col N="815" /> were put in the position of having an invitation from the Minister for Justice to become a district justice, what considerations would he have to take into account?  First, he would have to consider the salary; I do not know that anybody feels that district justices are adequately paid.  In my opinion they are not.  Only for the fact that the calibre of those selected for service in these courts is of very high order they might very well become suspect.  If they were a weaker type of people, in the circumstances of to-day, one might hear a number of very unpleasant suggestions made, not one of which is ever made against the manner in which our district justices discharge their duty. There are risks involved in underpaying people who have considerable responsibility to discharge.  District justices certainly are not adequately paid.  From that point of view there is no great attraction to enter that service.</P>
      <P>When they consider what will be their position at the end of their service, what do they find?  It may very well be that a man gets an invitation from the Minister when he is at an age that will not enable him, in present circumstances, to qualify for full pension.  He must ask himself the question, if he gives up all his time to his work, what will he do when he has to go out on a small pension of a few hundred pounds?  Is he to go back and try to pick up a practice as a barrister in the courts or to go into some solicitor's office or something like that? We could all cite such cases.  From that point of view, it is a very undesirable condition of affairs.</P>
      <P>I belong to a section of the people who do not believe in very high salaries, because they are accustomed to equate salaries paid to what they receive themselves, but in this respect anyhow not only is it penny wise and pound foolish but, from the point of view of the administration of the law, we are creating a situation in which the best material will not be available. When we get the best material, we are not treating it with the consideration which ability is entitled to expect.</P>

      <P>This is the matter which I promised to take up with the Minister for Finance.  I cannot commit the Government in a matter like this. Senator Hayes has seen the difficulty that it cannot be done in this Bill and I do not know whether it will be done at all.  All I can say is that I will raise the matter again with the Minister for Finance and the Government and see what, if anything, can be done about it.  I do not know why, when district justices were first appointed, the term was fixed at 40 years.  I suppose the idea was that it should be the same term as applies to the Civil Service. It was changed in 1936 to 30 years.</P>

It may be a point that we would get more applicants if there were better terms, that better applicants might come forward if better terms were available, but the fact is that these people know what their conditions are.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a stop-gap section, and I hope that, in future legislation, it will be put right.  The section provides that, where an appeal from the District Court in any matter is determined by the Circuit Court, then, unless the Circuit Court has issued the necessary instrument to enforce its decision, the District Court shall issue the said instrument.  That confuses the whole matter.  Which court is to issue the instrument?  The section arises out of a <i>certiorari</i> case brought before the High Court, in which I acted.  I advised my client not to go to the expense of trying to justify the order of the court, but, as a result of that warrant for possession of a house being fought, a state of uneasiness arose in the District Court, and I think the district justice refused to sign any further warrants lest they should be quashed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What happened in that case was that the landlord brought a summons for ejectment of a tenant who had signed a caretaker's agreement under Section 86 of Deasy's Act.  The district justice refused the warrant and the owner of the house appealed.  The Circuit Court judge made an order that the plaintiff do recover possession. That order should have been implemented by what is called an execution order of the Circuit Court, but, owing to some confusion in the rules which <Col N="818" /> provide that, when the Circuit Court makes an order on appeal from the District Court, the order of the Circuit Court shall be communicated back to the District Court so that the district justice will sign the warrant, the warrant was signed without any communication from the Circuit Court and the warrant was quashed.</P>
    <P>The section provides that the Circuit Court may issue an execution order on foot of a Circuit Court order on appeal from the District Court, or that the District Court may issue it.  It is obviously undesirable that the District Court should issue a warrant for the execution of an order which has been made by the Circuit Court.  That execution order should be issued from the Circuit Court office, and, when an appeal is taken from the District Court the District Court should no longer have anything more to do with the matter.  The matter should come to the Circuit Court which should deal finally with it.  As it is, this section provides that, when an appeal is taken from the District Court to the Circuit Court and the Circuit Court makes an order, say, for possession of a house, the order implementing the order of the Circuit Court is to be signed by a district justice.  That is highly undesirable.</P>
    <P>This is a kind of panic section to get over some temporary difficulty which arose in the District Court, and I urge the Minister to take steps to amend the rules of the District Court or the Circuit Court in relation to this matter.  The whole position with regard to appeals from the District Court to the Circuit Court is most unsatisfactory, both so far as the rules of the District Court and the rules of the Circuit Court are concerned.  I urge the Minister to look into the matter carefully.</P>

      <P>I did not know that Senator Ryan was concerned in the case in question, but I want to support what he has said from the theoretical angle.  I want, however, to take the matter very much further from the practical angle, because the fact is that, as this section is here drawn, it <Col N="819" /> is highly objectionable, from the theoretical angle, and, from the practical angle, is a futility.  It provides that where an appeal from the District Court has been taken and where the Circuit Court does not issue the necessary instrument to enforce its decision, the District Court shall issue the instrument, but there is nothing in the section or anywhere else to enable a district justice to know whether the Circuit Court has issued the necessary instrument or not.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>No, nor a subsidiary instrument.  There is nothing in the section and there are no rules dealing with the matter and the situation at the moment is that we pass the section and a case comes into the District Court on which the district justice gives his decision&mdash;let us say, with regard to possession of a house.  It passes on appeal to the Circuit Court, and the Circuit Court judge gives his decision that possession of that house shall be handed over.  The Circuit Court apparently has no power to issue the necessary execution order, and what happens?  The party concerned must go back to the district justice and say to the district justice: &ldquo;Will you issue the order for me&rdquo;? The district justice, if he has any sense at all, will not do it, without finding out whether the Circuit Court has done it or not, and there is no method provided by which he can find out.  There might, therefore, be a position in which a district justice was falsely got by this section to issue a warrant, for which a Circuit Court had been already enabled to issue the necessary document. In fact, there would be two orders on one decision.  This section, I suggest to the Minister, seriously needs further consideration so that such an eventuality shall not arise, and that there will not be such a stop-gap method which Senator Ryan has correctly described, but some practical way of ensuring that the responsibility of the various courts shall be properly co-ordinated.</P>

As far as machinery is concerned, it is quite easy, I am assured, for one court to know what the other court did.  If the Circuit Court has not done that until the rules are made right, then the District Court shall do so.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>This House considers that in view of the extent to which the value of money has depreciated in recent years, old people who depend for their subsistence on old age pensions are suffering undue privation and hardship which should be remedied, and requests the Government to introduce proposals for the purpose of providing a proper standard of maintenance for old people who have retired from remunerative employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The motion, as will be observed, is not drawn in what might be described as scientific terms.  It is drawn primarily for the purpose of securing <Col N="821" /> from this House a declaration that, in view of the extent to which the value of money has depreciated in recent years, old age pensions are inadequate, and that pensioners are suffering undue privation and hardship which should be remedied.  It urges the Government to provide a proper standard of maintenance for these old people who have ceased to be gainfully employed.</P>
    <P>It may be urged that the motion should give an indication of what is aimed at in terms of pounds, shillings and pence, but, in my opinion, we are on better ground if we indicate broadly our views as to what we aim at as far as old persons are concerned, rather than to endeavour to set out in specific figures the amount of an old age pension or blind person's pension. The motion, if it is regarded as unscientific, need not cause any surprise. The whole subject has been dealt with over a long period of years, in a rather unscientific manner as far as this country is concerned.</P>
    <P>It will not be news to some Senators &mdash;although to others it probably will be&mdash;that when the Old Age Pensions Act was promoted almost 40 years ago in the British House of Commons, the Irish Parliamentary Party of that day actually opposed its extension to Ireland and, when that proposal was defeated, the kind-hearted gentlemen who represented Ireland in the British Parliament then, proposed that the amount of the pension, as applied to Ireland, should be half the amount applying to England.  Some Senators will recall that that incident subsequently became one of the rallying cries not merely of the Labour movement but of the Sinn Féin movement in focusing public attention on the attitude of the Irish representatives in the British Parliament towards the question of social legislation, so far, at any rate, as it applied to Ireland.  But one begins to wonder whether the members of the Irish Parliamentary Party were very far removed in this matter from, say, the members of the Irish Government of 1946.  This Government are doing precisely what the Irish Parliamentary Party proposed <Col N="822" /> should be done, only they are doing it with a vengeance, and reducing the standard of pensions in Ireland, not merely to half the rate provided in Britain but, in some cases, to less than one-fourth of that rate in similar circumstances.</P>
    <P>Before old age pensions were introduced, in 1908, the only resource available to the poor and destitute was the poor law relief.  I suppose there are in this House a number of Senators who will recall the conditions under which poor law relief was provided for the poor and destitute.  I have heard it said that the amount provided by boards of guardians was usually 1/6 or 2/- weekly, and that the names of the recipients were posted at the chapel gates, so that everybody would know who was getting poor law relief.  Let us not be too sure that that mentality has entirely disappeared.  I am afraid there is still the mentality that the poor and the &ldquo;down-and-outs&rdquo; are getting something to which they are not entitled, that something is being given them out of public generosity for which they ought to be eternally grateful, and that the world should know that they were, in fact, beneficiaries of our kind-hearted benevolence.</P>
    <P>When the old age pension was first provided, in 1908, the rate was 5/- per week.  It was not a very generous pension, but it was a considerable improvement on the amount provided at that time by the poor law authorities and it did bear some relationship to the cost of living.  As a matter of fact, I offer the suggestion that the 5/-a week granted to the old age pensioner in 1908, when the old age pensioner was permitted to have a private income from other sources of £21 a year&mdash;8/- a week making a total income of 13/- a week&mdash;was equivalent in terms of purchasing power to £2 per week to-day.  The maximum pension which a person who is practically destitute can get at this moment is 16/-a week.  That is to say, if a person has a private income of more than 6/- a week, the old age pension is cut by 1/-for every 1/- that the recipient's income exceeds 6/-.  In other words, <Col N="823" /> we have set a target of 16/- a week and given notice to all and sundry that if you are going to be the recipient of compensation, assistance, or whatever you may like to call it, from public funds, you must not have an income of more than 16/- a week, as compared with the 13/- permitted in 1908 which, in my opinion, was then the equivalent of 40/- a week to-day.</P>
    <P>Let me quote a few figures to emphasise this point.  In the first place, there is a firm figure available for 1904. That is the year in which the British authorities prepared the figures which subsequently became the basis for the cost-of-living index figure of which we hear so much in every discussion nowadays. The figure ascertained by the British authorities as the minimum sum required to maintain a working class family in 1904 was 22/6.  From that calculation they assumed that for every adult person the minimum figure would be&mdash;I am not quite sure that it is for food only&mdash;4/6.  I do know that in 1908 the weekly cost of providing provisions and necessaries for an able-bodied man in a union workhouse was 3/3.  The cost of providing clothing, of course in the union workhouse, was 9d., making the total cost of maintenance in a poor law institution 4/- per week.  Therefore the old age pension at 5/- represented a payment 25 per cent. in excess of the cost of maintaining an old person in a poor law institution.  Does our old age pension provide a figure 25 per cent. in excess of the cost of maintaining a person to-day in a poor law institution?  The answer is definitely &ldquo;No&rdquo; as I shall show in a moment or two.</P>
    <P>Let us inquire further as to whether or not the 5/- a week did correspond more closely to the needs of an old person than the 10/- we provide to-day. For one thing, there is evidence that the price of a pair of gent's boots in 1908 was 6/6.  The nearest thing provided to-day in the shape of men's boots, although very much inferior in quality, I am informed would cost 27/6 or 30/-. The 4 lb. loaf which to-day is costing 1/- cost 5d in 1908.  Potatoes then cost 5d. a stone, and milk 1d per pint. <Col N="824" /> Butter was 8d. per lb and the humble herring was at the rate of three a 1d.</P>
    <P>If we may go more intimately into this question of human needs it may be permissible to recall that the price of the &ldquo;pint&rdquo; was 2d.  The price of an ounce of tobacco, which is now 1/3, was 2½d. in 1908.  So that the price of tobacco has multiplied six times, the price of the &ldquo;pint&rdquo; has multiplied four times, potatoes are four or five times more expensive, bread is two and a half times and milk three and a half times dearer.  I think I am safe in asserting that while there was considerable criticism of the inadequacy of the 5/- pension in 1908&mdash;and I think with some justification if we consider the old age pensioner as a social being with human rights&mdash;that 5/- went very much nearer to meeting the needs of an old person in 1908 than 10/- does to-day.</P>
    <P>I want again to emphasise the point that the 10/- pension is not given to every person at 70 years of age.  It is given subject to a means test and if, in any set of circumstances, it can be estimated by an official of the Revenue Commissioners that the old person, at 70 years of age or over, has an income exceeding 6/- a week, he cannot get 10/-.  If it is estimated that he is allowed from any source an income of 1/- per day, his old age pension becomes 9/- and so on down the scale. As I have said, we allow the old age pensioner to have an income from private sources of only 6/- per week, if he is to receive the maximum pension of 10/-, whereas, under the Old Age Pensions Act of 1908, he could receive the maximum pension if his other income did not exceed 8/-, although 8/- would then be the equivalent of at least 24/- a week now.  We have not progressed very far in our outlook when it comes to the treatment of the destitute poor.  For it must be always remembered that strictly this is a measure, where the full rate of pension is provided, applying to the destitute poor only.</P>
    <P>An old person who receives even a modest allowance from a son or daughter, possibly from a son who has gone over to England to work in a munition factory, is immediately <Col N="825" /> approached by an officer of the Government, who revalues the means of the recipient, and the pension is cut. I have a statement here from a correspondent in Courtmacsherry which will illustrate better than anything I have said what is happening.  This correspondent writes:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Mr. X, who resides at Ramsay Hill, was in receipt of a blind pension for a number of years.  Then his son joined the British Army and made him an allowance of 10/- a week.  He also sent the father some small sums to provide him with additional food, pay for laundry, etc. The value of these payments was reckoned officially at 6/- a week, and the blind pension was cut off.  We have done what we could to get the case reopened and the pension restored to this old man, but all our efforts have failed.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>How this situation affects people who, through old age or blindness, are unable to continue providing their own income and buying with their own money the things they need, is illustrated in one short paragraph I will read from a letter sent to me by a railway worker in West Cork.  He finishes up his complaint in this manner:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Just now the family are wondering where they will get food, never mind clothes, for the children.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This is a case of a person who is not 70 years of age but is totally blind:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Worst of all is the condition of the man himself.  He felt some independence while he was getting the 10/- pension, but now that that is gone he feels that he is a trespasser in his own house and that every bit he eats is taken out of the children's mouths.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>These are the conditions which apply in the case of people who have devoted 50 or 60 years of their lives to creating wealth for this country.  When we talk about the expenditure we intend to undertake on electricity schemes, on drainage and reclamation and all the other services, let us not forget that we have the resources with which to provide this money because these old people laboured for 50 or 60 years, <Col N="826" /> from dawn to dark, not merely to make a living for themselves but to create the wealth which is the source of our prosperity to-day, such as it is.  This is the reward we give them.  If they had served in the Army, in the British Army or the German Army or in any fighting capacity in any army in the world, even though they would have been destroying life and property, they would get at the end a pension which would at least buy for them in their old age the bare necessaries of life. But because they served in their own quiet way in tilling the fields, tending the cattle, building houses, cutting turf, slaving in mines and factories and so creating wealth for the community, during their active years, they are being dismissed with 10/- a week at most and, if they have a meagre private income of anything exceeding 6/- a week, they get less than the 10/- pension.</P>
    <P>The history of the old age pension scheme is very interesting but it reflects no credit on any Government which we have had in the past 25 years.  In 1919 the British Government, recognising the depreciation in the value of money&mdash;which is mentioned in this resolution&mdash;as it applied in that period, increased the pension from 5/-to 10/- and permitted the recipient to have in addition a sum not exceeding £26 5s. 0d. a year, so that the pensioner who in 1908 was permitted to have 13/- a week was permitted in 1919 to have 20/- a week.  In other words, he could have an income of his own from the produce of his garden, from cutting turf, even from earning wages, up to 10/- a week and still get the 100 per cent pension.</P>
    <P>We do not permit people now to be so lavish or so extravagant.  In 1924, an Irish Government, as one of its first measures of economy, cut the pension by 1/-.  In the same Budget, of course, they cut the income-tax by 1/-, so that they were cutting all round, cutting the expenditure of the rich and cutting the food which was to enter the stomachs of the poor.  Nine shillings became the maximum in 1924.</P>
    <P>We were told that that was restored later&mdash;in 1928&mdash;but it was not, in fact, restored.  The maximum was raised <Col N="827" /> from 9/- to 10/-, but the means test was tightened up, so that where in 1924 you would get the maximum pension with a private income not exceeding £18 5s. 0d. you could no longer, after 1928, get the maximum if your private income exceeded £15 12s. 0d.  Therefore, to-day, in 1946, a person who has a private income exceeding 6/- a week from labour, from a garden, from the rent of a house or from any other source, or by way of a gift from some member of his family, can get only 9/-a week old age pension.  That means that, for all practical purposes, the cut enforced in 1924 remains to this day. It is merely misleading the public to say that it was restored in 1928 to 10/-. It was restored to some where the depths of destitution were sufficiently acute, but if you had an income of 1/-a day you could get no more than 9/-a week even after the so-called restoration.</P>
    <P>I now want to offer this further suggestion, that the 16/- maximum income which is permitted to an old age pensioner to-day has no greater buying power than 9/3 in 1928.  Strictly relating the figures&mdash;and in any way you like to relate the figures&mdash;of 1928 with those of 1946, it must be accepted that the 16/- maximum which is permitted now will purchase no more for the pensioner than he would have purchased with 9/3 in 1928.  In fact, therefore, the income of the old age pensioner is infinitely lower now than it was either in 1924 or 1928.</P>
    <P>Now let us consider whether there is any standard by which we can measure in money the needs of an old person of 70 years who is no longer able to earn for himself.  There are many such measuring rods but I do not know if they are satisfactory or whether they are going to help us because if I refer to them I may mislead some people and perhaps present the Minister with an opportunity of suggesting that I am making some fantastic claim on behalf of those old people which if admitted would bring the country down to the verge of poverty. I cannot resist, however, the temptation to mention one or two points in relation to standards of living <Col N="828" /> which seem to indicate the insufficiency of the standard that we provide.  In his book <i>Human Needs of Labour</i> Mr. Rowntree calculated that at December, 1937 the lowest sum on which a single woman in Britain could maintain physical efficiency was 32/10 a week. Now let us not misunderstand these figures.  In the first place, they are British figures and, therefore, to provide physical efficiency here for the single woman that Mr. Rowntree had in mind would cost more in 1937 than 32/10 because our prices were substantially higher in 1937 than the British prices.  Nor do I desire to overlook the fact that this figure relates to the cost of maintaining a working woman in physical efficiency.  From that I conclude I think reasonably that an old person who has retired from work would not require as much income to maintain herself as a person actively working.  Accordingly, I make a deduction of 20 per cent to arrive at a figure for the person of 70 years of age who is no longer engaged in physical work.  That gives me a figure of 26/3.  Now, it has been the experience of everybody compiling statistics, in relation to the cost-of-living figure, that those whose incomes are less than £3 a week spend approximately 60 per cent of their income on food.  Taking 60 per cent of 26/3 leaves me 15/9 as the cost of food alone for an old retired person.  That was in 1937.  The cost of living has increased more than 70 per cent in the interval, and if you increase the 15/9 by 70 per cent. you get a total of 27/- a week. On this calculation, and making allowance for all my assumptions&mdash;whether reasonable or unreasonable I do not argue&mdash;it would require not here but in Great Britain, 27/- to provide food for an adult non-working person in the year 1946.</P>
    <P>My assumptions may be wrong.  I do not know.  I am not standing emphatically on this figure.  I merely quote it to show how I arrived at a conclusion that the present pension rate is totally inadequate and that we must strive to get a higher figure.</P>
    <P>I have been looking at the cost of maintaining old people in our own institutions.  It is pretty obvious that <Col N="829" /> a man or a woman living in his or her own home, or in somebody else's home, cannot buy the essentials of life at a lower price than these are bought at by public institutions.  The public institution buys commodities by tender and buys them in bulk quantities.  It does not, like the old age pensioner, buy a pound loaf or a half pint of milk or a quarter stone of potatoes. Potatoes are bought by the ton, milk by the hundred gallons and, in the case of bread, the flour is probably bought and baked in the institution as in the case of military establishments and prisons.  But, bearing all these considerations in mind, let us remember that the cost of providing food only&mdash;I ask Senators to bear this in mind&mdash;for an inmate in St. Kevin's Poor Law Institution in Dublin is 10/11 per week. That is 11d. more than we give to an old age pensioner to buy food and clothing and to pay rent.  The cost of food in the Kildare County Home is 11/- per week, in the Meath County Home, 12/4, and in Westmeath County Home, 14/2.  That gives some indication of the inadequacy of the provision we are making for old people.  The total sum that we provide for an old person, who has spent 50 or 60 years of his life producing wealth for this country, only covers two-thirds of the cost of food alone in the case of the Westmeath County Home.  If old people go into one of these institutions we must do more than feed them.  We have got to clothe them, to pay people to look after them, to pay nurses and doctors and to meet the cost of heating the place, so that it is a very profitable transaction for the State to keep old age pensioners hanging on outside.  For one thing, they will die quicker outside, because they will have less nutrition.  Besides, it costs less than half as much to maintain them outside as in a poor law institution.</P>
    <P>The cost of maintaining a convict in Portlaoighise Convict Prison&mdash;the cost of food alone&mdash;is 11/1 per week.  Portlaoighise Prison has attached to it a very substantial farm on which many of the commodities used in the prison are produced.  I think that the bread for Portlaoighise Prison is provided <Col N="830" /> from Mountjoy Prison.  In answer to a question in the Dáil on the 26th June, the Minister for Justice said that the production of a 4lb. loaf in Mountjoy Prison is estimated as follows: Cost of flour and other materials, 8¼d.; fuel, 1d., making a total cost of 9¼d., so that when you get a pretty low figure for maintaining a convict in one of our prisons you must bear in mind that bread, for instance, which is a big item in most maintenance, costs 9¼d. in the prison as against 1/- for the old age pensioner; it is certainly not less than 1/- for the 4lb. loaf.  The prisons and other institutions have, of course, farms attached to them; they rear pigs and so forth.  They are thereby enabled to provide and supply food to the inmates at the cost of production.</P>
    <P>I have been making some inquiry into what it costs us here to maintain a soldier, assuming for a moment that the old age pensioner could get a new gland and join the Army.  The figures provided by the Minister for Defence show that the average weekly cost of maintaining an unmarried Class III private soldier is 50/8 a week.  I am not saying now that the soldier is not very badly paid.  We are not very lavish, I fear, in our treatment of soldiers or of public servants generally. I am merely contrasting one figure with the other and the net purpose of my contrast is to show that the amount we provide for the old age pensioner is totally inadequate.</P>
    <P>Now, how are other States&mdash;big and small&mdash;providing for their old people?  Is there any evidence that other countries indicate a desire to make the lot of the old person less burdensome and less unhappy?  I think there is.  In Britain, for instance, beginning on the 1st October, a single man or a single woman of 65 years of age will receive a pension of 26/- a week.  A married couple, living together, will get 42/- a week.  No doubt Britain is a very big country and no doubt we shall be told it is a very rich country. In that connection it is rather strange to note that according to the index of industrial production calculated by Colin Clarke, our output per worker is greater than it is in Britain; the <Col N="831" /> output per head of the industrial population in Ireland before the war was greater than that obtaining in Britain. However, Britain is a big country with some 46,000,000 people.  I am not going to draw attention to some of the expenses they have had to bear in the past and some of the costs they have had to incur.  I merely mention the matter for the purpose of drawing attention to the figure now provided&mdash; may I add, by a Labour Government&mdash; for their old and destitute poor.  Of course, when a Tory Government ruled Britain such as we have at present in Ireland, the same argument was advanced as has been advanced by the apologists for our Government here. They could afford it.  That is what Chamberlain and Churchill said.  That is what our Government here will tell us in this debate.  But Governments always find money for the things which they consider are worth while.</P>
    <P>New Zealand is not a very big country.  In area it is admittedly four times the size of our State, but almost one-third of its land surface is covered with mountain ranges and two or three important centres in the country are subject to volcanic eruptions.  The population, if you take the Maoris with the Europeans, is little more than half our population.  The total figure is 1,600,000.  For a single man aged 60 a pension is provided of 32/6 a week.  A married couple gets 65/-.  But there is actually something more than that, because I have been reading a pamphlet written by the Hon. Walter Nash, Finance Minister in New Zealand, who says: &ldquo;In addition&rdquo;&mdash; that is, referring to the £3 5s. 0d. a week for a married couple&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;such a couple could have £1 a week of their own, have up to £500 in the Post Office Savings Bank and own their own home without affecting their social security pension&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>That is very substantially different from what we do here.</P>
    <P>Apart from that, New Zealand has now introduced a universal superannuation scheme.  The Hon. Walter Nash says in reference to it:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We are now providing by stages <Col N="832" /> for universal superannuation without any means test.  In 1940 everyone over 65 years of age received £10 per year&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Bear in mind, everyone over 65.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;This sum increases by £2 10s. 0d. each year and will go on increasing until all receive 32/6 a week in 1970. The amount paid in April, 1944, was £20 a year.  It may be said here that the purchasing power of the £ in New Zealand is fully equal to what it would be in Great Britain.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The purchasing power of the £ in Great Britain, we know in terms of boots, shoes, herrings, not to mention strawberries, at 4/6 a lb.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>Oh, no.  They are cheaper than that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Hayes says they are cheaper.  I accept his word for that, because I myself have not been buying strawberries.  However, I notice that tomatoes are 4/- in the shop windows.  Tomatoes in Britain are selling at 1/4 per lb.  I take it that when the Hon. Walter Nash says the purchasing power of the £ in New Zealand is as good as it is in Britain he means it has a higher purchasing power than it has here.  I mention the pensions provided in New Zealand because I think there are many things about the country and its systems that we might usefully study.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now look at Sweden.  Sweden has nothing like all the advantages we are told Britain possesses&mdash;size, climate, and population.  She has not the advantage New Zealand has of having about four times as many acres per head of the population.  We are familiar with all these arguments.  In Sweden there is a pension of 46/- a week.  France has a scheme&mdash;and I think it can be safely said that France is one of the most poverty stricken countries in Europe to-day&mdash;whereby she will provide pensions at 65; and the rate of pension is to be half the average national wage, plus 10 per cent. if the pensioner reared three children, or plus 20 per cent. if the pensioner reared more than three children.  I do not know whether these figures have <Col N="833" /> any interest for the Minister or for the House.  They certainly interest me.  I hate to think that we here are less mindful of the debt we owe to our old people than are the peoples of other countries.  I think, too, that the way in which we treat our old people, that in the provision we make for their maintenance, there is something which is going to have an adverse effect on the attitude of our young people towards the question whether they will decide to settle down in Ireland or make their homes elsewhere.  That is <Col N="834" /> a serious problem with us at the moment.  Thousands of our people have left the country in the last five or six years.  The great majority of them were quite young.  We have to ask ourselves the question squarely: are they going to come back again and work here?  Perhaps we should also ask ourselves the further question: do we even want them back?</P>
