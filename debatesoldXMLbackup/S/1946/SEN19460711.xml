      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Local Government (Remission of Rates) Act, 1940, applied to residences which were not cottages under the Labourers Acts or houses under the Housing of the Working Classes Acts, as amended by the Housing Act, 1932, or houses in respect of which grants were made under the Housing Acts, 1924-25 or 1925-31 or any houses in respect of which a grant was made under the various Housing Acts from 1932 to 1942.  It did not apply, either, to residences relieved of rates under the Gaeltacht Housing Acts.  The Act, as I think the Seanad will remember from last year, provided for two-thirds remission of rates for five years on any such residences which were erected, enlarged or improved in the period commencing 1st October, 1939, and ending 30th September, 1942.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1943-45 amending Acts extended the period mentioned up to 31st March, 1945, and 31st March, 1946, respectively. The purpose of the present Bill is to grant a further extension up to the 31st March, 1948, so that new dwelling-houses <Col N="634" /> and enlargements and improvements of existing houses, completed in the current and next financial years, may rank for remission.  A small number of residences are being constructed or enlarged which would stand for remission under this particular form of legislation.  They would not gain the benefit of the remission of rates if this Act were not extended. We can also anticipate an increase of building on a more normal scale and builders will commence to look for concessions hitherto granted by way of some partial relief of rates.  The Bill contains no new principles or any kind.  As was mentioned in this House when the present Act was before it, the reliefs apply to the building or reconstruction of larger residences and of out-buildings to larger residences. They apply to a building containing a number of residential flats and to a residential flat constructed above a shop that had already been built.</P>
    <P>It would also apply to certain out-buildings. It does not affect the improvement of farm buildings, which receive remissions under another enactment. The object of the remissions under this Bill is to encourage building and to give some concession to owners of residences by way of remission of rates for a limited period, it being recognised that after this limited period they must obviously pay their due share  for the maintenance of local services.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>This is obviously a non-contentious Bill.  It merely extends for a couple of years the provisions already in operation.  It is a good thing that it is being introduced now at the beginning of the period, rather than that the two-year period should be allowed so nearly to expire, as it was, I think, in the case of the 1935 Act.  Having regard to its being completely non-contentious, to extend the remission of rates for new houses in certain circumstances, it is a Bill to which the House might agree without much discussion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Aiken) Frank Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Aiken)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is necessary because, though the emergency which gave rise to the Emergency Powers Act of 1939, may have passed, the conditions created by the emergency and affecting the life of the community in many respects still persist to a very large extent. Many commodities in everyday use are still scarce and in the interests of consumers their distribution must be controlled by the continuance of the rationing schemes applied to them while the worst phase of the emergency conditions were with us. Moreover, the scarcity of commodities essential in the everyday life of the community requires that the specific powers taken for the control of prices should be continued, and it will be within the knowledge of Senators that in numerous other directions restrictions are necessary in the general <Col N="636" /> interests, such as, for instance, those applied to dealings in foreign exchange.</P>
      <P>The Government are anxious to retain only those powers which will enable effective control to be exercised in the directions where that control is still required and the Orders which, in fulfilment of this object, are regarded as necessary to continue in operation, have been set out in an explanatory memorandum circulated with the Bill. Already a number of powers taken under the Emergency Powers Act have been relinquished and, as soon as it is safe to do so, other powers will be relinquished. In the appendix on page 7 of the explanatory memorandum circulated with the Bill will be found a list of the articles of the Emergency Powers (No. 1) Order, 1939, which it is proposed to continue.  Only nine articles are to be so continued out of the 91 included in the Order as first made. The appendix to the explanatory memorandum lists in numerical order the Governmental Orders made under the Emergency Powers Act of 1939 and the Emergency Powers Order of 1939, which are to be continued.  Orders now in existence and continued under the Bill can be amended up to the appointed day, but after the appointed day Orders can only be made by the Government under Section 2 of the Bill in relation to the specific matters set out in Section 2.  Any of the existing Orders which relates to a matter not specifically covered under Section 2 of the Bill will not be capable of amendment after the appointed day, which will be the 2nd September.  Such an Order can only be revoked.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The matters which can be covered by Government Orders to be made under the powers conferred by this Bill are detailed in Section 2.  Briefly, they cover rationing, control of exports and imports, currency restrictions, the compulsory tillage of land, the production of turf, the facilitation of the financing of purchases of essential goods by the special purchasing companies set up for that purpose and, finally, the reduction or suspension of customs duties on certain articles.  It is well to repeat that after the 2nd September the Government will have no power to make <Col N="637" /> Orders save in relation to the matters which I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>The preceding remarks relate almost entirely to Orders made by the Government. In addition, as Senators are aware, numerous subsidiary Orders were made by Ministers under powers conferred by Government Orders. These subsidiary Orders continue in force either until they are specifically revoked or until the main Government Orders under which they were made have been revoked.  A large number of these subsidiary Orders has limited application and, for this reason as well as the fact that many of them are of short duration, they have not been listed in the explanatory memorandum. These Orders deal, among other things, with the details of rationing, the control of prices, and such like matters covering conditions arising out of the emergency.  A list of all these Orders of more than passing interest as well as of Government Orders in force at the 31st December, 1945, was published early this year as an index to the Emergency Powers Order.  It is proposed within a short period after the 2nd September next to reissue this index with brief particulars of all the Government and subsidiary Orders which will be in force at the 2nd September. The same policy will apply to subsidiary Orders as that which I have mentioned applies to Government Orders, namely, that they will be revoked immediately the need for them has passed.  That need is being constantly reviewed in all Departments.</P>
    <P>Under the Emergency Powers Act and the Emergency Powers Order it was provided that Orders made by the Government should be laid before each House of the Oireachtas, and there was power to annul.  The Bill now before the House not only makes similar provision in relation to Government Orders but extends the provision to cover Ministerial or subsidiary Orders. Similar provisions to those in Section 8 of the Emergency Powers Act with regard to the charging of fees are contained in the Bill.  Fees have been charged on the issue of licences, permits and certificates and, in accordance with the undertaking given at the time the Emergency Powers Act was under <Col N="638" /> consideration, these fees have been fixed at such amounts as to cover only the costs of administration of the schemes in respect of which the licences, permits and certificates were issued.  Any fees at present payable will continue at the amounts heretofore fixed.</P>
    <P>The provisions in Section 6 of the Bill dealing with offences, prosecutions and punishments merely re-enact existing provisions in respect of these matters.  I should refer at this stage to the provision in sub-section (9) of Section 6 which exempts summary proceedings for an offence under Section 6 from the limitations imposed by sub-section (4) of Section 10 of the Petty Sessions (Ireland) Act, 1851.  Under Section 10 (4) of the 1851 Act, summary proceedings must be initiated within six months after the date of the offence.  It was found that this limitation militated against the enforcement of many of the powers taken to cope with emergency conditions affecting the life of the community.  In particular it was found that the enforcement of the compulsory tillage regulations could not be operated with this six months' limit because inspection of holdings to see if the statutory requirements were fulfilled could not be undertaken until after a fixed date (18th July each year) and that was the date by reference to which the commission of the offence was determined.  In the debate in Dáil Eireann it was represented that it was inequitable to the defendants to defer the taking of summary proceedings for an undue period after the date on which the offence was alleged to have been committed. It is recognised that these representations had much force behind them, and it is proposed on Committee Stage in the Seanad to introduce an amendment, the effect of which will be to extend the period of six months, as fixed by the Act of 1851, to 12 months but not further.</P>
    <P>Though the shortages in supplies of very essential goods still exist, there are signs of improvement in the supply position in certain directions.  For instance, it was possible to increase the tea ration and to relax the provisions of the clothes rationing Orders.  It <Col N="639" /> is hoped that the improvement will continue and that before many months the stage will have been reached when rationing may be abandoned.  That stage has not yet been reached and consequently I feel confident that the Seanad will recognise the need for this Bill, as one of its main purposes is to secure fair distribution of goods in short supply.  The Bill will be in operation only until the 1st September, 1947, and will not be continued beyond that date unless the circumstances which have necessitated its introduction still persist.  In such an event, legislation will have to be introduced.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The main purpose of the Bill, of course, as the Minister has said, is to continue for a period certain limited Emergency Powers Orders.  It is perhaps a little unfortunate that the method of drafting the Bill is such that the Emergency Powers Orders continued in operation are merely referred to in an appendix by way of a White Paper and not in the Bill itself.  One must assume, however, that the White Paper as such is correct.  So far as the main provisions of the Bill are concerned, I propose merely to direct the attention of the House to the powers that are being continued in operation as detailed in that appendix. One can understand of course that it is absolutely necessary to continue in operation for a further year powers in regard to rationing.  That is self-evident to everybody.  I was extremely glad to hear the Minister say that the extension of the limit of six months provided in the Petty Sessions Act was going to be confined to 12 months because I think there were serious causes of complaint in the fact that a person was called upon to make up a defence so long after the event which formed the basis of the prosecution.  I take it that the extension beyond the period of six months is not merely in regard to compulsory tillage Orders but in regard to every Order which is retained in force under the provisions of the Bill.  If that is correct, I would suggest that, while it can be understood perhaps in regard to compulsory tillage, the Minister should explain what are the things other than compulsory <Col N="640" /> tillage offences, for which it is desirable to prosecute at a time beyond the normal period of six months provided for under the Act of 1851.  The matter is governed by sub-section (9) of Section 6 of this Bill which appears to me to be a general provision and not merely a provision applying to the compulsory tillage Orders.</P>
      <P>I regret also that the Minister has seen fit to provide under the Bill that the Orders, as such, are on the same level as statutes in regard to judicial notice.  There has been considerable difficulty in dealing with the details of Orders in the courts.  It was a sound practice that the Order under which the offence was being prosecuted should be handed into the justice so that the justice, particularly in cases where the defendant was not professionally represented, could have the exact terms of the Order completely before him and not merely have to depend on the judicial notice which affects any statute even though the justice may not actually have it physically on his bench at the time he is considering the matter.  These, however, are matters more for the Committee Stage than for the Second Reading.</P>
      <P>I also think it is unnecessary at this stage to retain under the emergency powers as set out in the appendix, powers to take possession of land.  As I understood it, land was to be taken under an Emergency Powers Order to provide sites for defensive purposes, sites perhaps for turf camps, turbary rights and so forth.  I understand the situation now is that Bord na Móna, and the Turf Development Board previously, have taken all the land that is required, and in that respect it should not be necessary to continue that power.  I think it undesirable that acquisition now should take place under an Emergency Powers Order rather than by ordinary proceedings under the existing statute law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also fail to understand why the power to search premises and vehicles is required to be left in the wide sense in which it is.  One could understand that power of that sort would be necessary where black marketing activities were suspected.  The power originally granted was granted to deal <Col N="641" /> with very much more than that.  In my opinion it is desirable that the power to stop and search should be limited to cases where a Gárda officer had reason to suspect that a vessel, craft or vehicle was likely to be used for black marketing activities, but that, apart from that, the power could not be used for any other purpose.  With regard to the ordinary power given to the Department of Local Government to stop vehicles, one can say, having regard to the long period during which vehicles were laid up, that it was desirable such a power should be there to see whether those vehicles were serviceable or not.  In view of the fact that vehicles have now been on the road for a period of six months, one wonders whether it is necessary to continue that power in operation.</P>
    <P>One of the Orders which is continued under this Bill deals with a great many nominal companies.  I had my crack at the Minister already on that, and it is not my intention to pursue the subject to-day.  I do, however, want to refer to one matter that arises specifically out of the Orders that we are continuing.  On page 10 of the White Paper the first Order mentioned is the one which enables the Minister for Finance to take up shares in Irish Shipping, Ltd.  That, I presume, is the parent Order under which the control of Irish Shipping Ltd., should properly be discussed.  I do not propose to go into any details in regard to Irish Shipping Ltd., but I do want to protest most emphatically against the action of that company in utilising its capital for a purpose that was not indicated or anticipated at the time when the Order setting it up was made.  I happen myself to be a shareholder in the Insurance Corporation of Ireland.  So far as my position as a shareholder in that company is concerned the intervention of Irish Shipping, Ltd., with that company was good for me because it resulted in appreciating the shares in the Insurance Corporation of Ireland.</P>
    <P>The fact that the shares of that company were enhanced thereby resulted in a certain material advantage to me, but notwithstanding that, as a public representative I must enter a <Col N="642" /> most emphatic protest against this Irish shipping company, which was granted moneys by the Oireachtas for a certain specific purpose&mdash;to bring goods here and insure against war risks&mdash;taking up shares in an ordinary private industrial company like the Insurance Corporation of Ireland without having the sanction of the Oireachtas to do so.</P>
    <P>That appears to me to suggest possibilities which I sincerely hope will not be followed in regard to other State-owned companies.  I could quite understand the directors of Irish Shipping Ltd. wishing to leave, on one side, their insurance arm after the termination of hostilities and negotiating with some existing commercial company an arrangement by virtue of which they would hand over their insurance arm to it for certain considerations. I could quite understand an agreement of that sort being negotiated with a commercial company with the sanction of its shareholders. It appears to me to be vital, in the interests of Parliamentary control, that the Government should also have come to the Oireachtas, as the directors of the commercial interest would have gone to their shareholders, and put before it proposals that Irish Shipping Ltd. should do this and seek Parliamentary sanction for it.  If that had been done there would not be any objection to the procedure adopted. As I have already said, from the point of view of my personal interest, what has happened has undoubtedly enhanced the value of my shares in the commercial company.  I do want to say, however, that for a Government-sponsored, controlled and owned company to go out of its way to engage in what is quite frankly a speculation&mdash; though I believe it is a sound speculation&mdash;and take up shares in an ordinary commercial concern operating in normal peace times&mdash;to do that under powers given for the emergency&mdash; appears to border very closely on sharp practice.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>It will generally be acknowledged by the House that controls must be maintained so long as supplies are short, and so long as there is a difficulty in satisfying the public <Col N="643" /> demand in many respects.  Therefore, the case of the Bill is established in that first sentence.  We cannot quarrel with the Minister's proposition to extend the period during which certain Orders made under the Emergency Powers Act will be continued for a limited period.  On that point, I would like to refer to the discussion which took place here last year when the Emergency Powers Act was being continued for an additional year.  One of the things that we were insistent upon was that the Bill should be introduced at a time in which there would be ample opportunity to consider its implications. I think I suggested that it might be introduced early in the session, say, in February, so that there would be no rush, as there was last year on the eve of the Recess when we were asked to give all stages of the Bill in the one day and hope for the best.  We have improved on that this year to some extent, but why in the name of all that is good and merciful does the Minister fix the expiring date as the 2nd September, 1947?  Is there any reason why this Bill should not run for an additional three months and expire on the 31st December, 1947?  That would give us ample time in the autumn session, if we live and happen to be here, to discuss the situation which would arise if it is necessary next year to continue this Act.  I would urge that on the Minister.  It may seem a very small point, but it is at least significant to the extent that it would enable us to have plenty of time in the autumn session to discuss the Bill.  I would urge him to extend the date for the additional three months until the 31st December, 1947.</P>
      <P>There are only two points that I want to refer to in relation to this Bill. I feel that it would be much more satisfactory if the schedule to the White Paper had been inserted as a schedule to the Bill.  That would be a far better way to deal with this problem, because as it is we are very largely taking a shot in the dark.  We are giving power to the Government, and we are going to extend the life of certain Orders, but, strictly, we do not know what Orders are being prolonged under this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="644" /> We have the statement that nothing will be continued under the Bill except the Orders mentioned in the White Paper but that is not mandatory.  If the Minister finds in his pigeon-hole an Order which he had forgotten to tabulate but which he thinks ought to be continued, there is nothing to prevent his continuing it under the Bill. That is a very unsatisfactory way to pass legislation.  A big improvement is being made in the manner in which Orders will be dealt with in future, inasmuch as these Orders, irrespective of their category, will be tabled and both Houses will have an opportunity of annulling them if there is a case for their annulment.  That is a big improvement on what has been done for the past six years, when only a particular type of Order&mdash;a Government Order&mdash;was tabled.  Ministerial Orders were not tabled, nor were they even brought to public notice.  Parties have appeared in court in connection with prosecutions and it was found that nobody had a copy of the Order under which the proceedings were being taken&mdash;not even the district justice.</P>
    <P>The second point to which I want to refer arises out of this question of prosecutions.  I want to urge on the Minister what I urged on his colleague when we were enacting legislation to abolish the Department of Supplies&mdash; that, unless in exceptional circumstances, the machinery of the Special Criminal Court should not be utilised for prosecutions under this Act.  If we have established a system for the administration of our laws under the Constitution and if we have set up a judiciary and made it independent of Parliament and of the Government in order that it might impartially administer the law and maintain the balance fairly between the citizen and the State, I think we ought to be very slow, save in exceptional circumstances, to permit any departure from the practice which requires that the machinery of the courts be utilised for prosecutions.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce, when presenting to us the Bill for the abolition of the Department of Supplies, dealt with this matter to some extent.  He said that, when he was winding-up the business of the Department, he would make a <Col N="645" /> memorandum for the guidance of his successor in the next world-crisis, pointing out that there should be some special procedure for dealing with emergency powers regulations, apart from the ordinary District Court.  I do not think he went further than that. I do not think that he said that the court should be a Special Criminal Court composed entirely of military officers.</P>
    <P>He did suggest, for a variety of reasons, the District Court was not the best instrument for enforcing these regulations.  What has been happening? A number of these cases have been dealt with in the District Court and, so far as one can gather, dealt with very effectively.  Indeed, the Minister for Industry and Commerce has claimed that we are more free from black market offences than any other country in Europe.  It was not the Special Criminal Court which achieved that result because, in the Dáil a few weeks ago, the Minister for Industry and Commerce said that less than 1 per cent. of the prosecutions were brought before the Special Criminal Court.  What was achieved by bringing these cases before the Special Criminal Court?  Extremely heavy penalties were imposed and, in most cases, it was worth while to appeal against the conviction.  Appeals were taken and invariably resulted in the High Court or Supreme Court setting aside the conviction and rendering the State liable for its own costs, for the defendant's costs and the costs of a new prosecution.  I do not think that that will improve popular regard for the law.  The average poor man sees the matter in this way: I happen to be poor and I am prosecuted for having overcharged for butter, bacon or tea. I am taken before the Special Criminal Court and I am fined £500 or given 12 months' imprisonment as an alternative. Because I am a poor man, I have to serve the sentence.  In another case, a fine of £5,000 is imposed or three months' imprisonment.  If the person concerned has made, in these transactions, a profit of £30,000, he can afford to brief Senator Ryan or Senator Kingsmill Moore to bring the conviction up to the Supreme Court, where <Col N="646" /> it is quashed.  I suggest that, in the enforcement of Orders under this Act, resort should be had to the ordinary courts established under the Constitution. I do not want to be told that the Special Criminal Court is provided for under the Constitution.  I know it is but it is regarded by everybody in the country as extra-Constitutional.  I urge that these prosecutions be brought in the ordinary courts and that advantage should not be taken of their place in the category of crime to send them to special courts, which, in the long run, with all respect to them, have no capacity for the weighing of evidence or for giving effect to the type of consideration which a lawyer is trained to understand.</P>
    <P>There is one other point to which I should like to allude.  Power is taken in Section 2 to continue to make new regulations, if necessary, regarding transactions relating to currency.  I have been utterly bewildered in the past by the manner in which corresponding regulations in the Emergency Powers Act have been operated.  Under these regulations, a case of considerable importance was brought, in the first instance, before the Special Criminal Court.  There was an appeal to the Supreme Court and the decision of the Special Criminal Court was set aside.  This was a case in which certain persons were prosecuted for transactions relating to watches.  I do not propose to discuss the case or to say anything regarding it beyond this &mdash;that I have been completely unable to understand the interest of this State in preventing citizens importing watches from Switzerland during the war.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>That is where all the humbug and tosh comes in.  Orders were made under the Emergency Powers Act prohibiting the importation under licence of watches into Ireland. Certain people applied to the Department of Finance for permission to import watches and pay for them in sterling, but the Department refused I made some inquiries to ascertain the <Col N="647" /> grounds on which the Department refused permission to Irish citizens to import Swiss watches and the reason given to me was that we were expending sterling on the importation of watches, and, therefore, were losing some of our sterling assets, that those watches were brought into the country and sold to English and Six County visitors&mdash;and that seemed a heinous crime.  The answer I made was: &ldquo;Suppose we are giving away sterling, in exchange for Swiss watches, we have the satisfaction that when the war is over, and if everything goes to the worst, instead of having paper money we will have gold watches, an asset of some value; we will have watches and clocks and other commodities which people will require.&rdquo; In regard to the suggestion that they were being imported for the purpose of being sold to visitors and so exported, I pointed out that, if that was so, we were getting back the sterling, plus some profit, and also that it was giving employment and wages to the people engaged here in those transactions</P>
      <P>I have never been able to understand how any purely Irish interest was being promoted by the regulations under which our citizens were forbidden to import Swiss watches, unless it be in the interest of keeping good terms with the Bank of England and the British Treasury in its control over the use of sterling.  If the Minister said it was to keep on good terms with Great Britain that we should make this regulation, I am prepared to accept the statement; but on no other grounds can action taken under an Emergency Powers Order in relation to the importation of these foreign goods be justified in this House or anywhere else.</P>
      <P>I hope that under this Bill, when it becomes an Act, we are going to get away from the practice which was in vogue during the emergency in relation, in particular, to the importation of foreign commodities which involve a payment of sterling outside the sterling area.</P>

      <P>Like Senator Sweetman, I was uneasy when I saw the limitation of six months abolished, but am glad to <Col N="648" /> hear the Minister say he is going to make a limitation of 12 months, and that is satisfactory to me.  With regard to the Emergency Powers Order authorising the acquisition of land, Senator Sweetman said that an Act we have passed empowers Bord na Móna to acquire land.  That is so, but county councils have also acquired land and spent large sums of money on different bogs and it is necessary that they should continue to be able to acquire land and hold it for certain purposes. I think that is the reason why particular emergency power is continued in this Bill.</P>
      <P>In regard to what Senator Sweetman said about Irish Shipping, Limited, taking shares in an Irish insurance company, I do not think there can be any grievance about that, as long as they invest it in an Irish company.  It is a very good act, and ought to be encouraged.  They must have had the right to do it under their articles of association or they would not have done it.  That would be more a matter to raise at a meeting of shareholders than in the Seanad.  In regard to Senator Duffy's point, I do not think there was ever an Emergency Powers Order preventing the importation of watches.</P>

      <P>The Minister may be able to deal with that and say what the power was, but I do not think there was any power at all.  I was rather perturbed about Section 9, that an Order shall be judicially noticed.  I did not object to that part of it, but I do not like the words &ldquo;and always shall be deemed to have been&rdquo;.  I hope that is not put in for the purpose of relating to some case in which an appeal is pending, as I would not like <Col N="649" /> to have any ground of appeal taken away by an Act subsequently passed. I suggest to the Minister to put in a clause saying that this would not apply to any case partly heard or now pending. I would not like to see a defect cured in such a way, but would like to see every man, no matter what his offence, given a fair run for his money and, if he has a point, I would not like to have it swept away by the Oireachtas.</P>

      <P>An talt deireannach den Bille, alt 16, fo-alt (4) fógrann sé go mbeidh deireadh leis mar dhlí i gceann bliana nó b'fhéidir roimhe sin. Feicthear dhom go bhfuil an tAire an-dóchasach ar fad má mheasann sé go mbeidh deireadh leis an éigeandáil nó an phráinn taobh istigh de bhliain.  Is maith liom, áfach, go bhfuil an Bille ann ach ag an am céanna is dóigh liom go mba cheart dúinn ár n-aigne a dhéanamh suas nach é seo an uair dheiridh a fheicimíd an Bille.

Duine ar bith a bhfuil spéis aige ins na scéimeanna líon-mhara atá beartaithe le haghaidh cúrsaí géilleagair na tíre agus le haghaidh cúrsaí sóisialta, ní fhéadfadh sé gan imní a bheith air ar eagla go mbogfaí den tsrianadh atá i bhfeidhm go dtí seo.

Bhíos i láthair tamall ó shoin ag cruinniú áirithe agus le linn an chruinnithe sin labhair duine údarásach oirdheare ann agus chuir sé in iúl a mhíshásta a bhí sé nach féidir beagáinín fhéin airgead a chur go dtí abair, an Fhrainnc, agus a éasca atá sé, más mian le daoine é, mór-chuid airgid a aistriú ón tír seo go Sasana.  Chuir sé iongnadh orm nár thuig an cainteoir uasal atá i gceist an fáth atá leis an srianadh ar aistriú airgid agus caithfidh mé a rá gur chuir sé iongnadh níos mó orm a mhéid ba léir nar thuig lucht an cruinnithe an scéal leis.  D'fhéadfainn an rud a fhreagart ar mo bhealach fhéin ach ní móide go dtúibharfaí aon áird orm.  Is fearr a thíocfadh an miniú ón Aire.  Níl cursaí trádála idir Eire agus tíortha eile mar a bhídís roimh an gcogadh agus is dóigh liom gur fada go mbeidh siad ar ais ar a gcóir féin.  Faoi láthair, le tamall roimhe seo agus le tamall eile le teacht, beidh airgead coigríoch gann sa tír agus an fhaid a bheas sin amhlaidh ní foláir don Rialtais féachaint chuige gur acu sin a bheas srian ar chaitheamh pe ar bith méid den airgead sin a bhéas le fáil i riocht go mbeidhfear ábalta é a chaitheamh ar na nithe is riachtanaighe le haghaidh gnóthaí na tíre.

    <Speaker pid="FrederickSummerfield" hpid="Mr. Summerfield Mr. Summerfield">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Summerfield</NameTxt>
      <P>My approach to this Bill is that I regard it as so much a regrettable necessity.  While I could not endorse Senator Duffy's suggestion that its life should be extended another three months longer than the period mentioned in the Bill, I would hope that circumstances would accelerate its demise much earlier than the year envisaged. The various clauses of the Bill could never be popular with the public but the powers which they confer had to be endured because we were passing through terribly abnormal and <Col N="653" /> unnatural times.  No one would wish that these conditions should continue. The various Orders were obnoxious to trade interests in general but, as I say, in most cases despite heart-burnings, of industry particularly, they had to be endured.  The Government had no other course open to it but to frame such regulations and again, despite the heart-burnings which these Orders caused, I think the Government have done remarkably well.  I could easily make a speech on Order 83 alone but at this stage I do not think it would be fair to the House.  It certainly would not be fair to the Minister who has got a difficult job to do.</P>
      <P>I just want to go on record as saying on behalf of the very considerable trading interest that I represent, that we do hope that the Minister will find himself within the year envisaged in the Bill able to provide for a decreasing amount of control.  Industry is restless, and industry cannot expand naturally as long as the regulations which in normal times did not hamper it are continued.  In saying all this I want to pay an unqualified tribute to the Department for the way in which these matters have been handled.  We could easily have been much worse off. The Government have had to take powers during the emergency which were new to them and to deal with conditions which were certainly very strange to them.  On the whole, the wonder is, not that we have so much to complain but that we have had so little to complain about.  I think it is only fitting that in giving expression to these few remarks I should pay tribute to the very efficient manner in which the Minister and his staff dealt with the powers which were entrusted to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to deal with one point in the Bill.  The Bill is a temporary measure and I am rather inclined to agree with Senator Summerfield that the sooner we can get rid of many of these Bills the better.  At the same time, I think from the Parliamentary point of view I have to sympathise very much with Senator Duffy in his desire that we should not be confronted in the month of July with legislation and regulations which <Col N="654" /> must be passed before the 1st September.  It would be much better if the date could be amended to the 1st January so that we could deal with these matters in November rather than in July.  I think Senator Summerfield and myself would then be in much better form to discuss these measures.</P>
      <P>There is one particular Emergency Powers Order which is being continued, Emergency Powers Order No. 30, 1940, from the Department of Finance, which deals with civil servants (transferred officers).  I think nobody who knows the higher Civil Service and the circumstances under which the Order was made should neglect to raise his voice against that Order.  As a matter of fact, what is being done in this Order nobody but the Department of Finance would ever think of doing.  Senator Summerfield is sometimes criticised in this House as an employers' representative, but no employer in the world would ever think of doing what is being done in this measure.  After the Treaty was passed and accepted, a number of civil servants were transferred from the British Government to the Irish Government under certain conditions, on an agreement between the two Governments that, if they so wished, these civil servants had the right to retire.  A certain number of them did take advantage of these terms and retired. With these people, certainly while I was a member of the Government, I never had and never could have any sympathy, but the great majority stayed on to serve the Irish Government.  Not only did they serve the Irish Government in the sense of giving value for their money, but they served it with great zeal, competence and fidelity.  In 1932, when another Government came along, they continued to serve that Government with equal competence, zeal and fidelity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is admitted generally.  There is no other fact about which Ministers and ex-Ministers are on such completely common ground.  Now the Minister for Finance says to these civil servants: &ldquo;Because you stayed in the Irish service, because you were competent, because you were faithful, according to your bond to the <Col N="655" /> Government elected by the people, whether in 1922, 1932 or 1942, because you worked so hard, we will not give you what we think you are worth because we know what you are worth.&rdquo;  I think that position is extraordinary.  Because these people are good, because they are essential to the State, because, in the words of the Order, &ldquo;the time has not yet arrived in which the premature retirement of experienced staff could be permitted without a loss of efficiency in the Civil Service&rdquo;, the promises of the Government, in the name of the State and in the name of every one of us when these officers were transferred from their former service, have not been carried out.  Because they have proved indispensable to the Irish Government, they cannot be permitted to retire as they were perfectly entitled to do.  These people&mdash;they must be a small number&mdash; never availed of the opportunities which were given to them to retire on special conditions.  They remained to bear the great burden of the work which was placed on the shoulders of higher civil servants, particularly during the emergency.  Senator Summerfield rightly paid many compliments to the Minister for his work during the emergency, but credit for the success of that work is principally due to the civil servants, and particularly the higher civil servants. I know that Senator Summerfield would willingly pay them that compliment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not taking from what Senator Summerfield said about the Minister.  I am merely pointing out that it was largely as a result of the magnificent work of these higher civil servants that the Department was able successfully to cope with the various problems which confronted them during the emergency.  Now, we are actually passing legislation to deprive these civil servants of what they were promised.  Of course, they have no defence of any kind.  Certainly it illustrates&mdash;and I have seen it illustrated in many smaller ways on other occasions&mdash;that <Col N="656" /> the Department of Finance can do what no private employer would think of doing or what any employer would be ashamed to do.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir John Keane Sir John Keane">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to widen, although I would be in order in doing so, the scope of this debate, but I feel that I must in one or two sentences refer to what Senator Summerfield has said.  He talked about controls in industry and the heart-burnings in industry.  I think the figures show that there must be a good deal of pocket-burning, too, arising out of the excess profits that we know have fallen in certain quarters.  We cannot know all about that until certain returns are made available by the Revenue Commissioners.  I cannot quite accept the position that, if these controls were removed, industry would function naturally.  Naturally, industry is being carried on under very sheltered conditions at present.  I think that in the public interest it might be considerably less sheltered with benefit to consumers.</P>
      <P>I strongly support the plea of Senator Duffy that the ordinary courts should be allowed to function in increasing measure for the trial of offences under the Emergency Powers Act.  I cannot find the section in the Bill under which trials before the Special Criminal Courts are to be continued.  I am told the provision is in Section 3 but I cannot find it.  At any rate, trials by the Special Criminal Court are to be continued.  I feel that, so long as that is so, it is a great reflection on our political stature.  It also shows a want of trust in our courts to try those offences.  As long as that is the position, I do not think we can claim to have reached anything approaching political maturity.  I think that the ordinary courts could, with the utmost confidence, be trusted to deal with black market offenders, and that they would inflict on them the heavy penalties which they deserve. It would be much more satisfactory if the ordinary courts were allowed to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also support very strongly the observations that fell from Senator Sweetman with regard to extending the use of Government money outside <Col N="657" /> of Parliamentary control.  I dealt with that on another occasion recently and do not wish to labour it now.  I do feel that after the Recess it would be necessary to have a full-dress debate on that whole subject, with a view to pressing the Government to have an inquiry.  The thing is reaching dangerous proportions, and to that extent I feel that after the Recess the matter should be seriously examined by Parliament.</P>
    <P>Finally, I want to ask the Minister if he can say what is the policy in regard to the standstill Orders?  It has been announced that there will be a relaxation of the standstill Order in regard to wages, but that it will remain in force with regard to dividends and directors' fees.  I see a danger in removing standstill Orders at all during the present emergency and scarcity. What is ever present on my mind is the danger of inflation, and the increasing burdens that are being placed on people of fixed incomes.  I do suggest that the matter must be handled with justice.  In my opinion, it would be unjust to remove the standstill Order in the case of wage earners and not allow a similar relaxation in the case of dividends and directors' fees.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Sweetman raised the question as to whether the extension of time to bring prosecutions before the lower courts&mdash;to extend it from six to 12 months&mdash;was necessary in regard to cases other than compulsory tillage cases.  The experience of the Department of Supplies has been that it is necessary where the rationing regulations have been broken, and where offences of one kind or another against rationing have been committed.  It is true that offences of this kind do occur, and it is, therefore, necessary to take some action against the offenders.  If it were not possible to bring them before the District Court they would then have to be charged on indictment and brought before a higher court.  I think it is reasonable enough to give this power up to a period of 12 months.  I do not think that either lawyers or their clients will forget the circumstances under which an offence was committed inside of 12 months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Sweetman also raised a <Col N="658" /> question as to whether it was necessary to continue the powers to enter upon land and take possession of land.  That provision is being kept on in order to facilitate county councils in doing the work that has been given to them, namely, to provide turf.  All Senators will agree that it is necessary to have rationing, to continue rationing and to keep a careful control over supplies. We must, at the same time, provide that there are supplies available for rationing, and if the county councils or Bord na Móna were held up in regard to the provision of fuel, then there will be no fuel to ration.  It is, therefore, necessary to continue for another 12 months this provision of being able to enter on land.</P>
    <P>A couple of Senators raised the question whether it was right for Irish Shipping, Ltd., to invest some of their reserves in an Irish insurance company.  As Senator Ó Buachalla properly pointed out, they must have had legal authority when they did that.  They had authority under their articles of association.  Not only had they legal authority for doing so but it was essential that a company set up to provide the Irish people with a shipping service should set up a company to do insurance, whereby the ships and their cargoes could be insured.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>They did insurance, as they were entitled to do under their articles of association.  By doing their own insurance, they saved our people a very large sum of money.  Senator Duffy has objected on a number of occasions to our building up our external assets.  I do not see why we should devote our external assets to getting a job done which we ourselves could do very much better.  Irish Shipping, through their insurance scheme, saved our people millions of money.  When the war ended, they had a surplus, built up from profits on insurance premiums which were lower than would otherwise have been the case.  They made use of those reserves to obtain a controlling interest in an Irish insurance company, so that the good work, which was found to be <Col N="659" /> absolutely essential to the life of our people during the war, should continue. I think that they have made a good investment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>From the point of view of directors with moneys to invest, I think that they did an excellent job of work in adding to the capital of a company which can now undertake insurance of a kind that no other Irish company is prepared to undertake or could undertake.  Not only can they deal with shipping but they can also deal with air insurance and, to some extent, with re-insurance forwarded to them from other countries.  If anybody desires to debate the matter in detail, there are ways of arranging for that.</P>
      <P>Since the matter was raised by Senator Sweetman, there is no use, as Senator Ó Buachalla said, in leaving the matter in the air.  What Irish Shipping did in the way of investing their moneys in the Insurance Corporation of Ireland was perfectly legal, perfectly justifiable and was good policy so far as the building up of the country is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>If there were not Parliamentary sanction, it would not be legal. The matter cannot be contested on the ground of legality or Parliamentary sanction, because that can be traced from the powers given by the Act.  A Senator may object to what was done on the ground of policy but not on the ground of legality.  Senator Duffy and other Senators referred to the trial of offences before the Special Criminal Court rather than before the District Courts.  If Senators examine the list, particularly in recent months, they will find that the cases in which offences were prosecuted before the Special Criminal Court in connection with rationing regulations had very wide <Col N="660" /> ramifications.  It was only such cases which were brought before that court. Senator Ó Buachalla hopes for the day when we shall have finished with Orders.  We must all join in that hope but I agree with him that we should be very optimistic if we thought we should be finished with emergency Orders before the end of 12 months. I agree with him that we have done very well during the war, that as a people we have come through a very difficult period, if not unscathed, without very deep wounds in our national economy.</P>
      <P>Certain Orders have to be retained. Senator Ó Buachalla asked why we were retaining the Order restricting transaction in foreign currencies and, generally, operating exchange control. He really answered that question himself. It has been necessary to control exchange during the war so that we could divert all the foreign currency which we could obtain, other than British, to the purchase of materials that were essential rather than spending the money on imports of services of secondary importance.  I am afraid that exchange control will last longer than 12 months.  Nobody would be more delighted to get rid of it than I.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the reasons I have objected to the proposition which Senator Duffy has put forward every time I have been here is that, instead of getting rid of the exchange control which exists, his proposition would involve the institution of exchange control between ourselves and Britain, which would be very much more difficult to operate than exchange control with the Continent or with the American continent. We have headaches enough at the moment deciding who should get money for various purposes.  It would be very difficult and add greatly to the number of civil servants if we had to decide whether people who buy goods in England should get British currency, as we should have to do if we had not free exchange.  We should also have to decide for what purpose people should get such money and in what priority they should get it.  I forget the details of the watch question which has been referred to but it would have been ridiculous if, when the British <Col N="661" /> Treasury had prohibited their citizens from buying watches, they were enabled to break the regulations simply by buying them here or by buying them from Irish people who had bought them in Switzerland with Swiss francs which were issued, in the first instance, through the British Treasury.  That case could not be sustained.  We got all the watches we wanted for our own citizens.  We got the Swiss francs necessary to purchase them and I do not think that we should at any time facilitate British citizens in breaking their own law.</P>
    <P>The only other question raised was that raised by Senator Hayes in regard to the transferred officers.  We must all agree that the Civil Service has worked very well, that it has loyally obeyed this Government and the Government that preceded it.  However, it was found necessary during the war to bring in an Order which prevented a civil servant&mdash;perhaps someone with a temporary grievance&mdash;using a grievance in order to get out of the Civil Service with an enhanced pension. As the emergency is not yet over, it is necessary to continue that provision.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Hayes that such a provision is not necessary in order to retain the services of the vast majority of the transferred officers. Only very few of them took advantage of their rights under the 1929 Act and went to the tribunal to get a release and get an enhanced pension.  If we released them from control to-morrow and allowed them to go before the tribunal again, I think there would be very few cases indeed.  Still, if one man who had some little personal grievance or, perhaps, even a falling out with his higher officers, did go to the court and succeeded, there would be a general complaint from those who did not go.  I think it is necessary to retain this power for the next year.  It is not going to have any great effect as, if the power were abolished, very few would go to the tribunal.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Boland) Gerald Boland">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is brought in mainly to deal with the situation in the District Courts in Dublin City.  The position at present is unsatisfactory.  The city, as everyone is aware, has increased very largely, both in area and in population, in the last 20 years.  Whereas 20 years ago three justices were able to do the work of the city, at the present time, besides the three permanent justices&mdash; that is, the senior justice and two others&mdash;there are three assistant justices, who were appointed originally to relieve justices who were ill or on leave. They have been kept on permanently in the city and in addition it has been necessary to appoint two temporary justices, making eight altogether, acting almost all the time in Dublin.</P>
      <P>We have had the emergency conditions over the last seven years and that has contributed largely to the extra work.  In the case of child delinquency, we have made special arrangements and that takes up the whole time of one justice now.  These things have led to a certain amount of congestion and, after a lot of consideration, this Bill has been brought in.  Dublin is to be dealt with by dividing the work into three blocs&mdash;criminal work, civil work, and the children's court&mdash;with probably the work that will arise out of the new provisions in the Rent Restrictions Act recently enacted, Part III of which has not been given effect to yet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is rather an anomaly to have assistant justices, and on several occasions in the Dáil during my Estimate the matter was raised, principally by Opposition Deputies who wanted to know the reason.  I could never see it myself, as those assistants were working in the very same way as the other justices, but they were paid less.  Even the temporary justices were getting a larger salary, though on a temporary <Col N="663" /> basis, which was three guineas a day. I said I would make that right.  In this Bill, we are abolishing the position of assistant justice and I have undertaken to see that the three people who have been acting in that capacity for a long time will be appointed as permanent metropolitan justices in the Dublin area.  I think that is due to them, as some of them could have been appointed to some of the recent positions as district justices elsewhere.  They did not wish to do that, in anticipation of this Bill.</P>
    <P>In regard to the tenure of office, the position at present is that, if there is any reason to dispense with a district justice, there is machinery by which the Chief Justice, the President of the High Court and the Attorney-General deal with any complaint about the justice and, if they think there is sufficient reason, they give a certificate and the Government&mdash;not the Dáil or Seanad&mdash; can remove the justice from office.</P>
    <P>Under Section 20 of this Bill, we are giving the district justices the same status as other judges.  It may be suggested that that is modified by Section 21, but I do not think so myself. My assurance about Section 21 was that it was really an extra precaution for the justices.  That position was not accepted in the other House and they divided on it, as they wanted to delete the section.</P>
    <P>In Section 21 of the Bill we provide that if the Minister wishes he can ask the Chief Justice to nominate a High Court judge to hold an investigation as to the condition of health, either physical or mental, of a district justice or as to his conduct.  I still think that is a good provision, notwithstanding the criticism to which it was subjected in the Dáil.  One Deputy said that if the Minister got an adverse report he could hold it as a whip over the head of the district justice concerned.  I said, in reply, that if there was an adverse report, it would be most unlikely that any Government would go to the Dáil and ask them to remove the justice straight away.  If there was an unfavourable report, before going to the Dáil with a proposal to remove the district justice, the Minister could intimate to <Col N="664" /> the district justice: &ldquo;There has been an unfavourable report in regard to you and it would be better for you to retire.  If you do not, there is only one alternative and that is to bring forward a motion in the Dáil and the Seanad to have you removed from office.&rdquo;  I think from the point of view of the district justice that is a much more satisfactory provision.</P>
    <P>Another provision in the Bill enables the Department to increase the number of permanent district justices. At present we have 33 permanent district justices and we propose to increase the number to 40.  In practice, we have had 40 all told, but that number includes the assistant justices and temporary justices.  It is hoped in future to avoid the necessity of having to employ temporary justices or, at least, to have recourse to that practice to a lesser extent than formerly.  I think Senators, in general, will agree that it is undesirable to employ justices in a temporary capacity.  A justice should have security of tenure and should be as independent as possible of the Government of the day. That is the principal reason we are providing that the number of permanent justices may be increased to 40.  Senators, I am sure, have had an opportunity of studying the debates on the Bill in the other House and for that reason they are probably in a better position to deal with the measure than Deputies were.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister in his opening remarks said that the position in regard to Dublin was unsatisfactory. I am afraid that I must consider that he is bringing in an unsatisfactory Bill to deal with an unsatisfactory situation. I appreciate the way in which the Minister admitted so naïvely and accurately that we are, of course, a much better House than the other House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>This is in the main a Bill with which I should prefer to deal in Committee rather than in Second Reading but there are some matters which I think it proper to raise on this stage of the Bill.  I want, first of all, to deal with the provisions of Part II of the Bill which relate to the <Col N="665" /> position in Dublin.  It is agreed that the work of the courts in Dublin is excessive and that there is a good deal of overcrowding, largely, perhaps, on account of emergency conditions.  Even though the emergency has come and gone, these conditions are leaving a trail behind them which I believe will mean that our morale, so far as crime is concerned, will be lowered with I am afraid a consequent further increase of work for the District Courts, particularly in the city.  I want to deal with a slightly different aspect of the position with regard to Dublin, an aspect dealt with I understand also in the Dáil.  Not having yet received the report of the Dáil debates, I am not in a position to know exactly how the question was dealt with in the other House.  I have on more than one occasion in this House objected very strongly to the State altering the conditions of a man's contract without the consent of that man.  Certain people were taken into the service of the State as district justices.  They were asked to give up their ordinary private practice when entering the service of the State in order that they might preside in the District Court in Dublin. They were asked to do that on certain conditions, knowing the circumstances that existed in Dublin and knowing that they would have to undertake certain duties.  It now transpires in this Bill, notwithstanding the fact that they were asked to enter the service on these conditions, that their terms of service are going to be materially altered under Part II of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I fully appreciate what the Minister has said in regard to the appointment of justices as principal justices of divisions but they are now being brought, to an extent that did not hitherto exist, under the Department of Justice.  As regards the regulation of their business, they are being brought much more stringently under the control of the Department. There is a possibility that under this Bill they may have to carry out much more arduous and much more continuous duties than was heretofore the case.  I think it is only fair that it should be stated, particularly in the City of Dublin, the work of a district <Col N="666" /> justice is the most tiring type of work that any justice could be asked to undertake.  They sit from early morning until very late in the afternoon. The type of case that comes before the district justices in the Courts at Inns Quay and Morgan's Place is, I think, without question the most tiring type of work that one could possibly visualise.  The nature of that work was always understood and justices who were called on to do that work were, accordingly, only asked to sit for a certain period each week.  It was not intended that they should sit continuously the whole five-and-a-half days a week.  They were given certain privileges under which they were allowed to sit a lesser number of days. Those privileges were there when they entered the service of the State but the Department is now taking power which enables them, if they so desire, to make these justices carry on work for which they did not contract when they entered the service.  That is a matter to which I think I should refer in general on this stage, but I shall refer to it more specifically in Committee by way of amendment.  I want to refer also on this Stage to the provisions of Section 19 of the Bill. I was completely put off my stride in the beginning by what the Minister said about Section 19.  I think he will agree that the position in regard to the High Court judges is that they receive their full pension after 15 years, and that the same applies to the Circuit Court judges.  The position in regard to the district justice is that he only receives his full pension after 30 years' service. I want to suggest very strongly to the Minister that that is not fair.  There is an age limit of 65 being introduced under this Bill.</P>
    <P>I would ask those who can remember what the position was 20 years ago, was it not reasonable to appoint as a district justice a man who was 45 years of age?  He has now given 20 years' service and is 65 years of age.  For that service he gets under this Bill a pension of one-sixth for his first ten years of service and a fortieth for each year of service after that.  When we think of what the circumstances were at the <Col N="667" /> time this State was set up, I think we will agree that it was eminently reasonable to appoint as district justices men who were between the ages of 40 and 45.  Now, when we are determining their retirement at 65, we ought, I suggest, make somewhat better and more generous provision for their pensions.  I do suggest to the Minister that in view of all the circumstances which exist in regard to district justices, and the fact that High Court judges and Circuit Court judges can get their pension after 15 years' service, it would be reasonable to alter the provision in Section 19 and ensure that a district justice can get his full pension after 20 years' service.  It would not, I suggest, be asking the State to make an unreasonable concession if the period to qualify for pension were reduced from 30 years to 20 years.  I would ask the Minister seriously to consider that now rather than leave it over until the Committee Stage of the Bill is reached.  I suggest that 20 years is not an unreasonable compromise to put forward.</P>
    <P>I now want to refer to the position of District Court clerks and of the staffs in the District Courts.  Their conditions are very far from what they might be.  So far as the District Courts are concerned, I think they are understaffed. In consequence the staffs have to do more than they should be asked to do.  I might also say that the position of District Court clerks all over the country, their pensions and emoluments is one that requires urgent consideration.  Frankly, I do not know if I am in order in discussing that on this Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>At any rate, I throw out that suggestion to the Minister.  I am encouraged to do so by the alacrity with which he praised this House in the beginning of his speech.  I trust that he will show the same spirit of alacrity in introducing something along the lines that I have indicated in regard to District Court clerks and the staffs in the District Courts.  I apologise to him for stressing that <Col N="668" /> matter about his approach to the House, but, having regard to the things that we have been hearing about ourselves from another Minister, I do think it was essential that I should stress the point.  There are some other matters that arise in the Bill which we can go into in more detail when the Committee Stage is being taken.</P>
      <P>In conclusion, I want to say a few words in regard to the appointment of justices in future and to the working of the legal machinery of State.  In my opinion we are going to be forced to get a new outlook and a new method. The present position with regard to legal appointments is that the appointees depend for their advancement purely on political support.  That is not a satisfactory method.  It is not a method that makes for efficiency or makes for the satisfaction of their colleagues who are left behind them.  It is difficult to suggest the method by which it can be altered, but it is desirable that there should be something substituted for pure political appointments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>Oh, yes, I see it now. That is only right and fair.  I was feeling that we had as good air, food, and drink in the country as there is in Dublin, and indeed I would not object at all if the age was extended to 70.  I think district justices could perform their work just as well as a High Court judge can at the age of 70, particularly in the country where they have a better and more open-air life.  There is no reason why they should not be fit at 70, and I hope they are.  If you do make the retiring age 65, as Senator Sweetman says, it is not fair that a district justice must wait 30 years before he can get his full pension.  Not one of them, I think, can acquire the full pension unless he was appointed very young, and it is a very bad thing if you can only get young district justices. It would be much better to have men on the Bench who are more mature and have a greater variety of experiences and a greater knowledge of life.  After all, district justices as well as having a knowledge of law, must know life and human nature, and it is more likely that they will have that if they are appointed at a mature age. But the pension should be available to them in full at the age of 65.  I was hoping that the Minister would have taken this into account and would be more generously disposed towards them.  When these men retire they sometimes have a family that is not fully grown up.  With a small pension their lives in the future will be miserable.  They don't live very long, and it would not cost very much.  I am told that people who retire on pension live on the average for something like only two years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>Possibly they would.  If that is the average life after retirement according to the statistics, the Government would not suffer very much by giving them a decent pension.  I know a district justice who was appointed in 1924 and is now retiring on something <Col N="671" /> like a little more than £300 per year. How can he live on this?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>Oh, he does.  He gets one year's gratuity, but that is too small, and it is not fair that he should have to live on a small pension.  I had also hopes that in this Bill the Minister would have increased the salaries of district justices.  In Dublin, he has made the salary £1,100 instead of £1,000.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="LouisODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>That is only fair.  The other justices have not got an increase since 1924, when they were appointed at £800 a year has nothing like the same value it had in 1924, and certainly does not compare with £600 a year which the resident magistrates had 30 years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LouisODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, even taking £1,000 and comparing it with £600, the £600 was worth far more at that time than the £1,000 is now.  I know there are district justices in this country who cannot live as they are expected to live, and I know that a lot of them are in debt, and I know those who are not in debt have not one penny to spare.  They can barely pay their debts, and some of them cannot pay their debts, and that is a very bad position for people administering the law.  They are in a very awkward position.  Taking into account that there are only 40 justices, what would an increase of £200 or £300 a year mean to this State?  It would not be worth talking about.  It would be all spent in the country, and spent on these men's wives and families who are trying to live in a respectable way.  I make a strong appeal to the Minister to consider this in the Bill.  I thought, <Col N="672" /> as Senator Sweetman thought, that they should get a full pension the same as a Circuit Court judge.  A Circuit Court judge can be as young as a district justice when he is appointed. The Minister should take that into account.  The district justice has to be called to the Bar or be apprenticed to a solicitor.  Then he has to qualify and a number of years must elapse before he can be appointed.  It would be very bad if a Minister was not able to get the very best men for appointment. The courts are very important, and the District Court is a very important court, and although the jurisdiction has been increased, I would like to see it increased still further.</P>
      <P>It is the poor man's court, and it seems ridiculous that if a man has to sue for a debt of £26 or over he must bring it to the Circuit Court.  It was all right when you had justices of the peace operating who had not a knowledge of the law.  It was very necessary then to confine their jurisdiction, but now, when you have experienced lawyers, there is no reason why the jurisdiction of the District Court should be limited as much as it has been limited.  I would like to see it increased to the old County Court judges' jurisdiction which was £50. If a man has to claim £10 now for assault or running down, he must go to the Circuit Court where the fees are much higher than the District Court.  I hope that the Minister will consider the question of a living wage and reasonable pensions for the district justices.</P>

      <P>There is not much that I desire to say in relation to the Bill because many of the points I had in mind have been dealt with.  It occurs to me in relation to the Dublin metropolitan courts that the proposal in the Bill to name three principal justices is wrong.  I would prefer to think that the Minister should appoint a principal justice, one principal justice and only one, for the Dublin metropolitan courts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Impose upon him an obligation to organise the work of the metropolitan courts in the same way as the President of the High Court is required to <Col N="673" /> organise and distribute the work of the High Court and as the Chief Justice is required to do in relation to the Supreme Court.  Like other Senators who have spoken, I have the feeling that there is a suggestion that the work of the Dublin metropolitan courts will be directed, more or less, from the Department of Justice.  That, I think, is a bad principle and I should urge strongly that the arrangement of the business and the allocation of the work as between the justices should be the job of a principal justice.  For that reason, I should prefer to see one principal justice and so many other justices as may be necessary to deal with the work of the Dublin courts expeditiously.  I urge the Minister to reconsider the matter from that angle. I gather from the Minister that his idea is to get rid of temporary justices completely.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>In this Bill, we are limiting the number of regular justices who may be appointed to 40.  The work of the District Court has been growing for years and is likely to go on expanding, because it is, as it has been described by Senator O'Dea, the poor man's court.  The great bulk of the legal business of the State will be discharged through the District Court. Therefore, its work will grow.  The Minister will, probably, find in two or three years that, if he is to avoid delays and dissatisfaction to solicitors and litigants, he will have to appoint additional justices to the 40 so as to relieve congestion.  He will, of course, appoint temporary justices.  It would be wiser for the Minister to make up his mind that he will have 40 regular justices and have at the back of his mind the intention, when the necessity arises, of appointing deputy justices who would hold office permanently.  A man who would be appointed a justice in this way would not be allocated to a <Col N="674" /> district or court.  If a vacancy arose in one of the permanent posts, one of these deputy justices would automatically be appointed.  There would be a floating element of deputy justices holding permanent appointments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>That is provided for in Section 17 of the Bill.  Four of those justices will be permanent and movable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not understand that.  The Minister has adverted to the risks that attached to the appointment of justices who have no fixity of tenure.  I remember on one occasion speaking to a temporary justice.  Three or four persons were discussing a case in which he had adjudicated and he expressed the view that he was dissatisfied with the decision, but added that, if he were to hope for a permanent appointment, that was the only decision he could possibly give.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is a very dangerous thing in relation to the administration of justice. I hope I am not unkind in suggesting that the Minister may not always occupy his present office and that the Government of which he is a distinguished member may not always hold office.  Their successors may take the view that some of those appointments were the result of patronage and that the services of the persons concerned should be dispensed with. Men who had been serving for a number of years without fixity of tenure may have to go back and re-start life in a solicitor's office from which they had been divorced for years.  Unless I am wrongly informed, that has happened in, at least, one case in Dublin. I am informed that one of the most capable justices in Dublin was appointed to a temporary position many years ago by, I think, the previous Government. His appointment was not made permanent until he had reached an age at which Civil Service regulations do not permit of the making of permanent appointments.  The result is that he is still a temporary district justice and the only ground on which he is permitted to serve is that, as there is no power to give him a pension, the Government feel that they <Col N="675" /> must retain him in a salaried position. That is wrong.  So far as we here can influence the administration of justice, we should secure that it will be taken out of the realm of politics completely and allow all persons of common-sense in the State to evolve a system in which all elements may reach agreement.</P>
    <P>I want to associate myself as strongly as possible with Senator O'Dea's statement that the salaries of district justices are totally inadequate.  About a year ago, I was in a small town in the midlands.  I happened to be speaking to the lady proprietor of a shop. When she saw the district justice walking towards the shop, she said: &ldquo;I must slip away because, if this man comes in, I must refuse him credit and I hate to do so.&rdquo;  I asked why she should refuse him credit and she said that he would not get twopence worth of credit in any shop within 20 miles. That surprised me and I wondered if it was due to some defect in the character of the district justice.  I mentioned the matter to a lawyer of standing in Dublin and he said: &ldquo;That is what they all say.&rdquo;  He pointed out that these men were appointed 22 years ago at £1,000 a year when they had very limited obligations.  They thought £1,000 a great deal of money then but they were no longer young and they had now heavy obligations.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, their obligations have grown enormously, and costs have increased to such an extent that the purchasing power of the £1,000 is very much less than it was in 1924, and I think that what Senator O'Dea has said, and he has pretty wide experience, can be confirmed in relation to all the district justices.</P>
    <P>I am not making any plea for district justices as such; there is only one of the district justices in this State whom I know personally, and I do not think that it matters very much in his case, because he will retire this year or next year, but I have to have regard to the fact that people are appearing in the courts of district justices, where the district justice is not free to do justice, and that I think is a very serious <Col N="676" /> aspect of this matter from the point of view of the public.</P>
    <P>Let us assume, for instance, that a publican is prosecuted for an alleged breach of the licensing regulations. The publican in that case comes before a district justice to whom he has probably lent £50 in the previous six months.  I want to ask this House, as reasonable people, how members expect that a district justice is likely to act, no matter what his ability, no matter what his competence, in a set of circumstances like that.  That has happened.  It is a very serious matter from the point of view of the administration of justice.</P>
    <P>I am going to suggest to the Minister &mdash;I know he has no direct responsibility&mdash;that as Minister for Justice he has there responsibility to see that justice is not likely to be corrupted and that it is not, in particular, to be corrupted because of the insufficient remuneration offered to those who administer justice, and he should boldly insist that salaries be increased over the 1924 level by 50 per cent.  It may involve the readjustment of salaries for the whole judiciary but we are concerned only with the position of district justices and I want to urge that the remuneration fixed in 1924 should be readjusted and be increased by certainly 50 per cent.  In regard to pensions, in order that a district justice may receive the full pension provided in the pensions code, he must be appointed at or under 35 years of age.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>At 35.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>He must have 30 years' service to get the maximum pension. Now, I do not know how the members of this House feel in regard to that, but I feel that the majority of us have passed the 35 mark, and my feeling is that men of 35 should not be appointed as justices except in rare instances.  I would prefer to think that we were appointing to the judicial bench men between 40 and 50 years of age than men between 30 and 35 years of age, but in order that the Department will ensure to the district justice his maximum pension at 65 years he must be appointed under 35 at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest that that is all wrong, and <Col N="677" /> probably no one in this House knows it better than the Minister for Justice. I would urge him, therefore, to revise the whole of the regulations relating to the appointment, pay and pensions for district justices, and to make it a rule that, except in exceptional circumstances, nobody will be appointed a district justice under the age of 40, that he should be entitled to full pension with 20 years' service and that his salary would be substantially increased.</P>
    <P>Roughly these are the proposals I want to make.  Let us bear this in mind.  The age of appointment will have some considerable effect on the salary to be fixed.  If a solicitor has developed a good practice and has himself well established at 35 to 40 years of age, he will not take the post of district justice unless he has made up his mind about one of two things. Number 1 is that he is never likely to be a success as a solicitor, and number 2 that his health has broken down and will not stand up to the strain of a busy life in a solicitor's office.</P>
    <P>Is it not perfectly clear that these are the only grounds on which a Minister is going to get cheap justice?  He is either going to appoint a solicitor who has completely failed to earn the standard income of his class or he is going to appoint a man who is in broken health, and cannot go on roughing it in the atmosphere of a solicitor's office.  Surely, the Minister does not want either of these alternatives.  In my opinion he wants to recruit for the District Court bench men who were eminent in their profession.</P>
    <P>They need a bit more than knowledge of the law; they want common-sense and want to know the people among whom they live, and I will go farther and say that they want to have sympathy with the people among whom they live, but they want also to be energetic and healthy men, able to stand the strain which court life imposes on them.  I know nothing about the Dublin courts, but I have heard from Senator Sweetman's description of them what the work is like, and he as a solicitor knows the work.  His view is that it is exhausting work but it is very much greater, in my opinion, in the case of district justices serving in rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="678" /> I know that Senator Sweetman dissents, but I would like to point out that work in the country means travelling long distances, and, in winter time, travelling long distances may mean great hardships, particularly in the cases of men who are becoming older in their positions.  I do not want to pursue this matter further because I do not wish to enter into controversial matters with the Minister, but these are matters which might be taken into account in a non-political atmosphere, having regard to the fact that we all want to see the administration of justice beyond suspicion.</P>

      <P>He is a good administrator; he approaches his problem in a sensible way.  This matter is not a Party matter in any sense.  I am not familiar with the problems which confront the Minister or the people who have to deal with the courts in Dublin, but I would like to say that I subscribe generally to the view of Senator Duffy and Senator O'Dea.  I hope I do not subscribe to one of the things advanced by Senator Duffy, because I would not like to think we have justices in the country in such a position that some of them had borrowed £50 from somebody who might have to appear before them in the morning.  I do hope it is not a fact; it would be most unfortunate to make the suggestion that it should be so.  On the other hand, it is true to say that the salaries paid to district justices from the point of view of purchasing power have seriously deteriorated, because the world in 1946 is very unlike what it was in 1923.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important that the courts of this land should have very high prestige.  It was a very wise departure originally to introduce the plan of district justices, and we all agree that they have been eminently successful because in the first instance, the <Col N="679" /> calibre of the men selected for them was very high and they established a prestige which it is important should be maintained.</P>
    <P>It is true to say that you have to pay for service and for competence and ability, and we ought not to be afraid to pay for reliability in the courts of the country and the best service that law can be given is not an extravagance.  I suggest that it should be the aim of a Minister to secure it, and I hope that he will keep that always before his mind.</P>
    <P>He gave us to understand that in the re-arrangement of court work, his plan is to have criminal, civil and children's courts&mdash;at least I gather that from him.  I wonder will the justices there at the moment have a voice in regard to which court they may choose to function in.  I realise that already there is a justice dealing with the children, and I presume, if there is a reorganisation that this man may become one of the chiefs, but probably the Minister will explain.</P>
    <P>I must confess that Section 11 makes me wonder how exactly this is going to work.  The Minister may enlighten us somewhat, because, as the section stands, it does give one the impression that the Minister is going to order the business of the courts in a particular way.  I think that section needs clarification.  My view is that when you set up the courts, you ought to leave the courts to organise their own business.  That ought to be the job of the courts and it would be much better, from the Ministerial point of view, that the Department would not have to enter into the matter at all, that the responsibility of the Department should be that the court was doing its business in its own way.</P>
    <P>It is important that the court would order and regulate the distribution of its work according to its lights, and from its study of the particular problems from day to day.  I do not know, if there are a number of cases listed at the same time, how the Department and the Minister's staff can work out a plan for disposing of them. If lists have to be sent in and checked and commented upon by the Department, <Col N="680" /> I believe it is not going to work. That is how the section looks at the moment and I am not going to hold the Minister on it now, because when we hear his reply we will be able to decide what attitude we will adopt on the Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>On Section 21, I would like to make one or two comments because the Minister has adverted to it.  Section 21 provides that whenever the Minister requests the Chief Justice to investigate the condition of health of a justice or to inquire into his conduct, the Chief Justice shall appoint a judge to conduct the investigation.  I put this to the Minister: in my opinion you want more than one person to pass judgment on the competence of any of us.  Suppose you have a justice down the country or anywhere else and he is not regarded as satisfactory for whatever reason.  You ask the Chief Justice to appoint a judge.  It is quite conceivable that the Chief Justice may appoint a member of the judiciary who might temporarily and immediately display such an attitude of antipathy that a reasonable report on the capacity of the individual concerned could not be got at all.</P>
    <P>Suppose that somebody comes along and makes a study of my capacity in something, or that of any other member of the House, and you know why he is coming&mdash;you can guess the kind of reaction there is immediately.  I probably would not do myself justice.  I might react very unfavourably. I think you should have two judges, because it is an awful responsibility to put on the shoulders of one person.  If I had to decide whether a man was capable of keeping his post, I confess it would be far beyond me and that is why I would like to have a balancing factor with me.</P>
    <P>From the conscientious point of view, it is quite an impossible proposal and I suggest to the Minister that he should re-examine it.  Quite conceivably, he might get a report that a man should be kept on because a single individual might not like to take the responsibility of saying he should be dispensed with.  I do not want to emphasise that to the House any more.</P>

I would like to draw the attention of the House to a matter which has not been referred to so far, that is, the inconvenience caused to the public by the delay in hearing cases in the District Courts.</P>
      <P>It is a pity that the provisions we are asked to make now were not here in the emergency, because the congestion, in my own knowledge, was intense and the difficulty of bringing cases to the courts was increased by the danger of adjournments from day to day.  The difficulty of that would not affect solicitors because they would be only getting extra pay for every day they attended.</P>

      <P>The fact is that the public are inconvenienced to an extraordinary extent and it is on that account that this provision is assumed to be necessary, apart from anything that other Senators had referred to regarding facilities for justices.  The third minute I will spend in referring to the pension rates given to justices. As far as I can see, they are better than those applying to civil servants, and better than those applying to officials of local authorities, where they must devote all their time to the duties of their offices.  I do not think there is anything in the law that district justices must do this.</P>

There are three divisions in the courts, and I think that Section 7 of the Bill provides for that.  A justice may be transferred from one division to another <Col N="682" /> and I think that that is a very important provision.</P>

      <P>Before the Minister replies, let me for a minute add my voice to something that has been said. The salaries paid to district justices have never been reviewed since they were appointed over 20 years ago, and we all know that the value of money has depreciated by 33? per cent. since then.  Their incomes are not commensurate at all with their responsibility and their position.  I add my voice to those of Senator O'Dea and Senator Baxter, and request the Minister to have this matter reviewed at his earliest convenience.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnJosephMeighan" hpid="Mr. Meighan Mr. Meighan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Meighan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would strongly support Senator O'Dea's point regarding appointing people of mature age to be district justices.  I also think it would be sensible to leave the age limit 70 years.  There are various heads of business houses and eminent ecclesiastics over that age and carrying on their duties.  I would also support the pension to district justices after 20 years' service, but I could not by any means support the proposal to increase their remuneration.  I think £1,000 is a nice salary for anybody and, while I do not believe in cheap labour, I believe that the duties of a county manager are just as important as those of a district justice and even more important, as he has very great responsibility.</P>

I know there are solicitors with apparently very fine practices who would not object to taking the job at £1,000 a year.  After all, these men are not compelled to accept the appointment.  I took it from the Minister's opening remarks that, if a district justice were to be removed from office, a committee would examine the case.</P>

      <P>We discussed the question of the retiring age in the Dáil and I am satisfied that 65 is the proper age. It is the age at present, except in Dublin City.  I agree with the Senators who said that the work in the District Court is more strenuous than in the High Court or Circuit Court. Those who know the position in Dublin tell me that the mental strain on the district justices there is such that they should be allowed to retire at 65.  The question of pensions is a matter I cannot settle on my own.  I will raise it with the Minister for Finance and the Government and see if I can get anywhere with it.  On the whole, the pension is fairly good.</P>
      <P>There is some misunderstanding about the ages.  Deputy Costello said yesterday that we were appointing much younger men than were appointed by the last Government.  I have a long list here, which shows quite the reverse: there were eight or nine under 30 who were appointed by the last Government, whereas there was not one single person under 30 in our case and the average is about 40.  Of course, that may be making a case for a better pension scheme.  The fact is that we have appointed older men than were appointed by the last Government.</P>
      <P>I am surprised at Senator Sweetman&mdash;although I should not be&mdash;making the mistake he made, that we are trying to take away some of the rights of justices or altering their contract. Since Deputy Costello, a senior counsel, made the same mistake, I can excuse a solicitor, although he may know the law better.  I will not read at length, as there is not time now, but will ask the Senator to read&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Very well.  Objection is taken to the Minister interfering in the arrangement of the business of the court.  In the other House, it was even suggested by Deputy Costello that we were interfering with the Constitution. I pointed out that, if so, there was a remedy, that he could take it into the courts and have it declared unconstitutional.  He said something <Col N="684" /> about the cost, but I did not retort that he could make it cheaper if he wished.  The fact is that under Section 47 of the Court Officers Act, 1926, the justices had nothing whatever to do with the fixing of the business.  It was entirely a matter for the Minister.  The section of that Act says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Minister shall divide every district prescribed by him under Section 68 of the Courts of Justice Act, 1924 (No. 10 of 1924) into such and so many convenient areas as he shall think proper and may divide any such district into different District Court areas for the purpose of different classes of business&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&ldquo;in every District Court area or within one mile of the boundary of such area in which, and such and so many convenient days and hours at which, the District Court shall be held for the purpose of transacting for such District Court area the business for the transaction of which such area was delimited.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3)  It shall be lawful for the Minister from time to time, as he shall consider expedient, to do all or any of the following things, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  vary or abolish any district prescribed by him under the said Section 68 of the Courts of Justice Act, 1924;</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="685" /> That is precisely what I am doing here. That was modified under Section 5 of the Court Officers (Amendment) Act, 1937, and the practice since then has been to leave it very largely in the hands of the Senior Justice himself, which I propose to do, save only that I insist on the right of the Minister for Justice, if any trouble should arise, to fix the hours, the place and so on&mdash; if that should happen, as I hope it will not.  It is laid down in Section 5 of the Court Officers Act, 1937, that the Minister may delegate this work to the justice but he has, in sub-section (2), full right to change that. I hope that Senator Sweetman will read up these things for himself and he will find that I am not proposing to do anything which I am not entitled to do or which has not been done already. I am not interfering with any rights they had nor with their contracts.</P>
    <P>In regard to the point raised by Senator Baxter the practice I think will be that when the first allocation of business is being made, the Minister will consult with the principal justices but he will not be bound by their views if he is not satisfied that a particular type of man would not be the best man for that class of business.  Once, however, a justice is put in charge of a particular type of business, say criminal business, he will not be changed or cannot be changed without his consent.  That is laid down in the Bill.  In the first allocation, he will not have the last word but he will certainly be consulted afterwards and agreement will be sought for any proposed change.  As far as possible the arrangement of the work of the court will be left to the justices but as I said in the other House you might have an obstreperous principal justice or there might be an ordinary justice who might have very little to do in his division, say perhaps two hours' work a day.  In the next section there might be a glut of work.  If we said to him: &ldquo;We think you should give some assistance in the next section&rdquo; his attitude might be, &ldquo;I shall stay where I am.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In case he takes up that attitude, the <Col N="686" /> Minister should have the right to say: &ldquo;There is a slackness in your section and there is a lot of work in the adjoining section which we require to get through.&rdquo;  That is the whole extent of the interference and it would be ridiculous if the Minister had not that right.  There would be an outcry amongst the citizens generally that they could not get their work attended to and the Minister would probably be compelled to appoint another temporary justice.</P>

They come to the Dáil and try to hold the Minister responsible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, just as there have been headstrong Ministers and Senators. As regards the point raised about jurisdiction, that matter will arise in another Bill.  In regard to Section 21, I have only to repeat what I said before.  The judge is not being sent down to try any man or to find whether he is suitable or not.  He will be asked to find out what the facts are in particular cases and to report the facts only.  The decision on these facts will rest with the Government.  The Minister for Justice will bring the facts to the notice of the Government. The position at present is that the Government can dismiss without any report from a judge.  Under the proposal in the Bill, even when the Minister gets his report he must come to both Houses if he wishes to have a justice removed from office and he will have to state a case.  The fact that under this Bill the Minister asks the Chief Justice to appoint a judge to investigate a complaint means that that <Col N="687" /> judge may report &ldquo;There is nothing in the complaint.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>If, however, there is something in it and he sends in a report which is unfavourable to the justice, we can say to the justice: &ldquo;You have gone a little too far and you had better retire or we shall be obliged to bring a motion before both Houses of the Oireachtas to have you removed from office.&rdquo;  I think that that course is undoubtedly an improvement on the present position.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 19:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 18, Section 38, to add to the section a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(6)  Every Order made under this section shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas as soon as conveniently may be after it is made.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The purpose of the amendment is perfectly clear.  I had an amendment of a different sort, to cover the same section, on the Committee Stage.  The Minister, on that occasion, made great play out of the fact that I was asking him to do something that was unconstitutional in so far that I was asking him to delegate to the Houses administrative powers that were in the hands of the Minister under the Constitution. While not agreeing with a lot of what the Minister said on that occasion, I came to the conclusion that it was better to avoid on this stage of the Bill any possibility of that line being continued. I am providing in the amendment merely that the Order shall be laid on the Table of the House so that it will <i>ipso facto</i> be there by way of publicity.  I think that is a better method than that of having to extract information by way of Parliamentary Question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="689" /> Senator Hearne said on another amendment to this section that there are very many such Orders.  I find from an answer given to a question in the Dáil on Tuesday that during the last 11 years there have been only 15 such Orders.  Therefore, the acceptance of the amendment would not impose any great strain on anybody.</P>

      <P>I do not think it can be admitted that Orders under this section are of sufficient importance to be laid before the Oireachtas.  The general functions of the representative assemblies are well understood.  If I may quote from the best exponent of representative governments, he says:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It is admitted in all countries in which the representative system is practically understood that numerous representative bodies ought not to administer.  The maxim is grounded not only on the most essential principles of good government but on those of the successful conduct of business of any description.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Again:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;A popular assembly is still less fitted to administer or dictate in detail to those who have charge of administration.  Even when honestly met the interference is almost always injurious.  A Minister feels himself under some responsibility.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I think that the matter was very fully discussed at an early stage in this debate.  One point made was that it is possible, by way of Parliamentary Question, to elicit the information required, and that it is not desirable to increase the number of occasions in which Orders shall be laid <Col N="690" /> on the Table governing matters of administration, concerning which general regulations are laid down, and concerning which the general principles are understood.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir John Keane Sir John Keane">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary has my sympathy in making such a very unfortunate debut on this Bill.  He quotes an authority and he cannot name the author.  We will leave that for the moment.  The Parliamentary Secretary seems to consider that this is a matter of minor importance.  Surely, he is aware of what has been happening in recent years.  He must know the public anxiety there is with regard to the appointment of these deputies, as well as the abuses, and I use that word deliberately, that have been disclosed in regard to the appointment of deputies, as well as the possibility of grave abuses in the future.  Does he not consider that the Houses of Parliament have the right of protection in matters of this kind?  Numbers and numbers of Orders under Bills of far less importance than this one had been laid on the Table.  Surely it is not seriously suggested that these are Orders of minor importance.</P>
      <P>In connection with this matter, I should like to say now what I omitted to say earlier.  The Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary no doubt endorse it.  It is this, that these holders of office are responsible for the work of their deputies.  It has always been a mystery to me what that involves.  A doctor, say, appoints a deputy.  What responsibility has the absent holder for the work of his deputy?  Supposing that somebody suffers or loses his life through the incompetence of the deputy, how can the holder be held responsible?  We have a right to be informed as to what is meant by this doctrine of responsibility by the holder for the work of his deputy.  To my mind it means nothing. It is pure eye-wash.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>We have now reached the stage when the Parliamentary Secretary comes briefed to the House without apparently being able to quote his authority.  I am afraid it is going <Col N="691" /> to be difficult to get him to accept the amendment.  Neither the Minister nor the Parliamentary Secretary appears to be in the frame of mind to accept such an amendment as this.  I think it is a very sensible one.  This is a very important section dealing with a specific situation.  You are not going to have countless unimportant Orders made under it.  You are going to have Orders made dealing with particular types of cases.</P>
      <P>I do not see why there should be any real objection to the tabling of such important Orders as these.  I think the Parliamentary Secretary should be very slow to reject the amendment. The position will be that a decision will be taken to appoint a deputy to perform work for somebody who is called away in circumstances which appear justifiable in the Minister's view.  I cannot understand why the Minister is not prepared to give publicity to that fact by laying the Order on the Table of the House. Surely the Minister does not want to keep something from Parliament?  I think the Parliamentary Secretary should reconsider the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I have very considerable sympathy for the Parliamentary Secretary who, at very short notice, is trying to speak from a brief, but I am afraid that he was speaking from a brief on an amendment that is not on the Order Paper.  If the amendment had been the amendment I had down in Committee then I could see that there might be some force in the Parliamentary Secretary's reply even though I did not agree with it. If the amendment had been an amendment embodying the suggestion I made in Committee, giving power of annulment, then I could see there would be a case for passing it on the lines that the Parliamentary Secretary has taken.  But, in fact, this amendment does not ask any Minister or Parliamentary Secretary to share his duties or responsibilities with anyone, it merely states that these duties which he carries out for the State <Col N="692" /> shall be subject to the public light of day by being placed on the Tables of both Houses of the Oireachtas, that is, in the Library, where it can be seen. I must confess I am in some difficulty having regard to the fact that the Parliamentary Secretary has had to come in here at short notice.  For that reason I do not like approaching this matter in the manner in which I would approach it if the Minister was here, but it appals me that this should be the official approach; it appals me that there should be a desire on the part of a Minister of the Government to suggest that it is a bad thing to give to him power to have these Orders see the light of day.</P>
      <P>I regard this not as a matter of minor importance but as a principle of major importance that the fullest publicity should be given, not merely in the interests of the public but in the interest of the person carrying out the duty of making the Order.  We know perfectly well that if we were asked to do something which we feel may not be quite correct, the fact that it is going to be public is a good reason for not doing it.  It appears to me that this would be an additional protection for the Minister.  For this reason I must ask this House to insist on this amendment being inserted in the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not moving amendment No. 20, but I am moving amendment No. 21:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 18, Section 38, to add a new sub-section (7) as follows:&mdash; (7) The appropriate Minister shall on the 1st April in each year lay on the Table of Dáil Éireann a list of all persons who have acted by deputy for a period of more than six months during the previous year.</P>
      <P>I think that Senator Hearne may be glad to know that this is my parting shot&mdash;not my Parthian shot, because I am not running away&mdash;in connection with the position of deputies, and he will shortly have his release.  I am not going to divide on this amendment, because I feel the principle has already been determined on the last vote.  But it is utterly incomprehensible to me how a Minister in a democratic Assembly can resist the principle and the actions called for under this amendment.  If I was a Minister&mdash;I am sure I hear a silent echo, &ldquo;God forbid&rdquo;&mdash;I would welcome an amendment like this.</P>
      <P>Take public life as we all know it. Is not one of the curses of public life the importunities of those who want to get something in life?  The Parliamentary Secretary knows possibly how we must be continually embarrassed by persons in high places asking: &ldquo;Look here, I want this done and the Minister is very reluctant, really, to do it.&rdquo; What better than to be able to say: &ldquo;My good chap, I am all in sympathy with you, but I have got to make this public and do you wish that done?&rdquo; Here we may now open the gates of salvation to a Minister away from embarrassments of that kind which must be a continual torment to him, and he rejects it; he spurns the opportunity.</P>
      <P>What other conclusions can we draw from his attitude than that he wants to keep this thing covered up, that he wants to act furtively, that he does not want the country or the Parliament to know&mdash;it is the only conclusion one can draw.  Here is a perfectly democratic procedure asked for and yet it is not acceptable.  The Government prefer to have all the whisperings, all the conjectures, all the surmises, all the suspicions that follow on this power to appoint deputies, and let them retain the right of nomination, and let them make hole-and-corner arrangements with regard to emoluments. The Government seem to prefer that to availing themselves of the very considerable escape that an amendment of this kind provides.</P>

      <P>During the last three weeks my ears have been assailed by people who are anxiously giving me lists of those to whom leave of absence was given in circumstances which they consider improper.  I do not know nor very much care who they were; I was interested not in the individuals but in the principle and the important thing seems to be this: that from different sources there were borne to my ears different names and I have no means of discovering how many other persons were subjected to the same aural assault, nor had I any <Col N="695" /> means of judging the truth or falsity of the statements which were made.</P>
      <P>I am willing to assume that 50 per cent. of the names given and the assertions made were false, and, for all I know, the other 50 per cent. were equally false, but unless some method is taken of bringing the matter out in the open this kind of thing is going to swell and you will soon have half the population of Ireland believing the other half is getting leave from the Government not to do their jobs.  I agree with Senator Sir John Keane that it would be greatly in the interest, both of the Government and the public, to publish a bare list, without any reasons, of the people who have been given leave of absence for more than six months.  By doing that, you take away this quality of rumour and you can show that reasonable grounds, probably, existed in each case.  Unless you want this country to be a whispering gallery, it is most inadvisable to refuse publication of the list of names of persons who, for reasons which seem entirely adequate to the Minister, and, which, no doubt, he can justify, have been given leave of absence.  For these reasons, I support the amendment.</P>

      <P>I thought that these amendments were left over to see if the Minister would put forward his amendment.  The Minister has put forward his amendment and it has been accepted by the House.  The result is that any Order giving leave of absence will operate only for six months.  At the end of that period it must be renewed.  What is the meaning of that?  Does it not mean that <Col N="696" /> every Order must be sent down to the local authority by which the holder of the office is employed and that it will probably be published in the local Press?  In any event, notice will be given to the only persons interested&mdash; the authority which employs and pays the holder of the office.  What greater security Senators could desire, I do not know.</P>

      <P>Senator O'Dea has made a statement which, if it be accurate, reveals a fact of which I was ignorant.  If a county manager makes an order, members of the local authority get copies of the order.  If the Minister makes an Order with regard to a particular official, I am not aware that that Order is communicated in the set of orders transmitted by the manager to the members of the local authority.  That point had better be cleared up.  I do not know that there is any obligation on the manager to communicate the substance of such an Order to the elected representatives.</P>

      <P>Speaking without a Ministerial brief, in the sense suggested by the Opposition, I think that this amendment should be resisted.  I do not at all agree with the observations of Senator Sir John Keane, who spoke about the salvation which could be afforded a Minister through being able to tell people that he must refuse them certain privileges because the matter would have to be published.  I do not believe in that at all.  Ministers have got to have executive responsibility and, when they make mistakes, they have got to suffer for those mistakes.  I do not believe that they ought to seek to protect themselves by compiling lists of persons to be laid on the Tables of the Oireachtas.  If I were Minister for Local Government and was certain that, in sanctioning the appointment of a deputy, I was acting in the public interest, I should be prepared for any kind of disturbance which might be made at a later date and I should be prepared to meet any question which might be raised in regard to my action.  I should be prepared to bear full executive responsibility for having such matters referred to the Oireachtas.  That is what I say on my own behalf and I am confirming what has been said by the Minister, who has referred to this matter on many occasions.</P>

      <P>Local government has ceased to exist in this country.  This question of the powers of Ministers is a very serious one in view of the drastic changes which have been brought about in local government. There is no such thing as local government and the powers the Government have in relation to remunerative positions are very important.  They like to have those powers.  They gain support when they are able to hand <Col N="698" /> round favours but it is a very serious matter for the country, which has to pay for that.  The Parliamentary Secretary tells us that he would be prepared to take responsibility for any mistakes made by him.  Would we ever have heard of the recent mistakes were it not for the falling out amongst a certain gang&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Consequently, I think that the House should divide and register its opinion on this sort of thing.  The more protection we offer the public, the better we safeguard the Ministers, as the mover of the amendment has already said.  Provision for publication serves as a safeguard.  Ministers will have to walk very cautiously if these Orders have to be laid on the Tables of both Houses.  They will be fortified in dealing with persons who importune them for appointments.  Therefore, I am in favour of the amendment.</P>

      <P>I wonder if Senators who are in favour of this amendment think that it would add anything to the public knowledge to be furnished with a list of persons who carry out their duties through deputies. These persons are employees of public bodies and, in their respective districts, everybody knows who they are and the circumstances under which deputies have been permitted to act.  Suppose this amendment were carried, what would we get in this House but a list of names?  There is local information about all that and, therefore, there is no hole and corner method being used. What we would get would be the list of names, without any commentary. The numbers on the list might give some indication of a trend, but as for any positive information that could enlighten the public mind, a long list of persons who do the work of deputies for more than six months in a given year would add nothing.  It is public <Col N="699" /> knowledge in the places where those deputies do the work of the holders of the office.  The section provides that there is an Order issued and this is all public property.  I do not think it would add to public knowledge or be any protection against the dangers which Senators seem to see, that we should have a bare list of employees of public authorities who carry out their duties through deputies.</P>

      <P>I am at least glad that coming events cast the shadow of John Stuart Mill before them.  Those like myself who had to move with the times but still cling to Liberal tradition are very pleased to have an ally now in the Parliamentary Secretary. On many occasions, both of us will be able to bring John Stuart Mill and his doctrines to our aid.  I was rather amused at the Parliamentary Secretary's attitude that no Minister ever required to be protected, to be immune against adopting a weak attitude. It is a doctrine of practice, but perhaps rather more honoured in the breach than in the observance. Nothing would be more to our advantage than to say &ldquo;yes,&rdquo; but if this is to be done, it cannot be done without consideration.  I said I would not divide the House on this point, but anyone else is at liberty to call for a division.  The whole principle is most unsatisfactory.  I am hoping that when a new Local Government Bill comes before us the whole of this question of deputies will be put on to a common-sense and straightforward basis.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>(1)  If the Minister is of opinion that on account of the nature or extent of the duties of an office it is inexpedient that the holder of such office should engage in any other gainful occupation without the permission of the local authority by which appointments to such office are made and the consent of the Minister, the Minister may give a direction to that <Col N="700" /> effect and such direction shall have effect according to the terms thereof.</P>

      <P>This amendment has been introduced as a result of the discussion on the last day and I fear that the cure is just as bad as the disease.  The Minister may leave himself open to being accused of discrimination now, by the insertion of this new section.  Candidly, the words of the Bill as it stood, requiring holders to devote the whole of their time to the duties of their office, form a definite and emphatic statement, and this amendment is somewhat on the same lines but doing it by a circuitous route.  I fancy that it will not be to the satisfaction of the Minister to the extent he believes it will be.  Certainly, it is not to my satisfaction.</P>
      <P>I do not like the word &ldquo;inexpedient&rdquo; at all, as it does not sound nice to me.  Either &ldquo;inadvisable&rdquo; or &ldquo;unsuitable&rdquo; would be better.  The use of the words &ldquo;engaged in any other gainful occupation&rdquo; means practically prohibiting a person doing anything which may bring in revenue in his spare time.  Having opposed the phraseology of the section as it stood, and since this is put in more or less to meet the matters raised, I just want to express the opinion that it will not be as effective in its application as we would like it to be.</P>

      <P>Members of the House will recall the objection to the section in its original form, in that it appeared to leave no loophole for difficult cases.  The section has been redrafted, largely with the deliberate intention of giving the Minister some discretion and to enable him to overcome difficulties of definition and other difficulties which might arise if there was some doubt as to whether a person's spare time occupation might or might not interfere with his work as a local official.  For example, an official might have some kind of specialised agriculturist activity which on a very small scale would not interfere with his duties, but if that activity&mdash;such as the growing of some particular form of pedigree fruit, or tomatoes, involved administering a very large acreage&mdash;the Minister would be able to say: &ldquo;I am very sorry, but this is so large an undertaking that if you manage it yourself you must be using official time and I cannot accept that you could carry on with the work and also remain an official&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The House is already aware that since the Local Authorities (Officers and Employees) Act, 1926, became law, the description of the duties of an officer has become more precise&mdash;in other words, whether they are temporary or permanent, whole or part-time, pensionable or non-pensionable. The duties are fairly well indicated, but there are many officers whose terms of service are not exactly defined and the question arises as to what exactly are the terms of the appointment. This is a matter of particular importance in deciding, on an officer's retirement, whether he is entitled to a pension or not.  The Minister, on the other hand, has power to define the duties of the holders of offices, to assign the place in which the officer works, his hours of duty.  He can do that in connection with officers of particular grades.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it has been already indicated that there have been cases where doubts have arisen.  An officer may begin his career as a part-time officer. He may subsequently secure another part-time post and later still a third <Col N="702" /> part-time post.  If these posts are amalgamated the question arises: is he a whole-time officer or not?  Then there is also the case which the Minister has to consider, as I have said already, the particular work of the officer.  There are cases where it would be undesirable for an officer to undertake private practice of any kind relating to his profession where he is supposed to be engaged as a full-time officer exercising that profession on behalf of a local authority.  There are other cases, for example, where the medical superintendent of a mental hospital is allowed to act as a consultant and to certify insane persons. It is to the advantage of the public generally, and it is desirable, that such officers should be available to persons other than their own hospital patients. The Minister must be guided by common-sense and, to a degree, by custom and by the circumstances of each case. I do not think there is any great danger in the character of this amendment. If Senators will read it carefully, they will see, as I have said, that it gives the Minister discretionary powers.  It says: &ldquo;If the Minister is of opinion that on account of the nature or extent of the duties of an office, it is inexpedient that the holder of such office should engage in any other gainful occupation without the permission of the local authority by which appointments to such office are made and the consent of the Minister, the Minister may give a direction to that effect.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think we have done our best to meet the objection to the original section. I must make it clear that the Minister has to use his discretion and that he may be subject to criticism in this, as in all other executive acts. There may be people who may be prejudiced when he makes a decision on a particular matter but we cannot avoid that.</P>

    <P>the expression &ldquo;the principal section&rdquo; means Section 80 of the Act of 1941;</P>
    <P>the expression &ldquo;the official residence&rdquo; means, in relation to a member of a local authority, his official residence for the purposes of the principal section.</P>
    <P>(2)  A local authority to which the principal section applies may by resolution decide that, in lieu of defraying the expenses of locomotion actually incurred by each of their members in travelling to and from the meetings of such local authority, such local authority shall pay to each such member in respect to every meeting of such local authority which he attends at a place not less than five miles by any route from his official residence, a fixed sum for every mile between such place and such official residence measured along the route by which such member would normally travel.</P>
    <P>(3)  A resolution passed by a local authority under sub-section (2) of this section may be revoked at any time by another resolution of such local authority.</P>
    <P>(4)  A resolution under sub-section (2)  or sub-section (3) of this section shall not take effect until sanctioned by the Minister.</P>
    <P>(5)  The passing by a local authority of a resolution under sub-section (2) or sub-section (3) of this section shall be a reserved function.</P>
    <P>(6)  While a resolution passed by a local authority to which the principal section applies under sub-section (2) of this section is in force such local authority shall not defray under sub-section (3) of the principal section the expenses of locomotion actually incurred by each of their members in travelling to and from meetings of such local authority but, in lieu thereof, shall make payments to members attending such meetings in accordance with the terms of such resolution.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="705" /> (7)  Where a member of a local authority attends a meeting of such local authority at a place not less than five miles by any route from his official residence and is obliged by reason of such attendance to remain away from his home for a continuous period of not less than three hours, the local authority shall, in addition to defraying under the principal section the expenses of locomotion incurred by such member in travelling to and from such meeting or making to such member the payment required by a resolution under sub-section (2) of this section (as the case may be), pay to such member an allowance in respect of such period calculated in accordance with the prescribed rules.</P>
    <P>(8)  The rules made by the Minister for the purposes of sub-section (7) of this section shall make provision for preventing allowances being paid to a member of more than one local authority, by more than one local authority in respect of the same period.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LukeDuffy" hpid="Mr. Duffy Mr. Duffy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Duffy</NameTxt>
      <P>May I be permitted to say a word about the amendment? This amendment was submitted arising out of an amendment which I had tabled on the Committee Stage.  My amendment sought to confer power on the local authority to make arrangements subject to sanction by the Minister under which payments might be made to members of local authorities in respect of expenditure on subsistence in connection with their attendance at meetings of local authorities, and also to compensate them, in proper cases, for any loss of remuneration which might be suffered because of their attendance to the business of the local authority.  I have in mind, for instance, the case of somebody in West Cork who is a member of the Cork County Council.  He probably would require to travel 40 miles to attend the meeting of the county council. He would leave home early in the morning and get back late at night. He would lose a day's pay, whatever it might be.  He would also have to pay for his subsistence while he was away. Under Section 80 of the Act of 1941, the council were entitled to make a <Col N="706" /> payment to defray the actual cost of locomotion occasioned by the attendance. The Minister promised that the matter would be examined and that he would endeavour to meet my amendment to some extent.  The result is enshrined in this amendment No. 27.</P>
      <P>I must say, first and foremost, that I am dissatisfied with the arrangement which he has made, which merely allows payment of the cost of a meal for instance.  The amount and the method of payment will be prescribed by the Minister under regulations which he will make under the section as amended.  What baffles me completely is the manner in which this amendment is drawn.  I think it is the most bewildering form of draftsmanship I have ever met.  The amendment commences in the first sub-section to deal with the present arrangement of defraying the cost of locomotion and it authorises the local authority, if they see fit, to pass a resolution enabling them to pay, not the actual cost of locomotion but a mileage rate, being a fixed sum for every mile between the place of meeting and the official residence of the member &ldquo;measured along the route by which such member would normally travel.&rdquo; Heretofore, the expenses were paid according to whatever route he had to travel, but now somebody will have to make a new survey of Ireland to find out the route by which he would normally travel and he will be paid a mileage rate according to that measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In order to clarify what is being done and to implement sub-section (2) we have four other sub-sections.  We then come to sub-section (7) which is really the sub-section which is introduced for the purpose of meeting the point I raised, to the extent that it is being met.  We have here a long sub-section, the net result of which is expressed in the last two lines, that the local authority shall pay to such member an allowance in respect of such period calculated in accordance with the prescribed rules. There you have almost a sheet of foolscap occupied in expressing a very simple idea, that a member who goes to attend a meeting may get 2/- to pa <Col N="707" /> for his lunch.  What is really happening at present is that, because of the manner in which these regulations have been drafted, councils are paying at least twice as much in expenses as they would normally, if the thing were done on a common-sense basis.</P>
    <P>Take this case.  A member of a local authority lives 20 miles from the place at which the council meets.  If he is a young athletic man and were allowed reasonable expenses he would probably cycle to the meeting.  He would be allowed a certain amount to cover subsistence and perhaps a day's pay.  The whole thing would come to 10/-.  But what does he do?  He has got to pay for his meals out of his own pocket, and he compensates himself for that by hiring a motor car.  He drives in the motor car to the meeting, keeps it out all day and drives home in the evening at a cost of £2 10s. or £3. Therefore, the local authorities are paying far more in expenses under the present arrangement than if they had a sensible arrangement by which they would give members compensation for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses. That is all they ask, that they should be compensated for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses.</P>
    <P>In reading this amendment I was highly amused to see the manner in which the drafting of simple ideas can become so involved in legislation.  It reminds me of a story that the late Cathal McGarvey used to tell many years ago.  This was at the time that the foot-and-mouth disease was alleged to be very prevalent in Ireland.  The person appointed to inquire into an outbreak in some part of the West of Ireland was the local sergeant of the Royal Irish Constabulary.  He is alleged to have asked a farmer whether there was any foot-and-mouth disease on his land.  The farmer said that he thought the goat had got it.  The sergeant asked the farmer to explain the symptoms.  The farmer said that the goat wagged its tail, and the sergeant proceeded to inquire whether the tail was wagged upwards and downwards or backwards and forwards. That is precisely the mentality that we find in the drafting of an <Col N="708" /> amendment of this kind.  If reasonable men sat down to provide a method by which the local authority would be allowed by its own resolution, subject to the sanction of the Minister, to settle these things for themselves, they would soon do so in a sensible way.  It would be less expensive than the arrangement set out in the amendment and would be understood by everybody. I thought that I misunderstood the amendment, and I, therefore, showed it to two or three members of local authorities.  I asked them to tell me what it meant, but they did not profess to know.</P>
    <P>There is one other point.  Section 80 is the principal section referred to here.  I do not remember whether it embraces all the subsidiary bodies that are appointed by local authorities.  I should like to know from the Parliamentary Secretary whether the amendment covers the visiting committee of a mental hospital or the various joint committees appointed by county councils. There is one other matter that I would like to mention for the information of the Parliamentary Secretary in the hope that the matter might be reviewed again.  In the old days, in the case of mental hospital committees, there was a practice by which a meal was provided in the institution for the members attending the meetings.  For some years I was a member of the joint committee of the Portrane and Grange-gorman Mental Hospital.  A meal was provided for the members who attended the board meetings.</P>
    <P>I understand that was a common practice throughout the country in the case of mental hospitals.  It got rid of all this trouble about the cost of maintenance.  The members assembled for the meeting at 11 o'clock in the morning.  There was an interval for lunch at 1 o'clock.  The members returned to the meeting at 2 o'clock, and were usually able to finish the business by 5 o'clock.  The result of that arrangement was that there was no question of expenses.  I understand that, in some cases, that practice has been discontinued.  I do not know whether it is due to some direction from Departmental headquarters or to some view taken by the county manager. <Col N="709" /> I am, however, aware that in certain cases the practice has been discontinued of serving a meal to the members of visiting committees of mental hospitals.  That has increased very materially the cost of the attendance of members at meetings.  For some reason, the practice has been continued in other cases.  I should be glad to get some indication from the Parliamentary Secretary as to what the official policy in regard to that matter is, and whether it is desired that the practice should be continued or discontinued.</P>

      <P>It is interesting to observe how great minds work alike because I, without any collusion, had come to identically the same conclusion as Senator Duffy.  Why all this elaboration and verbosity in the amendment? When I read it I knew, of course, roughly, what it intended to do, but I did not waste my time in trying to dissect it.  It is an eloquent example of the position we have now reached as regards central control&mdash;that it requires a whole page practically of the Order Paper to put into effect a very simple proposition regarding the payment of reasonable expenses.  Any business firm would do that in a 100-word circular.  You have a note of suspicion in it&mdash;that a person must travel by the nearest road.  Why all that tomfoolery?  I wonder what the friend of the Cathaoirleach and myself, that great patriot Alec Heskin, if he returned to this earth, would think of the sorry pass that local government has now reached?  The chairman and I had many encounters with him.  He was a very patriotic Irishman.  An amendment such as this is the result of the ridiculous position that centralisation has brought us to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Why cannot local authorities be allowed a certain latitude and discretion in the matter of expenses for the members?  One local authority may wish to give expenses in one form and another local authority may wish to do it in another form.  Is not diversity the whole spice of life?  That is what we should be trying to do&mdash; to educate our people to find their own salvation.  What we have here is a verbose legally constructed document <Col N="710" /> which Senator Duffy says he has examined and does not understand. As I said on the Second Reading of the Bill, we should cut away from all this nonsense, all this streamlining and get back to human methods in local government.</P>

      <P>The wording of the amendment is rather long, but the intention is clear.  The amendment speaks of &ldquo;not less than five miles by any route from his official residence a fixed sum for every mile between such place and such official residence measured along the route by which such a member would normally travel.&rdquo; That reminds me of a story that I once heard from an Indian judge.  For years and years he had been carrying on a correspondence about his charges. Eventually the authorities said that he was charging too much.  The reason, they said, was because he did not go along the route as the crow flies.  After some years he got busy again and wrote back to say that his reasons for not going as the crow flies were: &ldquo;(1), Because I am not a crow, and (2) Because I do not fly.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Whoever drafted this left nothing to the imagination because he says it must be along a road and a normal road.  The first Act that provided travelling expenses was the Act of 1925. It allowed 5d. per mile.</P>

      <P>I do not know whether Senator O'Dea is more clear-minded than I am, at the moment.  We know that the existing law in regard to the payment of travelling expenses is very unsatisfactory.  Perhaps it may be said that it is unsatisfactory because it has been unsatisfactorily administered. That is one of the faults I have to find with it.  Personally, I have no experience, but colleagues of mine have experience and it is quite absurd to find that they get one treatment one time from their own county manager and another treatment another time from another county manager.  We have had experience in my county of the manager of the Joint Mental Hospital for Cavan and Monaghan.  Members from Cavan who could not attend the meeting by any other means than by motor car, were not entitled to their travelling expenses. He actually did that.  It came up before our county council meeting and we found the position altered some time afterwards.  It is true that the law was there.  The phrase was &ldquo;reasonable travelling expenses&rdquo; and I think we can say that the position was somewhat clarified since then.  I would like to have this sub-section clarified still further.  Are we going to have a separate resolution for each member?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LouisODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>It says:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;A local authority to which the principal section applies may by resolution decide that, in lieu of defraying the expenses of locomotion actually incurred by each of their members in travelling to and from the meetings of such local authority, such local authority shall pay to each such member, in respect of every meeting of such local authority which he attends at a <Col N="712" /> place not less than five miles by any route from his official residence, a fixed sum for every mile between such place and such official residence measured along the route by which such member would normally travel.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Why I make this point is this.  As we know, some members of local authorities, some of our members at least&mdash;I do not know what happens in Clare, Longford or Galway&mdash; travel by bus, others cannot travel by bus and some of them travel by motor car and some of them travel by bicycle.  Now the man who can only travel by motor car cannot possibly get to the meeting at the same cost per mile, anyway you calculate it, as the man who travels by bus.  Some of the men who travel by bus have only the same distance to go as the men who travel by motor car. If you give a fixed sum to each member, an equal sum to each member, you are going to have some of the men doubly paid with regard to their expenses. I have no objection to this at all.  My view is that when a man spends his day away from home at a meeting he does not do so without spending money; he has to have a meal.  These men are always out of pocket.  I do not know how this is going to work out.  I think I heard some murmur of dissent from Senator Hearne and, perhaps, he will explain his difficulty.</P>

Not alone is it absurd in regard to his Department but in other Departments, too.  Under the Vocational Education scheme the allowances are grotesque. <Col N="713" /> How is this going to be worked out? I know men who cycle ten or 15 miles to meetings and they can only come by bicycle unless they bring a car to the house and that would be rather extravagant.  Personally I think the allowance is not sufficient.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I have only two or three remarks to make.  On the last occasion I dealt with the case of the Carlow Mental Hospital Committee where a lunch used to be provided for the members and where this was one of the first things that was cut out when the county manager was introduced. It was cut out by the county manager against the wishes of the committee and against the wishes of both councils.  The Kildare County Council has recently passed a resolution requesting that this luncheon be reintroduced because it is much more satisfactory to have members meeting and having informal discussions over a meal like this rather than that the members should be given a few shillings and have to get a meal outside.  One of the difficulties of the County Management Act is that committees like this have no power of dealing with a case that arises under the executive responsibility of the committee.</P>
      <P>Estimates committees and visiting committees are both very important committees of local authorities, and it does appear to me reasonable that where a member of the local authority, at the request of that authority, attends a meeting of the estimates committee or visiting committee, he should, while there attending them, be in the same position as if he was attending a meeting of the full council.</P>
      <P>I understand that there is a method by which the Minister's sanction to committees can be obtained, and that the meetings of those committees may be considered as meetings of the local authority, but will that operate so far as sub-section (7) for example is concerned?  I am not clear on that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not going to deal with the criticisms of the drafting of the section because it seems to be fairly clear.  Whether it might be said in fewer words or at greater length <Col N="714" /> is a matter of opinion, but I should state that the expenses of a vocational education committee or of a county committee of agriculture are not provided for in this section, which relates to the Local Government Act, 1941, where these bodies are excluded from the definition terms.  The visiting committee of a mental hospital is included.</P>

When the Bill becomes effective, a joint mental hospital committee can arrange to have a meal at an institution and the members can discharge the cost thereof by means of these subsistence allowances.</P>

      <P>With regard to Senator Baxter's observations on travelling expenses, the local authority can adopt either one or the other system.  Up to 1941, only the mileage system obtained, and in response to complaints that were made, we changed the system.  Now we have arranged that either method can be adopted&mdash; either there is a definite mileage allowance or members can continue to have their expenses reimbursed.  The rate of expenses is administered by the manager.</P>
      <P>In regard to Senator Sweetman's suggestion that local authorities might be able to arrange lunches where members could have informal discussions, I understand that there is no objection.  The manager could provide lunch for county council members and discharge the cost of those lunches by means of subsistence allowances.  In regard to estimates committees, I understand that if a case should be made, that these committees should meet regularly, expenses can be allowed.</P>

The Minister's amendment is that he may make regulations prescribing the size of signs to be provided by a road authority but it would appear that only a road authority is bound to obey his regulations.

Between this and the Dáil I would suggest that the Parliamentary Secretary would look into the aspect of the matter I have indicated. It appeared to me that what he has done is to leave the Minister power to make regulations about every sort of sign, hotel signs included, and the thing he has said is that a local authority will not erect any sign except in accordance with regulation.  I have provided that the Minister may make regulations about the type of signs which a local authority may erect and then it is provided that no sign can be erected except in conformity with the regulation.  It is a verbal question of drafting about which I am still not quite happy, but I would be satisfied if the Parliamentary Secretary will look into it by the time it goes back to the Dáil.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I am afraid the Minister slipped one across me on the Committee Stage&mdash; I may as well be quite frank about it. I understood that the whole section was being governed by the words in sub-section (1).  I thought on the Committee Stage that this was only provided in cases in which the land was acquired by agreement, but when I came on to read sub-section (4) more carefully in the light of the subsequent discussion, I came to the conclusion that my first impression was not quite correct and in fact what was happening was that local authorities were being given the power to acquire land compulsorily, notwithstanding the fact that they had not made up their minds what they wanted to acquire it for.  I cannot fully understand it, taking the view that if certain land was for sale in the public market, it would be desirable for such a public authority to take advantage of the opportunity to purchase it by agreement on that occasion, notwithstanding that they had not actually determined the purpose for which they wanted it.  Here is something different.  Here is a case in which the local authority come forward and say: &ldquo;We want to acquire this land compulsorily, notwithstanding that we do not know for what purposes we want it&rdquo;.  Worse than that, it might be land adjoining some amenity.  It might be no hardship on the owner that that land should be acquired for a particular purpose.  He might be prepared to agree with its acquisition for that purpose. But, in sub-section (4), the local <Col N="718" /> authority, having got the land from him by those means, can turn round and say that they have changed their minds, that they are going to put something there that might be objectionable and utterly ruinous to the business of the man next door.</P>
    <P>That does not seem to me to be giving to the private individual who owns property a fair crack of the whip.  I mention this matter with some diffidence because the proposal seems to me to be so outrageous that I feel I must have missed something in regard to the sub-section.  If the sub-section means that the local authority can acquire land compulsorily, saying they want it for one purpose, and then, shortly afterwards, decide, because of different circumstances, that they will use it for another purpose, I should find it difficult to support it.  I hope I am wrong.</P>

      <P>There is a great deal to be said for this amendment.  One can imagine an urban authority seeing some land near their area which they might require for the purpose of beautifying their town or adding to the amenities of their town.  Everybody who knows Galway knows Menlo Wood.  At one time, the corporation were afraid that the wood would be cut down and they bought the timber. People came in and cut down the timber and the council could not prosecute them because they were not the owners of the land.  I can imagine several such instances in which people would desire to develop their town and would require land for that purpose. They might not know immediately what they would do with it but any town planner they consulted would tell them that that land would be necessary for his purposes.  I do not think that an urban authority can purchase without the consent of the Minister.</P>

The last of those houses may not be built for ten years, but we want power to acquire the necessary land.  I think that it is right <Col N="719" /> that the local authority should have power to acquire the whole of the land and have their scheme prepared accordingly by an architect, even though the last of the houses may not be completed for ten years.  That would be the only proper way of proceeding in a case of that kind.  The other case I have in mind is that of the making of a new road near a town.  Undoubtedly, the land along that road would become valuable because of development by the public authority.</P>

      <P>It was suggested that, unless we inserted this amendment, the Minister himself would have to hold the local inquiry.</P>
      <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
      <P>Amendments Nos. 37 and 38 not moved.</P>

      <P>On behalf of Senator Patrick J. O'Reilly, I move amendment No. 39:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In page 42, Second Schedule, Part <Col N="721" /> 1, to delete the fraction &ldquo;¾&rdquo; where that fraction occurs and to insert instead in each case the fraction &ldquo;?&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Reilly asked me particularly to move this amendment, having regard to the terms of the Schedule.  In Part I of the Schedule, it is ¾ and Senator O'Reilly desires to reduce it to ?.  It is ? in Part II, but not in Part I.  In this question the Parliamentary Secretary may be in a great deal of difficulty, except that perhaps his brief is a great deal better than mine.</P>
    <P>I understand from Senator O'Reilly that the position is going to be that agricultural land in the urban district of Dundalk, which has a population of 14,684, agricultural land in the urban district of Tralee, which has a population of 10,285 and agricultural land in the urban district of Bray, which has a population of 10,111, will be rated at only three-fifths of the poor law valuation thereof; but that land in the case of all the boroughs, whether large or small, will be rated at the very much larger figure of three-fourths.  I think this is an example of what Senator Hayes referred to as streamlined efficiency&mdash;the Minister is anxious to get a cut straight deadline and bring all the different local authorities in on that line, regardless of size and so forth.  I understand that Clonmel&mdash;though a borough and, therefore, coming within Part I of the Second Schedule&mdash;has a population of only 9,391 and, therefore, it is being treated in a very harsh manner, if one makes a comparison with the urban districts in the larger places&mdash;Dundalk, Tralee and Bray.  Similarly, Kilkenny is about the same size as Tralee and Bray, but considerably smaller than Dundalk.</P>
    <P>It appears to me that the Minister might deal with this, perhaps not altogether in the way that Senator O'Reilly has dealt with it, but by reference to the size of the town concerned rather than to whether it happened to have an urban council or a corporation.  After all, it is very often fortuitous whether a town has an urban council or a corporation.  As <Col N="722" /> the Bill as drafted dealt with it purely on that basis, would it not be much more reasonable and equitable to deal with it on the basis of the population from time to time?  By that means, not only would we be fair at the present time, but according as different censuses were taken, the requirements of the neighbourhoods could be dealt with according to the latest shift of the population for the area concerned.</P>

      <P>There is a good deal to be said for the amendment.  First of all, there was the Town Improvements Act of 1847 and another of 1854, and the latter provided that land in an urban area should be levied only on a quarter of the poor law valuation.  It may be suggested that boroughs are more important than urban areas and that is the reason for the three-quarters, that people are not dependent so much on the land as they are in urban areas.  I think they are just as dependent.</P>
      <P>The only question is about Section 21.  For the first six years there is an allowance made, and I wonder if the figures in that would have to be altered if this is altered to 3-5ths?</P>

      <P>We have tried to establish some uniformity in regard to the rating on lands, etc., and in this connection, with the Senator's amendment we have received a letter from the acting-town clerk in Clonmel, whom we asked to give us an indication of the effect of the section on the incidence of rate.  He said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The total rate in Clonmel this year is 16/8, made up of borough rate 3/-, sanitary rate 3/8, and poor rate 10/-; while the rate on land is borough rate 3/-, sanitary rate quarter of 3/8, 11d.; and poor rate 10/-, total 13/11.  Under the new Bill, if three-quarters of the total rate was assessable on lands, the rate on land would be 21/6, which would mean a gain of 1/5 in the £ to the rated occupiers of land in Clonmel.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have tried to arrange this in such a way as to be equitable and if the Senator were to study what the change of rate would mean in effect, as <Col N="723" /> between three-quarters and three-fifths, he will see we have made the best job we can of it.  I could read a long list of figures showing the effect of this amendment but it is surely not necessary at this stage.</P>

      <P>In the absence of the Senator for Clonmel who sits behind me and in the absence of the Alderman of the Borough of Clonmel <Col N="724" /> who is the Leader of this House, I do not think I can do anything else but withdraw the amendment.</P>
      <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
      <P>Question&mdash;&ldquo;That the Bill be received for final consideration&rdquo;&mdash; agreed to.</P>
      <P>Fifth Stage ordered for Wednesday, 17th July, 1946.</P>
      <P>The Seanad adjourned at 9.10 until 3 p.m. on Wednesday, 17th July, 1946.</P>
