    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass) Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>Senators I think are aware that an Order made by the Government under the Imposition of Duties Act, 1932, must be confirmed by legislation within a period of eight months from the date of the Order. In this year the Government made an Order which this Bill proposes to confirm&mdash;Emergency (Imposition of Duties) (No. 226) Order&mdash;which relates to duties on wireless apparatus.  It was considered desirable to review and recast the duties upon wireless apparatus.  The House is probably familiar with the history of these duties.  They were originally imposed in 1926 for the purpose of raising revenue to finance the broadcasting station that was then established. Duties were imposed upon wireless apparatus and on all component parts of wireless apparatus at the rate of 33? per cent. <i>ad valorem.</i>  They were not intended to and did not have any protective effect.  For some years after the duties were imposed the revenue derived from them was earmarked for broadcasting purposes. That situation ended in 1929, when these revenues were credited to the general account of the Exchequer and not appropriated in aid of or set against the cost of the broadcasting services.  In 1932 it was decided to recast these duties so as to encourage the assembly and partial manufacture of wireless receiving apparatus here. The duty of 33? per cent. was increased to 50 per cent. upon assembled or substantially assembled apparatus and the duty on component parts was reduced to 25 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have stated, the duties had originally a solely revenue purpose and with the revision of duties in 1932 the Minister for Finance did not wish to lose the whole of that revenue so that the scale of duties devised in 1932 was designed not merely to encourage the assembly of wireless apparatus but <Col N="155" /> also to continue to yield revenue to the Exchequer.  The duties were protective to the extent that a lower duty operated upon component parts than upon assembled or substantially assembled apparatus.  These duties were revised in a minor degree by various Finance Acts up to 1937.  In consequence of the change, the production of wireless receiving apparatus here began, although in pre-war years the output of local factories was not sufficient to supply the whole of the requirements of this market.  It is estimated that of the 40,000 wireless sets which were purchased every year on the average in pre-war years, not much more than 25 per cent. were home produced.  There was a number of reasons for that position.  The industry was a new one and it was developing gradually but the main reason in my view was that the manner in which the trade in wireless apparatus was carried on involved the giving of very substantial discount by manufacturers to wholesalers and importers. That situation had the result that the declared value of wireless apparatus for customs purposes was small in relation to the selling price fixed by manufacturers and the importers were able to pay the duty and still make a substantial profit on the sale of sets.</P>
    <P>During the war years the production of wireless apparatus fell considerably owing to the difficulty of obtaining parts but, arising out of the efforts of the firms to keep going, it was demonstrated that many parts which were previously imported for incorporation into sets assembled here could be manufactured here and it was considered desirable to recast the duties, first of all to encourage that development, that is to say, the manufacture of parts which were previously imported complete for assembly in sets here and, secondly, to eliminate the revenue aspects of the original duty. The new scale of duty is designed to encourage manufacture and assembly to the degree now considered practicable and to remove from the scope of the duty altogether such parts as wireless valves which it is considered are not likely to be manufactured here but <Col N="156" /> which were nevertheless subject to duty previously for the benefit of the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>The system under which the duty will be operated will necessitate the granting of licences to firms which are engaged in the manufacture or assembly of sets to the approved degree, to import duty free certain components. There are, in fact, three such firms operating at the moment, manufacturing components and assembled sets for sale here.  To these three firms, and to these three firms only, is the privilege of duty free importation of certain assembled parts allowed.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned that the annual sale of wireless receiving sets in the pre-war years was about 40,000 sets.  It is anticipated that the demand in the present and future years will be higher than that, both in consequence of the fact that there have been difficulties in obtaining sets during the war years and the fact that the extension of the rural electrification scheme will create a new market heretofore not catered for by the manufacturers.  The three firms engaged in the industry are producing at present at a rate of about 25,000 sets per annum.  Their output is increasing and will continue to increase as supplies of materials become more plentiful. When in May of this year the new duties were brought into force the number of employees was 100.  It is now about 350 and it is still increasing. It is understood that at least three additional firms are proposing to engage in the production of wireless sets here.  One of the existing firms, which established a new and larger factory and got into full-scale economic production before the others, is selling sets similar to sets sold under the same trade name in Great Britain at prices which are the same as those prevailing in Great Britain exclusive of purchase tax.  The other firms, which are not yet in full-scale production, are selling sets at prices slightly higher than the British prices but it is anticipated that their prices will come down to the level of British prices when full-scale production has been reached.</P>
    <P>There is at present a certain difficulty in supplying parts for the repairs and servicing trades, but it is the intention of the firms in the industry to <Col N="157" /> produce for these trades, and already some supplies are becoming available to them.  It is contemplated that the full requirements of the repairs and servicing trades will be met by the production of the local factories in respect of components manufactured by them.  To the extent that persons may have sets of types not produced here and require replacement parts for those sets, they will, of course, have to pay duty on those parts.  As I explained, however, these parts have been subject to duty since 1926.  At present 20 different varieties of sets are being produced and sold here, so that there is a wide choice available to purchasers. All these sets have different characteristics and different performances. The industry is a very desirable one for establishment.  It involves a considerable degree of skill on the part of some of the operatives, it is capable of giving substantial employment and its full-scale exploitation may lead to further industrial development of various kinds worth having.  For that reason, the Government considered it advisable to make the changes in duties achieved by the Order referred to in this Bill and recommends the Oireachtas to pass confirming legislation.</P>

      <P>I hope to show the House that a number of matters in connection with this measure will require a great deal more elucidation than has been given in the Minister's opening statement.  I should like, as a preliminary, as a sort of academic matter, to call the attention of the House to the extraordinary distance we have travelled in relation to what is known as a Money Bill.  I am aware that to deal with a matter of this kind would, probably, require some constitutional change.  Here, we have a Bill which, as the Minister says, is primarily designed to prohibit the importation of wireless sets.  The revenue aspect of this Bill is purely secondary.  Yet, a measure mainly confined to prohibition seeks enactment under the protection of a Money Bill. That means that it escapes amendment in this House.  When the device of Money Bills was originally introduced, no such development was anticipated. We have now reached a <Col N="158" /> stage at which the Government might introduce a measure imposing a duty of 200 per cent. or 300 per cent. on an import&mdash;a duty which would have a prohibitive effect&mdash;and that Bill would, under our present regulations, be protected as a Money Bill.  I think that the time has come when this matter should be re-examined by whatever committee is appropriate to the purpose, with a view to preventing an abuse of the facilities afforded by, and the principles of, Money Bills.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Passing to the details of this measure, its object, as the Minister says, is primarily to prohibit the importation of wholly or partly assembled sets, in order to build up, so far as possible, a home industry and to encourage the complete assembly of wireless apparatus.  If we examine that matter closely, the Bill has certain very disquieting features. Under this measure, there will be within the wireless trade practically two divisions.  In one group, will be the licensed manufacturers or assemblers and, in the other group, will be the ordinary retail traders. What are the requirements for obtaining a manufacturer's licence?  I know that certain people have claimed such licences and that their claims have been refused.  I do not think it is satisfactory that what may be an issue of considerable importance to an individual should be determined, as I imagine it will be determined, purely by the decision of the Minister. Perhaps, on first examination, the decision may come from one of the Minister's officials.  If he refuses the application, has the aggrieved party an appeal to the Minister?  In justice, he should have.  I should go further and say that he should have an appeal to some body with technical knowledge, competent to hear and adjudge such appeals, because I doubt that the Minister will claim that, within his staff, he has the necessary knowledge to deal with matters of so technical a nature. I am sure he would not go outside amongst people who have already got licences for advice as to the rights or wrongs of an application.  In fact, who does advise him or his officials on the merits of such an application?  Is it not only just that there should be <Col N="159" /> some more or less formal procedure in coming to a decision in such matters?</P>
    <P>In connection with the manufacture or assembly of sets, the Minister has told us that there is provision to allow parts to be imported duty free.  I take it that this will be a developing matter.  To-day, a number of parts which are not being made here may be allowed in duty free.  If the object of the Minister is to establish an increasing degree of manufacture, he may say: &ldquo;I think that those parts which are duty free to-day should be made at home in due course and, after a certain date, we shall no longer allow imports duty free of those prescribed parts.&rdquo;  Would the Minister give the House more enlightenment on that matter?  What machinery has he for examination as to the parts which may be allowed in duty free to-day and which may be liable to duty tomorrow on account of the possibility of their being made at home?  Arising out of these two questions is the necessity for some independent body, with technical knowledge and quasi-judicial functions, outside the trade, to deal with these matters and see that injustice is not done as between the retailers and the manufacturers and above all, that the listening public is adequately protected.</P>
    <P>As I have said, there are two main groups in the trade&mdash;the manufacturers and the retailers.  The manufacturers are to be allowed to import parts duty free.  That privilege will not be allowed to any of the retailers.  What is there to prevent a manufacturer bringing in parts duty free and passing them, at a profit, to a retailer, so that he may carry out repairs?  There is a serious possibility of a black market within the trade.  That, I imagine, would be very hard to prevent.  We are accustomed to hosts of officials inquiring into everything but, bearing in mind what human nature is, there is a probability of transference of duty-free parts from a manufacturer to a retailer at a profit.  What machinery has the Minister in existence or in contemplation to prevent such illicit traffic, as I would call it?  Manufacturers <Col N="160" /> at present, as well as retailers, do repairs, so that we will obviously reach a position in which the manufacturer who does repairs can carry them out to a certain extent with duty-free parts, while the retailer will be forced to carry them out with parts on which duty has been paid.  That seems, on the face of it, to be a great injustice.  I suppose the Minister has addressed his mind to that possibility and here again I should like to know what steps he intends to take to prevent that very likely discrimination between manufacturers and retailers.</P>
    <P>With regard to this matter of repairs, there are a number of old sets&mdash;many of us have them&mdash;with many years of service but which can be kept going for many years by repairs.  We may, I think, assume that none of the parts used for the repair of these older sets is likely to be admitted duty free and, if so, is it just that people&mdash;generally people of moderate means who are less able to afford a new set&mdash;should have imposed upon them the penalty of this duty on repair parts, that duty not in any sense being in the interest of home manufacture but merely a tax on the importation of parts for old sets which are never likely to be made in this country?  The Revenue Commissioners may say that they cannot give up the revenue from this duty, but is it a just tax?  That is the point which ought to be gone into.  I shall have something to say in a moment about the general social aspects of this new boon to mankind.</P>
    <P>I have heard it suggested that the real purpose of this measure is to drive these old sets out of date as soon as possible or within a reasonable time in order to stimulate home manufacture. I hope the Minister would not agree to such a proposition.  But knowing human nature and knowing a certain amount about trade methods, correct or incorrect, I would not put it beyond certain people to take that line and say: &ldquo;I am in the wireless manufacturing business and I am only too anxious that these old sets should be scrapped in order that new sets will be bought.&rdquo;  A very useful way of scrapping them is to put a duty on the <Col N="161" /> parts required for repairs and so increase very much the price of repairs. Let me call attention to the very great increases.  Small articles which were 6d. before will be up to 3/- now and the 3/- article will be up to 7/- or 8/- with this 75 per cent. duty.  All these are points which will require clarification.</P>
    <P>The Minister says that this is a suitable industry for the country and in that I agree.  Compared with some of the industries with which we have been burdened and others which are threatening, this industry is eminently suitable. It is as suitable to this country as the watch industry was to a small country like Switzerland, but implicit in that suitability is a fair deal for the unorganised consumer.  I have been told that I have rather made myself the champion of the unorganised consumer and I am not ashamed of it.  I intend to speak up on every occasion where I think the consumer is being unduly exploited or unduly neglected.  I should like to remark incidentally that in statements made in this House and in the Dáil and in speeches which the Minister has made at functions of trade associations and so forth throughout the country, which I pity him for having to attend, I rarely find any reference to the protection of the consumer. It is all: &ldquo;Let us have industries.  Let us manufacture or die,&rdquo; and there is not a word about whether the poor people who have to buy the articles can do so within their means and in face of the rising prices.  I feel that the consumer is an integral part of any effort to manufacture at home and if we cannot manufacture at a price which is fair to the consumer, we should not manufacture at all.</P>
    <P>The only crumb of comfort I see for the consumer is the statement of the Minister that at the present time&mdash;and I emphasise &ldquo;at the present time&rdquo;&mdash; one firm is producing wireless sets similar in quality&mdash;quality is always a doubtful factor in all these cases, but I assume that it is so&mdash;and equal in price to sets manufactured in Great Britain.  That is all right for the present, but does anybody imagine that the present minimum price of £15 for sets in Great Britain will continue <Col N="162" /> when supplies become more plentiful and when a sellers' market becomes a buyers' market?  Will the Minister give the House an assurance that that position will continue to be observed, and that, in five years' time, home prices will be at least equal to, and possibly even less than, prices across the water, because without that assurance there is no protection whatever for the public in that statement?</P>
    <P>With regard to variety, the Minister said that at present 20 different types of sets are being manufactured.  I have had conversations with competent people in the trade and they assure me that they know only five.  They do not say that there might not be a set with a knob in a different place from another set or with somewhat different lettering on the dial, or with a different kind of cabinet, but so far as essential works are concerned&mdash;numbers of valves and such other technical matters &mdash;they say that there are only five sets of different type being manufactured here.  You cannot call one set which works off the mains different from a set which works off batteries.  I do not know if a battery set and a mains set are regarded as different types.</P>
    <P>This is a matter which, on grounds of social policy and education, I would ask the House to say requires a very deliberate and careful approach.  The wireless is no longer a luxury.  My friend, Senator Foran, I think, will agree with me that there are very few working men, with the possible exception of the leaders of the labour movement, who to-day could readily pay a minimum of £15 for a set which is an essential part of their equipment as citizens to listen to the voice of the Tánaiste or the Taoiseach on occasions.  We should all be in a position to do that in our homes, and it should be the object of the Government to make wireless sets as cheap in price as any other essential article in a person's home.  There should be strong resistance to any attempt to keep up prices mainly in the interests of home industry or local manufacture. I think that at the present time £15 is in or about the minimum price of a wireless set.  It should be our aim to produce sets at a much lower price so <Col N="163" /> as to bring them within the range of the ordinary working man, realising their social and educational value as well as the enormous influence they have in keeping people at home&mdash; keeping them off the streets and away from the &ldquo;pubs.&rdquo;  We should realise the moral effect that a good wireless set has in family life.</P>
    <P>This is a Money Bill, and I have no doubt it will be passed.  At the same time, I want to say that it contains principles which should be the subject of a much more deliberate approach. There is the question of the suitability of local manufacture as well as the effect that a preference may give to manufacturers over retailers.  There is also the question of a penalty&mdash;indeed, one may say that it is a tax&mdash;on those who have old sets, and there is the assessment of the educational value of a set on the minds of listeners.  We have in this Bill an example of the bad way, and the wrong way, of introducing tariffs.  All these questions should be examined before a prohibitive tariff of this kind is introduced without any corresponding safeguard for the consumer.  This brings me to a request which I made on the Finance Bill to the Minister for Finance and which, I am sure, he conveyed to the Minister for Industry and Commerce. It was that the Minister for Industry and Commerce should seriously consider the revival of some such body as the old tariff commission before important questions affecting the price level, as well as the lives and social conditions of our people, are brought into force by Order or without notice. Before that is done there should be an examination of the whole problem by people representing all sides&mdash;not merely manufacturers, but consumers and educationists as well &mdash;and only on their report should a decision be made.  I hope that the Minister will on this Bill or, possibly, on another Bill which is to come before us to-day, give some indication of his views with regard to the revival of a body corresponding to the old tariff commission.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Johnston</NameTxt>
      <P>After listening to the Minister and to Senator Sir John <Col N="164" /> Keane, I find myself unable to make up my mind as to whether this Bill is one of the Minister's wiser and better-considered industrial policies, or whether it is what the late Stephen Leacock would refer to as &ldquo;a moonbeam from the larger lunacy&rdquo; on some of his other industrial policies.  We have on the one hand the prospect of establishing a new industry which it is anticipated will give employment to 350 people.  We have on the other hand the interests of 3,000,000 people minus the 350, who are primarily concerned with wireless because they want to listen to it, or because the desire of a great many of them to have a wireless set has not been met.  Now, it is perhaps encouraging to know that at present there are certain Irish manufacturers of wireless sets who are able to produce sets at a price which compares favourably with similar sets produced in England.  Like Senator Sir John Keane, I should like to be assured that that is not due to some special circumstance affecting manufacture here and there which may, possibly, be removed in the near future, and which may lead to a situation in the future not unlike that which existed in the past.</P>
      <P>My recollection is that, during a great many of the pre-war years, it was a notorious fact that an Irish-made set cost something of the order of £5, or more, than a set of similar quality made abroad and imported duty free if it could have been imported duty free. This difference in price undoubtedly operated to diminish the demand for wireless sets at home.  It diminished the number of possible owners and listeners, and that, in my opinion, is a matter of grave social and political importance. In fact, I think that the dominant interest in this matter should be that as many people as possible should own a wireless set, and that it should be available for their acquisition at the lowest possible price whether made at home or imported.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest that the Minister himself has a very special personal interest in the greatest possible number of persons owning and using a wireless set.  I remember a famous broadcast which the Minister made just before the election <Col N="165" /> of 1944 in which he announced the electrifying fact that the extraction rate for flour would be reduced to something like 85 per cent., and that we were to get a white flour after having, for some years, pestilential black bread. I also recall that <i>Dublin Opinion</i> rather unkindly suggested that the Minister was an expert at political billiards, and that what he really wanted to do was to go in off &ldquo;white&rdquo;. Anyhow, he may find an occasion before another election when he may have a personal interest in going in off &ldquo;white&rdquo; or in off &ldquo;red,&rdquo; as the case may be, in which case I suggest it would be very much to his interest that as many people as possible should own wireless sets, and thereby be able to hear his dramatic broadcasts.</P>
    <P>Now, what are the facts with regard to the number of people who own wireless sets in Éire as compared with other countries?  I have before me a paper which was contributed to the Statistical and Social Inquiry Society of Ireland by Dr. Beddy.  It was read on the 25th November, 1943.  In that paper certain interesting statistical comparisons were made between Ireland and Denmark.  It appears from this publication that in Denmark one person in every five owned a wireless set in 1938, whereas in Éire one person in every 20 owned a wireless set.  In other words, there were four times as many persons, in proportion, owners of wireless sets in Denmark as there were in Ireland, so that in this respect we lag very much behind the standards of other civilised countries in Europe in this very important matter.  I think, therefore, we ought to keep before our minds the desirability of making wireless sets available for our people at as cheap a price as possible, so that as many people as possible will be able to purchase them, whether they are made at home or come in from abroad. If they can be made at home at a price corresponding to, or very little in excess of, the price at which they can be imported duty free, then I welcome this industry, but if there is going to be an important differential in price, resulting from dearer costs of production at home, I think we ought to put the interests of Irish listeners well above the interests of the 350 people <Col N="166" /> who may otherwise be employed in making the wireless sets here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="The Earl of Longford The Earl of Longford">
      <NameTxt>The Earl of Longford</NameTxt>
      <P>We have been hearing a great deal about the blessing that wireless is to the people of this country.  I am not denying the great educational value of wireless, but I do not think, simply because the Danes have four times as many wireless sets in proportion to what we have, that they are necessarily four times a more civilised people.</P>
      <P>I think we should consider this matter from every point of view.  I hear that 350 workers are employed in the wireless business.  I think that our first interest should be to have not only those 350 workers employed but to get 3,000 workers employed.  I think large numbers of employed workers well paid, well clothed, well fed and well housed would be rather more important to the country than making wireless sets cheap.</P>
      <P>Now, for people in many parts of the country wireless sets are undoubtedly a great blessing and they are of great educational value.  Personally, I think books or, for that matter, even theatres, are of more value even than wireless sets.  I do not think it is of such enormous importance to get wireless into every home at just any price, even if it means unemployment.  I feel that we should consider, in this question, the point of view of the nation as a whole and that there are other things more important than making wireless sets cheap.  Therefore, I think this measure is very much a step in the right direction and I shall be prepared to support it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I feel, however, that the point raised by Senator Sir John Keane about parts is rather an important one and that it would be a very bad thing if there should be a black market created in parts.  If there is anything wrong in the details of this measure it should be amended.  I am not saying that the measure is in every way a good one in detail, but I think it is a sound measure.  I feel that all measures which increase employment, without definitely being detrimental in other respects, are beneficial to the people <Col N="167" /> as a whole and all such measures ought to be supported.</P>

      <P>There are other champions of the consumer in this House but, apparently, Senator Sir John Keane is anxious to appropriate to himself the title of champion of the consumer.</P>
      <P>I will explode one of the fallacies he gave expression to, with respect to duty-free parts and the possibility of a black market.  I am engaged in an industry in connection with which numbers of duty-free parts are imported.  I refer to the motor-assembly business.  On this occasion I can at least pay testimony to the efficacy of the Civil Service by saying that the assembler does not get any more parts than are necessary for his business and he has to account for all of them.  Therefore, that little point to which Senator Sir John Keane devoted such a lot of time need not worry the House very much.  The inspection system that exists in this State will, I am sure, see to it that the duty-free parts for the assembly industry, whether in regard to wireless sets or motor cars, are just sufficient to meet requirements and there is no possible chance of getting any more than the assembler requires.</P>

    <P>Let us get rid of the oft repeated suggestion that everything made in this country must be not only as good, but also as cheap, as articles that are made in other countries.  We are a comparatively small community&mdash;our population runs to about 3,000,000 people.  We live in close proximity to one of the biggest industrial nations in the world,  nation that possesses between  and 50,000,000 domestic consumers. <Col N="168" /> Prior to the last war that nation had an enormous export market, apart altogether from meeting its domestic needs.</P>
    <P>I wonder whether the people who make those statements are such friends of this country as they pose to be.  I suggest they are not doing the country any good by repeating those statements so often.  If you give me an order for 100,000 articles, I can give them to you at a cheaper rate individually than I could if you were to order only one. That is a sound business maxim.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister is to be congratulated in making it possible for us to do something which will increase employment in this country.  This country owes a lot to the variety of industries created here, created too in the midst of hostile criticism.  Those industries were damned by the faint praise of people who should have known better.  Were it not for the variety of the industries and the fact that we had certain goods, not at a cut price but at any price&mdash;if we had not the native manufacture they would not be there&mdash;where would the people of our country be during the past five or six years?</P>
    <P>Here is another industry that will strengthen our industrial fabric.  We hope that this effort will be followed by others.  It may be necessary&mdash;I am not saying that it will be in this case &mdash;for the initial cost of the article to bear a little increase compared with any similar article that may be imported from Britain or America.  If you want really cheap goods, you might go to Japan.  I repeat that this will help to strengthen our industrial fabric. The 350 people who will manufacture the articles will be consumers of our agricultural products.  Let us take a realistic view of the situation.  I was particularly anxious to counter the oft repeated fallacies uttered by people who pose as the friends of this country but who, by reason of their ill-informed criticisms, are doing the country no real good.</P>

      <P>D'ainneoin cuid de na rudaí adúradh faoin mBille seo, is léir cheana go bhfuil <Col N="169" /> Seanadóirí i gcoitinne an-tsásta leis an ráiteas atá tugtha ag an Aire dúinn anois beag i dtaobh an tionnscail atá i gceist.  Tá sé dóchasach go maith faoi agus de réir na bhfigiúir agus de réir an eolais a thug sé dúinn, ní dóchas gan údar é.</P>
      <P>Bunaíodh cuid mhaith tionnscal nua sa tír seo le cúig bliana déag anuas. Bhí daoine in aimhreas faoi chuid acu, aimhreas a bhí gan cúis réasúnta a bheith leis.  Ach maidir leis an gceann seo, tionnscal déantóireachta gléasraidh cian-éisteachta, tig linn a rá nach léim ins an dorchadas é.</P>
      <P>Tá trialacha á dhéanamh le tamall ar ghléasanna agus goireas cianéisteachta a dhéanamh agus de bharr na dtrialacha sin, tá curtha i n-iúil dúinn go réasúnta soiléir gur tionnscal é a fheileann don tír.  Muintir na hÉireann, tríd is tríd, is daoine anabalta iad.  Buadh na teicniúlachta, baineann sé le n-ár muintir chomh maith agus a bhaineas sé le muintir ar bith eile ach a bhfuighidís an seans. Ón eolas atá againn ar an margadh agus de bharr eolais eile, tá léirithe go dtí seo go bhfeileann an tionnscal seo agus tionscail eile mar í don tír.</P>
      <P>Ón méid adúradh mar gheall ar an bprionsabal atá i gceist, sé sin le rá, tionnscal a chosaint, ní dóigh liom gur tugadh dóthain Aire don taobh eile den scéal.  Tá sean-rá sa nGaeilge a deireas gur beag scéal nach bhfuil dhá innsint air, agus tá dhá innsint ar an scéal seo chomh maith le scéal ar bith eile.  Sílim nach gá aon argóint a dhéanamh an lá atá inniu ann i bhfabhar cosanta a thabhairt do thionnscal.  Sílim go bhfuil an cheist pléite agus socraithe go maith.  Bhí tráth ann agus cheap daoine nach raibh aon argóint fhóntach le fáil ach i bhfábhar saor-tradála.  Na Sasanaigh, bhíodar an-láidir ar an tuairim sin ar feadh i bhfad.  Ach má scrúdaítear polasaí Shasana le roinnt blianta tabharfaí faoi deara go bhfuil siad eirithe láidir go maith i bhfabhar caomhaointe tionnscal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ach tá argóint amháin ann i bhfábhar cosanta a thabhairt do thionscail agus níor cheart gan áird chúramach a thabhairt uirthi i gcónaí.  Ar thionscal mar an gceann atá i gceist againn a chur ar bun, gheobhaidh dream maith <Col N="170" /> daoine deis luachmhar saothair. B'fhéidir go bhféadfaí na hearraí a bheadh i gceist a cheannach taobh amuigh den tír ar luachanna is ísle ná a luach soláthair anseo sa mbaile.  Is beag an sólás do dhaoine a bheadh ábalta agus a bheadh sásta earraí áirithe a dhéanamh a rá leo nach dtiubharfaí an deis oibre sin dóibh toisc go mbeadh na hearraí a dhéanfaidís níos daoire ná d'fhéadfaí iad a cheannach ar an gcoigrích.  Cuimhnimis nach i gcónaí, is ionann an margadh is saoire agus an margadh is fearr.</P>
    <P>Thairis sin, dob í ceann de na rudaí is mó a chuir ríméad orm agus an tAire ag cainnt, go raibh sé sásta, ón eolas atá aige, go bhfeileann an tionnscail don tír.  Tá an mhuinín seo agam, má thugann na hoibrithe faoin obair go ciallmhar dícheallach; má thugann na daoine a bheas i bhfeighil an tionnscail an aire dó mar is chóir, agus cothram na féinne a thabhairt don tír mar is cóir, go bhféadfaí an tionnscail seo a mhéadú go rathúil in Éirinn agus ar ball, nach hamháin go mbeidh margadh na hÉireann acu agus é fairsing go maith, ach go bhféadfaí na hearraí a dhíol ar fud na margadh coigchríoch. Tá an tionscal seo ar bun go láidir i dtíortha eile, mar An Eilbheis&mdash; mar shompla&mdash;agus gléasanna cianéisteachta ag dul amach ón tír sin ar fud an domhain.  Níl aon bhuntáiste aicionta ag an tír sin thar mar tá againne.  Ón eolas atá agam ar oibrithe na hÉireann, ón eolas atá agam ar imeachta déantóirína hÉireann, níl fáth ar bith nach bhféadfaí an tionnscal a leathnú go mbeidh chómh tabhachtach i bhfus agus atá sé i dtíortha eile.</P>
    <P>Táim ar aon intinn leis na Seanadóirí adúirt go mba chóir go mbeimis réasúnta cinnte nach ndéanfaí éagóir ar an bpobal trí mheáchain mhí-chothrama a bhaint amach, nó gan mianach na n-earraí bheith go maith.  Ní bheinn féin i bhfábhar an sean-Choimisiún a bhí ar bun fadó le ceisteanna faoi chaomhaint tionnscal a réiteach.  Sílim go bhfuil a leithéid de chóras as dáta agus gan bhrí.  Sé mo thuairim&mdash;agus ní bhaineann sé leis an tionnscail nua seo amháin, ach baineann sé le gach tionnscal dá bhfuil curtha ar bun ins an tír&mdash;go mba cheart go méadófaí cumhachta Bhinse na bPraghsanna sa tslí go mbeadh sé d'údarás aige <Col N="171" /> imeachta gnótha ar bith sa tír a fhiosrú go mion i gcás ar bith ina bhfeictear go bhfuil imní ar an bpobal nach bhfuil siad ag fáil cothram na féinne, tré imeachta an ghnótha sin.  B'fhiú an chumhacht a bheith ag an mBinnse tuarascáil ar a gcuid fiosrúchán a fhoilsiú ionas go gcuirfí an pobal ar a suaimhneas.  Thuit rud nó dhó amach sa tír agus ba argóintí iad i bhfábhar a nmholta atá mé a dhéanamh.</P>
    <P>Ón eolas atá agam ar lucht déantóireachta sa tír níl call le imní ar bith i dtaobh a rí-fhurmhór.  Tá a gcuid gnóthaí á stiúradh go stuama, éifeachtach cneasta acu.  Tuilleann siad muinín a bheith againn astu agus tuilleann siad ár mbuíochas.</P>
    <P>Is maith liom an Bille a bheith ós ár gcómhair.  Sé, b'fhéidir, an chéad chomhartha agus gníomh cinnte eile go bhfuilimid ar tí tosaithe ath-uair ar an obair mhóir a bhí idir lámha againn go dtí 1939 nuair a tháinig an Cogadh Mór. Is comhartha é go bhfuilimid ar tí aththosú arís ins an tír seo ar thionscail agus déantóireacht a chur chun cinn, a neartú agus a leathnú.

    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to comment on the principles embodied in this measure.  Despite anything Senator Summerfield had to say on the matter, I think Senator Sir John Keane is to be congratulated on raising the issue which he put before the House.  It would be a queer House if that sort of thing were not done on every possible opportunity and I am sure the Minister would feel it was hardly worth while coming here unless there was to be an intelligent examination not only of the particular Bill, but of the principles embodied in it.  It is not necessary that we should all agree.  Discussion in the House would be very monotonous if that were so.  Senator Sir John Keane, or any of us who speak in the name of consumers, either here or elsewhere, is perfectly justified. The consumers in this country are an all-important section.  We are all consumers.  This Bill dealing with wireless sets and the possibilities of building up new industries here, gives <Col N="172" /> us an opportunity of stating our views about the value of radio sets in the country.  While Senator Lord Longford is not prepared to acquiesce in the point of view that the Danes are four times as civilised as we are simply because they have four times as many radio sets, it is true to say that the Danes are a very well-informed people. As producers, they are probably the best informed people in the world and it is a tribute to the knowledge of Danish farmers that they have risen above very considerable natural difficulties and have built themselves up to their present position as the foremost exporters of agricultural products in the world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Utilisation of radio in a country like Denmark is of incalculable value.  Our country is much bigger than Denmark and our population more scattered.  Our people have not the same opportunity for contact and discussion and the radio can be of inestimable value in providing educational facilities.  To the extent that you will raise the cost of commodities by the erection of new industries here, you are handicapping Irish consumers.  I do not take the view, of course, that simply because something is going to be dearer if produced here rather than purchased from an outside country we ought not to provide it for ourselves.  In a great many of these things, we have to pick and choose.  While there may be general assent to the point of view that whatever we can do for ourselves we should try to do and what we cannot do for ourselves we must purchase from others, it must definitely be understood, by Senator Summerfield and by everybody who stands up in this House as an industrialist or who purports to speak on their behalf, that consumers here cannot afford to pay any price for an Irish product merely because it is an Irish product.  It is to the Minister's credit that in a number of speeches recently he has pointed out that, if there are to be Irish industrialists here, directors of industry and people working in factories, they must put their best foot forward, must work hard and give good service to the community, they must increase their output and improve both in quantity and in quality.  If that be the aim of the <Col N="173" /> Irish industrialist, as I think it is the aim of the Minister now&mdash;though in his earlier years he may not have regarded it as of such major importance&mdash;and if there is a fair appreciation that that aim is essential to the future progress of Irish industry, there will be much more hope for Irish industry, as we will be making the right approach.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, I am afraid there are too many people here who regard Irish industry as a happy hunting ground where there are possibilities of exploitation.  You cannot blame a great many people amongst the farmers who are frequently very critical about the imposts they have to bear because new industries have been brought into being.  They see the costs rising from day to day.  It is easy to say that consumers are prepared and should be prepared to pay something more for the Irish article and that you cannot expect to have it manufactured here at the same price, as the number of consumers is small and we have not got a very large market.  That would be true in certain large-scale industries.  I take it we cannot have an Irish motor industry, as the market would not justify the capital expenditure, unless the skilled labour in Irish industry were prepared to work very much harder than the skilled labour in British and American industry and do even better work.  I do not know what would happen then, but I do know that, in the present circumstances, we must try to produce commodities for ourselves, amongst ourselves, for exchange between ourselves.  If some of those commodities can only be produced at a price very much higher than their world value, the pressure of that price on the consuming public will be very considerable.  It is all right for the people in the industry, who may be paid very good wages and may not have to work very hard.  As consumers, they are well able to buy, but we must think of the others, who may be in other industries not very well paid and who have to face these rising costs.  You can have social unrest arising out of a situation like that and none of us can look lightly on that.</P>
    <P>This policy is very difficult and complicated. It may be a desirable policy to pursue, but I agree with Senator <Col N="174" /> Sir John Keane that it must be pursued with caution and discrimination. As the Minister has been saying recently, Irish producers must give really good service or they will not hold their place; if they give good service, they will hold their place and we will all be proud of them and glad to encourage Irish industry.  But there is a great body of consumers here who have very little protection and all the time we must think of them.</P>
    <P>In this particular case, it should be the Minister's policy to get a radio into the great majority of the homes. It would be of inestimable value, from the cultural and educational standpoint and also it would make life in the poorer and more remote districts much more tolerable.  If the organisation of new industries is going to render that much more difficult, I do not think the Minister's policy in that regard would be justified.  Inasmuch as the House will give him support in this Bill, the responsibility and obligation is on him to see that the people who are going to come into new industries, on account of these opportunities, will give service to the community at least the equivalent of what manufacturers in another country would give if they were given the market which is being provided under this Bill for these people and which is being closed against those outside.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hawkins Mr. Hawkins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hawkins</NameTxt>
      <P>From listening to some of the speeches already contributed in this debate, one would be inclined to draw the conclusion&mdash;and I am afraid some Senators have drawn this conclusion&mdash;that the result of this Bill will be to increase the cost of wireless sets to the user or consumer. My understanding of the Minister's statement is that the result will be the exact opposite.  Those concessions which were already made under previous Acts and Orders were availed of to a great extent, not by the manufacturers or the consumers, but by those people engaged in the wholesale and retail business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has also been suggested that the purpose of the Bill is to find employment for some 300 persons.  That is not the truth.  I know that from my own personal experience.  A few <Col N="175" /> months ago I met some of the people interested in that business across the water.  This firm is coming over here to set up a new industry in the manufacture of wireless sets and other electrical equipment in the confidence that they will be able to cater for the needs of the people here and, in addition, build up a very extensive export trade.  That is one of the things we should encourage.</P>
    <P>A good deal has been said in the debate about Irish industrialists and one would feel that all those engaged in the building up of Irish industry have made fortunes.  I am sure every member of the Seanad has met people from time to time who have invested money in Irish industry, with the very opposite result.  This Bill is a good Bill and many of the statements against it have been made through being misinformed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamFearon" hpid="Professor Fearon Professor Fearon">
      <NameTxt>Professor Fearon</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a point which has not yet been made by any member of the House and which is, I think, of sufficient importance.  It is the difference between possession and use.  We assume that, because people possess a wireless set, as a great many do, they also use it.  That is not at all invariable.  In many cases, people have wireless sets in their houses in much the same way as they have fire extinguishers. They use them when they have some visitors whom they cannot otherwise entertain, or for use when something special happens.  I would have listened to the Minister with more confidence, if I heard that this Bill would increase the use of wireless sets and not merely the possession of them. I suppose there will be some small decrease in the cost and that may mean a greater number will be sold, but that is only part of the business.  You want more sets to be used and I feel that the way to get them used is to give us very much better programmes. I think the sale could be encouraged in many ways.  One thing I should like to have passed on to the proper authorities is this: could we not have a concession on the licence for Irish-assembled sets, just as we have on Irish-assembled cars?  I think the tax on wireless, which is partly a means of social entertainment and partly a <Col N="176" /> means of education, means putting a tax on our hearing.  If something could be done in that way, it would certainly brighten our New Year a bit.</P>
      <P>The other matter is whether it would be possible to divert a little more of the revenue to be obtained from this increase to the support of our own broadcasting station.  At the moment we are competing against many programmes from the other side which have almost reached a record low level of worthlessness.  If we are to build up a good Éire programme, we have a very fine opportunity now.  I understand it is possible to tell from the changes in the consumption of electricity how much listening-in is done. I know that in London, for example, they can tell that certain people are more popular than others.  I understand one of our own local comedians is very high up on the list of wattage consumption when he comes on.  I do not know whether the Minister has figures for the amount of listening-in done in this country.  I think that is really a thing we ought to arrange for. We want to have more ears used and more current consumed through sets rather than selling a few more.  A great many sets have collected as many cobwebs as have been collected by the programmes they have failed to circulate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TheodoreMoore" hpid="Mr. Kingsmill Moore Mr. Kingsmill Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kingsmill Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder whether the Minister in his reply could undertake the task of reconciling the different and irreconcilable views expressed by people in favour of this Bill.  So far as workmanship goes, the experience of the 18th and early 19th centuries has shown that the Irish craftsman certainly cannot be beaten anywhere in the world, and if craftsmanship is an issue in the production of any article, I personally would assume that we would start upon level terms.  Senator Summerfield, evidently feeling that some such thought might be in the minds of people and that there might be a corollary drawn that the money was not going to the craftsmen but to the distributors and the manufacturers, met it, in anticipation, by saying that we are a small country and a small market and therefore we have to produce things at a higher <Col N="177" /> price than elsewhere.  The answer to that was very conclusively made by Senator Hawkins, who pointed out that with our craftsmanship and with equal organisation we would not be a small market, because if we were able to produce as good an article, then the market would be infinite, in fact, that England being next door to us was an advantage and not a disadvantage, as Senator Summerfield seemed to think.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrederickSummerfield" hpid="Mr. Summerfield Mr. Summerfield">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Summerfield</NameTxt>
      <P>That depends on the article.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TheodoreMoore" hpid="Mr. Kingsmill Moore Mr. Kingsmill Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kingsmill Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I am assuming an article in which craftsmanship plays a considerable part.  I know perfectly well that where you have to use a heavy industry, we have not the facilities for so doing.  I am not taking any particular side in regard to these particular remarks.  They seem to be a little inconsistent. I am asking the Minister if he would think well of telling us the principle upon which he is being guided in the imposition of these tariffs.  The Minister, I imagine, would probably agree with me that in an ideal world the ideal system would be free trade. He would, however, point out that it is not an ideal world, that there are considerable numbers of recognised exceptions and that a natural exception is in operating the particular class of article we are now dealing with.  It is certainly no longer an infant industry.  It has been carried out for over 20 years. The exception which depends upon the assumption that you must protect an industry until it has found its feet, until it has been organised and has trained workmen does not apply in this case. There are other arguments for protection. It is unnecessary to go through them now.  Perhaps the Minister will give us a general indication, such as I think he was inclined to give comparatively recently outside the House, as to what are the basic principles which he is following in deciding what things are to be protected, to what extent they are to be protected, and subject to what limitations they are to be protected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Senator Sir John Keane misunderstood my remarks when introducing the Bill in one important respect.  It is not necessary <Col N="178" /> to have a licence to manufacture wireless sets here.  The tariff which is now in operation on wireless sets and component parts is, however, operated so as to permit of duty free importation of homogeneous parts and certain component parts by manufacturers who are manufacturing wireless sets in an approved degree.  The principle we are following in this regard has been applied already in the case of the motor car assembly industry with which Senator Summerfield is familiar. In that case also our desire was to encourage the importation of motor cars in a &ldquo;knocked down&rdquo; condition &mdash;to use the technical term which was in use&mdash;and their assembly here. Duties were imposed upon motor cars and upon assembled parts of motor cars; but any manufacturer who brought in a car in an approved degree of dis-assembly got the components at a much lower rate of duty than anyone who brought components in separately or dis-assembled in some other degree.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this particular case, the position is somewhat complicated by the fact that the duty upon wireless apparatus and parts was originally imposed as a revenue-raising duty, solely for the purpose of raising revenue, and it has always been so arranged as to yield some revenue, even though the protective effect of later changes may have reduced the total yield.  The system which has been devised is to maintain the duty upon sets and the component parts of sets and to give this right of duty-free importation to firms manufacturing sets in the approved degree and in respect of certain defined components imported by them for the manufacture of sets.  They cannot import parts for the purpose of trading in parts.  At the present stage of development of the industry, coils, transformers and loudspeakers are being manufactured here; whereas condensers, volume and tone controls, and switches are being imported already assembled as components for incorporation in sets manufactured here. Other technical parts are also brought in free of duty.  Cabinets and other parts of that type have also been manufactured here and can be manufactured for use in new sets or for replacement purposes.  The position in regard <Col N="179" /> to the repair and servicing trade is not much worse in consequence of these changes than it was previously.  I again ask the House to remember that, at all times, parts imported by that trade were subject to duty and, because that duty was for revenue purposes, it applied to all parts.  The change we have in mind now is designed to eliminate the revenue-raising aspect of the duty and, consequently, we have eliminated from its scope such items as valves, which are not made, and are not likely to be made here.</P>
    <P>The position of the repair and servicing trade is, therefore, that they will be able to get such components as valves free of duty for the first time. They may have to pay at a higher rate for certain parts or components which at present cannot be supplied from the existing factories, but it is contemplated that the existing factories will be, within a short time, able to supply replacement parts of home-manufacture to the trade for the types of sets they are producing.  To the extent that they are not producing these parts, the parts will be imported by the repair and servicing trade subject to the payment of duty.</P>
    <P>As regards old sets, sets of a type that are not produced here at all at present, the parts required for their repair and replacement will be subject to duty as they were heretofore but the duty will be changed.  The House should not assume that the parts of one set are not interchangeable with the parts of another.  So far as a number of these parts are concerned, such as switches, coils, condensers, etc., they can be incorporated in almost any type of set and are, not infrequently, of standard design.</P>
    <P>The extent to which it is possible to develop the industry and the employment given by the industry is, of course, problematical to some extent but I think we can step up the annual purchase of wireless sets considerably higher than the 40,000 pre-war average. I think it is almost certain that the current demand, which cannot be made fully effective because the supply is not there, would be  <Col N="180" /> considerably in excess of that number and it is probable, with the growth in the popularity of wireless broadcasting, the extension of the rural electrification scheme and the development of housing schemes, that the use of wireless receiving apparatus will increase and that the demand for such apparatus will expand.  On the basis, however, of the pre-war demand, it is obvious that we can more than double the present rate of output and more than double the employment given by the industry.  With that increase in production, there is no reason why the industry should not be as economic here as anywhere, because, provided that the production is not dispersed between too many separate and competing firms, there will be sufficient demand for the products of each to make full-scale economical production possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir John Keane Sir John Keane">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to interrupt the Minister, but in his speech in the Dáil he used the term: &ldquo;entirely economic&rdquo;.  Could he enlighten us as to what that implies?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I was using that term to imply no disadvantage arising out of the inability of the persons engaged in the industry fully to employ the capital equipment they must use in connection with it.  As regards many of the speeches made in the course of the debate, it is, I think, symptomatic of our comparative under-development in political experience that any proposal of this kind usually leads to a discussion upon the fundamentals of economic policy.  In other countries that would not happen because most of these fundamental issues of policy have been already debated to a conclusion or have been settled by experience over a long time.  Here we are still at the stage of working out the main lines on which we are to try to progress and consequently particular propositions, relating to details of our industrial organisation, still lead to these debates on fundamental policy.  I do not want to open a wider discussion than I think is necessary on this Bill.  I would not at all agree that it is sound principle to require that manufacturers in this country should be able to produce and sell at or about the lowest price at <Col N="181" /> which we can buy corresponding products anywhere.  I think that would be a completely false standard to establish.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, I think it is not unreasonable to require that they should produce and sell here at or about prices at which corresponding goods can be sold in countries with a somewhat similar social structure.  I have for practical purposes applied in particular cases the selling price for goods in Great Britain as a test by which to judge the efficiency of production here, at least to this extent&mdash; to require our manufacturers to show cause why it is necessary for them to exceed that price and at the same time expect to get protection from the community.  There will be many cases where it is desirable to maintain some particular form of industrial activity by protection even if there are good reasons why it is not possible to have costs as low as in Great Britain or any other corresponding country, but in such cases we should be able to show to the Dáil and to the Seanad and to the public who are interested, why the good reason, whatever it may be, overweighs the consideration of price which would otherwise be a good argument for declining protection or reducing the protection at present in force.  I should like, however, Senators to get out of their minds that Irish manufacturers are now, and must necessarily in future, be compelled always to produce at prices higher than those prevailing elsewhere.</P>

      <P>Prices higher.  At the present a very large number of our manufacturers are producing and selling at prices which are substantially lower than the prices prevailing in Great Britain and other parts of the world.  That is not altogether due to abnormal circumstances which will pass after a short period.  It is due to the fact that they have passed beyond the early stages of development in which the gaining of experience by executives, the training of workers and other special factors necessarily affected the cost of production here.  Our industries have, in consequence of their wartime <Col N="182" /> experience, developed in efficiency much more rapidly than they might have if the war had not occurred.  The existing concerns have also the substantial advantage of having equipped themselves with plant and machinery at a total capital cost very much below what it would now be necessary to incur to establish an equivalent productive capacity.  It is therefore satisfactory to know that over a wide range of goods&mdash;motor tyres, leather, containers and many other commodities of that kind&mdash;the general level of prices here is substantially below the world level and is likely to remain so.  Recently, in the case of leather, sanction was given for the purchase of supplies abroad to supplement home production and it was found that they could only be imported at a price which was 250 per cent. above the home prices.</P>

      <P>I fully agree with the views expressed by Senators, that it is desirable that wireless sets should be as cheap as possible and, therefore, available to the largest number of families.  I want to make quite clear that there is no likelihood that removal of this duty would mean that wireless sets would be available to us at present more cheaply than we can produce them ourselves.  As I mentioned, we are producing sets at the rate of 250,000 per year.  It is very improbable that we could import them at that rate even if there were no duty in force.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry.  I was going to add that the only source of supply that might be open to us would require very high prices&mdash;much higher prices than those ordinarily prevailing in Great Britain or here.  The firms now in production here, when they shall have got over this intermediate period and can get supplies of materials sufficient to occupy their machinery fully, can continue to produce at, at least, the British level of prices.  Any new firm that may come into the industry fully understands that it will be required to do so if it is to get the facilities of free import of parts and a continuation of the protection which the Bill affords.  It is, I think, much to be desired that the number of wireless sets in use should increase but, if there is to be an expansion in the use of wireless sets by reason of their cheapness, it would require the adoption of some such scheme as was, I think, carried out in the dictatorial countries prior to the war.  Very cheap sets were there distributed at the Government expense, the dictators being desirous of being heard when they spoke.  Whether it is necessary to do anything in that line here is another matter.  Whether we do or do not subsidise the price of wireless sets to certain classes of the community, we can produce all that they will require. I have considerable sympathy with the view expressed by Senator Fearon, that the licence tax on wireless sets should be abolished.  I doubt, however, that the Minister for Finance would agree to that.  It is, again, necessary to remember the history of wireless broadcasting here.  When the Government of the day decided that a broadcasting station was to be established in 1926, they decided also that it would cost them nothing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The entire capital cost of construction of the station, plus the annual cost of operating it, was to be defrayed by a licence tax upon sets and a customs duty on imported apparatus. They departed from that policy some time subsequently and appropriated the revenue from the customs tax for Exchequer purposes.  But there is still in existence the idea that the broadcasting service should not be a <Col N="184" /> general charge on the revenue but should, to some extent, pay for itself. It does, in fact, pay for itself at present to the extent that the revenue from the tax upon sets covers the annual cost of the broadcasting service &mdash;or almost covers it.  It would not necessarily be an improvement, from the point of view of the general body of the public, if the revenue from the tax upon sets were removed and a tax imposed upon something else to make good the revenue loss.  On the other hand, to the extent that the broadcasting service represents not so much an educational facility as a recreational facility of a particularly desirable kind, I think that it is good policy, generally, to encourage the use of wireless receiving apparatus and to make it as cheap as possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir John Keane Sir John Keane">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>A point arises, on Section 1, out of the statement which we have just heard from the Minister. I understood him to say that, in the matter of repairs, a user of wireless apparatus will be in no worse position than he was&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  Parts will still be subject to duty and the rate of duty is changed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir John Keane Sir John Keane">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>The rate of duty is increased.  I have to repeat that we have now the admission that repairs will cost the users of old sets&mdash;and those will be mainly the buyers of parts for repairs&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Not necessarily.  They will be affected more to the extent that the repairs involve the importation of parts for replacement but 99.9 per cent. of the repairs carried out to wireless sets are not of that character.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir John Keane Sir John Keane">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>I see the Minister's <Col N="185" /> point but I am not prepared fully to accept it.  The Minister's case is conditioned by what the repairers will charge for the substituted parts.  If I have an old set and if the part required is not made in the country, I shall have to pay substantially more for the part required.  If the part is made in the country, I shall not necessarily get the repair done more cheaply.  I shall be in the hands of the manufacturer.  He may make the article available at less than the amount charged for the imported article or he may not.  The temptation to the manufacturer will be to take advantage of the duty.  I fully expect to see manufacturers who are making parts put up the price practically to the price of the imported part, which includes a high duty.  I think that repairs will cost owners of old sets substantially more than was the case in the past.</P>
      <P>Another Committee point arises.  The Minister is apparently satisfied, by analogy with the motor trade and by his knowledge otherwise, that there is no danger of parts imported duty free by assemblers or manufacturers finding their way into the repair market There are, in fact, two repair markets. There are the repairs done by the importing manufacturer, who gets the parts in duty free, and the repairs done by the dealer, who has to pay duty on the parts.  If the Minister says that the machinery is water-tight, well and good, but, without a host of inspectors, I see great difficulty in ensuring that it will be watertight.  I never knew that the motor and wireless trades had to keep elaborate returns such as would be required in the case of those dealing with rationed goods&mdash;returns which would enable an inspector to satisfy himself that there was no illicit diversion of parts which had been imported duty free.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is not quite similar because many of the un-assembled parts of motor cars are duty free now.  The duty was removed from those parts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir John Keane Sir John Keane">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>Then Senator Summerfield's argument does not apply, because many parts in the motor trade are duty free, both to the assembler and the repairer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="186" />
    <Speaker pid="FrederickSummerfield" hpid="Mr. Summerfield Mr. Summerfield">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Summerfield</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir John Keane Sir John Keane">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not at all satisfied that that is so.  With all due respect to the Senator, he has full knowledge of the motor trade but I suggest that he has not got equal knowledge of the wireless trade, and I should like to be satisfied as to the machinery for ensuring that there is no illicit diversion of imported parts to repairers.  I can see great difficulty in getting a system which is water-tight without a very considerable number of inspectors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>A very high proportion of the repairs, so called, carried out to wireless sets consists of mending broken connections and other operations of that kind and the replacement of valves.  The remission of the duty on valves will have the effect of cheapening that form of repair, and most of the components imported as components for incorporation in sets by assemblers rarely have to be replaced.  They are in fact not liable to break down, and, when they do, it is generally only a matter of repairing a connection or some operation of that nature.  I could not outline now the detailed arrangements which may be made by the Revenue Commissioners to ensure that there is no evasion of the duty in the manner the Senator fears may occur, but I think we can be sure that they will take effective steps to see that the concession which may be given under this Bill to manufacturers will not be abused.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrederickSummerfield" hpid="Mr. Summerfield Mr. Summerfield">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Summerfield</NameTxt>
      <P>To allay suspicion and as the point has been raised, I must emphasise that the machinery in so far as the motor trade is concerned, does not permit of any illicit use of duty-free parts.  The manufacturer or assembler in this case has no advantage over the retailer who is purely a retailer.  I say that with full responsibility and it is easily proved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not suggesting that there is anything wrong in the motor trade.  I am merely trying to find out the position in the wireless trade.  I should also like some information as to the position of those people who are licensed transmitters.  I am <Col N="187" /> told that these amateurs, people interested in special work in wireless telegraphy, have rather special equipment which is never likely to be made in the course of the manufacture of ordinary receiving sets.  All the parts of this special equipment will now have to bear this duty of 75 per cent.  Does the Minister think that is just?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir John Keane Sir John Keane">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>I am speaking without technical knowledge and am therefore rather at a disadvantage, but I am informed that there are a number of parts used in this short-wave transmission which are never likely to be made in this country, as the demand is so small.  Yet these people are to pay a vastly increased price for these parts now and I am in fact told that some of them will not be able to continue in business, so to speak, and that it will not be worth while taking out a licence at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order gives considerable discretion to the Revenue Commissioners.  They are given power to remit the duty in the case of apparatus imported for the amelioration of the lot of blind persons, for the use of blind persons, for imparting or receiving instruction in wireless telegraphy in a school or college or for use for some purpose other than as a component part or accessory of wireless telegraphy apparatus.  These are the purposes for which the Revenue Commissioners may, at their own discretion, remit the duty and I think that the cases in which completely assembled transmitting apparatus is imported, other than by schools and colleges or for the purpose of receiving or imparting instruction, would not be very many.  Most of these sets are in fact constructed by the people using them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir John Keane Sir John Keane">

      <P>I cannot allow a certain statement on general economic policy just made by the Minister to remain unchallenged because it is really a fundamental matter.  The Minister said that some of the speeches, and, no doubt, mine amongst them, showed political immaturity and showed that we had not grasped what he suggests is now axiomatic&mdash;that his economic policy is the last word.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnKeaneBart" hpid="Sir John Keane Sir John Keane">
      <NameTxt>Sir John Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very glad to hear that I am exempt, but the statement <Col N="189" /> was made all the same.  Surely it is open to great question.  It is not my intention to go into the wide range of our economic policy which has driven our price level 100 points higher than the level in the neighbouring country.  I know there are a lot of explanations of it, but that is the fact, and it has created a very considerable alarm amongst people whom we do not hear very much.  I hear them in queues, and in the buses.  I do not suppose the Minister travels in buses, but one hears quite a lot in them.  I hear every day the complaints of the harassed <i>rentiers</i> and only the other day my daughter-in-law came in and showed me an article and said: &ldquo;What do you think I had to pay for that?&rdquo;  It is going on all over the place and everybody knows it and Senator Summerfield knows it as well as I do.</P>
      <P>This policy, whether right or wrong, is one which has to be considered. Free trade principles are not dead, and one has only to look at international affairs to see that the whole economic future is tending towards wider markets for trade.  I would not accept for a moment that the policy which the Minister has outlined for this country is the last word.  We have a long way to go before that can be established as a safe thing for the plain people of this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I object to this measure because I have had no indication from the Minister as to what practical steps are being taken to safeguard the ordinary wireless user against excessive prices. I am frankly suspicious, in the case of a small market, of a few manufacturers getting together and fixing their prices.  I think that is a grave danger in our economy&mdash;in a small country such as this.  I am an unrepentant capitalist where the capitalist safeguards are of the established form, namely, where you have plenty of goods, and where there is competition amongst producers.  There is little or no competition at present, and there is unlikely to be competition in the case of a small market.  In such a market, you are unlikely to have adequate protection for the public, <Col N="190" /> and for that reason I emphatically challenge the Minister's statement that his policy is the last word in political wisdom.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

      <P>Like the Senator, I do not wish to start a discussion on this now.  But I do want to say with regard to people travelling on buses, to whom he referred, that any prices they may now be complaining of are most unlikely to be influenced by customs duties because, with very few exceptions, all customs duties have been suspended.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (1), paragraph (c), after the word &ldquo;given&rdquo; in line 27, to insert the following words: &ldquo;to an officer of statistics in pursuance of a requisition lawfully made under the Principal Act&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Due to circumstances which I did not anticipate and could not have avoided, I was unable to be present for the Second Reading of this Bill, but I have very carefully considered the views which were expressed in that Second Reading debate.  The amendment which I have moved, as well as the other amendments which appear on the Order Paper in my name, are really designed to bring into harmony two completely different views which were expressed by different members of the House and by the Minister.  The Minister said that this was a very simple and very harmless Bill, by which I imagine he meant &ldquo;So far as I am concerned, I mean it to be a very simple and very harmless Bill&rdquo;.  On the other hand, many Senators regarded it as an exceedingly dangerous Bill, by which they meant that if a Minister, other than the present one, were to administer it within the scope which the Bill itself allows, it was quite definitely fraught with a great amount of peril.  Now, it appears to me that both those views were correct. The Bill as it stands, without <Col N="191" /> these amendments, is frankly exceedingly dangerous, and by itself could open the way to a police State.  I do not think it is meant to do that.  The Bill would enable information obtained by any means and by any person in the Government service to be circulated, with details as to the person to whom it referred, to all branches of the Government service, and as it stands, if it was not operated with very great discretion, the Bill would be one of the most dangerous that has ever come before the House.</P>
    <P>Now, that was one point of view.  I equally accept it that the Minister did not see that and did not intend it. Well, now, how are we to reconcile the Minister's innocent lamb with his opponents' dangerous lion?  I believe you can do it by accepting this amendment, and thereby make this into a kind of March Bill which comes in like a lion and goes out like a lamb.  I propose to endeavour to show the House that not one of these amendments will cripple the Minister's activities in a single respect.  If the Minister desires that this Bill should be used as an innocent lamb, he should be able to accept all these amendments because they give him all the powers which he claims that he desires, and which he claims are necessary under the Bill. But, if the Minister does not accept them, not necessarily in the form in which I have submitted them but in principle, then I will be suspicious, not of the Minister's <i>bona fides</i> which I have never questioned but of some people in the background.</P>
    <P>The first amendment, to which I am speaking, is really a prelude to most of my other amendments.  This first amendment probably only puts into the Bill something which, by an oversight, was left out.  By the original Statistics Act of 1926 there were three methods by which information could be obtained for the purpose of investigating general drifts, and on the various subjects for which statistics were to be collected.  First of all, it provided that a form or schedule should be sent to individuals to be filled up.  Of course, once the form was filled up the individual simply became a cipher and would thereafter be represented by a number. <Col N="192" /> The second way in which information could be obtained was by giving leave to an officer of statistics to inspect certain records; and the third way was by giving leave to an officer of statistics to make certain lawful inquiries.  If Senators will look at sub-section (1) of Section 2 of this Bill they will find that it provides that the expression &ldquo;statistical information&rdquo; comprises:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(a)  the contents or any part of the contents of any individual schedule, form or other document filled in or otherwise completed by any person in pursuance of a requisition made under the Principal act.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was form No. 1 in the Principal Act.  If Senators will refer to the Principal Act they will find that provision in sub-section (1), Section 7, Paragraph (b) of sub-section (1) of Section 2 of this Bill goes on to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(b)  the contents or any part of the contents of any record or document (not being a record or document open to public inspection) which was inspected or of which a copy was taken or obtained by an officer of statistics in exercise of any power in that behalf conferred on him by the Principal Act.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That corresponds to Section 9 of the Principal Act.  Now, there is not any extension of the Principal Act in either of these two sub-sections, but if Senators will look at paragraph (c) of sub-section (1) of Section 2 of this Bill, at which this amendment is aimed&mdash;&ldquo;any verbal information or answer given relating to any individual person, business or concern&rdquo;&mdash;they will see that the power proposed to be taken under it is not to be restrained in the way in which it was in the Principal Act.  That applies to any question which might be asked in the street by a policeman or other person.  There is no limit as to the type of person who might ask the question, and no limit as to the type of question to be asked.  There is no limit requiring that the question should be lawfully asked.  If one looks at the corresponding provision in the Principal Act, I feel quite certain it will be admitted that the insertion which the amendment proposes to make was <Col N="193" /> really only left out by an oversight.  As Senators will see, all that the amendment proposes is, that paragraph (c), as amended, should read:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Any verbal information or answer given to an officer of statistics in pursuance of a requisition lawfully made under the Principal Act....&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I seek, first of all, to confine this sub-section (c) to information given to an officer of statistics.  I seek to confine it to cases where that information is given in answer to a lawful requisition, instead of applying it to every question asked by Tom, Dick or Harry of Séan or Michéal.  In the original Act, you will find in Section 7 (2), that the powers are as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Every person who is lawfully required by an officer of statistics to give or furnish to such officer any written or verbal information or to answer any question asked of him by such officer shall to the best of his knowledge, ability or belief... give or furnish information or answer such question....&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If he fails to do so, he shall be guilty of an offence.  It is confined to a question asked by an officer of statistics, who is a civil servant employed on statistical work; he may sometimes be a member of the Gárda Síochána if he is collecting census forms.  Secondly, you will notice that the question has to be one &ldquo;lawfully&rdquo; required.  That takes you back to the definition of &ldquo;lawfully&rdquo; in the earlier part of the Act.  &ldquo;Lawfully&rdquo;, when used in relation to an officer of statistics, means &ldquo;under and in accordance with this Act and in the proper course and for the purpose of his duties and within his authority as such officer.&rdquo;  So, under this Act of 1926, all you could be required to do was to answer a question put to you by a proper person, namely, an officer of statistics, when it was put under and in accordance with the Act in the proper course of his duties and for the purpose of his duties and within his authority.  That is a very reasonable proposition, especially as the person can be required to give his authority for asking the question.  The whole purpose of the Act was not to delve into the private concerns of any individual, but to <Col N="194" /> collect statistics whereby big trends could be observed.</P>
    <P>I ask that the Seanad should consider, and the Minister should deal very specifically with, the question as to why statistical information is now not being confined to information given to a person concerned with statistics&mdash;a statistics officer&mdash;and why it is not to be confined to information given in answer to a lawful question, that is, one properly asked.  Why should it be extended to any question asked of any person at any time, especially when, if you go to the next section, you find that information illegally asked by an illegal person for questionable purposes can, by the operation of that next section, be broadcast to every Government Department, to the Commissioner of Public Works in Ireland and the Land Commission?  That would be the effect if it is left alone.  I rather think this has been an omission and that the amendment I suggest, either in the words in which I submit it, or in such other words as the Parliamentary draftsman may prefer, is one which this House should insist on being put in, because otherwise you are instituting and legalising a system of unlicensed personal inquiry, with a process whereby, in the hands of a Minister less scrupulous than the Minister before us, the result of that inquiry could be broadcast to all persons in the State.</P>

      <P>I think the Senator has completely misinterpreted the Bill. The Bill gives no additional powers to procure statistical information.  Whatever powers are conferred under the Act of 1926, remain unaltered.  This Bill does not alter them.  The 1926 Act gives power to publish statistical information furnished in accordance with the provisions of that Act with the consent of the person who gives the information.  We have power to publish information with consent.  The only change the Senator's amendments would make would be to enable us to assume consent if we did not get a reply to our letter within 14 days.</P>

      <P>So far as the collection of information is concerned, our powers are not altered by the Bill.  So far as the publication of information with the consent of the persons concerned goes, it would not be necessary to introduce this Bill because we have that power under the 1926 Act.  The sole purpose of this Bill is to enable disclosure, without the consent of the person giving the information, of statistical knowledge of a specified character, specified in the direction signed by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, to persons who are officers of public authorities for purposes connected with the discharge of their duties.  The first amendment, therefore, is not necessary, because the definition of statistical information contained there is one for the purpose of that section.  It relates to statistical information procured under the 1926 Act in accordance with the powers conferred under that Act.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a definition of statistical information for the purpose of this section.  If a person gives information otherwise than in accordance with the Act of 1926, then there is no secrecy about it at all.  It is because the information cannot be disclosed without the consent of the person, or unless to an officer of statistics, that this additional provision is being made to permit of its disclosure in the circumstances set out there when the Minister gives a direction and specifies the persons to whom the information is to be disclosed&mdash;to officers of the State requiring it for some approved purpose in connection with the performance of their duties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The real effect of the Bill, therefore, is merely to extend the class of persons who might be described as officers of statistics, who are employed in the Department of Industry and Commerce in connection with statistical work.  It is a very loose definition in the original Act, because it is the Minister who requires the information, collects it, compiles and publishes it, and it is the persons he uses in connection with these duties who are officers of statistics. As the law stands, that information cannot be disclosed, even under <Col N="196" /> the seal of secrecy, to another officer of the Department who might require it in connection with his official duties and it cannot be disclosed to him in future unless the Minister gives a direction specifying the officer to whom it is to be disclosed and the nature of the information to be disclosed.  That specified person will be under the same conditions of secrecy as an officer of statistics is at present.</P>
    <P>I think the Senator's three amendments are based on a misunderstanding of the Bill.  It is not necessary to put in those words here.  This relates only to information collected under the 1926 Act.  The powers are not altered. That Act gives power to publish information, with consent.  The purpose of this Bill is to permit that information to be disclosed to specified persons, without consent.</P>

      <P>I do not want to be at cross-purposes with the Minister, but I cannot agree with him.  I did not deal with my other amendments when I was proposing this one. The Minister seeks power, if necessary, to distribute what he calls statistical information, definite statistical information, in a way which makes it very much wider than anything in the original Act permits.  He has defined statistical information, in Section 2 (1) (c), as any question asked or any answer given by anybody anywhere, at any time.</P>

      <P>As the Senator knows, there is no secrecy about that information unless it is information procured under the powers of the 1926 Act.  If I ask a person a question and he gives me the information, there is no barrier to my passing the information on to anyone else.  If I say: &ldquo;As Minister for Industry and Commerce under the authority conferred on me by the Act of 1926, I require you to give me this information&rdquo;, then the obligation of secrecy arises.  It is only where the secrecy rule applies that it is necessary to have this amending legislation to enable the information to be passed on to other persons.</P>

You can do that under the Principal Act in certain circumstances and for certain purposes and there was a provision preventing disclosure.  Now you so arrange those circumstances, by being dressed in the appearance of authority, that a person who had no real responsibility could ask questions of an individual, which that person would imagine were being treated as confidential, though he is not authorised to do so by the Principal Act.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kingsmill Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>No, but in fact you can do that.  This Bill treats that as being statistical information and says that you can circulate it broadcast. The Minister is right that the amendments hang together.  I want first of all to make quite certain that the expression &ldquo;statistical information&rdquo; is used as meaning the same class of information obtained in the same type of way as was in the Principal Act.  Having got information of that type, which you are entitled to get, because it is given to a regular person in pursuance of a regular purpose, I have no objection to that being circulated to the proper quarters, if an intimation is given to the person, either at the time when he answers the question or by some subsequent notice, and he does not dissent from it.  But let me give an example of the kind of thing that might happen: Several people in this House have probably <Col N="198" /> been required in the course of the past years to fill in a form indicating how many salmon or sea trout they caught in the year, the weights and the prices they got for them and everybody who had done so would be only too pleased to furnish any information which would show the general passage of fish up and down the rivers, the general trend of a good season or a bad season.  By the powers that are given here, when the information has been docketed for that reasonable purpose&mdash;I am giving what is admittedly a rather extravagant example to make things clear&mdash;it could then be sent on to the Minister for Local Government to check up on fishery rates and, quite conceivably, if one had sold some of one's fish there could be a further investigation as to whether one was carrying on a business of selling fish which would render one liable to make a special return for income-tax.  Of course, nobody ever yet has ever made a profit out of fishing but I am giving that as an example of the sort of way in which the return could be circulated.</P>
      <P>If the Minister is merely anxious to avoid duplication of returns, as he suggested, there is no possible reason why he should not have a little slip printed: &ldquo;The information furnished by you on form so-and-so is required for transmission to such and such a Department.  If you have no objection, this will be done and if you do not reply within 10 days it will be assumed that you have given your consent&rdquo;.  That will avoid all the duplication and all the irritation that the Minister suggests.  On the other hand, if the man who gave that information in good faith, assuming it was given for a certain purpose only, does not desire it to be utilised for an alien purpose, he can prevent it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us take the case of a person filling up the census form.  He fills up a number of forms and, as soon as he fills them up, he becomes not an individual, but a Hollerith card.  All his information is indicated by punches in a long piece of cardboard. For one purpose he may belong to the class of people in Tipperary, for another purpose to the class of unmarried people, for a third purpose <Col N="199" /> to the class of people with three children.  He no longer is an individual, he is merely of interest to the Statistics Branch as a member of one class or another.  Anybody will give that information and will give it willingly for the sake of helping the State to find out things.  Supposing he knew that that could be formed the basis of an investigation as to whether one of his children was or was not legitimate, supposing, instead of being merely a class of a person with children, he, John Jones, was liable to have that individual piece of information with his name tacked on it circulated to the Guards or to any other person, would he not have a right to object? Supposing a woman has filled up her age with a slight allowance of three years in her favour, as is not unusual in a woman, is she because she had done that in the census form, when she comes to apply for an old age pension to be confronted, her own details having been sent from one place to another, with a statement that she is not the age she claims to be?  Admittedly, she can probably get a birth certificate, but she would have to go to that trouble.</P>
    <P>The Bill, if left in the present form, will allow any information given in pursuance of a legitimate request for a limited purpose to be used in a way which the person who gives it cannot anticipate and which might be exceedingly undesirable.  Following the Minister's example, I am speaking now to the second of these amendments. If, first of all, you secure that the information which is classed as statistical information and which the Minister has a right to broadcast, is only of the type which is required by the original Act and if, secondly, you make it certain that it shall not be distributed with the name of the person to whom it applies unless with his consent, you have taken all the objectionable matter out of this Bill. Can the Minister say as to how that appears to him in the innocent purpose for which he introduced the Bill, namely, that he is anxious that there should not be duplication of statistics? I am anxious that a person who gives <Col N="200" /> statistics for one purpose should not have them used against him for another.</P>
    <P>The Minister has not indicated why he objects to circulating a short notice to a person that, if he does not object, the information is going to be passed on.  If he will meet me on that point, it is equally necessary that that should only apply to information which was correctly taken in the first place.  I have substantially spoken to the second amendment now and I think there is only one amendment before the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TheodoreMoore" hpid="Mr. Kingsmill Moore Mr. Kingsmill Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kingsmill Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>Even if the Chair will put them, separately, it will be just as simple, if I may do it, to deal with some other matters now.  The Minister said this was not infringing very much what was in the original Act. The original Act had three sections of protection other than the ones I have referred to.  There was, first of all, Section 13, which provided that the individual information was not to be shown except to an officer of statistics concerned therewith, in the course of his duty as such officer, that is to say, it was not to be shown to anybody who was interested in the individual but only a person who would be interested in the numerical result, and that no report, abstract or summary was to contain any particulars so as to allow the information to be identified with any particular person.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again, the person, once he had filled up the form, was merely to become a number&mdash;and there were similar provisions in regard to documents.  It then went on, in Section 14, to provide that an officer of statistics, while he might disclose the information in his hands to another officer of statistics who was concerned with the matter in hand in the course of his duties, might not disclose it to anyone else.  Naturally, one person taking a census may have to find out how many Gaelic speakers there are in Tipperary and may then hand over that form to another officer, to find out how many bachelors there are in Dun Laoghaire; but it can only be handed on from one <Col N="201" /> officer to another dealing with statistical information.  There was, finally, in Section 15 the penalty for abuse of the office by an officer, which is substantially reproduced in the penalties in this Bill.</P>
    <P>All through the earlier Act, there was a provision to ensure that the person who gave the information would be safeguarded and would get an inkling of the general lines for which he was giving it&mdash;namely, to use the words of the Act, for providing any information &ldquo;which is necessary for the collection, compilation or interpretation of numbers relating to any matter in respect of which statistics can be collected under this Act.&rdquo;  His identity was to be preserved: as far as it concerned him, he was to be anonymous.  As far as possible, in giving information helping statisticians to find out what they wanted, he was at their service, but outside that he was given anonymity and the statistics were limited as regards the persons who could see them, and the preservation of the form of the records was such that no one could trace it back.</P>
    <P>In this Bill that is all gone.  The information can be related to an individual, it can be given to people who are not officers of statistics, or it can be published in a form in which it is recognisable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It cannot be published at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TheodoreMoore" hpid="Mr. Kingsmill Moore Mr. Kingsmill Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kingsmill Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>It can be communicated to a committee.  It is a legal use of the word &ldquo;published&rdquo;, which is correct legally but perhaps incorrect in the ordinary sense.  It can be communicated in a form in which it is no longer anonymous.  I can conceive that these powers are useful&mdash;but for what purposes are they useful?  Why should one Department want to investigate, not the trend of commerce or the trend of population or anything like that, but the details affecting an individual man or an individual firm&mdash;and that without his consent?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It may be that statistics furnished for one purpose may be useful for another purpose.  In that case, the consent would be as willingly given as were the statistics originally furnished. <Col N="202" /> But it may not be that.  If this Bill is left alone, statistics which are furnished for trade could be used by other Departments for entirely different purposes. They could be used for police purposes.  It may be very desirable that they should be used for police purposes, but let it come out into the open. There is no limit to the extent of publication or the abolition of anonymity which is allowed by this Bill&mdash;except the person who for the time being happens to be holding the position of the Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>
    <P>If members of this House were to imagine this identical Bill being introduced in Germany or in Russia, they would see the danger.  The only reason why Senators do not realise the danger is that we happen to know the present Minister and we trust him.  But if you were to imagine that it was in an entirely different country and that a Minister was to have power to reveal the details, given by any individual on a specific subject, to the Gestapo or to the Ogpu or any other secret service police, you would see the danger.  That power is there in the Bill.  It is said that it is not intended to be used like that.  The Minister has told us the Bill is a lamb.  Surely the power should not be left there, if we can safeguard it in a suitable way?  The Minister has not suggested any real difficulty which would be involved in confining it to information which has been obtained in a proper manner and in ensuring that the consent of the person would be obtained before information, given by him or collected from him for a specific purpose, is used for an entirely different one.  If there were any elaborate form necessary, I could understand the Minister resisting that.</P>
    <P>If the Minister is going to resist the form of this amendment, I am afraid, for the first time, it does arouse suspicions in my mind that there is some intention of transferring information from one Department to another, when the Department and the Minister would know perfectly well that the person who had given it would dislike intensely the information being passed on in that way.  If we are going to do this, let us at least put on the face of every kind of schedule which is sent round, a statement in red letters: <Col N="203" />&ldquo;The information which you are providing by filling this up may be circulated, with your name attached to it, to every Government Department, including the Land Commission and the Board of Works&rdquo;.  That at least will give people notice of it.  If that is not done, surely we are trading on the good faith and credulousness of persons who hand in statistics for one purpose and then find them used for another?</P>
    <P>Nor do I think that, in pressing this matter&mdash;and I am aware that I am pressing the amendment&mdash;I am meeting with a danger which is entirely unreal, even at the present moment.  Official inquiries and official secrecy have gone a remarkable length.  In a Department &mdash;which is not the Minister's&mdash;quite recently, in a case which is still a matter of legal conflict, a certain firm in Dublin was charged a sum of money in respect of customs and politely queried as to whether they were charged the right sum.  They paid the sum which they were charged and they exercised their rights then by claiming back from the officer who had charged them that sum which they said was overpayment. The officer proceeded to justify his charge under two Orders which had been issued to him by his superiors. So far, there is nothing in the least objectionable.  There was a general question at issue, but when the firm asked the officer to produce the text of the Order, they were met with a claim of State privilege.  A Customs duty is being exacted under an Order which the officer claimed to keep secret and would not show to the person from whom he was taking the money.</P>
    <P>So much for undue secrecy.  And what about all these questions now being asked when any person is renewing his passport&mdash;as to whether the consent of the other spouse is forthcoming?  That is an nice way of wrecking homes and encouraging jealousy and encouraging a spouse who happens to be of a domineering nature.  In these cases, we find a citizen can be taxed and his money taken under an Order which will not be revealed, on the claim of State privilege and a citizen cannot be allowed to exercise his rights of coming and going without answering impertinent <Col N="204" /> questions.  Surely I am within my rights in looking upon the provisions of this Bill as extremely dangerous, if they do, as I tell you they do, allow information to be collected, apparently, for one purpose and by one Department and circulate it to every Department with the name of the person to whom it applies.  I would very strongly press upon the House that, if they accept the amendments which are before them, the Minister will not be crippled in one iota in his legitimate use of this Bill; but, at the same time, they will ensure that matters which may be very private indeed, which may be communicated in an access of good faith in order to help the Government in arriving at certain statistics, shall not find their way into hands in which they will be deterimental to the person who has furnished them.  The Minister will not be able to consider every individual case.  We all know the Minister's quickness of mind, we all know his reasonableness, and we all know his power of rapid decision. But the Minister, in fact, is not going to be the person who is to decide on every matter like this.  It will be done by anonymous people, important people, no doubt, in different sections of the Ministry.  How are we to be certain that they will not make a mistake?  How are we to be certain that this power may not be abused?  I ask that the Seanad should take their stand firmly on this: that a man should not be asked to give information for a limited purpose and find it is being circulated against him, with his name attached to it, for a purpose which never crossed his mind when he was giving it.</P>

      <P>May I on the first amendment and on Section 2 (1) ask this question?  Senator Kingsmill Moore desires to amend paragraph (c). Paragraph (c) refers to any verbal information or answer given.  I presume that that means oral information. Oral answers do not become statistical information until somebody writes them down.  Surely paragraph (c) refers to answers written down by a person authorised under the Principal Act.  Paragraph (a) and (b) both refer to the Principal Act. <Col N="205" /> Paragraph (c) does not.  The Minister was rather convincing upon the matter, but, looking into it, I wonder why it does not.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I will try to make that clear.  May I intervene to try to get the discussion back to the Bill before the House?  Deputy Kingsmill Moore certainly has not been talking about this Bill.  So far as his first amendment is concerned, let me say that, if the Minister can trick people into giving information, he does not need this Bill to enable him to disclose that information.  There is nothing in this Bill which affects his powers in that regard.  This Bill has nothing to do with it.  Section 2 is solely for the purpose of enabling the Minister to reveal to specified persons information which he could not reveal to them before without committing an offence under the Act of 1926.  If he has that information through any source, by tricking people into giving it to him, by any method, overhand or underhand, which he can use, then clearly the barrier upon its revelation otherwise than to an officer of statistics under the Act of 1926 does not apply.  It is only where that bar applies, it is only in respect of information which he may not now reveal except to an officer of statistics without committing an offence, that this additional power is being sought.  I think that answers the points concerning paragraph (c).  What that relates to are the steps taken by officers of statistics to clarify returns which are not infrequently ambiguous in detail. A firm will send in a return.  The officer of statistics will find it has defects in some respect or is not clear in some other respect.  He will ring up the manager of the firm and explain as regards that return what precisely is the information wanted.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall come to that. Senator Kingsmill Moore talks about that information being broadcast. There is no question of its being broadcast. He talks about its being revealed to the detriment of a person in civil proceedings or in connection with old age pensions.  It cannot be used for that purpose.  The point is that the information revealed under the authority of a Ministerial Order given under this Bill to a specified person is confidential to that specified person and cannot be revealed by him to anybody without committing an offence under the 1926 Act.  There is, therefore, no question of broadcasting or publishing in the ordinary sense of the term; no question of using the information in ordinary Departmental administration.  It can be revealed only for a specified purpose to a specified person.  The Minister can allow that information to be revealed to a specified person who must treat it as confidential.  He cannot disclose it to other persons even if they require that information for the purpose of their official duties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The statistical branch has, in fact, at the present time, for the publication of the various reports which appear from time to time, to go to various firms to get their consent under the 1926 Act for the revelation of information. Senator Sir John Keane will be familiar with one case.  It is necessary and desirable that figures should be published concerning the output of cement.  Everybody knows that we have only one firm manufacturing cement.  It would be illegal under the 1926 Act to publish that information unless the firm consented; but the firm does, in fact, consent.  A large number of firms are in that position.  They have to be approached and are approached and give their consent to the publication of the information for the production census or some other return, which could not otherwise appear.  Their consent <Col N="207" /> will be still necessary under this Bill.  There will be no power to publish in that broadcast sense any information secured under the authority of a statistics Order.  That information can only be revealed in confidence to an officer of a Government Department, or a tribunal of inquiry, or a commission of inquiry, for the purpose of enabling them more effectively to discharge their duties.  There is, therefore, none of these dangers of abuse to which Senator Kingsmill Moore referred. There is no possibility of the information being used to the detriment of the individual concerned. There is no likelihood of its being broadcast.  It is an entirely different process which we are authorising here. The whole of the Bill relates only to information secured under the authority of a statistics Order and not capable of being published, except in accordance with the terms of the 1926 Act, unless this amending Bill is passed.</P>

      <P>I think this matter wants a somewhat closer examination than it has had.  I understand that certain information rendered to statistical officers, to Departmental officers, is rendered voluntarily.  I should like to know if the person rendering this information has any knowledge at the time whether it is done under an Order which he is bound to observe or whether he is doing it voluntarily with the knowledge that it is voluntary.</P>

      <P>If he is required to give information under the authority of a statistics Order that fact is made clear to him.  Of course, a very large number of firms and individuals give voluntary returns which are used in the preparation of statistics relating to national income and matters of that kind.  That information is not prepared under the authority of the Statistics Act.  The person concerned can withhold that information if he wishes to do so but if it is information required for the publication of abstracts or other statistical data and the person must give the information, then the fact that the information is required under the authority of the Act and that it must be given is made clear to him.</P>

      <P>I know that there are powers to call for information prescribed by the Minister under a statutory form but I am not sure whether the people rendering the information know whether they are obliged to do so or not.  People give information generally in the belief that they are bound to do so.  The Minister might differentiate between these two classes when he is replying.  I want to examine this matter of passing information to a specified officer more closely.  Let us examine it in the light of administrative experience.  Let us suppose that the specified officer is Mr. A.  I cannot see what use such information would be to Mr. A. alone in any Department.</P>
      <P>The information goes on a file and if it is going to be used for administrative purposes, it must be circulated amongst quite a number of Departmental officers concerned in the matter.  I should like to get that point made quite clear, whether the specified officer is the only person who gets this information and if he is the only person, how can he use it?  If he has got to use it by putting it on a file and utilising it for administrative purposes, it cannot be regarded as merely individual to that person.</P>

      <P>The difficulty which Senator Sir John Keane has raised has affected my view to some extent too. It is evidently intended under the sub-section&mdash;because it would be necessary for the committee or commission to get the information in order to discharge their functions under the Act&mdash;that the specified person will be entitled to give that information to his commission or committee.</P>

      <P>That is very satisfactory. I am very glad to know that because, if that is so, it takes away the sting from the Bill completely.  I was afraid that he might disclose information concerning an individual who would be the only manufacturer perhaps of a particular commodity.  I do not know that the section should not be altered in some way to afford the necessary protection because it would appear from the section that it was necessary for the commission or <Col N="209" /> the committee to get the information and that the specified officer would be obliged to pass it on to them.  I do not know that it would ever be construed in that way but there is that danger.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The most obvious case that occurs to my mind is where a Departmental committee was investigating certain economic or other trends for the Government and where they would be asked to report to the Government on that matter.  A member of that committee could get this information available in an individual return.  It could not appear in the report which the Government would receive but it would enable individuals to prepare that report with a much clearer knowledge of the facts and without having to take the steps necessary to procure that information first-hand for themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They would report to the Government on the basis of that information that the production of pigs was going up, or that the production of boots was going down, as the case might be. They would base their report on the knowledge they got.  Even individual officers investigating particular proposals or propositions before a Department and desiring to make a fully-informed comment on a particular proposition or project, may require that information.  I do not say that case would often happen because it would have to be a rather formal business to require the Minister to specify certain persons and authorise officers of statistics to reveal certain information to these persons.  That would not happen except in connection with some matter that was of more than usual importance.  It would not be done in connection with the ordinary day to day business of any Department.  The most likely instance would be in connection with inter-Departmental committees. It might be necessary in connection with a commission or tribunal of inquiry such as is mentioned here. <Col N="210" /> Again that would be a case where the information need be revealed only to an officer of the commission or tribunal, to give him an indication of the direction in which the commission might pursue its inquiries.  Further, it might be necessary to reveal it to members of the commission but in no case can the information be published by them in their report or by communicating it to any other person without an offence being committed.</P>

      <P>I think the reason is that, when a notice is sent to a firm or individual requiring information, the Order made by the Minister is quoted and their obligation under that Order to give the information is mentioned. The practice, as I explained earlier, is for officers of statistics occasionally to make additional inquiries by telephone or conversation to get clearer information. On many of those occasions, they may not go through the formality of quoting the Order.  The intention is that the information should be treated as confidential and that it should not be revealed to any person without the committal of an offence.  It is precisely that information which it is desired to make available to those specified officers.</P>

      <P>They do not.  What I tried to point out to the Senator was that the Principal Act gives full power to publish information with the consent of the person who gave the information. The insertion of these words would nullify the Bill and would give no power which we have not already got under the Principal Act.  What is required here is power to reveal that information to a specified officer without the consent of the person.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kingsmill Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there is an enormous difference between them because, under the Principal Act, I think you would have to get the express consent, while, by this amending Bill, you get a presumed consent.

      <P>Is it not very undesirable if it is not intended to do so at all?  What I want the Senator to remember is that this information cannot be passed on until the Minister has authorised the passing on of specified statistical information to a specified person for a specified purpose.  He cannot merely say: &ldquo;Give the Department of Local <Col N="213" /> Government or the Land Commission all the information they want&rdquo;.  There must be an individual authorisation. The Minister must name the person, name the information and name the purpose, and I think it would be undesirable to suggest by any general phrase in the form issued to firms that the information was going to be used in any event.  It might never be used or might be used only once in ten years, and then only in the circumstances contemplated here, by disclosure to persons who would be under precisely the same bond of secrecy as the officers of statistics.</P>

      <P>It is not necessarily for statistical purposes, I agree.  I can best illustrate this by quoting the example I gave earlier.  An inter-Departmental committee might be set up to advise the Government upon certain aspects of trade or certain economic trends. That committee, in order to produce a fully informed report, might require to have access to some of these individual returns.  They would be authorised to have access to them, but they could not refer to individual returns in the report they send even to their Ministers or the Government as a whole; but they would, nevertheless, be more certain that their statement of the facts was correct if they had had this information before them when preparing their report.  It is that type of case which is far more likely to arise than any other, and, in any event, the information could not be revealed by them to any person but used only for the purpose of adding to their own knowledge and enabling them to do their own work more efficiently.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Summerfield</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to emphasise the doubt I expressed on Second Reading.  Although the Bill does not expressly say so, the Minister, in reply to a question on Second Reading, said it was intended that this power would be retrospective.  I have every sympathy with the Minister and I do not wish in any way to impede him in what he is trying to get, but the Bill does give power by which all the information can be given to a wide number of people, within, of course, the limits prescribed by the Minister. A lot of the information in the possession of the Statistics Department, however, was got voluntarily and was given in detail because of the confidence then felt that it was being given for statistical purposes.  I do not want to exaggerate, but there is a considerable amount of uneasiness that information so given&mdash;in many cases, information of a highly confidential nature&mdash; might at some time&mdash;not particularly under the present Minister but the Act will continue and the powers conferred by the Act will continue when the Minister may be in a more exalted position&mdash;be used to the detriment of those who gave it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I realise the Minister's difficulty.  He wants to have the information for certain purposes and I cannot suggest how it could be so worded that it would not be possible to make use of information already in the possession of the Department, but if, from this date onwards, people are asked for information in the full knowledge that it will be used in the way described in <Col N="215" /> the Bill, they will give the information with that knowledge and knowing what they are doing.  I feel, however, that there will be a degree of uneasiness that what they have given in good faith might conceivably be used to their detriment.  I content myself with saying that.  I say it in no spirit of hostility but merely for the purpose of giving expression to a doubt which exists, and perhaps the Minister could see to what degree it can be met, if at all.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite obvious that the information now in the possession of the statistics branch should be available if these powers have to be used just as readily as information which may become available.  Again, I give the illustrations I have already given. Suppose there is an inter-Departmental committee inquiring into the trend of bacon production and it wants to ascertain whether there is any movement of production from the West to the South, from one part of the country to another.  Clearly, it would have to investigate the output of individual concerns over a number of years and it could not determine the trend except by examining the returns over a number of years, and consequently would need to have past, as well as current, information.  In certain cases, it would be undesirable for the Minister to make an Order under this section for the revelation of information acquired in the past, except where that revelation was clearly of a kind which was not likely to cause a difficulty to individuals.</P>
      <P>We in this country get a large part of our statistics voluntarily.  Senator Summerfield referred to information given voluntarily, but we are not talking of information given voluntarily. We are talking of information given compulsorily under statistics Orders. But a very high proportion of statistics which form the basis of reports published by the Department of Industry and Commerce are secured voluntarily, and there is rarely difficulty in getting the cooperation of firms in supplying information&mdash;even most intimate and confidential information relating to their own concerns.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="216" /> For example, the estimating of national income requires that certain firms should give information concerning the number of employees, the wages they pay, the hours the employees work, average earnings and so forth, information which is not sought under the Statistics Act but obtained with the voluntary co-operation of a number of firms.  In fact, for the recent national income report, about 10,000 firms were asked to give all that very detailed and intimate information. Half of them did not do it. Half of them preferred not to do it, and that was an end of the matter. The information was not obtained under the authority of statistics Order. It was in fact voluntarily contributed by these firms and was used solely in the Statistics Branch for the purposes of their report.  This Bill relates to the transmission to specified officers of information which it would be illegal to transmit to them under the terms of the 1926 Act because it was given under the authority of an Order made under the 1926 Act.</P>

      <P>I alluded to this on Second Reading.  I have no objection at all to the disclosure of information to civil servants.  I have the greatest confidence in their discretion and I have the greatest sympathy with the Minister in this matter.  I understand the case he makes for the Bill and the purposes for which he wants the Bill. The real objection which Senator Summerfield and others have to it is that it includes civil servants, members of commissions, who may be any people at all, who may be very varied, and the officers of commissions.  In other words, when the Minister has a good case for getting extra power, he comes to the two Houses with that good case, but always gives himself good measure in the Bill.  That is what it amounts to, and that is the whole story.  Perhaps I would do the same if I were Minister. I am not accusing a particular Minister, but, in every case where power is taken, it is taken in ample fashion.  That is the whole story, and it cannot be helped apparently.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>My amendments are as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>1.&mdash;Section 1.: In page 2, after line 22, to insert the following definition:&mdash;&ldquo;the expression &lsquo;Circuit Court&rsquo; means the judge or the deputy or assistant judge of the Circuit Court exercising jurisdiction in the county in which is situate the courthouse in which the sittings of the District Court for the transaction of licensing business for the licensing area are for the time being usually held.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>2.&mdash;Section 2: To delete the words &ldquo;the Minister&rdquo; where these words occur in sub-section (1) and sub-section (2) in lines 23, 25, 27, and 33 and substitute therefor in each place the words &ldquo;the Circuit Court&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want the confusion to arise on this occasion which arose on a previous one.  The purpose of these amendments is very simple.  The case that Senator Hayes made a few seconds ago on the Statistics Bill about good measure is <Col N="218" /> very relevant to this Bill.  The proposal here is certainly good measure for an Intoxicating Liquor Bill, and it is that which is at the back of my objection to the Bill in its present form.  As I have said, my first amendment is merely a definition amendment, and is taken from the Intoxicating Liquor Act of 1927.  It is the method adopted in the Principal Act of defining the Circuit Court which is to apply to the area concerned.  It is, of course, in regard to amendment No. 2 that the principle at issue arises.  I made it quite clear on the Second Reading of the Bill, though one particular Senator tried to make the contrary clear, that, in the case which the Minister envisaged, where you are going to have bog premises&mdash; where, in the words of the Minister, you are going &ldquo;to have miles and miles of sweet damn all&rdquo;&mdash;it is right that proper facilities, a wet canteen, should be provided for the people residing in the middle of that vast space, if they desire to have it.</P>
    <P>I am in entire agreement with the Minister so far as that is concerned. My objection is that that is not what is in the Bill.  The Bill is very much wider in its scope.  It leaves it open to the executive authority of the Minister to decide what is going to be a vast open space and what is not.  If the Bill provided that there was to be a licence for the vast open space which the Minister envisaged in the course of his argument, then I would be in entire agreement with him that the proper place to put the power to grant the licence would be in the Bill and not in the court.  But that is not the Bill.  The Bill leaves it to an executive discretion to decide whether the place is sufficiently lonely, and whether there are facilities or not.  It leaves that to an executive discretion, and not to the Oireachtas to decide on the one hand or the court on the other.</P>
    <P>In my view the discretion should be a fixed determined thing: that either we should make up our minds here and now on the exact circumstances under which we want facilities to be provided or else we should define the general principles which, perhaps, are defined in rather too wide a manner <Col N="219" /> in the Bill, and leave the practical application of those principles and how they are to be put into effect to those who, under the Constitution and under the ordinary law of the land, have been put in a position to decide such matters.</P>
    <P>As I said on a previous occasion, it is right and proper that reasonable and proper facilities in regard to the sale of intoxicating liquor should be provided for a growing city.  The town of Crumlin, outside of Dublin, comes at once to the mind of anybody living in Dublin.  The law provides that where additional facilities are required for a town such as that, the person concerned has to go to the court and satisfy it that the need is there before a licence is granted.  This Bill could quite easily say, in regard to these camp premises, that where there is no alternative facility within, say, two miles&mdash;that was the distance taken by the Minister himself&mdash;a licence could be issued automatically, but that, where there are additional facilities within two miles of the camp premises, the matter would have to go to the court.  In such a case it would be for the court to decide whether it was right and proper, in all the circumstances, to grant the application.  I would be quite prepared to legislate here and now that where there is no alternative facility within two miles of camp premises it is right and proper that Bord na Móna should automatically get a canteen licence.  If that was in the Bill it would meet my objection. What I am urging is that, where there are alternative facilities within a distance of two miles, Bord na Móna should be put in exactly the same position as any private individual.  It should have to go before the circuit judge and satisfy him that there was a need, and if it did satisfy him on that point, then it should get a licence.  If, on the other hand, it did not satisfy him: if local interests were able to satisfy him that the need was already being properly catered for, then the licence would not be granted. It would seem to me that that would be a much fairer way of dealing with the matter.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="220" /> On the Second Reading a suggestion was made by one or two Senators that I mentioned this for the sole purpose of bringing grist to the lawyers' mill. I think those were the words that were used.  The Senator who mentioned that has little knowledge of the amount that would be involved.  It is far more likely that in a case like that it would bring substantial grist to the newspapers, as Senator O'Dea pointed out, and to the local auctioneers who would be giving evidence in relation to the facilities and so forth.  They would be far more likely to get the grist if there was a court application.  I do not think, therefore, that we need consider that suggestion very seriously.  It might have been made in good faith, but it was made without any knowledge of the procedure involved in making an application to the Circuit Court in licensing cases.</P>
    <P>If the Minister had introduced a Bill such as he advocated in his closing statement on the Second Reading, I would have little cause to complain, but, as Senator Hayes said, he has introduced a much wider measure.  I am sorry to see that that seems to be a tendency to which we have grown somewhat accustomed.  There is a natural tendency that, if you want something, you ask for a little bit more than you expect to get.  It would be equally fair to say that, as far as those who criticise measures are concerned, it is their duty to see that the Minister gets only what they think he should get and not what has been, so to speak, his opening bid.</P>

      <P>I am not sure if I interpret Senator Sweetman's amendment correctly to mean that he contemplates that the Circuit Court would decide who should receive the licence in the first instance, but that the Minister should continue to have responsibility for the transfer, variation or renewal of the licence.  As he is proposing to delete the Minister and substitute the Circuit Court in sub-sections (1) and (2) only, I think that would be the effect.</P>

      <P>My reasoning was that it was the initial grant of the licence which was the important principle. There was a suggestion made by <Col N="221" /> the Minister in the other House that if he had to apply at the annual licensing sessions&mdash;that is a nominal thing every year&mdash;it would be undesirable.  I tried to meet him in so far as I could do so.  It is purely the initial decision that there shall be a licence in a particular place that I have provided for &mdash;that that must be determined by the Circuit Court judge.  Once it has been decided that there shall be a licence in a particular place, I am quite satisfied that it should remain for the Minister to say whether the camp shall continue at that place for which there is a need for a licence.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

      <P>The Senator's amendment goes further.  It contemplates not merely that the Circuit Court should be satisfied that it is expedient that a licence should be granted, but also should issue to a person who appeared to be fit and proper a certificate certifying to the Revenue Commissioners that the court approved of the grant of the licence.  That concentrates the main objection I have to the amendment on the point that really matters. I have stated that the intention is to give this licence to the camp superintendent or the bog manager, the official of Bord na Móna, who will be responsible for the running of the camp.  I think it very undesirable that we should take the risk of the Circuit Court choosing to give the licence to some other person not connected with the board's organisation, or to some other official of the board who for some reason might be an applicant for it. It is very undesirable that there should be any personal interest in this licence at all; it should be held by the official of the board <i>ex officio.</i></P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">

      <P>The Senator would not have objected to leaving the decision with the Minister if it were in the Bill that the licence could not be given if there were alternative facilities within two miles of the camp.  That is not quite the phrase I used.  I said suitable alternative facilities.  It seems clear <Col N="222" /> that you could not leave it as broadly as the Senator puts it.  The alternative facilities he speaks about might be completely unsuitable.</P>
      <P>The camp might be a large one, containing 400 or 500 workers, and the facilities within two miles of the camp might be in the nature of a very small public house which could not possibly cater for the workers concerned.  In fact, it might be undesirable that the number of workers concerned should attempt to obtain facilities at these premises.  I mentioned that where there would be a camp in the vicinity of a town like Edenderry or Droichead Nua, then clearly the presence of a number of licensed premises would ensure that there would be adequate facilities and no facilities should be given to the board to operate a wet canteen.  But where the camps are in isolated areas, I think that we should ensure that there are reasonable and suitable premises within two miles.</P>
      <P>What constitutes reasonable and suitable facilities is also a matter in relation to which discretion must be exercised.  There is no difference whatsoever between putting into the Bill that if the Minister thinks it expedient to operate a canteen at the camp he may do so, and putting in that if the Minister considers there are no suitable alternative facilities he may grant a licence.  In either case, the Minister must use his discretion.  You could not possibly eliminate from the Bill that element of discretion.  I think it is better to leave the Bill as it is and to take the assurance which has been given that these facilities will not be granted to permit the board to operate wet canteens at the camps unless there is an absence of suitable facilities within reasonable distance.  If there is an absence of suitable facilities, the board should get the licence, but clearly it would not be practicable to define in precise terms the circumstances in which a licence will be issued.  I suggest the Minister is the suitable person to make the decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fact that the licensing laws are administered through the courts introduces here what is in my view a false analogy.  The principle on which these licensing laws were framed was that there should be no additional licence <Col N="223" /> except in special circumstances and the courts were to decide what the special circumstances were.  In this particular case we are asking the Oireachtas to decide that it is desirable that these facilities should be given at the type of camps I have mentioned and, having decided that, then to establish a simple and convenient administrative machine to give effect to their decision.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. M. Hayes Mr. M. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I have often heard the Minister better than he was on this occasion.  Surely the position is that we are all in agreement that where people are working in a camp at turf they should have facilities for refreshment, to put it quite bluntly, facilities for drinking to a reasonable degree.  We are also in agreement that Bord na Móna should be able to afford them these facilities.  Now, I think I would be also in agreement with the Minister that you cannot put the conditions under which the licence ought to be issued into an Act of Parliament.  In fact, the ordinary licensing law does not put the conditions into Acts of Parliament.  It puts certain things into the Acts and it leaves to a circuit judge the decision as to whether the particular licence ought to be issued or not.  What is in this Bill is that, granted that we all want these facilities afforded, it should be in the absolute discretion of the Minister, and of nobody else, to grant a licence.  That is an amendment of the existing law. It is the introduction, in spite of what the Minister says, of a new principle, that is, that the discretion which somebody must exercise will in this particular instance be exercised by the Minister and not by a circuit judge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister goes on to say&mdash;I have been listening to the same phrase for 24 years&mdash;the House should accept the Minister's assurance.  Of course it should.  Every Minister thinks the House should accept his assurance. Why should this particular Bord na Móna be put in any different position from the ordinary licence holder?  All that Senator Sweetman's amendment asks is that the Board should appear before the circuit judge and should say <Col N="224" /> to the circuit judge exactly what the Minister has said to us except that they say it about a specific instance. They say: &ldquo;Here we have 500 men. We want to accommodate them in this particular way.  There is no suitable premises within a reasonable distance. There is premises within two miles or within three miles but it is not suitable for this great number of men and, therefore, in these circumstances, we desire to set up facilities for the men on the camp sites.&rdquo;  Surely the circuit judge, to whom we give such a tremendous amount of discretion as between ordinary citizens, is capable of being the judge in that case, too.  I do not see why he would not be.  Surely there is no necessity to depart from the established principle of letting the court decide.  The circuit judge is used to this kind of thing and he can consider the circumstances and can issue the licence.</P>
    <P>I understand Senator Sweetman's amendment does not compel the Minister to go up every year, as other people have to go, but, in the first instance, surely it would be better from the point of view of Bord na Móna and the Minister that there would be no clash of any kind between a private interest and Bord na Móna and that, if there was, the person who is continually deciding when there is a clash between interests, namely, the circuit judge, would be the person to decide in this instance as in every other instance.  It seems to me that from the general point of view it would be far better that the case that has to be made about individual applicants should be made in the first instance to a circuit judge.  Remember, the Guards come into it, and the Guards are an impartial body also, and the Gárda officers realise all the arguments the Minister has given us, namely, that you do not want to have people travelling in groups to a small remote public house, and so on.  That is all quite clearly realised by the Gárda and by their officers and surely they would assist Bord na Móna in getting these facilities for their people.</P>
    <P>For that reason, it seems to me that, instead of leaving the matter in this form, which is the familiar form in <Col N="225" /> Bills, of giving more and more discretion to the Minister&mdash;which, in effect, is discretion to somebody else, to Bord na Móna or to some civil servant&mdash;why not leave the matter to a court, particularly in the first instance, in the belief that the court will give as fair a deal to Bord na Móna as it gives to Patrick Murphy when he applies?  I do not see why it would not.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasForan" hpid="Mr. Foran Mr. Foran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Foran</NameTxt>
      <P>I have to intervene having heard Senator Hayes.  He is a very simple man.  He would have us believe that all the Minister has to do is to go into court and make an application before a justice.  Does not Senator Hayes know&mdash;do not we all know&mdash;that his application would be opposed by the local publican and all the influence and interest and obstacles that could possibly be put in the way would be put in the way of the Minister getting a licence?  I do not think this case is unique.  I think that there is a certain analogy between the Army and the turf camps.  If there is a camp set up by the Army they do not have to go to a justice to set up their canteen.  I see no earthly reason why the camp board would not have the right to facilitate their workers by providing reasonable facilities in their canteens.</P>
      <P>If a local publican can put up a proposition and offer a better inducement to the workers there, let him do it but let the Turf Board have the opportunity of offering the opportunities to their workers to induce them and, having done that, I believe the board would have much greater control and that the workers would have more consideration when they were using their own canteens.  We read that during the past season there were some very unseemly occurrences in parts of the country where these camps are situated.  If these things occurred within the camp they could be dealt with there and they could be isolated whereas it causes great inconvenience to the people in any particular town where these men resort in great numbers and perhaps go in for a little over-indulgence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the proposition of the Minister is sound and, while I am in agreement with a lot that has been said about Ministers getting power, I think <Col N="226" /> we are perfectly safe in putting this power in the hands of the Minister or any Minister.  The Turf Board know they want these facilities and it should be made as easy as possible for them to obtain them.  It should not be left within the power of any local interest or personal interest to make it difficult for the board to get a licence.  It is not just as easy as Senator Hayes would have us believe, namely, that all the Minister has to do is to make the application.  The local publican would brief a local solicitor and perhaps Senator Kingsmill Moore or Senator Ryan or somebody else and the Minister would have to brief his counsel to meet the argument.  We know that would go on.  There is no use in Senator Sweetman trying to tell us that it would not bring grist to the lawyers.  Of course, it would.  Any man owning a licensed premises in the immediate neighbourhood of a camp would certainly make a big effort to prevent the board getting a licence. Then, again, if the Minister is restricted to the two-mile limit, the surveyor will be down with a chain measure.  We should cut out all that kind of thing and allow the Bill to stand as it is, seeing that we all agree on the need for these camps, making it as easy as possible for the board to facilitate the workers.  The profits from these canteens will accrue to the people working on the bog and we should do everything in our power to ensure that the people get the greatest possible facilities and profit from their own vice, if you like, of drinking alcoholic drink.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. M. Hayes Mr. M. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am more simple than Senator Foran but I am not quite as simple as he makes me out to be.  If the local publican, whoever he is, has any objection, why should not he be let state it in court?  Is not that what he does in the ordinary way?  I have no interest in publicans.  I have no interest in barristers, either.  But why should not the publican be allowed to state his case and would not it be better for the local publican, if he has an objection, to go into court or appear by way of counsel than to be log-rolling with the local T.D. or the local Senator for the purpose of influencing the Minister when it is in the Minister's discretion?  The present <Col N="227" /> Minister knows better than anybody the affliction it is to have T.D.s and Senators writing to him about licences, and this is an additional case for him now.  It would be far better to avoid that.  I quite agree that if the local publican has not got the facilities, he ought to be put aside but, if he thinks he has and if he thinks he has a grievance, then the proper place to state it is in court.  I agree entirely with the Minister that it is not practicable to put into the Bill anything about a two-mile limit.  I would not bind anybody in that way.  I would say &ldquo;suitable facilities&rdquo; or use some such phrase and let the circuit judge come to a decision.  The argument that it is bringing grist to the lawyers' mill could be used against every Bill we pass.  If we do not want to bring grist to lawyers' mills, we should shut down.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>We can all be quite clear that no one wants to deny these facilities to the turf workers.  We appreciate that there is a necessity for them.  It is all a question of the approach.  Much as I respect the Minister and the way he does his work, and the ability and discretion exercised by the officials of the Turf Board, I do not believe they should be put above the licensing laws any more than any other group of citizens.  They should be obliged to approach this problem in exactly the same way as any other group.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Foran draws an analogy between this and the provision of canteens in the Army.  I do not think you can draw such an analogy at all, The Army is accorded facilities in every country that are not the privilege of other groups of citizens. You could, of course, have other groups of workers situated elsewhere and demand similiar facilities for them as for these turf workers, that is, not through the procedure of the court at all but by some such method as this. I was slightly disappointed by what the Minister said on the last occasion, when he left the impression on me that this was, to a certain extent, a temporary provision.  I would hope that it would be nothing of the kind. <Col N="228" /> The Minister left us under the impression that the turf would be cut away and then the canteen would be moved on.  I suggest that what he is seeking now is power to erect wet canteens in certain areas, which I expect would be permanent institutions&mdash;that is, if the board is to do the job I visualised when the Minister was putting the Turf Development Bill through the House.  When you cut your turf, you have the other problem of reclamation, which means there will be permanent buildings there for the workers.  We must look at that side of the problem. If that is so, it means establishing in particular areas wet canteens which eventually will develop into the ordinary kind of licensed house which we find all over the country.  If that assumption is correct, those premises ought to be subject to the ordinary procedure of the licensing laws.  It would be much more satisfactory, from the point of view of Bord na Móna, if they had to go before the Circuit Court judge and get their authority, than that they should get it from their own Minister.  I am convinced that, for their sake, from the point of view of their reputation, they should get no advantage that is not the right of everybody else in the country.  That is the way the others have to get their authority and if they do that, I am sure it will not be denied to them.</P>
    <P>Senator Foran suggests that it is difficult to do that.  I think the Oireachtas would be very impatient with the decision of a Circuit Court judge who would deny those facilities and I do not think it would happen. That point should not be made as a reason why Bord na Móna should not go to the Circuit Court for authority. The Minister would be acting wisely and for the better conduct of these establishments, by letting it go to the judge.  There is nothing at all in the point that lawyers will benefit.  After all, there may be two or three lawyers concerned in this altogether, as the camps are located only in certain areas.  That is a point with no substance whatever in it.</P>
    <P>There is an orderly way of proceeding to do the right thing, a way that <Col N="229" /> is fair and above-board.  If you have something to do that you can justify, it would be far wiser&mdash;even though there are certain inconveniences to be faced&mdash;to go the way everyone has to go, taking no short cuts.  I am absolutely convinced that the decision to leave it with the Minister, which means leaving it to Bord na Móna, is not wise, in the interests of the board itself.  We would regret it later on, if there were any sort of trouble in any of these camps, arising out of these wet canteens being there, perhaps arising through some people going to their own canteen and having drinks there and others going to the publichouse three or four miles away and taking some of the kind of drink which would not be good for them and then causing a disturbance in the camp.  It would not be for the welfare of Bord na Móna then if they had got the permit in an indirect way, a way in which no other group could secure it.  In whatever form Senator Sweetman's proposition might be embodied in the Bill, it should be accepted in principle.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>If this amendment is accepted, I do not know what it would lead to.  We must take into account that the licence is described as an &ldquo;on-licence&rdquo;. If you go before a circuit judge under this Bill, there are three kinds of licences he can grant&mdash;an ordinary seven-day licence, a six-day licence or an early closing licence, which means closing an hour before the usual time.  If a licence were granted by him, it would mean that the premises would have to be open during all hours for which licensed premises must be open.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LouisODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>That makes the matter worse.  It says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;the expression &lsquo;on-licence&rsquo; means a licence for the sale of intoxicating liquor for consumption either on or off the premises.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="230" /> There is nothing in that to define hours or anything else.  The circuit judge under this Bill would have power merely to grant one of the three licences.  Then any local publican or any friends of his could go up, at any hour during which licensed premises must be open, and demand a drink&mdash; and have the licensee prosecuted if he refused to supply it.  I understand that the idea in this case is that these licensed premises would be open only for certain hours of the day, that is, not during the hours when the people would be working.  The life of the licensee would be made unbearable.  It would defeat the whole purpose of the Bill if such a licence were granted.</P>
    <P>The second question that arises is: who is to be the applicant for the licence?  Somebody spoke as if the Minister was to be the applicant, and somebody else spoke as if Bord na Móna was to be the applicant.  A company cannot be an applicant for a licence.  It must be the nominee or a manager of the company.  In order to apply for a licence he must show title, if he is applying in the ordinary way. Is it suggested that Bord na Móna should make a lease to him of portion of the premises in order that he may apply for a licence therefor?  If not, is it merely that he is to be the nominee of Bord na Móna or a manager?  Then, supposing he is dismissed, he might refuse to transfer the licence.  There would be a licence in existence and the Minister could not issue a new licence in respect of a premises for which a licence was already in existence and he could not transfer the licence.  I can see possibilities in that which would make the whole thing absolutely and entirely unworkable.  In order to carry out that amendment you would have to change the whole framework of the Bill, define the various powers, give the licensee power to trade only at particular hours, and make other arrangements by which the Minister could cancel the licence and issue a new licence if any difficulty arose such as I have anticipated.</P>

The fact is that this Bill enables an on-licence to be granted and that the words &ldquo;on-licence&rdquo; are defined in lines 21 and 22.</P>

I do not know whether the Senator makes that suggestion or not.  But if the Senator thinks that that is the law, then I suggest that the Bill ought to be amended by the Senator and I will support him if that is correct, so as to provide that the canteen will be open only at proper hours to ensure the working of the camp.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator forgets that that was not my objection; it was his.  I have always understood that Senators who had objections were the Senators to put down amendments. However, that does not make any difference to the point about the grant of the licence.  So far as the second point raised by Senator O'Dea is concerned, I do not like giving an advertisement to any establishment in the city, but I understand that there is an establishment where one can obtain refreshment called J.G. Mooney and Company, Limited, which is a company in respect of which, I understand, licences are given under the Intoxicating <Col N="232" /> Liquor Acts to managers, as presumably is the intention in this Bill and is the intention which has been stated by the Minister.  As I went to some pains on the last stage to try to make clear, there is, in effect, absolutely no difference in the licensing law between the two.  It could be done just in the same way here as in the other.</P>
      <P>If the Minister makes the point that he wants to be the person selecting the applicant because the applicant is to be the manager of the local turf camp, then I am quite prepared to yield that to him and that can be quite easily met.  If the Minister is prepared to meet me, I am prepared to withdraw the amendment I have on the Paper and substitute another amendment on the Fourth Stage which will be a very simple one, which will merely delete the words &ldquo;the Minster&rdquo; where they first occur in line 23&mdash;in other words, it will be &ldquo;whenever the Circuit Court is satisfied that it is expedient&rdquo;&mdash;and where the words &ldquo;the Minister&rdquo; occur later on leave them there, so that the Minister would have the choice of the applicant, but it would be the Circuit Court who would decide whether it was proper for a particular location to have a canteen.  The location of the canteen is the matter in which I am really interested.</P>
      <P>I am afraid I do not see the objection of Senator Foran.  I feel that if a licence is clearly and obviously necessary for an area because there are not suitable available licensed premises, then it is quite clear that the local licensed trader, if he is a long way away, will not bother about going to a lot of expense and there will not be any opposition.  The only case in which there will be opposition is where it is doubtful whether the existing accommodation that is available is suitable. That is the case where there will be opposition to the application of Bord na Móna.  If the case is doubtful, then I think that the proper person to resolve the doubt is the Circuit Court judge and not the Minister.</P>

We are all <Col N="233" /> agreed that, if there are to be wet canteen facilities, the licence which must be issued should be issued to a nominee of Bord na Móna, the official in charge of the camp.  The Bill says that the Minister is to decide that the circumstances are such as to require the provision of canteen facilities and, having so decided, to give a certificate to the person nominated by Bord na Móna to get his licence from the Revenue Commissioners. That seems to me to be the straightforward way to do it.  As I understand, what Senator Hayes and Senator Baxter suggest is that, instead of the Minister making the decision, the Circuit Court should make the decision, and they were careful to say that the result would be exactly the same.  Why should we do it that way? It is not quite as simple as Senator Sweetman suggests.  Putting in the words &ldquo;Circuit Court&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;Minister&rdquo; would not ensure that result, would not ensure that the licence would be issued in the circumstances which we have had in contemplation during our discussions here, without further and elaborate provisions. It would be necessary to make a much more elaborate provision than that.</P>
      <P>We would have to enjoin the Circuit Court to issue a licence in circumstances in which the Oireachtas is of opinion that a licence should be issued, and not merely leave it to be satisfied that it is expedient that a licence should be granted, without giving any further indication of the circumstances in which in our view the licence should issue.  I think it is an unnecessarily roundabout way of doing it, solely for the purpose of preserving what Senators think to be an important principle in regard to the licensing law, namely that the Circuit Court should be the deciding authority rather than the Minister.  I think that is important only where it is a question of making a choice as between individuals in the matter of conferring a privilege which may yield a profit.  In this particular case there is no dispute whatever as to who should get the licence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no question of profit in the licence and, therefore, there is no necessity to call in the Circuit Court <Col N="234" /> to decide as between rival claims. The only decision that has to be made of that character is on the issue of the suitability of other licensed premises in the vicinity of the camp.  That is a matter which could undoubtedly be decided by the Circuit Court, but in order to enable it to give a decision, it would have to get from the Oireachtas far clearer directions than the Bill contains at the moment, and it would therefore necessitate a far more elaborate measure.  I do not think that is necessary.  I think it is quite competent for the Oireachtas itself to decide that there should be facilities at these camps, that these facilities should be secured by means of a grant of licence to the official in charge of the camp and therefore to ask the Minister to go ahead and arrange accordingly.  It seems an unnecessary complication to bring in the Circuit Court.  If we bring in the Circuit Court we are taking a chance that the purpose we have in mind will not be achieved at all.</P>

      <P>Surely the mover of the amendment did not intend that it should be taken seriously, because it applies only to Section 2 and it leaves the Minister power in later sections to vary a licence or to transfer it.

      <P>It seems to me that the definitions in this section may require some clarification.  The first definition, referring to &ldquo;bog premises&rdquo;, says that the expression &ldquo;means all the buildings for the time being erected in a bog.&rdquo; All the discussion here so far related to camps which are near a bog or in the vicinity of a bog.  I do not like to be the means of bringing grist to the lawyers' mill, and I fancy that this may bring some grist to the lawyers' mill if it becomes part of the Act.  Again, the second definition says that the expression &ldquo;licensed bog premises&rdquo; means premises in a bog and later on it contains the words &ldquo;only of the bog premises in such bog&rdquo;.  I may point out that the Minister in speaking to this mentioned the fact that it is desirable that the camps should adjoin bogs because the premises were to be in the camps.  This Bill refers apparently to licensed premises in camps which are, as far as I am aware, in the vicinity of the bogs but not in the bogs themselves, as many of the speakers have been here to-night.  I should like the Minister to look into the matter or he may be in another bog at some future date, if the matter is not rectified. When we went down to visit the bogs on the invitation of Bord na Móna we were in the camps but we were only in the vicinity of the bogs.  I think these definitions may require attention before the Bill becomes law.  When we went to Clonsast the camp there was not in the bog.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before sub-section (2) to insert a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(2)  The Minister shall not issue a certificate under this section until he is satisfied that provision has been or shall be made in respect of a bog for accommodation separate from the proposed licensed bog premises in which shall be available non-alcoholic refreshments, such as teas and minerals, and also tobacco, to workers on the said bog.</P>
      <P>The House will remember that, on Second Reading, I mentioned this matter and I was supported by Senator Honan and Senator Kehoe, who spoke at some length.  The Minister then gave us a promise that he would look into it and see that our wishes were carried out as far as possible, though, he said, they could not be carried out absolutely.  He stated that he could not insert anything of the kind in the Bill.  I understand the difficulty is in administration&mdash;at least I have been told so by people who know these things better than I, but I cannot see it.  However, as a matter of principle, I raise the point again and I should like to see this sub-section inserted in the Bill.  I am speaking for everybody interested in the welfare of the young, especially parents, and particularly I speak for the thousands of persons who are very worried about the provisions of this Bill.  I speak for the growing boys and girls and the men and women who think that these licensed premises would be a source of danger to the younger men&mdash;in fact, you might call some of them boys.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can foresee somebody in this House telling us that you cannot make people saints by legislation, but I think that is a very futile argument.  We have been all endowed by Providence with a free will and we are either what we ought to be or what we ought not to be of our own volition.  There is no <Col N="237" /> question of compelling us.  However, the difficulties are there and I hope the Minister will look into the matter and accept this amendment, if he can at all.</P>
    <P>In regard to the talk about making saints, I think it is the duty of the Legislature and the people at large, if they cannot make saints or sinners of certain people, at least to help the weaker members of the community and, by the weaker members, I really mean the younger members.  We should help them, at least, on the right path and not tempt them on to the wrong path. If a young fellow between 16 and 25 years contracts drinking habits, they are likely to last for his life.  Moral and material ruin, with the break-up of families, is a frequent result of those habits.  I should be very grateful if the Minister would accept this amendment, which, I believe, is a useful amendment.  So far as the suggestion is concerned of the Legislature trying to make people what they should be, we cannot compel them but we can help them.  That was very clearly brought out when the Censorship of Publications Bill was going through.  That argument was used and the Minister in charge of that Bill resisted it and the Bill became an Act.  I ask the Minister, if at all possible, to accept this amendment which, I believe, would be for the good of the community and, particularly, for the good of the young men working at these camps.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LouisODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment of Senator Miss Pearse.  Evidently, she wants cigarettes, non-intoxicating liquors, teas and other such things sold in a separate compartment.  That ought to be done.  There is no doubt that if young fellows have to go in for their cigarettes to places where intoxicating liquor is sold, they will be brought aside and pressed to take a drink.  Some of them are likely to succumb to the temptation and to break their pledge, with permanently bad results.  Apart from that, there is a clause in the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1927, which states that, where there is mixed trading, no business can be carried on during closing hours without a breach of the licensing laws.  It would be illegal to sell cigarettes or teas during closing hours in licensed premises.  If <Col N="238" /> the Minister says that he will carry out that provision of the 1927 Act, the amendment may not be necessary, but I suggest that it should be carried out. Temptation should not be held out to young fellows in a bog to take to drink by going into places where drink is sold.  They may be teetotallers or they may be temperate but, if they commence drinking, there is likely to be drink after drink and, with teetotallers, the breakdown will be worse than with others.  I suggest that the amendment should be carried out, at least, in spirit.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidJohnMadden" hpid="Mr. Madden Mr. Madden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Madden</NameTxt>
      <P>I have great pleasure in supporting the amendment.  I have had 40 years' experience of business conducted in premises part of which was licensed.  Consequently, I have had unique opportunities of watching the happenings in such places from the point of view of a person interested in the business who is also a Pioneer.  I myself have never tasted drink.  I must admit that the atmosphere even of a well-conducted licensed premises is bad for young people.  Young persons are freely allowed in these places to mix with their elders.  The law is such and I have been amazed an infinite number of times to hear older people improperly prevailing upon young fellows of from 20 to 22 years to depart from the drinking of minerals and to imbibe strong drink.  I have often lost my temper with such persons.  I frequently felt that there was a devilish design on the part of men of mature years to induce innocent young men to take to drink.  Quite recently, a father and son came into my premises in the morning. The father called for two glasses of whiskey.  In answer to my question, he said he wanted the second glass for his son.  I asked his age and he told me he was 16 years.  I said: &ldquo;You, as father of that boy, ask me to give him a glass of whiskey to ruin his career. Do you appreciate your responsibility as a parent?&rdquo;  He said that, if I did not give it to him, he would get it somewhere else and they passed out of the premises.  That is not the first time I had an experience like that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have had 40 years' experience of the disastrous results to young men from the influence and bad example of older people with whom they came into <Col N="239" /> common association in publichouses.  I think that Senator Miss Pearse's amendment would do splendid work and, without attempting to dictate to the Minister on the subject of his responsibilities and duties, moral and otherwise, I think that this is one of the most serious aspects of the Bill. The Minister stated last day that 700 or 800 men were to be congregated at some of those camps.  I do not know what percentage of the 700 would be boys or young men.  I know that about two dozen from my own part of the country left the care and watchfulness of their parents and plodded their way to Kildare to get into one of those camps.</P>
    <P>If these young men are allowed to intermix with older men who are accustomed to drinking, my experience teaches me that it will gradually lead to the ruin of some grand young fellows.  Quite recently I was tempted to hit a responsible citizen in a certain town when I saw him deliberately leading a young fellow astray in this fashion.  Now, that young fellow cannot get a sufficient quantity of drink to consume although he is not more than 24 or 25 years of age.  We must accept a certain moral obligation in matters of this kind, and I trust that, as Senator Miss Pearse suggested, a portion of the camp premises will be set aside for the young men to whom I refer, such portion to be completely independent of that part in which spirituous liquors are sold.  That will be the only security for their prosperity, peace and contentment.  As one of the oldest Pioneers in the country, I suggest that that is the only safe path for these young men.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamOCallaghan" hpid="Mr. O'Callaghan Mr. O'Callaghan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Callaghan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the idea put forward by Senator Miss Pearse. We should all try to remove the temptation from the path of youth. There may be another way of accomplishing what Senator Miss Pearse has in view.  That would be by segregating the men who drink from the men who do not drink.  There could be a bog at which there would be a pub and another at which there would not be any.  The men who require the drink could go to the bog where facilities <Col N="240" /> were provided and the others could go to the other bog.  So far as I know, most of the men who drink could spend all their available money on Sunday in a few hours.  I do not know that we are starting off properly by putting a pub in every bog.  I hope the Minister will move slowly in that direction.  I think that that is a rather rash proceeding.  It may be a good thing to have a pub in a bog for the convenience of men who are inclined to drink, but in the case of bogs where men who have wives and families are working, I wonder what will the wives say to the men who drink their money in these pubs.</P>
      <P>I am afraid the Minister will be creating trouble in many homes and I suggest that we should save him from it.  I am well aware that the turf bogs are the most desolate and depressing places in which a man could work and I agree that we should do everything we possibly can to make the lives of these men who work there, brighter and better, but if we run away with the idea that a &ldquo;pub&rdquo; in every bog will settle the matter and achieve what we seek to achieve, we are making a mistake.  I ask the Minister to hasten slowly and to think over what I have said.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a matter upon which there is no difference of opinion at all.  Everybody agrees that it is desirable that accommodation separate from that in which drink will be sold should be provided for the sale of tea, milk, minerals, cigarettes and tobacco. I agree with that and Bord na Móna agrees with it.  They have the intention of providing that separate accommodation in the camps licensed under the Bill.  My objection to the amendment is two-fold.  First, I object to the implication that Bord na Móna will not provide separate accommodation unless compelled to do it by law, because that, of course, is the idea behind the amendment. Secondly, I object to it because it is not possible to frame an amendment which will make it practicable for Bord na Móna to give full effect to it and which, at the same time, will be legally clear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The construction of these camp premises will not be uniform.  There <Col N="241" /> may be necessity for having more than one mess-room or canteen in some premises, and, in others, there may not be room for more than one which might have to be divided.  I think, however, there need be no apprehension in the mind of anybody that the board will not be anxious to ensure and will not take steps to ensure that separate accommodation will be provided.  Separate accommodation will be provided.  It is my intention that it will be so and it is the board's intention that it will be so, and, in their plans for new camp premises, they have made the necessary provision; but I think is undesirable that we should put a sub-section of this kind in the Bill because it would be almost impossible to frame a provision which would cover all the cases, and, at the same time, make the legal obligations of the board clear.</P>
    <P>I am sure there are Senators who remember the prolonged debates and elaborate provisions which followed on the decision to enact the segregation of premises to which Senator Madden referred.  There were weeks of controversy concerning the provision of the licensing Acts which gave effect to that intention, and it is much better in a case of this kind, where we are dealing with one organisation operating these camps, to leave the matter to their judgement, knowing that their judgment will be the same as that of every responsible person, that they will be fully alive to the desirability of having separate accommodation and that they will have, if they need it, the instruction of the Minister for Industry and Commerce to provide separate accommodation and that there is not the slightest risk whatever that there will not be separate accommodation.  In these circumstances, I urge that the amendment be not pressed.  I think the Seanad might be satisfied with the assurance I am giving of the intention of the board to provide that accommodation in every camp licensed under this Bill, and I think they can be certain that the members of the board will be as much concerned as anybody here to see that the conditions in the camps are proper in every respect and particularly correct in this respect.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has dealt with a few of the points I intended to make and Senator Crosbie in his query has put the second point of the argument I had in mind.  I was anxious to know whether these canteens would be subject to the ordinary licensing laws and whether they would close at the ordinary closing hours and open only during the hours at which other licensed premises are open.  What I understand by a canteen is a premises which is open at hours convenient for those who wish to frequent it and closed at all other hours; in other words, a premises which opens at lunch-time, at tea-time and some time during the evening.  I do not know whether the reply to Senator Crosbie's query covers the point and whether a canteen would be closed during certain hours and open at other hours during which ordinary licensed premises are not open.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to providing separate accommodation, we are all quite satisfied that such accommodation should be provided and the Minister has said it will be provided.  We might think it would be no harm to set it out in the Bill, but we have to accept what the Minister says, that we are pushing two open doors.  I could be a little reminiscent about what happens to young people in the matter of drink. I never took drink as a youngster and I know what I had to go through.  I travelled with football teams and when they wanted a drink, the order was: &ldquo;So-and-so and a sucking bottle&rdquo;.  The drink I did take was a couple of beaten up eggs and milk and that was the origin of the joke about the sucking bottle.  Every one of us who tried to keep away from intoxicating liquor had to put up with a good deal of criticism of a good-humoured kind, but it can always have its effect upon the person who is not sufficiently strong to resist. It is like constant dripping which can wear away a stone&mdash;constant criticism <Col N="243" /> can have its effect on many people.  I think we are all agreed that this provision is of vital importance in order to save some people from themselves and to save others from the evil influence of their associates.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanRuane" hpid="Mr. S.T. Ruane Mr. S.T. Ruane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S.T. Ruane</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment because I know that hundreds of young people who went to the turf camps went there temperate and I am not quite satisfied that they all came back without having broken their Confirmation pledges.  I have seen total abstainers and people who were not total abstainers associating together on licensed premises and when it came to a question of the drink to be supplied, I have often heard said, when a desire was expressed for a bottle of some temperate drink: &ldquo;I will not pay for that for you.&rdquo;  There are young people who have sufficient courage and strength of character to resist any suggestion that it is manly to drink intoxicating liquor, but there are quite a number who could easily be led into the belief, as a result of pressure by their associates, that to be a man it is necessary to stand behind some measure containing either porter or whisky.</P>
      <P>For that reason, it is necessary that there should be incorporated in the Bill a provision that would make it absolutely necessary for Bord na Móna to provide separate accommodation for total abstainers.  By doing that, you will keep people out of temptation and will save people who have the pledge the humiliation which many of them experience when challenged with not having the courage to take a man's drink.  A licensed premises is a proximate source of danger to such people.  It is absolutely necessary to see that, so far as canteens are provided at the turf production camps, a separate canteen is provided for those who are temperate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support the amendment.  The remarks made by the Minister were, to a large extent, satisfactory, but the giving of a licence at all to bog premises is a very serious matter and may involve very considerable temptations and risks in the case of those for whom certain <Col N="244" /> facilities are granted.  It seems to follow, naturally, that some safeguards should be provided.  The Bill enables one thing to be done.  It should also insist that the other should be done in the way of a safeguard for people who do not take drink.  Some years ago an intellectual sort of person was found after hours in the public house.  I think this occurred somewhere in the West of Ireland.  His defence was that it was not for drink that he went in but rather for the intellectual conversation.  I am rather inclined to think that that may be a beginning, because in the case of boys, separated as they are from big centres of population and living in the conditions under which they will be obliged to live, to some extent in unnatural conditions, socially the strain on them will be very great, and there will be the natural tendency in circumstances of that kind to go in and mix with the others because the monotony of the place is likely to be relieved in that way.  Take the case of two young people who, perhaps, are inclined to be friendly, one with the other.  One goes into the place where the intoxicating liquor is sold.  The other may be tempted to follow him.  Of course, the opposite thing could happen, too.  But if one is strong enough, and usually he is, to go into the temperance part of the building it may have the effect of drawing the other in the same direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The discussion so far seems to assume that this bog development work could not be continued if facilities in the way of getting intoxicating liquor drink were not provided. It is certainly throwing up the sponge with a vengeance to expect us to accept that principle.  Personally, I do not quite agree with it.  I should imagine that it should be quite possible to continue this particular work if we had none of these facilities, but since they are to be granted for intoxicating drink I hold that it is not unreasonable to have inserted in the Bill a provision similiar to that suggested by Senator Miss Pearse.  I do not think there is anything else that needs to be mentioned by me. Senator Madden is a man who has practical experience of the dangers associated with the use of intoxicating <Col N="245" /> drink.  He certainly put the case in very forcible fashion as did other speakers, including Senator Miss Pearse herself.  I suggest that the Minister ought to accept the amendment more or less as it stands.  It is possible that it could do with some verbal changes.  If the Minister were to accept it with these changes, I think he would be doing something that would meet with the approval not only of everybody in this House but of the nation as a whole.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFrancisBaxter" hpid="Mr. Baxter Mr. Baxter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>While I am in favour of the amendment, may I suggest that even though it were inserted in the Bill I do not think Senator Miss Pearse would get very much more from its insertion than she has already got from the Minister in his statement. The amendment provides that</P>
      <P>&ldquo;the Minister shall not issue a certificate under this section until he is satisfied that provision has been made or shall be made&rdquo;</P>
      <P>and so on.  I think the Senator weakens her amendment by the insertion of the words &ldquo;shall be.&rdquo;  If the Minister is satisfied that provision shall be made in ten years' time he can accept the amendment, and in that event perhaps Senator Miss Pearse would, actually, be getting less from him than she has already got in the undertaking that he has given.  I confess quite frankly that some of the speeches made in support of the amendment made me feel that the speakers do not understand the type of people who are working in the camps.  Some Senators talked as if the workers ought to be separated with barbed wire entanglements between them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Baxter</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say that I am just as interested as any of the Senators who have spoken in seeing that the people working on the bogs should not fall into temptation.  But if people want to fall into temptation it is extraordinary how they can get into close proximity to it.  While I think that Bord na Móna should do everything possible to make the <Col N="246" /> quarters for the people who do not take intoxicating drink even more attractive than those in the wet canteen, I am sure we all realise that there is nothing in the world to prevent even Pioneers from strolling into the other place if they want to.  If they cannot go into the other place, and if we cannot produce people of character who can go into such a place and come out of it as good as when they went in, then I am afraid there is not much hope for us as a people.</P>
      <P>Surely, what we should aim at is the cultivation of a strong character in our people that will enable them to go through life with success.  Senator Miss Pearse did talk about saints and sinners. The success of people going through this life depends on their ability to withstand the many temptations that fall across their path.  I think that we can accept the Minister's guarantee in this matter.  I am quite satisfied myself that the officers of Bord na Móna will, as responsible men, not want to see any young fellows coming into their employment and leaving it worse citizens and worse Catholics than they were when they entered it.  Another important consideration from their point of view will be this, that the worker who manages to abstain from intoxicating drink will be found to be probably a fitter man for his work than the fellow who takes rather too much.  For these reasons, I am sure the officials will be anxious to see that their men will live a life of temperance.  As I have said, the Minister has already given an undertaking to Senator Miss Pearse, and I do not think that the acceptance of the amendment would give her anything more than what she has already got from him in that way.  I think she can be quite satisfied that the Minister need not come back to this House again if he does not fulfil the pledge he has given in this matter.</P>

      <P>I think Senator Miss Pearse has every reason to be pleased with the results that she has achieved in the moving of her amendment.  She has got a guarantee from the Minister that I think very few other people would have got.  That was given in such definite terms that, in my opinion, she has already achieved what she set out to achieve in her amendment.  The Minister has satisfied himself that not only will provision be made, but that it has already been made to have separate apartments for those who take intoxicating drink and for those who take non-intoxicating drink.  I should like to say, however, that this debate has quite shaken me in my knowledge of this country.  I thought I knew the country well, but apparently I do not. I have been in most of the publichouses in the country and apparently things have been going on in them that I never saw or heard of.  If it were not for the fact that Senator Madden is himself an auctioneer I would be looking for the sale of his publichouse. After having listened to his speech I cannot see how any honest man, thinking as he thinks about that business, could continue to own a publichouse. However, that is his own business.  I think the amendment has served its purpose and I ask Senator Miss Pearse to withdraw it.</P>

This is a very serious matter.  Senator Quirke speaks as if he were a very innocent little boy.  He is quite agreeable that we should put a licensed premises within the camps in the bogs, where all those men are living.  Is he aware that some time ago some of the men working on the bogs were driven mad by drink and they <Col N="248" /> attacked the local barracks?  Is that not a fact?</P>

When they go back home it might be worse than the attack on the barracks.  It is a very serious step to have young fellows 16 and 18 years of age living around those canteens.  Probably it is their first time to leave home, to be away from parental control.  I am opposing this Bill and I say that if we permit a licensed premises in the places where these people work, I do not think we will be doing a good day's work for the country.  Instead of encouraging extra licences, I would be in favour of doing away with half the public houses in the country.  I would give them to Senator Quirke to auction them off.</P>

      <P>I do not think Senator Miss Pearse should withdraw this <Col N="249" /> amendment.  I think the House should not give her permission to do so.  We have got a very emphatic promise from the Minister, but that is not law.  The people who will administer this legislation will not be bound by the Minister's promise.  It is not embodied in the Bill.  If Senator Miss Pearse's amendment is adopted, it will be inserted in the Bill, and in the ordinary way can be enforced.  For that reason I do not think the Senator should be allowed to withdraw the amendment; the consent of the House should be necessary.</P>
      <P>We have heard from Senator Kingsmill Moore arguments with reference to taking certain things out of the Bill, and the Minister opposed them.  Here is a reasonable proposition to put something into the Bill and, instead of doing that, the Minister gives us a promise that is worth very little from the point of view of legislation.  We want to have something embodied in the Bill, a definite obligation imposed by law. That is the only way you can do it.</P>
      <P>The object aimed at is good and desirable. It is somewhat anticipated by the arrangements already in the camps. Facilities have been given for athletic sports and a dry canteen.  We should make this obligatory on the Minister or on any future Minister.  We want it embodied in legislation; we do not want merely a promise.  For that reason I hope Senator Miss Pearse will not withdraw the amendment and that the House will not consent to its withdrawal.</P>

      <P>My promise, as it has been described, is, I suggest, of far more value than the amendment, which is so ambiguous that it would mean nothing.  It certainly is of far less value in the matter of securing what so many Senators desire than the declared intentions of Bord na Móna.  I would much prefer to place my reliance on the good judgment and the good citizenship of the directors of the board than on an ambiguous amendment like this which, if inserted, may be the cause of legal dispute as to its interpretation.  On that ground alone it is undesirable.  The Seanad can rely on the good judgment and citizenship of the directors of Bord na Móna, as the body responsible for the proper <Col N="250" /> running of the organisation, that they will make provision of the kind required because it will obviously make for harmony in their camps.</P>
      <P>My objection to the amendment is that it is indefinite in its legal significance. Anything of that kind inserted in a Bill always leads to trouble.  If we are to have a legal provision of this kind it has to be specific in every respect.  That would mean a very elaborate section.  As it is not practicable or desirable to have such an elaborate section, it would not be a good substitute to have an ambiguous section inserted and that is why this amendment should be withdrawn. Those interested in ensuring that the camps will be constructed so that there will be separate accommodation for the sale of drink and non-intoxicating drink and tea and other commodities of that kind, will find it is far better to rely on the declared intentions and known common sense and judgment of the directors of the board.</P>

      <P>I have considerable sympathy with the object of this amendment but I am not at all happy about the method by which it is proposed to give effect to that object.  I think the object briefly is that facilities for drink should not be of such a nature as to encourage teetotallers to forget their pledge.  It seems to be the general opinion of the House that there should be separate premises in turf camps for non-intoxicating drinks different from the canteen in which hard drinks are sold.  I do not propose to quarrel with that but I do want to suggest that it should be the policy of the Turf Board to provide every possible facility for the consumption of non-alcoholic drinks and I should like to urge that, even in the canteen where hard drinks are sold, there should also be an obligation on the management <Col N="252" /> to provide non-alcoholic drinks so that persons going into the particular canteen would not be under the necessity of either drinking hard drink or going out again.  Think of the awkward situation of a teetotaller and a non-teetotaller wishing to stand each other a drink if one can only drink in the dry canteen and the other in the wet canteen.  How can they both go together for a drink?  They ought to be able to have non-alcoholic drink in the wet canteens and, if he must have it so, let there be separate premises in which only non-alcoholic drinks are sold.</P>
      <P>I am not quite sure if it would not be possible on Report Stage to introduce a variation of this wording which would insist on the desirability of the Minister providing facilities for the consumption of non-alcoholic refreshment in the wet canteen and, if possible, also in premises separate from the wet canteen.</P>

      <P>We have heard no explanation of the point very properly raised by Senator Seán O'Donovan in regard to the bogs.  I must confess that I find myself in agreement with him.  Clonsast is definitely in a bog but Shean is on agricultural land.  The two camps in Corduff are on agricultural land, on the edge of a bog, but <Col N="253" /> not in a bog.  Muckland and Drummond are in exactly the same position, on agricultural land, not in a bog, but situated some little distance from the bog.  So far as the camps in certain other places that are near other facilities are concerned I think Senator O'Donovan's point would be even more forcible than any amendment that I had on the Order Paper.  That is something that perhaps will be tested through the courts by the use of the lawyers to whom Senator Foran takes such strenuous objection.  If it had not been that I know full well how very serious Senator Miss Pearse was in her amendment I would have been rather tempted to have asked, through the Chair, whether Senator Mrs. Concannon believed that Senator Miss Pearse was serious because she had not put down her amendment to Section 3.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is to extend the objects of the Industrial Alcohol Company. When I introduced the Bill in the Dáil it led, not unnaturally, to a debate upon the activities of the Industrial Alcohol Company and even on the wisdom of having a company to manufacture industrial alcohol.  That was a contentious matter when the original Industrial Alcohol Act was passed but, while it would be unreasonable to expect that there would be no reference made to it in this Bill, it really has nothing whatever to do with this Bill. The origin of this Bill lies in the decision of the Government to have some organisation to investigate the possibility of undertaking the manufacture of chemicals on a commercial scale and to undertake their manufacture if it was considered desirable to do so.  When we arrived at that decision, it was decided also that, instead of creating a new organisation with these powers and providing by legislation for its establishment and its financing, it was preferable to use the existing organisation of the Industrial Alcohol Company.  When, however, <Col N="254" /> we endeavoured to use that organisation in connection with certain chemical manufacturing activities which had been carried on during the war, it was found that the terms of the Act precluded it from engaging in any activities other than those defined in the Act or from devoting any part of its funds to purposes which were not strictly in accordance with the very limited scope of its activities as defined in the original Act.</P>
      <P>As the Seanad possibly knows, the Department of Defence, with the cooperation of the Emergency Scientific Research Bureau, carried on the manufacture of certain chemicals used in the production of explosives and used commercially in the manufacture of matches during the war and, at the end of the war, they were naturally desirous of transferring that activity to commercial firms.  Similiarly, other forms of chemical manufacture which had resulted from the researches of the Emergency Scientific Research Bureau appeared to be of possible interest even in normal times and it was desired to examine all the commercial problems associated with their manufacture before authorising anybody to undertake it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Because there was no existing organisation, because the Government wanted to create an organisation and because it appeared a simpler and better device to extend the powers of the Industrial Alcohol Company rather than to set up a new organisation, this Bill was framed in the form in which it now reaches the House.  There is a wide number of chemicals used for industrial purposes in this country and difficulty in obtaining supplies of these chemicals or in obtaining supplies in adequate quantities was one of our main difficulties during the period of the war. Some of the problems that arose were met by the activities of private firms instructed by the Emergency Scientific Research Bureau, some by the alcohol company which itself extended the scope of its activities, and some were not met at all.  It is obviously desirable that, in relation to these commodities, we should have a more detailed examination, made by an expert organisation, of the possibility of getting them produced here. <Col N="255" /> Because of their character, because of the high capital cost of the equipment required in their production, it is not likely that private commercial enterprise will be interested.  The Bill provides that, before the Industrial Alcohol Company&mdash;in its new title, Ceimicí, Teoranta&mdash;will be able to engage in any form of chemical manufacture, public notice must be given of the intention to license it to undertake that, and any private firms wishing to object to the intervention of Ceimicí, Teoranta, in that business will be at liberty to do so.  If it is clear that private enterprise will undertake the provision of the commodity concerned, on an adequate scale and at reasonable cost, then a licence would not be given to this organisation to engage in the business.  However, it is not likely that, in regard to the electro-chemical industries as a whole, private enterprise here will be deeply concerned, as economic manufacture, in the normal sense of that term, will not be practicable.</P>
    <P>The essential chemicals, the production of which here might be considered very desirable for security purposes, could not be made available at an economic cost to commercial users, unless they were supported by the State or by other activities carried on by the same undertaking.  The value of the chemicals imported into this country before the war, of the classes in which this company might at some stage be interested, exceeded £1,000,000.  Not all of those could be produced here, and there is a number of them in which this company probably would never be interested; but it is quite clear that there is a substantial field for investigation. The first fruits of this Bill will be the carrying on of those investigations by this company.  The scientific aspects of manufacture and the scientific problems involved in manufacture can be safely left to the Institute of Industrial Research, but after those scientific problems have been investigated and solved, there are clearly commercial problems&mdash;the process to be used, the type of equipment necessary, the possibility of securing supplies of raw materials from within the country and, of course, the cost of manufacture.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="256" /> One of the commodities which I mentioned by way of illustration in the Dáil and which will have the attention of the board of this company, is sulphate of ammonia.  Before the war, we had examined the possibility of producing sulphate of ammonia here.  There are many indications that its manufacture is a particularly suitable industry for this country and we have a substantial internal demand for it.  In fact, it was regarded by farmers as a very necessary fertiliser, and its absence during the war years has been a loss. The raw materials required in its production appear to be available here. Our pre-war examination of the possibilities of its manufacture was undertaken by an inter-Departmental committee. It was a very cumbersome and unsuitable instrument, which proceeded far too slowly in its researches, but it did appear to make it clear that sulphate of ammonia could be manufactured at a price very little above, though slightly above, the price at which it was at that time being sold here by producers elsewhere. It was desired not to increase the cost, and other processes were being investigated when difficulties arose because of the approaching war situation.  An agreement had been made with an engineering firm on the Continent which appeared to be suitable, but that engineering firm disappeared in the general European upset which followed.  Whether the situation has changed in any fundamental respect since the war I could not say.</P>
    <P>I do not want the Seanad to assume that the enactment of this Bill will necessarily lead to the manufacture of sulphate of ammonia by Ceimicí, Teoranta.  In fact, it cannot do so. Although we are proposing to alter the powers of the company to enable them to investigate these commercial prospects and even to undertake forms of manufacture in certain circumstances, we are not proposing to alter the financial structure of the company. The company was established under the terms of the Act passed in 1938, which empowered the Minister for Finance to invest in the share capital up to a limit of £500,000.  His investments to date total £275,000.  There is a balance under that Act which could be made available to the company <Col N="257" /> for new enterprises, but in the case of sulphate of ammonia the capital involved would be very much greater than that balance.  Therefore, so far as that particular commodity is concerned, the situation is that the company could not engage in its manufacture unless the Principal Act were amended&mdash;which would give the Dáil and Seanad full opportunity to discuss the desirability of authorising the company to proceed along that line.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>An amendment of the Principal Act would be required.  I mention that commodity in order to illustrate the type of activities in which we think the company might engage.  It was one possibility which appeared to be worthy of investigation before the war.  We have not resumed the investigation of it since the war ended, primarily because we had no suitable organisation to carry on the investigation.  This company will provide a suitable organisation.  It is an existing concern; it has a staff of chemists and engineers&mdash;highly competent people&mdash;and they can obtain any additional expert advice they require, once this Bill is passed, once their powers are extended and they are given the necessary legal sanction to engage in such activities.</P>
      <P>There are certain other provisions of the Bill to which it is necessary to refer.  While its primary purpose is to extend the powers given to the company by the Principal Act, so as to enable it to include in its objects the manufacture and sale of any substance all or any portion of which is produced or obtained by a chemical process, that is not the whole of the Bill.  It was necessary, and Part III is designed to give effect to the limitation to which I have referred, the limitation which is intended to debar the company from engaging in the manufacture of any chemical product, if any other firm in the country is already engaged in the manufacture of that product in a substantial degree or interested in its manufacture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provisions included here are similar to those contained in certain <Col N="258" /> other Acts&mdash;the Control of Manufactures Act, and a recent Act concerning the powers of the Electricity Supply Board.  Public notice is to be given of the intention to give a licence to the company to undertake the particular form of manufacture.  A period is allowed for objections to the granting of that licence to be transmitted to the Minister for Industry and Commerce. He considers these objections and decides whether or not to grant the licence.  It is the intention not to grant a licence if it is clear that any private concern is engaged or is likely to be engaged in the production of the goods concerned in a substantial degree.  There is, of course, no question of giving the company a monopoly in the production of any class of goods. It is not intended that it should engage in production in competition with others, if these others are likely to do the job adequately.</P>
    <P>Because of the device of public notice of the intention to give a licence, it is necessary to contemplate circumstances which do not exist now, but which might exist at some stage and to provide for the control of imports of the commodities the subject of the notice prior to the commencement of manufacture.  Section 8 of the Bill makes that provision.  It is quite clear that, in normal times, when supplies of commodities are freely available, the publication in advance of manufacture of notice of intention of the company to engage in the particular form of manufacture might well lead to abnormal imports which would completely upset the whole situation.  Concurrently, therefore, with the giving of notice, the Government may, if they think it necessary, impose quantitative restrictions on imports.</P>
    <P>Section 9 amends the Principal Act to remove certain doubts.  During the war, the company extended its production from the manufacture of industrial alcohol to the production of pure, undenatured alcohol used in chemical laboratories and hospitals and also by various industrial concerns as raw materials.  It produced that pure natural spirit in a rather makeshift manner and with hastily devised <Col N="259" /> plant during the war years.  It is now installing at Cooley suitable, up-to-date plant for the production of undenatured spirit for sale as an industrial raw material and for use in hospitals and laboratories.  There is, however, reason to think that the Principal Act must be interpreted as obliging the company to sell all alcohol produced by it to petrol distributors. The original Act was intended to ensure that all the industrial alcohol produced would be sold to petrol distributors; but it could be read to mean that even the undenatured spirit produced would have to be sold also in that way, and Section 9 is designed to ensure that nothing in the Principal Act will be interpreted as debarring the company from selling industrial alcohol to a person other than a distributor.</P>
    <P>I mentioned chemical manufacture which was undertaken by the Department of Defence during the war.  When the Department of Defence ceased all activity, we asked this company to investigate the possibility of taking over the plant which had been operated by the Department of Defence and continuing that manufacture, if it considered it desirable, with that plant or with new plant.  In fact, the company had not power to do so, and it may be that it will not engage in that particular activity, because, while it was necessary to produce these materials at almost any cost during the war, the same necessity does not arise at the present time, and such investigations as have been undertaken up to date appear to cast considerable doubts upon the possibility of these materials ever being produced here at a cost comparable to the price at which they can be imported.  It is, however, provided in Section 11 that property of a Minister of State may be assigned to the company.  It is intended to cover the possibility of the company taking over from the Department of Defence some of the equipment used by the Department of Defence in the chemical manufacture during the war period and still in the possession of that Department, although not now in use.</P>
    <P>I cannot say definitely that the extension <Col N="260" /> of the powers of this company in the manner proposed here will in fact lead to any new form of manufacture by it.  But, having regard to the need for having some body of people keeping in touch with the problems of manufacturing chemicals, acquainting themselves with the practical difficulties associated with it, and knowing how best to proceed if any emergency should compel us to proceed, we would, I think, gain by the enactment of this Bill, even if it did not lead to any new manufacture in normal times.  I think it is desirable that we should have some organisation available to us, and this organisation appears to be by far the most suitable.  We could, undoubtedly, set up a new organisation, with new staffs, powers and finances. It would be, however, not merely uneconomical, but foolish to do so when there is available here an organisation with a first-class staff under a competent board of directors which could add these activities to its other existing activities and could go further and competently direct any form of manufacture which it may be decided to license it to undertake.  For that reason, I would ask the Seanad to pass this Bill.  I ask them not to attach any special significance to the fact that it is the Industrial Alcohol Company which is given these new powers.  That is intended to be a form of economy, a method of using an existing organisation, rather than creating a new organisation for a purpose which, I am sure, everybody will agree is desirable in any event.</P>

      <P>The fact that this is an amendment of the Industrial Alcohol Act would, I presume, give us the right to discuss the competence of that company to undertake the task which is being passed over to it by the Minister under this Bill.  However, I confess that I have so little acquaintance with what that company has been doing that I will not undertake a critical analysis of how it has done its work.  From the beginning, I may say, I always queried the wisdom of the policy set out by the Minister when he anticipated that it would be more profitable to handle a certain product of the land in a factory like that than in certain other factories <Col N="261" /> which all of us could have on our own farms.  I will not enter into any discussion of that aspect of the work of the Industrial Alcohol Company, nor attempt an examination of its competence to do the work which the Minister is empowering it to do now under this Bill.</P>
      <P>I should like, however, to raise a question as to whether this work which the Minister expects of it could not be better undertaken by a body more closely in touch with the universities.  We are in a variety of ways attempting the reorganisation of our industrial effort from the point of view of industrial research and from the point of view of obtaining a knowledge of the value of science to our progress, but I do not know whether we have ever had sufficiently revealed to us the attitude of mind of the Minister towards this whole problem in such a way as to make us satisfied that his approach is the best approach.  It is rather piecemeal.</P>
      <P>I am not quarrelling with what he is undertaking in this Bill.  It is definitely limited; it is quite specific, and I think that he is clear as to what he wants the Industrial Alcohol Factory to attempt. I presume he has at the back of his mind the idea that the efforts that they are going to make are to be concentrated in the main on the possibilities of our developing the manufacture of sulphate of ammonia here. We are quite clear that a variety of activities may be entered upon by them but I just wonder how much these people are competent to achieve in that respect.  The Minister tells us that it is mainly on grounds of economy that it has been passed on to them.  He tells us that they have an expert staff, for instance.  I do not know anything, or at least very little, about their staff. It seems to me that they have been working within a very narrow radius so far, that their expert staff may be expert up to a point.  What just have they been doing except distilling alcohol from potatoes?  What is their competency to enter this new field which the Minister is opening up to them?  I do not know and I should like to hear from the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="262" /> That brings me to another aspect of the question, and it seems to me&mdash;I think we have to get clear on this&mdash;if we are going to enter the field of chemical research here, if we are going to face a future where we hope to build up some sort of institution here where research and the application of the knowledge of the chemist to our problems is going to be considerably developed, we should set about it in a definite, thorough way.  That being so, I am afraid I cannot be satisfied that the Minister has here the expert staff whom he can set working on this problem at all.  It seems to me that if we are going to build up this sort of organisation, the first thing these people have got to do is to look round the world and to draw upon other countries, in so far as it is possible, to obtain the services of competent people abroad and the talent that is available.  Possibly, there is to-day scattered all over Europe a number of people who would be a tremendous asset to us in this new venture.  I suggest that we have to face that problem and if we are going to attempt anything of real importance, unless we buy experience of a type that is not available to us here, I do not think the Minister will be laying a proper foundation at all.</P>
    <P>A certain aspect of that strikes me immediately.  The great chemical undertakings in Britain and on the Continent naturally have all sorts of extraordinary secrets.  It is quite conceivable that, in setting up an organisation like this here, some of our young people who have had to leave the country in the past, when set to work on our problems here, may make discoveries, and that, guided and aided by people of established reputations and wide experience in this sort of research, we might achieve something here which possibly may not have been accomplished elsewhere.  I should like to suggest to the Minister that it is of the utmost importance, if we are going to build up an organisation like that, that we go out and search for the people who can assist us in that venture. If we are going to select other people, it is most important that we should make a good choice.  I would be very careful, if I were bringing such <Col N="263" /> people here, to try to get people who would have certain affinities with us nationally, who would have our approach and our outlook on life, and who would not be here serving us nominally while perhaps really serving somebody else.  In the world of chemical research, that is of the utmost importance. I need not dilate further on that aspect of the matter.  I suggest to the Minister that if our efforts are to be of real value to the nation, we should be secure in the knowledge that we can trust absolutely the people that we have here to serve our purpose and serve our cause.</P>
    <P>I take it that the endeavours of this organisation will be in the main concentrated on discoveries and the development of the manufacture of sulphate of ammonia here.  Naturally, they will not concentrate on that alone. I agree that anything that can make life here more secure is an asset which we should seek to possess.  In a variety of ways, I have no doubt, the researches of the chemist can make life here much more complete than it is and more secure, especially in a period of emergency like that through which we have passed, but again I should like to strike this note of warning.  If we are going to contemplate the production of sulphate of ammonia in this country, we may approach that from two angles.  One angle may be the value and the necessity of this commodity to our agricultural effort.  The other angle is the national importance of such a chemical organisation within the State, the security which such an organisation would give the nation. There are, therefore, two approaches.  If it were only in the interests of agriculture alone, and that it were being conceived and created because in times of emergency the farmer would have within our own State protection in the shape of fertilisers which were not available during a war, then probably the farmer might be expected to pay the price.  There is the other aspect&mdash;the aspect of national security.  We must make up our minds right from the beginning that if we are to put specialists to work on a task which is to give us, some time, big chemical plants for the <Col N="264" /> production of a commodity we formerly imported, it is a <i>sine qua non</i> that these people be able to give the farmers this product at a price not higher than that at which farmers elsewhere can buy it.  I think that the Minister recognises, no matter what may be said to the contrary, that the profitability of farming is contingent upon the price of the raw materials.  People may be critical of farmers and say that they are always grumbling.  We can assert with truth that the farmers can bear their burdens and make their sacrifices in silence when it has got to be done.  In that respect, we have recently had a remarkable test in the case of the beet growers.  The farmer complains only when there is justification. If the farmers are confronted with a situation in which the raw materials on which they have to depend for increased production have to be bought at home at a price out of proportion to what they are costing the Danish, the Scottish or the English farmer, the nation may gain certain benefits but the farmers' position will be worsened. We must have security against that. Because I recognise that we are not embarking on that project in this Bill and that the capital provided under the original Bill is not sufficient to enable such a new venture to be entered upon without further opportunities for discussion, I need not proceed further along that line.</P>
    <P>I stress that the attitude of mind of farmers towards an undertaking such as this is as I have stated.  I suggest that, if attempts at production are to be undertaken under the legislation we are now discussing, it will be important to consider the location of the branches of this organisation which may be established.  Chemical works are very vulnerable to particular types of attack.  If we are to have these things as an asset in times of difficulty, right from the beginning we should consider where those plants are to be located. I do not think that we can deny to the Minister the authority he seeks under this measure.  I am all for research so far as the trained mind can add anything to our knowledge and make our lives more complete.  We must be prepared to spend money to win knowledge for ourselves.  There are things <Col N="265" /> we cannot buy abroad.  I am one of those who think that, given the opportunity, our people have a peculiar kind of genius which might enable us to provide for ourselves comforts and advantages that even people wealthier than we are and with much greater natural resources might be unable to provide.  I take no exception to the amending Bill, generally.</P>

      <P>This Bill gives the company very wide powers indeed. These powers are indicated in Section 4 (c):&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(i)  the manufacture, refining and sale of industrial alcohol and products and derivatives thereof, and</P>
      <P>(ii)  the making, aiding or subsidising of experiments, investigations, researches and tests in relation to the possibilities of the manufacture of any substance, all or any portion of which is produced or obtained by chemical process, and</P>
      <P>(iii)  the manufacture and sale of any substance, all or any portion of which is produced or obtained by chemical process.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I should like to refer to paragraph (ii). This seems to me to contain very extensive powers for the factories. They could start to make atomic bombs.  That paragraph does not indicate that their efforts are to be devoted to agriculture or to any specific purpose whatever.  The provision refers to a substance produced or obtained by &ldquo;chemical process.&rdquo;  That gives very wide power because everything in nature, practically, is obtained by chemical process.  Some of them are classified as biochemical processes. Senator Baxter often speaks at length and, having talked so much at length, it is often difficult to know what he has said.  His speech gave me the same impression to-night.  He spoke so long yet said so little.  Did some Senator say that my own meaning was not clear?</P>

      <P>Perhaps this attempt will be somewhat pungent, too.  We could easily have a research <Col N="266" /> laboratory of great advantage to agriculture, as well as other industries under this Bill.  While Senator Baxter was speaking, it occurred to me that the utilisation of those potatoes for other purposes than conversion into industrial alcohol might be investigated. Senator Baxter knows quite well that the use of potatoes throughout the entire season is very difficult owing to spoilage and that ensilage is recommended. I suggest that investigation into ensilage should be carried out under the powers provided by this Bill.</P>

      <P>I am speaking of the more effective conversion of the potato into ensilage.  I suggest that the ensilage might be provided in bulk in those factories and distributed to the community instead of trying to ensile small quantities of potatoes by boiling them up and putting them in a pit.  It is not easy or economic for the farmer, owing to difficulties of fuel, to carry out ensilage in that way, and frequently there was considerable spoilage.  I can picture potatoes being commercially ensiled and distributed to the community through the agency of this research institute which the sub-section practically gives us.</P>
      <P>I have mentioned that under the powers given here the company could investigate atomic energy generally and atomic energy, rightly directed, might be a very fine thing for the country.  There are other ensilages on which a lecture was given during the week in Dublin which this company could investigate and there are many other chemical processes which would be of great interest to the farming community, in addition to the production of sulphate of ammonia, which I hope to see developed under this section.  I hope that on the basis of the wide powers given, this research institute will, by its work, provide the country and the farming community with very beneficial discoveries following on chemical research.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apparently anything which is the <Col N="267" /> result of or obtained by chemical process can be investigated and it really means that this is to be a research laboratory.  It will be entering the commercial sphere in the production and distribution of industrial alcohol and other substances, but mainly, it seems to me, it can engage satisfactorily in research work and I confine my remarks to this aspect.  I urge that the research should have an agricultural bias so that products of a chemical nature may be secured from farm produce for the benefit of farming and other industries.  It is very satisfactory <Col N="268" /> that the name of the company should be changed so as to give it wider powers of production as well as these powers of research which appeal so much to me.  If my remarks in this regard have given Senator Hayes an impression of pungency, it is all to the good.  I hope they will be of some benefit to the Minister and to members of the House, and I express the hope that the Bill will result in real benefit to the agricultural industry and to other industries.</P>
