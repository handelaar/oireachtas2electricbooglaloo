      <P>I would like to have some information about this Bill before we proceed to discuss it.  I was hoping that someone would justify the Bill before we were asked to proceed to comment on it. I think that should be the procedure. I would like to draw attention even at this stage to Section 6, which I think should be amended.  I am not dealing now with the principle of the Bill.  I am dealing with that portion of the Bill which gives authority to the Minister to make regulations. Sub-section (3) provides that any regulation made under this section may provide that any contravention shall be an offence triable summarily and may prescribe the penalty which may be inflicted.  That may be following the precedent of the excise laws, but I do not think it is a principle we should continue to follow without some criticism.  A considerable amount of public attention has been drawn to the effect of the excise laws recently, and as to the way penalties are prescribed by regulations, which regulations have not been at any time submitted to the Legislature.  The penalties are prescribed in the regulations.  I think that an abrogation of the responsibilities of the Legislature, and the least we should ask for is, before any regulations become effective that they shall have the formal approval of both Houses of the Oireachtas.  I am raising the point because of the indication that it is proposed to take all stages of the Bill to-day.  I want, at least, to secure that a change in <Col N="1166" /> this section in the direction I have indicated shall be inserted during the Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>I am sorry I was not in for the beginning of Senator Johnson's speech because, from the legal point of view, I would have a number of very serious objections to this Bill.  I will not dwell upon the point raised by Senator Johnson which relates to the rules to be made under Clause 6, except to say this, that it is the first time that I have ever seen in any legislation where there was Parliamentary government, power given a particular Department or its officers to make laws which will, when made, have the effect of repealing portion of the criminal law.  The second objection I have to the regulations is that they purport to authorise excise penalties, that is, taxation.  As Senators will understand that is a vice in this Bill of the greatest magnitude.  I will only add in reference to that clause that we have on former occasions called attention to and expressed our unanimous disapproval of legislation by Departments as an encroachment on the privileges of Parliament.  I think Senator Johnson has already dealt with that clause fully, but I have objections of a more serious character to other clauses in the Bill. Clause 3 provides that the Minister may, if he thinks fit, issue a licence. That is most unusual.  It is unusual that a Minister should issue licences in any circumstances.  I do not think the Chancellor of Exchequer in England has ever issued a licence for any purpose.  It is the special function of the Department of Inland Revenue, which is, of course, under the control of the Minister but which is a permanent office. Therefore I think permanent officials should be the persons to issue the licences particularly when it is a case of receiving money for the licence, because the proposal in the Bill would entail as a Departmental matter the keeping of a set of revenue accounts in the office of the Minister for Finance, which is a thing unthinkable, and which I <Col N="1167" /> think the Minister, when he has further time to study it, will find not according to precedent and entirely wrong.</P>
      <P>The discretion to issue a licence for a totalisator is given to the Minister. Certificates for the issue of licences by the Inland Revenue Commissioners have been given in a number of cases.  Senators will remember the case of a publican's licence where a certificate has first to be issued that a person is a fit and proper person, qualified to receive a licence before the Revenue Commissioners can issue it and receive the money.  That is a discretion.  In this Bill it is proposed to make it a Ministerial discretion, that is, a political discretion, that is political patronage and political favour.  I think it ought to be a judicial discretion or, at least, a Ministerial discretion. I make these points because I think this is a matter in which I as a lawyer, and in which Senator Brown who is also a lawyer, are especially concerned.  Without being expressly deputed to do it by the Seanad, we regard it as part of any special function we may have to peruse this legislation with a view to seeing that it is in accordance with constitutional precedent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The third objection I have is.  I think, the most serious of all.  The issue of a totalisator licence is under this Bill a Ministerial discretion&mdash;a question of patronage.  If I were in any way connected with or responsible for this I would keep it as far away from the patronage of the totalisator as I possibly could.  But the main objection I have is this: that not alone is the Minister to do the work of issuing the licence, receiving the money, and exercising patronage, but he is the man to fix the amount of the duty&mdash;a most extraordinary provision.  I ask the Seanad to look into this Bill, in view of what I have said.  Section 3, sub-section (3) says: &ldquo;The Minister may charge such a fee for the grant of any totalisator licence as he shall think fit.&rdquo;  There you have a charge at the discretion of the very Minister <Col N="1168" /> who is entrusted with the revenues of the country.  Of course, the legislature has to place trust in its Ministers, but never in any country has the Chancellor of the Exchequer or the Minister for Finance been given power to charge a penny more or a penny less than the scale fixed by Parliament.  That is one matter in respect of which Parliament looks with&mdash;I will not say suspicion, but with the greatest vigilance on the act of the Chancellor of the Exchequer.  I do not know of any single instance in any law where the amount of duty can be charged at the discretion of any man.  It is always fixed to the last halfpenny by schedule.</P>
    <P>I mention these matters because they are Parliamentary matters.  It is our duty to be vigilant with regard to legislation.  There is a constant tendency on the part of departments, without any ill-will on their part&mdash;it seems to be a sort of force of nature or force of circumstances urging them on&mdash;to nip here and there, and to nibble at the powers of Parliament, and there is a constant struggle by Parliament to defend its own power, particularly in respect of this matter of taxation and licences.  What I say I say simply as a lawyer.  This Bill is objectionable to me from that point of view.  I do not know whether what I have said will be considered or not by Ministers, or whether they consider, having regard to what I have said, that it is possible to modify this Bill so as to make it conformable with the Constitution.  If it is, perhaps it will be amended.  My own inclination would be, without wishing in any way to obstruct, to reject this Bill altogether now, and let them come forward again with a proper Bill, conforming to the laws, with a proper schedule for licence duty or licence fee, whatever they call it, and with proper penal regulations included in it.  If these regulations, as they undoubtedly will, have the effect of repealing the positive law, then they ought to come before Parliament in the form of a section in a Bill.  Can this Bill be <Col N="1169" /> amended?  Does the Seanad require it to be amended?  My own impression is that in present circumstances this Bill ought to be rejected, but perhaps the Minister and his adviser or the Seanad consider that it can be amended, if, in their opinion, it ought to be amended.  I have registered my objection to the form of this Bill from Clause 3 down to the end.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brown</NameTxt>
      <P>To some extent I agree with Senator Johnson and Senator Comyn.  There is a certain theoretical objection to parts of the Bill.  I do not see any objection to the issue of the licence by the Minister, because that really means that it will be issued by the Department for which he is responsible.  But I agree with both Senators that it is not a constitutional method to allow the Minister, without even the consent of the House, to fix a fee which is a tax and which will go into the Exchequer.  To that extent I think the Bill is unconstitutional, but what I would suggest is, that it can be amended by making the licence fee, and also the penalties, which ought never to be made by the Minister without reference to the Houses by regulation or by order of the Minister and having that order submitted to both Houses, not to be effective until a resolution has been passed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a provision in the Betting Bill in connection with this matter, and it is considered advisable to have this Bill introduced and passed into law, so as to allow for the setting up of the totalisator.  It was mentioned in the other House that it was proposed to grant a licence to the Turf Club and to the Irish National Hunt Steeplechase Committee.  The totalisator will be managed by a committee consisting of three members of the Turf Club, three members of the Irish National Hunt Steeplechase Committee, one member representing metropolitan race meetings, one member representing provincial race meetings, two members representing breeders, owners and trainers and such Finance representatives as <Col N="1170" /> are necessary.  The Finance representative would have no power of voting, and no personal financial interest in the totalisator, but would be eligible for election to the committee. That is as regards management. It is not proposed to deal out licences in the manner outlined by Senator Comyn, because that would not be a practical proposition, but to grant one licence.  Power is taken in the Bill, if it is impossible to have such an organisation as I have outlined, to have it done by the Revenue Commissioners.  That will be operative only in case the other method is impracticable.  I believe it is practicable.  I believe steps will be taken to work this measure and to set up the totalisator.  That is the general desire of those who are closely associated with the very important industry of horse breeding. That is as regards the licence.  If one were to consider the granting of a number of licences, the objection raised by Senator Comyn would be a reasonable objection.</P>
      <P>The point he has put about political patronage is rather childish, having regard to what I have said, and scarcely arises at all.  Is it political patronage to give to the persons who are most intimately and vitally concerned with racing, and with horse breeding, and with race meetings generally, the management of the totalisator?  I rather think not.  I think if one were looking around for persons who would be anxious to get this right, if there were a number of them in competition, and if one could discriminate between them for one cause or another, political or otherwise, and exercise a preference in regard to any one of them, there might possibly be some grounds for the Senator's objection.  But I think he is either utterly unaware of the circumstances, that he has not read the proceedings in the Dáil, that he knows nothing about racing, and that he has only heard of horse breeding when he committed himself to the statement he has made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As to the regulations, let us consider what is the position.  It is advisable that the totalisator should be <Col N="1171" /> set up.  There is an impression amongst people that unless some such system is worked&mdash;and it has been worked with remarkable success in other countries&mdash;the future of racing will be very seriously interfered with, and possibly some damage might accrue to the horse breeding industry.  My own view is&mdash;and I give it for what it is worth; I do not pretend for a moment to have the knowledge of this matter that Senator Parkinson has&mdash;that our climate and our soil is such that we have opportunities here for horse breeding which would survive even the fall of racing, but I would not be so bold as to say that the damage that would be done to horse breeding, if horse racing were almost eliminated here, would not be very considerable indeed.  It is the race meetings which we have here which form the great opportunity for showing the class of horses, the stamina, the speed and everything that goes to make our horses so well known all over the world.</P>
    <P>Section 6 gives the Minister power to make regulations, by order, for controlling and regulating the setting up, maintenance and for the working of totalisators under the licence.  It also gives power to the Minister to make regulations prescribing a penalty.  A person charged with an offence under this section is triable, and the penalty, if he is convicted, is an excise penalty, fixed by the Minister.  The Minister is responsible to Parliament, which can take him to task in respect of a penalty which would be considered oppressive or unfair, and while it might be possible, if circumstances were otherwise, to have a much more elaborate number of sections dealing with the matter, the proposal here is one which meets the circumstances in a manner which still retains Parliamentary control over the whole procedure.  The Minister is always responsible to Parliament. He can be made to answer for anything in connection with this matter. It is not the Revenue Commissioners who will impose the penalty; it is a <Col N="1172" /> court, and I think, having regard to that, that the Senator's fears are rather exaggerated.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOFarrell" hpid="Mr. O'Farrell Mr. O'Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>It was very difficult for anyone to follow the President's remarks.  He spoke in a whisper.  I was not able to follow him, but it would seem to me that he has evaded some of the principal points.  Take the last point.  He argued that because the Minister is responsible to Parliament then it is all right for him to prescribe penalties in regard to offences under the Bill.  On the same argument one might say that because the Minister for Justice is responsible to Parliament he might prescribe the whole of the criminal court, prescribe penalties for sedition, for murder, robbery, and everything else, and that it was quite all right because he could be impeached before Parliament and could be made to answer for his conduct.  I do not think that is an argument that could hold at all in this case.</P>
      <P>Senator Brown has made a suggestion by which we could, to a certain extent, make the Bill constitutional in this respect, by making it necessary that any regulations he made should be approved of by resolution of both Houses before they become effective.  I daresay the Ministry has failed to prescribe penalties in the schedule because of the haste with which they desire to get this Bill through.  It would require some consideration to fix the various penalties to be imposed.  I do not think a mere question of expediency should induce the House to pass a Bill which is definitely unconstitutional to that extent.  I hope that the subsequent motion to suspend the Standing Orders in the name of Senator Parkinson will not be passed because it is very desirable that the Bill should be amended at any rate in the way suggested by Senator Brown.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceMoore" hpid="Colonel Moore Colonel Moore">
      <NameTxt>Colonel Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose no one is opposed to the idea of having the totalisator or having racing.  The President has stated that horse-breeding here is dependent to a <Col N="1173" /> great extent on race meetings and that if racing were stopped the breeding of horses would probably fall through.  We are all agreed that anything that can be done for the promotion of horse racing should be done.  I think the totalisator has advantages over bookmakers because it will get people to bet on the course.  The great evil of betting, as far as I know, is that people who never saw a horse in their lives, and who would not know his head from his tail, go into bookmakers' offices and make bets.  That is pure gambling, whereas a person who goes to see races probably takes an interest in racing and in horse breeding.  We are all anxious to have something done in this matter.  When two lawyers who are on different sides generally are agreed about this it requires grave consideration.  We should not hand over to Ministers power which they have never before exercised or have rarely exercised.  As Senator O'Farrell stated, we and the Dáil might just as well meet after an election and hand over all the affairs to nominated Ministers and then retire for five years, letting the Ministers do what they liked.  That would be the ultimate result of the President's suggestion.  It seems to be quite clear this Bill can be amended so as to make it constitutional. Everyone wishes that to be done, and I think it would be helpful if it was done.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Parkinson</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the circumstances I do not propose to ask for the suspension of the Standing Orders.  I would like to make a few remarks for the purpose of enlightening Senators who may not understand the purpose of the Totalisator Bill, what it is for and what it means.  Under the Bill a licence will be granted by the Minister to a non-proprietary body, which will handle and work the totalisator in one interest and one interest only.  It will provide some revenue for the State, and it will provide a very considerable revenue for breeders and people who own and run horses.  No one connected with the control board <Col N="1174" /> can derive any salary or any revenue or have any financial interest in the machine.  The machine, as I stated, is to be non-proprietary and run for one interest and one interest only&mdash; the horse-breeding industry and for the general uplifting of that business.</P>

    <Title>Arterial Drainage (Amendment) Bill, 1929&mdash;Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMilroy" hpid="Mr. Milroy Mr. Milroy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Milroy</NameTxt>
      <P>When this Bill came on on Wednesday Senator Sir John Keane suggested that there should be some explanation of it.  I would like to make a few observations on it.  This Bill is entirely non-controversial and is intended to remedy an oversight in the Arterial Drainage Act of 1925 which omitted specifically to include county borough councils equally with county councils in the definition.  Though that omission occurred it was generally assumed that county boroughs were so embraced in the provisions of the Act, and a joint scheme was promoted by the county council and by the Corporation of Waterford City for the purpose of draining certain marshes, portion of which area is within the city boundary and portion of which is outside it.  When the work had progressed to some considerable extent it was discovered that there was a doubt as to whether or not the borough council came within the interpretation of the Act.  The matter was submitted to the Attorney-General, and I think <Col N="1175" /> he decided that it did not.  It was pointed out in Section 3 of the Act of 1925 that</P>
      <P>Every council to which a petition is presented under this Act shall refer such petition to the county surveyor for his report on the general merits of the proposal contained in the petition.</P>
      <P>From this it was argued that there was no corresponding or alternative reference to a borough surveyor in any part of the Act, the Act as worded could not be made to apply to a borough council unless and until it was amended.  It is for this reason that the necessity arises for the introduction of this Bill.  The Bill has received general assent in the other House and it is entirely non-controversial.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamBarrington" hpid="Mr. Barrington Mr. Barrington">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrington</NameTxt>
      <P>As one who has been associated with arterial drainage for many years, I should like to say that I thoroughly support this Bill.  But I would like some explanation as to whether it is quite non-controversial or not.  I remember that when the Arterial Drainage (Minor Schemes) Bill came before the Seanad I moved an amendment to carry into effect what this Bill proposes and the Minister strongly opposed it.  He would not have anything to say to it.  I do not know why.  I would like to know whether the Ministerial attitude has changed now, and what the reason is why this Bill should receive the approbation and approval of the Minister, seeing that when I made a similar proposal on the Minor Schemes Bill it was strongly opposed. There is no objection to this Bill, and I support it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to the last Senator, I think the Minor Schemes Bill only referred to drainage works estimated to cost £1,000 and under. For that reason the Minister opposed that amendment because the amount involved was so small that it was not easy to see that county boroughs would be affected at all. It was not visualised when the 1925 <Col N="1176" /> Act was brought in that any drainage area would be within a city boundary.</P>

      <P>I am advised that it was not anticipated that arterial drainage schemes would have any bearing on borough council areas.  I was present in the Seanad at the time that Senator Barrington raised his objection, and I am wondering why I did not intervene, because that point was always present to my mind.  I do not think that is exactly the point Senator Barrington made then&mdash;that borough councils should or should not be included in the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephOConnor" hpid="Mr. O'Connor Mr. O'Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to support this measure for reasons that, more or less, concern my district.  There has been great delay there in getting this Act properly working to the satisfaction of the people, so that any benefit would be derived from it.  It was complicated a few years ago by the Land Commission handing over the turbary rights to people in Clongorey district.  Drains were not properly cleaned and the land could not be worked.  The drainage in that district has not yet been satisfactorily settled, owing to other interests that intervened, between the bog land and the River Liffey.  I attended two or three meetings of the tenants, and I went to the County Surveyor in order to try and get the matter put in order.  If this Bill is to be of any advantage it would be a blessing for the district I am referring to.  The people are very anxious to see the Act working so that their land may derive some benefit from it.  The working of the Act is not thoroughly understood, especially where many interests are concerned, and where other people's property has to be crossed, there seem to be objections that have not been cleared up.  I <Col N="1177" /> hope this Bill will be the means of getting this drainage question properly fixed up.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That the Standing Orders be suspended for the purpose of enabling the remaining stages of the Arterial Drainage (Amendment) Bill, 1929, to be taken to-day.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>My reason for doing so is because of the matter that Senator Milroy referred to.  A joint scheme was projected in Waterford between the County Council and the Corporation, and it advanced to a certain point. The Board of Works sent down men who made surveys.  The scheme had the general good-will of the County Council and the Corporation.  The work was held up at a certain point, when an objection was raised that borough councils were not included in the Act.  This will clear up the point made by Senator O'Connor. Schemes are initiated by petition.  Six or more land holders in any area subject to flooding, or in an area that requires drainage, may send in a petition to the county council with certain maps outlining the area.  The county council must refer the matter in the first instance to the county surveyor for a report as to the practicability of the scheme and the necessity for it.  The county council will then approve or disapprove of his report.  If approved of, the report and the recommendation of the council are sent to the Commissioners of Public Works, and they proceed to investigate the matter.  The proceeding is laid down in the Act.  The parties interested in the first instance, the landowners, simply petition the county council and the whole proceeding goes through and a decision is taken as to whether it is economic or uneconomic.</P>

      <P>Yes; but I was trying <Col N="1178" /> to clear up one or two points which are rather ambiguous and that Senator O'Connor wished to have information upon.  My reason for asking that this Bill should be put through all stages to-day is on account of the urgency.  The work with regard to the Waterford scheme has been done up to a certain point.  The summer-time is the only time that these drainage schemes can be most effectively carried through.  In Waterford district, once winter rain sets in, the whole work must be suspended.  The greater portion of the summer season has already passed, and only a few months remain during which the work could proceed.  Hence the urgency of this measure.</P>

      <P>The object of my amendment is to delete the sub-section, because it deals with newspapers reporting cases.  It places in the hands of the Gárda Síochána, who I might say are part of the prosecution, the right to get up and say that any newspaper man should be removed from the court, if the judge considers it right to do so.  I think, and it has always been thought, that one of the greatest defences a prisoner can have is the publication of the case in the newspapers.  In a great many cases publication has led to the acquittal of the prisoner, because the fact of having seen it has brought forward witnesses who gave evidence in his favour. It is really a question of the freedom of the Press.  The attempt here is to prevent the Press reporting what it considers right.  The Press is always bound not to raise questions that are <i>sub judice</i>, but to report only what occurs during the trial.  I think it is wrong that the Press should be excluded from a trial.  I am not well up in these matters, but, as far as I know, it has hardly ever been done before.  One of the worst parts of the Bill is this part excluding the Press during the hearing of a case.</P>

      <P>I do not <Col N="1180" /> think Senator Moore has read the sub-section that he proposes to delete. It does not say that all Press representatives shall be excluded.  It says that when a newspaper has contained articles of a certain kind, that is to say that when it has urged the intimidation of jurymen or witnesses or the murder of witnesses or anything of that kind, then the representative of that particular paper should be excluded from the court. I submit that is what the sub-section says and nothing else, and I submit that it is perfectly right that the representative of a newspaper which desires that jurymen should be intimidated or murdered should not be in court.  That is the very type of man who would be used as a spotter.</P>

      <P>I am personally opposed to the amendment, but it would seem as if the section was really unnecessary because, if there are papers published which encourage attacks on jurors or on witnesses, either generally or in any particular case, I contend that such papers should be suppressed, and should not exist.  Consequently there would be no representative of such a newspaper, and this section would be quite unnecessary.  But the section assumes that newspapers will be allowed to exist that in successive issues encourage the intimidation of jurors and attacks on witnesses.  I do not know if that is the intention of the Minister, but it assumes the continued permitted existence of papers of that kind, that should not be allowed to exist in any civilised community.</P>

      <P>What has been said is perfectly correct.  The real object of this section is to suppress any publication that the prosecution does not approve of, and although the question is submitted to the judge for his decision, nevertheless one particular class of newspaper is penalised.  As Senator O'Farrell has pointed out, it is quite right that any such paper should be prosecuted, but then it would have to be tried.  This section is merely put in so that a Gárda can get up and make a statement and the newspaper is banned without any trial.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 7, sub-section (5).  To delete all after the word &ldquo;section&rdquo; in line 34 down to and including the word &ldquo;truthfully&rdquo; in line 45 and to substitute therefor the words &ldquo;it is proved to the satisfaction of the judge presiding in the court that one or more recent issue or issues of a specified newspaper <Col N="1182" /> has or have contained articles or other matter calculated to intimidate jurors or witnesses.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The object of this amendment is to leave the discretion absolutely in the judge.  I really put forward this amendment because I think it is superior, from the draftsman's point of view, to the words that it is proposed to substitute. This sub-section deals with the representative of a particular newspaper, a man who is following his profession, who may be occasionally contributing to an objectionable paper, from the Minister's point of view, and who may be earning portion of his livelihood by contributing to a paper that has not been guilty of any breach of the law or the regulations.  Therefore, it is for the purpose of protecting the individual professional man that I suggest you should alter the words in the section.  I think that with the amendment the section would be quite satisfactory.  It would leave to the judge full control of the court and of the reporters.  If there was the case of a man who was earning his livelihood as a contributor to more than one newspaper, and that the judge knew that his personal repute was good, he might say to him: &ldquo;Well, now, I do not want any intimidation of jurors or witnesses, and at the same time I do not want to prevent you from earning your living.  You can remain, but you are not to report for this particular paper.&rdquo;  My amendment is not intended in any way to favour the intimidation of jurors or witnesses.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1183" /> The judge can admit him on the ground that he represents another paper.  The reporter may come along and say that he does not want to represent that paper for the purpose of reporting the trial at hearing, but that he wants to represent another paper.  I do not wish to be taken as in any way encouraging any newspaper to intimidate jurors or witnesses, or to interfere in any way with the Courts of Justice.  I think that the amendment, as drafted by me&mdash;if the Minister thinks otherwise he can say so&mdash; leaves the fullest discretion to the judge to meet a particular class of case.  On that ground I would urge the Seanad to accept the amendment. With the little modification that I have explained, the amendment is really, in substance, the same as the section.</P>

The amendment makes this difference, that the judge will have to be satisfied before he makes an order to have the court cleared.  If the judge is of opinion that the court should be cleared, I think we may trust the judge to do so, but we should leave the option with the judge to use his discretion.  I support the proposition to put in the word &ldquo;may.&rdquo;</P>

If the judge decides that there is a case before the court in which the court must be cleared, then this section makes a certain class of individuals who write for these newspapers, and who are known to be evilly disposed, ineligible to be present in court.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is directed, first, against the person because, as I said a moment ago, a person reporting for a paper of that nature is a person who, very reasonably, might give away information which should not be given away.  The sub-section is not against the paper, but against the individual.</P>

The latter shall not be admitted on the ground that he is a reporter for a newspaper if he reports for one of these papers, but he may be a reporter for a newspaper and at the same time might be a witness going to be called in the case.  That is quite possible. What the sub-section means is that he shall not be admitted because he is a reporter of a newspaper.</P>

      <P>I think that the acceptance of this amendment would result in a great improvement to the section.  The sub-section, as it stands, leaves the judge no discretion whatever.  In the vast majority of cases, in every case I might say, if an officer of the Gárda Síochána comes forward and, upon oath, says that he wants a particular thing done, the judge, of course, will acquiesce.  That will be the decision of the judge, and I think that is only quite right and quite conformable with the position and dignity of the judge in his own court.  I think that the Minister ought to accept this amendment.</P>

      <P>We are repeating here more precisely the procedure that is being followed in regard to sub-section (1) of Section 7.  The amendment seeks to secure that the judge shall be satisfied.  That, of course, is with the object of leaving the responsibility with the judge and not with the superintendent of <Col N="1187" /> the Guards.  The judge will normally be satisfied.  I would certainly say that if he is so satisfied that he might act according as the section provides.  The question then arises, whether the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; should be replaced by the word &ldquo;may.&rdquo; I think that, in this instance, there certainly should be a discretion left, that the authority should be left with the judge finally, and not with the superintendent of the Guards.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>What the section does is, it makes a certain class of people ineligible to be present in court.  The judge gives a direction with regard to those persons and the procedure is that they should be excluded.  It is very much the same as the case of a person who has committed an offence coming before the judge.  It becomes the duty of the judge to sentence him.  You cannot say that the judge is not the supreme master. What the section says is that a certain class of persons shall be ineligible to be present.</P>

      <P>The Minister drew the parallel of a person who committed an offence and was sentenced. In this case the superintendent of the Guards has merely to state upon oath his opinion in regard to a particular person.  Then the judge has no discretion whatever.  In the case from which the Minister drew his parallel there was evidence produced as to the guilt of the person, but in this case the superintendent of the Guards merely states that a particular person is not the kind of person who ought to be in court.  I want to say that it is rather a formal matter, but an important formal matter, rather than a matter of substance. The superintendent of the Guards comes into court and states on oath that, in his opinion, a particular <Col N="1188" /> person is suspect&mdash;he is suspected of being associated in acts relating to the intimidation of jurors.  I think that in probably 99 cases out of 100 the judge would take that evidence of the superintendent of the Guards and act on it, but I submit that we ought to leave the final decision as to whether the court should be cleared on that evidence with the judge, and not make it compulsory on the judge to clear the court because the superintendent of the Guards says it ought to be cleared.  That is the whole point of difference, but it is an important point of difference.</P>

The second class is a person not allowed in to report for a paper which does not come under sub-section (5).  He shall not be allowed in to report for any paper if he is a person who is known to be acting as a &ldquo;spotter.&rdquo;  If you had to have a trial as to a man's antecedents and whether you should allow him in or not, that might take a very long time indeed.  I cannot see that this amendment would make the slightest difference.  The section simply says that men of the class I have referred to shall not be in court when a certain case is being tried.</P>

      <P>I take it that we are debating Senator Johnson's amendment, No. 57, with the amendment now before the House.  The Senator, I think, will agree with me that his amendment means the same thing as this one.  Both amendments mean that, instead of the court being cleared on the oath of the superintendent, there has to be a trial, and that on the result of that the judge will make his order.  I think that is the whole point.  It does not seem to me to be a wise thing to alter the section so that you should have a trial going on in the court before the real trial begins.  What that would mean is, that all sorts of persons <Col N="1189" /> would have to be called to give evidence to prove that so and so was a suspected person, although to the knowledge of the authorities the individual spoken about on oath would be likely to avail of any information that he might get to do injury to jurors or witnesses.  I think it would be a very unpleasant thing to have a trial under such circumstances.

      <P>Amendment 58.  Section 7, sub-section (6).  To delete the words &ldquo;shall forthwith&rdquo; in line 61 and to substitute therefor the words &ldquo;may in his discretion.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think this amendment meets the difficulty that was raised by the Minister and by Senator Jameson.  Both said very fairly, I think, that the question as to whether a suspected or objectionable person should be removed or not should not be the subject of a trial.  The Seanad has concurred in that view, and I am not going to say that they were not right.  My amendment meets that view.  The meaning of the amendment is, that when the police officer comes forward and states on oath that there is a suspected person in court the judge may, in his discretion, <Col N="1190" /> order his removal.  The words in the section are &ldquo;shall forthwith.&rdquo; Of course, in every case that can possibly be imagined the judge will use his discretion, but I do not want the judge in his own court to be under the whip of the police officer.  I think the Minister will agree with me that it is undesirable that the judge should be compelled to take orders from the police officer, or that there should be any appearance of that in the proceedings in a court of justice.  You must trust your judges.  If the police officer comes up and says on oath that there is a suspected person in the court, any judge that I have ever seen, and I am sure the judges in the future will be worthy of trust, would act upon the oath of the superintendent and promptly order the removal of that person.  The only object I have in moving the amendment is simply to preserve the forms of procedure in court and the sanctity of the position of the judge.  There is nothing in the amendment that trenches in any way on the purposes of the Bill. I cannot see why the Minister should not at once concur in the amendment. He knows as well as I do the decencies of the situation.</P>

      <Col N="1191" /> Amendment declared lost.</P>
    <P>Ordered: That Section 7 stand part of the Bill.</P>
    <P Just="Center">SECTION 8 (3).</P>
    <P>The power of adjourning a trial conferred by this section shall be in addition to and not in substitution for any other power of adjournment for the time being existing by law and one or more adjournments of a trial under this section shall not prevent a subsequent adjournment of such trial under any such other power of adjournment nor shall one or more adjournments of a trial under any of such last-mentioned powers prevent a subsequent adjournment of such trial under this section.</P>

      <P>I move amendment 61:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 8, sub-section (3).  To add at the end of the sub-section the words &ldquo;Provided that an accused person whose trial has been once adjourned under this section shall on a second adjournment be entitled to be admitted to bail except in the case of a person returned for trial on a charge of murder.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The object of this amendment is to secure that the unfortunate person concerned shall not be kept in jail indefinitely without trial.  Senators can see that the sub-section is very drastic, and that it would be quite possible to keep an unfortunate prisoner, who might be in no way concerned with political publications of any kind, in jail indefinitely, that is if the judge was unreasonable enough to do so.  Senators can see the purpose of my amendment, that it preserves the right of the State in the serious case of murder.  If a man is charged with murder, I do not propose that he should even be entitled to apply for bail, but if he is charged with a minor offence, an offence of a less degree than murder, and if the case comes up for trial, and that it is stated there has been any kind of agitation about the case and the <Col N="1192" /> judge puts back his trial&mdash;the judge has the power to adjourn the trial&mdash; that man must remain in custody until he comes up again.  If he comes up again and it is represented at court that while he was in jail there was some sort of agitation going on and representations are made to the judge the trial is postponed a second time.  When a man comes up a second time he probably has spent six or twelve months in prison awaiting his trial.  All that I ask is, that if he is charged with a minor offence he should have the liberty to apply for and obtain bail.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>I intend to explain as fully and as shortly as I can the meaning of this.  If a man is twelve months in jail and if he is not tried and is put back again by reason of matters that happened while he is in prison, and that he could not be in any way regarded as being connected with, he should have the right to bail.  Is that right?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelComynKC" hpid="Mr. Comyn Mr. Comyn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>The forms of court provide that application shall be made.  Application must be made to the judge.  There may be other reasons for detaining him.  There may be another charge, but in regard to the charge for which he has spent his term in prison he should have the right to bail on application made to the judge by his counsel or solicitor.  The judge then fixes the amount of the sureties.  It is all the time in the discretion of the court.  If he has committed any other offence he is not to be entitled to bail.  If he serves one period in jail without bail and comes up again and has to be sent back a second time, he ought to have the right to bail in case of a minor offence.  It is for the Seanad to express their opinion on this without being urged by me.  I think there is inherent justice in that.</P>

      <P>I think there is a weakness in this amendment.  If a group of persons outside knowing the person inside was subject to a serious charge, less than the capital charge, and had a fair amount of confidence that that person was to be convicted and they wanted to get him out, for a time they would intimidate a few jurors and cause the trial to be adjourned the second time.  He would then have to be released on bail.  I think that is a weakness.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>It goes too far. There is another side to it.  One can see within the provisions of the sub-section that a group of persons outside who are vindictive against the person inside would intimidate the jurors for the purpose of keeping him in.  That is quite possible under the section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>I draw the attention of the House to the meaning of the section.  Supposing intimidation has been going on, the judge if he is satisfied that intimidation is going on, may adjourn the trial.  He must be satisfied that intimidation has been going on.  If he is, the prisoner shall be detained in custody as if he had been returned for trial at such sitting.  The meaning of that is that he can always apply for bail.  A man detained in custody by a District Justice can always apply to the High Court for bail.  Senator Comyn spoke of minor offences.  A man charged with misdemeanour is entitled of right to bail.  He has only to make an application to the High Court to get bail.  Deputy Comyn excludes murder, but there are other serious offences.  Take a bad bank robbery in which a sum of money is stolen and some person is seriously injured; short of actual murder, that is the sort of case in which one would imagine there would be a certain amount of intimidation.  If that robbery were a semi-political bank robbery it is the kind of case in which there might be a good deal of intimidation.  It would not be <Col N="1194" /> quite right that these persons should be let loose on the community for a considerable period of time.  The other case Deputy Johnson put forward is, I think, a theoretical case. As to somebody outside trying to intimidate jurors in order that a person would get acquitted, that I think need not be seriously feared as likely to happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelComynKC" hpid="Mr. Comyn Mr. Comyn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, there are serious cases and there are cases of less magnitude.  The Minister has referred to one of the most serious cases that could possibly come before a court, short of murder.  One can quite well imagine a case of a trifling nature which would merit, say, imprisonment for only a month, or two or three months.  I am not sure whether according to the section as it stands a man would be kept in for the minor offence from one session to another.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelComynKC" hpid="Mr. Comyn Mr. Comyn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>It is said he can get bail if he is put back under this section; the probability of discretionary bail is nil.  What I say is, here I am pleading for the civil rights of persons who are not found guilty.  I am pleading for habeas corpus really.  The law did require that a man should get a speedy trial; that he should be tried at the first jail delivery after he is returned for trial.  This keeping of a man in prison month after month and year after year untried is a matter about which legislatures of all countries have been very jealous.  I only say that on the second postponement of his trial a man should get bail.  If the Minister would be willing to make any concession on that point I would be prepared to modify the amendment for the Report Stage so that it might deal with offences of a minor nature to which the Minister has referred.</P>

      <P>Section 8, sub-section (3).  To add at the end of the sub-section the words &ldquo;But no adjournments under this section shall operate to keep an accused person in custody pending trial for a longer period than three months.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This has been already explained. The section deals with the keeping in prison of a person because threatening messages have been sent from outside.  Although he may not be concerned in any way in the matter, the unfortunate prisoner is liable to ke kept in prison on account of that indefinitely. Take the case of Seán McBride.  He was arrested and kept in prison for eight or nine months without being brought up for trial.</P>

      <P>The Senator thinks that a man should be released unconditionally at the end of three months if there has been intimidation. Let us say that a man is charged with murder.  Then, if there has been intimidation and it is carried on long enough, he has to go scot free.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceMoore" hpid="Colonel Moore Colonel Moore">
      <NameTxt>Colonel Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no question about bail.  The question is whether a person should be kept in jail without being tried for an indefinite period&mdash;ad infinitum.  Anyone can see that that is unfair.  I say that he should be tried at the end of three months.  If the judge says he is to be kept in prison for three months he is kept, but at the end of that time he should be brought before a court and tried.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the point argued by Senator Moore is a sound one.  A prisoner in these circumstances may be kept in confinement for an indefinite period through the fault of persons outside.  That is surely an injustice.  A person confined in prison should not be liable to suffer continued imprisonment because of the offence of people outside. That seems to me possible in the section as it stands.  There should be some limit to the period within which a man should be brought to trial.  Adjournments of this kind could go on indefinitely, so that a prisoner may be continuously in prison.  It may be a case where bail would not be justifiable, and you are leaving the prisoner's condition dependent upon the action of people outside, and for which he is not responsible.  That means you are imprisoning a man for the crimes of other people.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>Assuming that three months is the period it would not work out, for the adjournment from one court to another might exceed three months.  Let us assume that six months is the period and I will argue it on that basis. Here you have got intimidation going on.  You know that if that man is <Col N="1197" /> put on trial it will be an absolute farce.  You know that juries and witnesses will be intimidated.  It is proved to the satisfaction of the court that intimidation has gone on to such an extent that a man would not receive a fair trial&mdash;that a man would receive a trial which inevitably would result in his acquittal. What is the result?  That it is much better to keep a man in custody until such time as he can get a fair trial. If a man has been sent for trial by the District Justice then there is a prima facie case against him.  Is it better that he should be kept for a period until he can receive a fair trial, or is it much better that at the end of three months he should be let loose again on the community? That is the whole question.  Even assuming that the trial would always take place within three months, the second trial would be but humbug. Why try a man when there is intimidation going on?  They know that by steadily keeping up intimidation for three months a man can go free to rob a bank.  They might say: &ldquo;We will keep up intimidation.&rdquo;  On the other hand, they might say it is better to let the course of justice go on.  It would be far more satisfactory they would say: &ldquo;It is better to let the course of justice go unimpeded.&rdquo; If a man committed a minor offence it would be all to his own advantage to be tried without intimidation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelComynKC" hpid="Mr. Comyn Mr. Comyn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Comyn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister seems to be always imagining and speaking of extreme cases in order to deprive the ordinary prisoner of his right to bail.  He gives the case of a bank robbery in which a person is wounded.  He says this intimidation will go on during the period the accused person is in jail, for three months.  I ask what will the Minister be doing?  He purports to be able to stop intimidation?  The Minister in his argument presupposes that the Executive Council will remain absolutely lifeless in face of all this intimidation, and they will allow it to go on.  I have never seen a case in which it was not possible to get a trial free from intimidation somewhere <Col N="1198" /> or other in the Twenty-six Counties.  The Minister knows quite well that in the past when there might have been intimidation in one venue the trial was changed to another.</P>

But the main thing here is the principle that ought to be respected by the Seanad, that prisoners should not be kept in jail awaiting trial, such as was done in France before the Revolution.  That is a serious inroad on the liberty of the subject, and it will require very serious arguments to countervail against it.  Three months in all conscience is long enough to keep a man awaiting trial.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnOFarrell" hpid="Mr. O'Farrell Mr. O'Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the period mentioned in the amendment is too short.  It might be impracticable to work it out, but I think there should be some limit.  We know the horrors of the old Czarist régime, when persons were kept in jail for years for one reason or another without being tried.  A man charged with a political offence could be kept in jail interminably and have no trial. I do not see how this section is going to work effectively or achieve the object for which it was conceived. For instance, in the Central Criminal Court there is a case listed for hearing.  The judge is satisfied that there has been intimidation of witnesses or of jurors, and he adjourns <Col N="1199" /> the case until the next sitting, say for three months.  No intimidation has taken place in the meantime, and the man must be tried at the next sitting.  Surely, the people who intimidated originally are still, presumably, in the land of the living, and the people intimidated are still alive to the fact that three or six months having elapsed does not alter the position in the least.</P>
      <P>If there is somebody who intimidated witnesses at any time, it must be assumed that he has not changed his mind because three months have elapsed.  I do not see the object of postponing unless you are going to change the venue, and the Minister says you can only change it to the Central Criminal Court.  Postponing the trial can have only one result.  It makes the prisoner spend a longer time in jail whether he is guilty or innocent.  That is the only object.  I think there should be some limit to the period of time a man can be kept in prison without trial.  He may be quite innocent.  It is often easy to establish a prima facie case against a man who may be found innocent when tried.  We should be slow to adopt the old Russian system, and keep a man interminably in prison.  I know that the Bill is a temporary one, but things of this kind have a knack of setting precedents of a dangerous character, and even during a period of two years great abuses can occur under this section.</P>

      <P>We all remember the state of mind that existed some years ago in which certain people had certain views and did not care whether their friends suffered or not.  They wanted to carry out those views and were prepared to sacrifice themselves and their fellows in order that they might do so.  I can quite understand that the same thing may exist at the moment and that people outside may say: &ldquo;There are fellows inside there and let them go on staying there and take their punishment, and we will go on with our propaganda.&rdquo;  They would go <Col N="1200" /> on with their propaganda as long as they chose and all the time the man inside may have no information of all this, and yet on account of the propaganda this man, who properly knows nothing about it, is kept in prison.  This is very important and I must have a division on it.  It is one of the worst parts of the Bill. It means the Bastille over again.</P>

      <P>Senator Moore is arguing on one thing, while his amendment is going in another direction.  Even if there is a division on this point, that will not go to meet the case put forward by Senator Johnson.  There might be some slight point in that, and I would ask the Minister to give his attention to that aspect of it.  If there was a possibility of abuse at any time, it could happen that a prisoner might be kept without trial in prison for an indefinite period. Subject to the acceptance that there might be abuse in that respect I would like the Minister to give his attention to it.  But what Senator Moore's amendment seeks to carry out is an entirely different matter altogether.  It would be possible under his amendment that exactly what the Minister puts forward might take place&mdash;that is, for the period specified, whether it would be, three months or six months, intimidation might be carried on, and at the end of that period, according to Senator Moore's amendment, the prisoner would be liberated and would leave the court a free man.</P>

I would like the Minister to give his attention to the other consideration, entirely apart from Senator Moore's suggestion, and that is, that it might be possible by some means or other to have some limit, so that at the expiration of the period it would be obligatory to <Col N="1201" /> have the prisoner tried.  There might be something in that, and I would like the Minister to give his attention to it, while I do not propose to vote for Senator Moore's amendment.</P>

The man is brought up for trial and the case is adjourned, let us say, for the attendance of a witness.  The case might have to be adjourned again on account of the illness of another witness, or because of something of that kind.  You never can say when a case will be heard. Sometimes when there is a great pressure of business in the Central Criminal Court it is not possible to finish the calendar, and some of the cases have to be adjourned until the next session.</P>

      <P>Amendment 63 is out of order.  If it were carried, the effect would be to nullify the section. The same purpose would be achieved by voting against the section. Amendment 64 is out of order. It would negative the section.  If the amendment were carried, true statements would be permitted, a position which is obviously opposed to the intention of the section. Amendment 65 is also out of order. This amendment proposes to delete sub-section (2), which merely provides a punishment for what sub-section (1) states to be unlawful. For a statute to enact that certain conduct is unlawful without prescribing any punishment would be absurd.</P>
      <P Just="Center">SECTION 9 (2).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If any person prints, publishes, distributes, sells, or offers or exposes for sale or posts up or otherwise exposes in any public place or makes by word of mouth any statement of any other person in contravention of this section such first-mentioned person shall <Col N="1203" /> be guilty of an offence under this section and shall be liable on summary conviction thereof to a fine not exceeding fifty pounds, or, at the discretion of the Court, to imprisonment for any term not exceeding six months or to both such fine and such imprisonment.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>Section 9, sub-section (2).  To delete the word &ldquo;summary&rdquo; in line 46.</P>
      <P>The section provides that it shall be an offence to print, publish or state the name of any juryman engaged in a case. The Minister has shown indulgence in this section by providing that a man is not to be punished for saying that he himself was on the jury, but if you say, even casually and inadvertently, that a man was with you on a jury and that he was in favour of the prisoner, or anything like that, it is possible under this section for you to be brought before a District Justice and given six months in jail.  That is rather a drastic proposal.  My submission is that if a person is charged with the offence of saying, or writing in a letter, or printing the fact that an individual was on such a jury and he is prosecuted for that, he should at least have the right to be tried by a jury.  I think it is very drastic indeed to take away from the citizen his ordinary right and to try him by the paid officer of the Executive.  That officer might be a most estimable man, but he is not the man to try a citizen for offences of this description, and therefore I think the word &ldquo;summary&rdquo; should be struck out.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;Summary conviction&rdquo; means that a man is tried and convicted before the District Justice.  He has an appeal to the Circuit Court.  I was astonished and really horrified to hear Senator Comyn make the statement <Col N="1204" /> that District Justices are paid officers of the Executive.  They are nothing of the kind.</P>

      <P>Section 9, sub-section (2).  To delete all words after the word &ldquo;months&rdquo; in line 48 down to the end of the sub-section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Seanad has decided now as to mode of trial, and the next question to consider is as regards the punishment. The section provides that on summary conviction the person shall be liable to a fine not exceeding £60 or, at the discretion of the court, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months, or to both such fine and such imprisonment.  The object of the amendment is to provide that a man can be either fined or imprisoned at the discretion of the court, but that he should not receive both lashes at the same time.  I <Col N="1205" /> think that that only needs to be mentioned to commend itself to the Seanad.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to say on this that I do not understand why anybody should desire to publish the names of jurors, and if, in a case of the trial of a person who had published the names of jurors, it appeared to the court that there was malice, I would not object to the fine being £500 or the imprisonment being six years, or both.</P>

      <P>Question&mdash;&ldquo;That Section 12 stand part of the Bill&rdquo;&mdash;put and agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">SECTION 13 (3).</P>
      <P>This Act shall continue in force until the 31st day of December, 1931, and shall then expire.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJohnson" hpid="Mr. Johnson Mr. Johnson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 13, sub-section (3).  To delete the word &ldquo;December&rdquo; in line 63 and to substitute therefor the word &ldquo;October.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This may seem to be a trivial amendment inasmuch as it simply seeks to substitute the word &ldquo;October&rdquo; for &ldquo;December,&rdquo; that is to say, that the Act shall expire on the 31st day of October, 1931, instead of the 31st day of December, <Col N="1206" /> 1931.  My reason for moving this amendment is that I do not want this Act to appear in the long list every year of the Expiring Laws Continuance Acts.  There is rather a tendency to allow the Expiring Laws Continuance Acts to be lumped together and to pass <i>en bloc,</i> and I think that this is a type of law that ought to have special consideration before it is re-enacted.  I am not quite convinced that it is the Minister's intention that this Act shall expire finally on the 31st December, 1931, and if it happened to be his intention to have it re-enacted and it was simply made part of the Expiring Laws Continuance Bill, I think it would not be likely to receive proper consideration.  Therefore, I hope by the insertion of &ldquo;October&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;December&rdquo; a specific re-enactment would have to take place of this Bill alone and that it should not be lumped with other enactments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>What the Senator suggests would not be practicable in working, because as far as certain sittings are concerned the 31st October would be almost certain to occur in the middle of the sittings.  Some criminal sessions would begin in October and would go on into November.  Of course the dates are not fixed, but I fancy that the 31st October would probably be the very middle of the sitting of the Central Criminal Court.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that would be too short a period.  As far as the point which the Senator puts forward as to whether or not this would be included in the Expiring Laws Act, that is a long way ahead.  But assuming for the moment that it is the intention of whatever Executive is then in existence to continue this Act, it could be done by a short Act providing for the 31st December, 1932, instead of the 31st December, 1931.  Is there any real substantial difference between having an Act of that nature and having this Act appearing in the Expiring Laws Continuance Act?  I do not think that there is.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Johnson</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid that the Minister has not had a close acquaintance with the manners of Executives in relation to Parliament. These Expiring Laws Continuance Bills come forward very late in the session, very near the end of the year, the list contains perhaps twenty or thirty Bills, and there is a neglect perhaps on the part of Senators and Deputies to be careful in their examinations of what is contained in those Bills.  Therefore, I am seeking that a special Bill shall be brought forward before this Bill can be re-enacted, applicable to this alone.  I am not tied to the month of October.</P>

      <P>I do not think the Minister's suggestion would meet it. I would like to support Senator Johnson's amendment, if it was only for the purpose of showing that this is a special and an unusual piece of legislation, that it should be regarded as a mere formal Act with a number of other Acts that come up for consideration.  I think that the amendment ought not to be received by the Minister with an air of humour.  I am sure that it is with the greatest reluctance that the Seanad is passing this Bill.  I am sure that it is no pleasure to any member of the Seanad to pass this Bill, and I think it would be proper that they should mark in a special <Col N="1208" /> way their opinion that this is a drastic and an unusual piece of legislation.  If the Minister would make it the 1st September, or the 30th September, there is no possibility that any Circuit Court would be sitting at that time, and even if there was a Circuit Court sitting at that time, the ordinary machinery would provide that the prisoner should be sent forward to the Central Criminal Court.</P>
